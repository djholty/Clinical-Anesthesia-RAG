This guideline is not a standard of medical care. The ultimate judgement with regard to a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the clinician in the light of the clinical data presented and the diagnostic and treatment options available.

Do not exceed a maximum cumulative dose of 12 ml.kg -1

and

and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Give an initial intravenous bolus injection of 20% lipid emulsion 1.5 ml.kg -1 over 1 min

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Give

<!-- PAGE=? -->
a maximum of two

<!-- PAGE=? -->
repeat

<!-- PAGE=? -->
boluses (same dose) if:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
  cardiovascular stability has not been restored or

<!-- PAGE=? -->
  an adequate circulation deteriorates

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leave

5 min

<!-- PAGE=? -->
between boluses

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A maximum of three boluses can be given (including the initial bolus)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Start an intravenous infusion of 20% lipid emulsion at 15 ml.kg -1 .h -1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continue infusion at same rate, but:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Double

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the rate to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
30 ml.kg -1 .h

-1

at

<!-- PAGE=? -->
any time after 5 min, if:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
  cardiovascular stability has not been restored or

<!-- PAGE=? -->
  an adequate circulation deteriorates

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continue infusion until stable and

adequate circulation restored or

maximum dose of lipid emulsion given

An approximate dose regimen for a 70-kg patient would be as follows:

ImmedIately

<!-- PAGE=? -->
after 5 mIn

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Do not exceed a maximum cumulative dose of 840 ml

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Give an initial intravenous bolus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
injection of 20% lipid emulsion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
100 ml over 1 min

boluses of 100 ml

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Start an intravenous infusion of 20%

<!-- PAGE=? -->
lipid emulsion at 1000 ml.h -1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continue infusion at same rate but double rate to 2000 ml.h -1  if indicated at any time

| 1 Recognition            | Signs of severe toxicity: • Sudden alteration in mental status, severe agitation or loss of consciousness, with or without tonic-clonic convulsions • Cardiovascular collapse: sinus bradycardia, conduction blocks, asystole and ventricular tachyarrhythmias may all occur • Local anaesthetic (LA) toxicity may occur some time after an initial injection |
| 2 Immediate management    | • Stop injecting the LA • Call for help • Maintain the airway and, if necessary, secure it with a tracheal tube • Give 100% oxygen and ensure adequate lung ventilation (hyperventilation may help by increasing plasma pH in the presence of metabolic acidosis) • Confirm or establish intravenous access • Control seizures: give a benzodiazepine, thiopental or propofol in small incremental doses • Assess cardiovascular status throughout • Consider drawing blood for analysis, but do not delay definitive treatment to do |
| 3 Treatment              | In cIrculatory arreSt • Start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) using standard protocols • Manage arrhythmias using the same protocols, recognising that arrhythmias may be very refractory to treatment • Consider the use of cardiopulmonary bypass if available GIve IntravenouS lIpId emulSIon (following the regimen overleaf) • Continue CPR throughout treatment with lipid emulsion • Recovery from LA-induced cardiac arrest may take >1 h • Propofol is not a suitable substitute for lipid emulsion • Lidocaine should not be used as an anti-arrhythmic therapy WIthout cIrculatory arreSt Use conventional therapies to treat: • hypotension, • bradycardia, • tachyarrhythmia conSIder IntravenouS lIpId emulSIon (following the regimen overleaf) • Propofol is not a suitable substitute for lipid emulsion • Lidocaine should not be used as an anti-arrhythmic therapy |
| 4 Follow-up              | • Arrange safe transfer to a clinical area with appropriate equipment and suitable staff until sustained recovery is achieved • Exclude pancreatitis by regular clinical review, including daily amylase or lipase assays for two days • Report cases as follows: in the United Kingdom to the National Patient Safety Agency (via www.npsa.nhs.uk ) in the Republic of Ireland to the Irish Medicines Board (via www.imb.ie) |
