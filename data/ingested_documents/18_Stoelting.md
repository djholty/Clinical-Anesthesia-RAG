Water and Osmolal Homeostasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  nonobese  adult,  total  body  water  comprises  approximately 60% of body weight (adiposity decreases this proportion). Body water is divided into intracellular fl uid (ICF) and extracellular fl uid (ECF) compartments according to the location  of  the  water  relative  to  cell  membranes  (Figure  18-1). ECF consists primarily of an interstitial compartment (three fourths  of  ECF)  and  an  intravascular  plasma  compartment (one  fourth  of  ECF).  Water  shi ft s  between  compartments according to the balance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across membranes, and thus water homeostasis relies on the maintenance of osmolality within a narrow physiologic range. Th e  integrity  of  living  cells  depends  on  the  preservation  of water homeostasis, as well as on the energy-intensive maintenance  of  intracellular  and  extracellular  concentrations  of ions, also termed electrolytes. Th ese electrolytes, in addition to being a major determinant of both osmolality and acid-base balance,  are  responsible  for  electrical  potentials  across  cell membranes.  Changes  in  electrolyte  homeostasis  may  especially impact excitable cells in the central nervous system and musculature that rely on action potentials for the rapid and organized transfer of information.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Water and osmolal homeostasis are predominantly mediated  by  osmolality  sensors,  neurons  located  in  the  anterior hypothalamus. In response to osmolal elevations, these neurons stimulate thirst and cause pituitary release of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). Vasopressin is stored as granules in the posterior pituitary and acts through G protein-coupled receptors in the collecting ducts of the kidney to cause water retention,  which  in  turn  decreases  serum  osmolality.

Alterations  of  water,  osmolal,  and  electrolyte  content  and distribution  as  well  as  acid-base  disturbances  are  common in  the  perioperative  period  and  rarely  happen  in  isolation, because they are inherently interrelated. Th ey both a ff ect and are  a ff ected  by  the  function  and  stability  of  disparate  organ systems.  Central  nervous  system  impairment,  cardiac  dysfunction, and neuromuscular changes are especially common in  the  presence  of  water,  osmolal,  electrolyte,  and  acid-base disturbances. Several perioperative events can exacerbate such alterations  (Table  18-1).  Management  of  patients  with  these disturbances is based on an assessment of the cause and severity of the condition, an understanding of the interrelationships

Th e  osmolality  of  serum  represents  the  total  number  of osmotically active particles (i.e., solutes) per kilogram of solvent. When osmolality is assessed, a shorthand indirect measurement of serum osmolality can easily be calculated as 2[Na] + [Glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8, and this calculated value should always be compared with direct, laboratory-measured osmolality.  A  signi fi cant  di ff erence  in  these  values-an  "osmolal gap"-should  alert  the  clinician  to  the  presence  of  unmeasured, osmotically active particles. Increases in serum osmolality may be encountered as a result of free water depletion (e.g., dehydration  or  diabetes  insipidus)  or  the  presence  of  additional solutes (most commonly from the ingestion of ethanol or other toxins, hyperglycemia, or the iatrogenic administration of osmolal loads such as mannitol or glycine). Perioperative attempts to induce fl uid shi ft s by deliberate administration of osmolal loads should take into consideration the patient's preexisting  serum  osmolality  to  avoid  extreme  increases  in serum osmolality (>320 mOsm/kg). Mannitol should not be administered to an intoxicated patient with elevated intracranial pressure, for example, without prior consideration of the preexisting e ff ects of ethanol molecules and water diuresis on the osmolal state of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although vasopressin is predominantly secreted in response to increased osmolality, release is also stimulated by large iso-osmolar decreases in e ff ective circulating volume. In addition, the pain and stress of the perioperative period are upregulators of vasopressin release, and the stress response to critical illness can include water retention, oliguria, and dilutional hyponatremia (Table 18-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  osmolal  homeostasis,  the  homeostatic response to isotonic changes in total body water relies on juxtaglomerular sensation of changes in effective circulating volume and consequent changes in kidney renin excretion.  Renin  converts  angiotensinogen  into  angiotensin  I,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 18 FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
359

<!-- PAGE=? -->
which  is  converted  to  angiotensin  II  in  the  lung.  Angiotensin  II  induces  adrenal  release  of  aldosterone,  which promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium loss in the distal tubules and also leads to increases in water resorption. Elevations in circulating volume also cause increased release  of  natriuretic  peptides  that  promote  a  return  to water homeostasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid  resuscitation  in  patients  with  hypovolemia  necessitates  consideration  of  cause,  severity,  and  patient  comorbid conditions. Crystalloid administration should take into consideration a patient's electrolyte and acid-base balance as well as concerns regarding the acute cardiovascular e ff ects of additional volume and the neurologic e ff ects of changes in volume, osmolality, and glucose levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infusion  of  colloids,  including  blood  products,  should be  done  in  the  context  of  appropriate  goals  for  hemoglobin, platelets, and coagulation factors, which must take into consideration the course of any ongoing blood loss and the health  status  of  the  patient.  Arti fi cial  volume  expanders may o ff er the advantage of reduced tissue edema compared with crystalloids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF SODIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  the  ion  with  the  highest  concentration  in  the  ECF, sodium contributes most of the e ff ective osmoles to serum. Th is underlying connection between serum sodium concentration  and  osmolality  is  critical  for  understanding  disorders of sodium homeostasis. Under normal circumstances, serum sodium concentration is maintained between 136 and 145 mmol/L primarily by the action of vasopressin on water and  osmolal  homeostasis.  Variations  in  measured  sodium concentration frequently occur along with derangements in total body water.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment and treatment of changes in sodium concentration must therefore consider osmolality as well as the total body water of the patient. Total body water can be increased, normal,  or  decreased  in  the  context  of  derangements  in sodium concentration, and the cause and treatment of serum sodium disorders depend on the osmolality and volume status of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyponatremia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyponatremia commonly  exists in concert with hypoosmolality when water retention or water intake exceeds the renal excretion of dilute urine. Hyponatremia exists in approximately  15%  of  hospitalized  patients,  most  commonly  as  a dilutional e ff ect in the setting of increased vasopressin release. In the outpatient setting, hyponatremia is more likely to be a result of chronic disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  signs  and  symptoms  of  hyponatremia  depend  on  the rate  at  which  the  hyponatremia  has  developed  and  are  less pronounced  in  chronic  cases.  In  addition,  younger  patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
appear  to  tolerate  a  decrease  in  serum  sodium  better  than elderly patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorexia, nausea, and general malaise may occur early, but central nervous system signs and symptoms predominate later in the course and in acutely deteriorating cases of hyponatremia (Table 18-3). As mentioned earlier, hyponatremia usually occurs  along  with  extracellular  hypotonicity. Th e  associated osmolal gradient allows water to move into brain cells, which results in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. Brain cells may compensate over time by lowering intracellular osmolality through the movement of potassium and organic solutes out of brain cells. Th is reduces water movement into the intracellular space. However, when adaptive mechanisms fail or hyponatremia progresses, central nervous system manifestations of hyponatremia can present as a change in sensorium, seizures, brain herniation, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although hyponatremia usually co-exists with hypo-osmolality, osmolality  should  be  measured  in  all  cases  of  hyponatremia, particularly  to  avoid  overlooking  a  pathologic  hyperosmolar state caused by dangerous concentrations of glucose or exogenous toxins, or iatrogenic infusions of osmolal loads.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In such hyperosmolal situations, plasma volume expands as interstitial and intracellular water migrates into the intravascular space, causing a relative dilution of the serum sodium concentration without reduction in the amount of total body sodium. Total  body  water  may  be  increased,  unchanged,  or decreased depending on the competing e ff ects of water coadministered with the osmolal load and the likely presence of osmotic diuresis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with normal osmolality, a pseudohyponatremia can be seen as a laboratory artifact in cases of severe hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia when plasma volume is increased in the presence of normal serum sodium concentrations. Measuring sodium concentrations in serum rather than in plasma avoids the misinterpretation of this nonelectrolyte problem.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once  the  two  situations  of  hyperosmolality  and  normal osmolality have been excluded, the approach to the diagnosis of hypo-osmolal hyponatremia should be to evaluate the severity of the electrolyte derangement and the underlying volume status of the patient. Hypervolemic hyponatremia suggests the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
360

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
possibility of renal failure, congestive heart failure, or a hypoalbuminemic state such as cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome. Normovolemic hyponatremia is commonly seen in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone or in situations of habitual ingestion of hypotonic substances as seen in psychogenic polydipsia. Hypovolemic hyponatremia should prompt an investigation into the source of free water loss-either renal losses (e.g., from diuretics, mineralocorticoid de fi ciency, or other salt-wasting nephropathy) or extrarenal losses (e.g., gastrointestinal losses or third spacing).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sometimes the clinical context o ff ers the answer. For example,  massive  absorption  of  irrigating  solutions  that  do  not contain sodium, such as during transurethral resection of the prostate, is a relatively common cause of intraoperative hyponatremia. When the clinical context does not lead to a diagnosis, urinary sodium concentration measured from a spot urine sample can further di ff erentiate among the various causes of hyponatremia (Figure 18-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  hypotonic  hyponatremia  will  depend  on  the volume status of the patient. In hypovolemic hyponatremia, appropriate volume resuscitation should be pursued, usually with normal saline. If renal sodium losses are suspected, mineralocorticoid de fi ciency and the possibility of adrenal insuffi ciency  should  not  be  overlooked.  Cases  of  massive  third spacing such as can accompany pancreatitis or burns requires tailored resuscitation based on the totality of electrolyte and hematologic derangements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In euvolemic or hypervolemic patients, treatment involves withholding free water and encouraging free water excretion with a loop diuretic. Administration of saline is necessary only if signi fi cant symptoms are present. In these as in all cases of hyponatremia, the rate of correction depends on whether the development of hyponatremia was acute (i.e., occurred in <48 hours) or was chronic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic symptomatic hyponatremia  should  be  corrected slowly to avoid the risk of osmotic demyelination. During the development of chronic hyponatremia, brain cells retain their

Hypotonic hyponatremia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute symptomatic hyponatremia must be treated promptly.  Solute-free fl uids  are  withheld  and  hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) and furosemide are administered to enhance renal excretion of free water. Serum electrolyte levels should be  checked  frequently  and  this  treatment  continued  until symptoms disappear, which will likely occur before the serum sodium concentration returns to normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 18 FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
normal intracellular volume as the serum sodium decreases by exporting "e ff ective osmoles." Approximately half of these e ff ective  osmoles  are  potassium  ions  and  anions,  and  the remainder are small organic compounds. While hyponatremia is being corrected, brain cells must reaccumulate these e ff ective osmoles or water will move out of the cells into the now relatively hypertonic ECF, causing cell shrinkage. Such shrinkage can trigger central pontine myelinolysis, which can result in quadriplegia, seizures, coma, and death. Th e risk of osmotic demyelination  is  higher  in  patients  who  are  malnourished or  potassium  depleted.  Guidelines  for  correction  of  chronic symptomatic  hyponatremia  call  for  an  initial  correction  in serum  sodium  concentration  of  approximately  10  mEq/L. Th erea ft er, correction should not exceed 1 to 1.5 mEq/L/hr or a daily maximum increase of 12 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia should consider the underlying cause of the electrolyte disturbance. Appropriate sodium intake and volume restriction are o ft en the  cornerstones  of  treatment.  Patients  with  hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to congestive heart failure respond very  well  to  the  combination  of  an  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a loop diuretic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If at all possible, signi fi cant hyponatremia, especially if symptomatic, should be corrected before surgery. If the surgery is urgent, then appropriate corrective treatment should continue throughout  the  surgery  and  into  the  postoperative  period. Frequent  measurement  of  serum  sodium  concentration  is necessary  to  avoid  overly  rapid  correction  of  hyponatremia with resultant osmotic demyelination or overcorrection resulting in hypernatremia. If the treatment of hyponatremia includes hypertonic sodium infusion during surgery, it should be  infused  via  a  pump  while  losses  caused  by  the  surgery are replaced with standard crystalloid or colloid solutions as required. Treatment of the underlying cause of the hyponatremia should also continue throughout the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction and maintenance of anesthesia in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia are fraught with the risk of hypotension. In addition to fl uid therapy, vasopressors and/or inotropes may be required to treat the hypotension and should be made available before the start of induction. Hypervolemic hyponatremic patients,  particularly  those  with  heart  failure, may bene fi t from invasive hemodynamic monitoring to assess cardiac function and guide fl uid therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign  prostatic  hyperplasia  is  o ft en  treated  surgically  by transurethral  resection  of  the  prostate  (TURP). Th is  procedure involves resection via a cystoscope with continuous irrigation of the bladder to aid in visualization and removal of  blood and resected material. Th e  irrigating fl uid is usually  a  nearly  isotonic,  nonelectrolyte fl uid  containing  glycine  or  a  mixture  of  sorbitol  and  mannitol. Th is  irrigating fl uid may be absorbed rapidly via open venous sinuses in the prostate gland, which causes volume overload and hyponatremia. Th e use of hypotonic irrigating solutions has mostly fallen out of favor but would also lead to hypo-osmolality. Th e  constellation of fi ndings associated with absorption of bladder  irrigation  solution  is  known  as TURP  syndrome. Th is  syndrome  is  more  likely  to  occur  when  resection  is prolonged (>1 hour), when the irrigating fl uid is suspended more than 40 cm above the operative fi eld, when hypotonic irrigation fl uid is used, and when the pressure in the bladder is  allowed  to  increase  above  15  cm  H2O. TURP syndrome (Table 18-4) manifests principally with cardiovascular signs of fl uid  overload  and  neurologic  signs  and  symptoms  of hyponatremia.  Use  of  hypotonic  irrigating  solutions  can

also induce hemolysis, because red blood cells encounter a signi fi cant in fl ux of free water from hypotonic ECF. Hypertension and pulmonary edema are common. If a glycine irrigant is  used,  transient  blindness  can  occur  that  is  thought to result from the inhibitory neurotransmitter e ff ects of glycine. Glycine breaks down into glyoxylic acid and ammonia, and excessive ammonia levels themselves are known to cause encephalopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  for  the  development  of  TURP  syndrome includes direct neurologic assessment in patients  under regional  anesthesia  and  measurement  of  hemodynamics, serum  sodium  concentration,  and  osmolality  in  patients under  general  anesthesia.  Treatment  consists  of  terminating the surgical procedure so that no more fl uid is absorbed, administration of loop diuretics if needed for relief of cardiovascular symptoms, and administration of hypertonic saline if severe neurologic symptoms are present or the serum sodium concentration is less than 120 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypernatremia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypernatremia, de fi ned as a serum sodium concentration of more than 145 mEq/L, is much less common than hyponatremia  because  the  vasopressin-driven  thirst  mechanism  is very e ff ective in responding to the hypertonic state of hypernatremia.  Even  in  patients  with  renal  disorders  of  sodium retention  or  severe  water  loss,  patients  will  regulate  their serum sodium concentration close to or within the normal range if they have access to water. Th erefore, hypernatremia is much more likely to be seen in the very young, the elderly, and people who are debilitated, have altered mental status, or are unconscious.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the perioperative setting, hypernatremia is most likely a  result  of  iatrogenic  overcorrection  of  hyponatremia  or treatment  of  acidemia  with  sodium  bicarbonate.  Free  water losses from diabetes insipidus and extrarenal gastrointestinal losses will also lead to hypernatremia. Because sodium is the major contributor to ECF osmolality, hypernatremia induces the movement of water across cell membranes into the ECF. Hypernatremia and the associated hyperosmolality will always lead to cellular dehydration and shrinkage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of hypernatremia can vary from mild to life threatening (Table 18-5). Th e earliest signs and symptoms are  restlessness,  irritability,  and  lethargy.  As  hypernatremia progresses,  muscular  twitching,  hyperre fl exia,  tremors,  and ataxia may develop. Th e signs and symptoms progress as the osmolality increases above 325 mOsm/kg. Muscle spasticity, seizures, and death may ensue. Th e very young and the very old and those with preexisting central nervous system disease exhibit  more  severe  symptoms  at  any  given  serum  sodium concentration or degree of hyperosmolality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most prominent abnormalities in hypernatremia are neurologic. Dehydration of brain cells occurs as water shi ft s out of the cells into the hypertonic interstitium. Capillary and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
venous congestion as well as venous sinus thrombosis have all  been  reported.  As  the  brain  cells  shrink,  cerebral  blood vessels  may  stretch  and  tear,  which  results  in  intracranial hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Usually  the  signs  and  symptoms  are  more  severe  when hypernatremia is acute rather than chronic and when excessive elevations in serum sodium levels are present. Mortality rates of up to 75% have been reported in adults with severe acute  hypernatremia  (serum  sodium  concentration  >  160 mEq/L),  and  survivors  of  severe  acute  hypernatremia  o ft en have  permanent  neurologic  sequelae.  During  the  development  of  chronic  hypernatremia,  brain  cells  generate  "idiogenic osmoles" that restore intracellular water in spite of the ongoing hypernatremia and protect against brain cell dehydration.  If  chronic  hypernatremia  is  corrected  too  rapidly, these  idiogenic  osmoles  predispose  to  the  development  of cerebral edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis and treatment of hypernatremia should focus on assessing the severity of the derangement and on ascertaining the volume status of the patient. Th e presence of hypervolemia, euvolemia, or hypovolemia dictates the appropriate diagnostic and treatment modalities (Figure 18-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In hypovolemic hypernatremia, the patient has lost more water than sodium via renal or extrarenal routes. Th is may occur  as  a  result  of  excessive  hypotonic  diuresis,  gastrointestinal  losses,  or  insensible fl uid  losses  from  burns  or sweating.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with hypervolemic hypernatremia will show signs of ECF volume expansion, such as jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, and pulmonary congestion. Th e di ff erential diagnosis  includes  a  history  of  hypertonic fl uid  administration, oral intake of salt tablets, and endocrine abnormalities marked by excessive aldosterone secretion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Euvolemic and hypovolemic hypernatremia occur secondary to water loss without concomitant salt loss and may be seen with either extrarenal pathologic conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal tract losses or insensible losses from burns or sweating) or from renal losses (e.g., diabetes insipidus, loop diuretics, or osmotic diuresis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with hyponatremia, testing of a spot urine sample for sodium  concentration  and  osmolality  can  help  distinguish among the causes of hypernatremia (see Figure 18-3).

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment is determined by how severe the hypernatremia is and how rapidly it developed and whether the ECF volume is increased or decreased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In hypovolemic hypernatremia, the water de fi cit is replenished  with  normal  saline  or  a  balanced  electrolyte  solution until the patient is euvolemic and then the plasma osmolality is corrected with hypotonic saline or 5% dextrose solution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with hypervolemic hypernatremia, the primary treatment is diuresis with a loop diuretic, but if the cause of the hypervolemic hypernatremia is renal failure, then hemo fi ltration or hemodialysis may be needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with euvolemic hypernatremia require water replacement either orally or with 5% dextrose intravenously. Treatment of diabetes insipidus is covered in Chapter 19 and depends on whether there is a central de fi cit  of  vasopressin release or a renal insensitivity to vasopressin's actions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  hypernatremia  should  be  corrected  over  several hours. However, to avoid cerebral edema, chronic hypernatremia should be corrected more slowly, over 2 to 3 days. Ongoing sodium and water losses should also be calculated and replaced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If at all possible, surgery should be delayed until the hypernatremia has been corrected and the associated symptoms have abated. Frequent serum sodium measurements and urine output monitoring will be required perioperatively, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be useful to assess volume status. Hypovolemia will be exacerbated by induction and maintenance of anesthesia, and prompt correction of hypotension with fl uids, vasopressors, and/or inotropes may be required. Th e volume of distribution of hydrophilic drugs will be altered in hypovolemia and hypervolemia. An accentuated hemodynamic response to anesthetic drug administration, however, is  more  likely  a  consequence  of  vasodilatory  and  cardiodepressant responses in a hypovolemic patient than a result of changes in the volume of distribution.

with age. Less than 1.5% of total body potassium is found in the extracellular space. Th erefore, serum potassium concentration  is  o ft en  a  re fl ection  more  of  factors  that  regulate transcellular potassium distribution than of total body potassium.  Total  body  potassium  is  regulated  over  longer periods  of  time,  principally  by  the  distal  nephron  in  the kidneys; the distal nephron secretes potassium in response to aldosterone, which leads to an increase in urine volume and  nonresorbable  anions,  and  metabolic  alkalosis.  More than 90% of the potassium taken in by diet is excreted in the urine, and most of the remainder is eliminated in the feces. As the glomerular fi ltration rate decreases in renal failure, the  amount  of  potassium  excreted  by  the  gastrointestinal route increases.

Hypokalemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of hypokalemia are generally restricted to the cardiac and neuromuscular systems and include dysrhythmias, muscle weakness, cramps, paralysis, and ileus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypokalemia is diagnosed by the presence of a serum potassium concentration of less than 3.5 mmol/L and results from decreased net intake, intracellular shi ft s, or increased potassium  losses.  Di ff erential diagnosis requires determining whether the hypokalemia is acute and secondary to intracellular potassium shi ft s, such as might be seen with hyperventilation or alkalosis, or whether the hypokalemia is chronic and associated with depletion of total body potassium stores (Table  18-6).  If  the  hypokalemia  is  the  result  of  potassium losses, a spot urinary potassium reading will guide the diagnosis toward either renal or extrarenal causes. Renal potassium  losses  are  associated  with  a  spot  urinary  potassium value of more than 15 to 20 mEq/L despite the presence of hypokalemia. Appropriately low urine potassium concentrations in the setting of hypokalemia point to a normally functioning kidney in the setting of inadequate potassium intake or gastrointestinal losses. In cases of renal loss, assessment of the  transtubular  potassium  concentration  gradient,  hemodynamics, and acid-base status will further guide diagnosis. Hypertension  with  hypokalemia  is  usually  the  result  of  a hyperaldosterone state. Renal losses in the setting of acidemia point to a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis. Renal losses in the setting of alkalemia can indicate a response to diuretics or can be seen in genetic disorders such as Liddle's syndrome (associated with hypertension) or Bartter's syndrome (which has tubular e ff ects similar to those of loop diuretics). Hypomagnesemia can also exacerbate renal potassium  losses.  Hypokalemia  without  a  change  in  total body potassium stores can be caused by familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Unusual causes of hypokalemia from ICF shi ft s  include  conditions  causing  rapid  cell  growth,  such  as a ft er  initiation  of  treatment  for  pernicious  anemia  or  other anabolic states.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of  hypokalemia depends on the degree of potassium depletion and the underlying cause. If the hypokalemia is profound or is associated with life-threatening signs, potassium must be administered intravenously. In the presence of paralysis  or  malignant  dysrhythmias,  the  rate  of  potassium repletion  can  be  as  high  as  20  mEq  over  30  to  45  minutes, repeated as needed. If a malignant dysrhythmia appears a ft er potassium repletion is initiated, the di ff erential diagnosis may implicate the potassium administration as the cause. Th erefore electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is required whenever rapid  potassium  repletion  is  undertaken.  In  the  setting  of urgent repletion, delivering potassium solutions in a dextrose carrier is suboptimal, because the resultant insulin secretion will further induce intracellular potassium transfer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Largely  because  of  the  risks  of  intravenous  potassium administration, in cases of nonemergent potassium repletion the enteral route is preferred. If intravenous repletion is chosen in a nonemergency situation, it should proceed at a rate of less than 20 mmol/hr. Peripheral infusion may result in pain or venous damage at the intravenous site, and central administration is preferred.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether  or  not  to  treat  hypokalemia  before  surgery  is  an ongoing  subject  of  debate  and  depends  on  the  chronicity and severity of the de fi cit. Because of the limitations on rate of  repletion  and  the  large  total  body  potassium  de fi cits  that accompany chronic  hypokalemia,  the  safe  repletion  of  total body  potassium  stores  o ft en  requires  days.  Although  total body depletion is variable in its relationship to serum potassium concentrations, chronic hypokalemia with serum concentrations of less than 3.0 mmol/L may require delivery of 600 mmol or more of potassium to achieve full normalization. It  is  therefore  unlikely  that  the  administration  of  small  aliquots of potassium immediately before surgery will make any signi fi cant  di ff erence  in  potassium  balance.  Moreover,  such interventions carry the risk of inadvertent serum hyperkalemia that may exacerbate susceptibility to dysrhythmias in the perioperative period. However, it has also been suggested that even small improvements in potassium balance may help normalize  transmembrane  potentials  and  reduce  the  incidence of  perioperative  dysrhythmias.  Recommendations  on  this controversial issue are based more on expert opinion, clinical judgement, and local practice patterns than on evidence from peer-reviewed studies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  may  be  prudent  to  correct  signi fi cant  hypokalemia  in patients  with  other  risk  factors  for  dysrhythmias  such  as those with congestive heart failure, those taking digoxin, and those with ECG evidence of hypokalemia. ECG abnormalities associated with potassium derangement are illustrated in (Figure 18-4). Classically, U waves are seen in the presence of hypokalemia. Anesthetic management of patients with signi fi cant  hypokalemia should also prevent further decreases in serum potassium concentration by avoiding the administration of insulin, glucose, β -adrenergic agonists, bicarbonate, and diuretics, as well as by avoiding hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  of  the  e ff ect  of  hypokalemia  on  skeletal  muscle, there  is  the  theoretical  possibility  of  prolonged  action  of muscle relaxants. Doses of neuromuscular blockers should be guided by nerve stimulator testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potassium levels should be measured frequently if repletion is ongoing or changes resulting from drug administration, surgical progress, or ventilation are expected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperkalemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperkalemia is de fi ned as a serum potassium concentration of more than 5.5 mEq/L. As with hypokalemia, hyperkalemia can result from transcellular movement of potassium out of cells or from alterations in potassium intake or excretion. In hospitalized patients, hyperkalemia is frequently the result of iatrogenic potassium loads (Table 18-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Signs  and  symptoms  of  hyperkalemia  depend  on  the  acuity of the increase. Chronic hyperkalemia is o ft en asymptomatic, and  dialysis-dependent  patients  can  withstand  considerable

variations in serum potassium concentration between dialysis sessions (usually 2 to 3 days) with remarkably few symptoms. Chronic  hyperkalemia  may  be  associated  with  nonspeci fi c symptoms such as general malaise and mild gastrointestinal disturbances. More acute or signi fi cant increases in potassium manifest as membrane depolarization and associated cardiac and  neuromuscular  changes,  including  weakness,  paralysis, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia or asystole.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst step in the diagnosis of hyperkalemia is to rule out a spuriously high potassium level secondary to hemolysis of the specimen. A spuriously high potassium level may also occur with thrombocytosis and leukocytosis resulting from leakage of potassium from the cells in vitro. True hyperkalemia can be identi fi ed on ECG tracings fi rst as a peaked T wave, followed in more severe cases by disappearance of the P wave and prolongation of the QRS complex, which progresses to sine waves and then eventually to asystole (see Figure 18-4).

Common  causes  of  hyperkalemia  in  the  perioperative period include acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and succinylcholine administration.  If  the  increase  in  serum  potassium  level  is thought to be associated with increased total body potassium, then decreased renal excretion or increased potassium intake is likely. Measurement of the urinary potassium excretion rate can  aid  in  the  di ff erential  diagnosis  between  cellular  potassium shi ft s and problems with potassium excretion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediate treatment of hyperkalemia is required if lifethreatening dysrhythmias or ECG signs of severe hyperkalemia are present. Th is treatment is aimed at antagonizing the e ff ects of a high potassium level on the transmembrane potential and redistributing the potassium intracellularly. Calcium chloride or calcium gluconate is administered intravenously to stabilize cellular membranes. Th e onset of action is immediate. Potassium can be driven intracellularly by the action of insulin with or without glucose. Th is measure will be e ff ective within 10 to 20 minutes. Other adjuvant therapies include sodium bicarbonate administration and hyperventilation to promote alkalosis and movement of potassium intracellularly. Potassium driven intracellularly may eventually move out of the cells again, so therapy may need to continue beyond acute correction of the derangement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When hyperkalemia is secondary to increased total body stores of potassium, then potassium must be eliminated from the  body. Th is  can  be  achieved  by  administration  of  a  loop diuretic such as furosemide, infusion of saline to encourage diuresis, or use of an ion exchange resin. Th e primary potassium  exchange  resin  used  is  sodium  polystyrene  sulfonate (Kayexalate) given either orally or by enema. Dialysis may be required to remove potassium in cases of emergent hyperkalemia or in patients with poor renal function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is recommended that the serum potassium concentration be below 5.5 mEq/L for elective surgery. Correction of hyperkalemia before surgery is preferable, but if this is not feasible, steps should  be  taken  to  lower  the  potassium  level  immediately before induction of anesthesia by the methods indicated previously. Potassium levels may in fl uence the selection of drugs for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, because preoperative medications that induce hypocapnia and acidosis may cause  further  transcellular  potassium  shi ft s.  Also,  succinylcholine increases serum potassium concentration by approximately 0.5 mEq/L in healthy patients and is best avoided in the absence of an urgent need for it. Th e e ff ects of muscle relaxants may be exaggerated if there is muscle weakness from the hyperkalemia.  Respiratory  and  metabolic  acidosis  must  be avoided, since either will exacerbate the hyperkalemia and its e ff ects.  Potassium-containing intravenous fl uids such as lactated Ringer's solution (which contains 4 mEq/L of potassium) and Normosol (which contains 5 mEq/L of potassium) should be  avoided.  Dialysis  patients  who  are  scheduled  for  surgery in  which  intraoperative  potassium  loads  can  be  anticipated may be managed preoperatively by decreasing the potassium content of the dialysate to reduce serum potassium levels in anticipation of surgery.

DISORDERS OF CALCIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Only  1%  of  total  body  calcium  is  present  in  the  ECF. Th e remainder is stored in bone. Of the calcium in the ECF, 60% is free or coupled with anions and thus fi lterable, and the remaining 40% is bound to proteins, mainly albumin. Only the ionized calcium in the extracellular space is physiologically active. Ionized calcium concentrations are a ff ected by both albumin concentration  and  the  pH  of  plasma.  Net  calcium  balance occurs when absorption from the diet equals losses of calcium in feces and urine. Several hormones regulate calcium metabolism:  parathyroid  hormone,  which  increases  bone  resorption  and  renal  tubular  reabsorption  of  calcium;  calcitonin, which inhibits  bone  resorption;  and  vitamin  D,  which  augments intestinal absorption of calcium. Th e activity of these hormones is altered in response to changes in plasma ionized calcium  concentration.  Other  hormones,  including  thyroid hormone, growth hormone, and adrenal and gonadal steroids, also a ff ect calcium homeostasis, but their secretion is determined by factors other than plasma calcium concentration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia is de fi ned as a reduction in serum ionized calcium concentration. It is important to note that many blood chemistry analysis systems measure total calcium rather than ionized  calcium.  Several  formulas  exist  to  convert  total  calcium to ionized calcium, but none of these is totally reliable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Binding of calcium to albumin is pH dependent, and acidbase disturbances can change the fraction and therefore the concentration of ionized calcium without changing total body

calcium.  Alkalosis  reduces  the  ionized  calcium  concentration,  so  ionized  calcium  may  be  signi fi cantly  reduced  a ft er bicarbonate administration or in the setting of hyperventilation.  Many  hospitalized  patients  are  also  hypoalbuminemic, and the reduction in bound calcium will reduce the measured serum calcium level. When serum calcium concentration is interpreted  in  the  setting  of  a  low  albumin  level,  corrected calcium concentration can be calculated as follows: measured calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 [4 -albumin (mg/dL)].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  signs  and  symptoms  of  hypocalcemia  depend  on  the rapidity and the degree of reduction in ionized calcium. Most of these signs and symptoms are evident in the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems and include paresthesias, irritability, seizures, hypotension, and myocardial depression. ECG changes associated with hypocalcemia are marked by prolongation of the QT interval (Figure 18-5). In the postoperative period  a ft er  parathyroid  resection,  hypocalcemia-induced laryngospasm can be life threatening.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia is o ft en caused by decreased parathyroid hormone secretion, end-organ resistance to parathyroid hormone, or disorders of vitamin D metabolism. Th ese are usually seen clinically  as  complications  of  thyroid  or  parathyroid  surgery, magnesium de fi ciency, and renal failure. In the operative theater, acute hypocalcemia is o ft en encountered as a result of calcium binding to citrate preservative during massive transfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia with seizures, tetany, and/or cardiovascular depression must be treated immediately with intravenous calcium. Th e duration of treatment will be dependent on serial calcium measurements. Treatment of hypocalcemia in the presence of hypomagnesemia is ine ff ective unless

magnesium is also replenished. Metabolic or respiratory alkalosis should be corrected. If metabolic or respiratory acidosis is present with hypocalcemia, then the calcium level should be corrected before the acidosis is treated, because correcting an acidosis with bicarbonate or hyperventilation will only exacerbate the hypocalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Less acute and asymptomatic hypocalcemia may be treated with oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic  hypocalcemia  must  be  treated  before  surgery, and  every  e ff ort  must  be  made  to  minimize  any  further decrease in serum calcium level intraoperatively. Th is  might occur  with  hyperventilation  or  administration  of  bicarbonate. Ionized calcium levels should always be considered during massive transfusion of blood containing citrate. Hypothermia, liver  disease,  and  renal  failure  impair  citrate  clearance  and further increase the likelihood of signi fi cant hypocalcemia in transfusion recipients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sudden decreases in ionized calcium levels may be seen in the early postoperative period a ft er thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy and may precipitate laryngospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia results from increased calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (milk-alkali syndrome, vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis), decreased renal  calcium  excretion  in  renal  insu ffi ciency,  and  increased bone resorption of calcium (primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, hyperthyroidism, and immobilization).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost all patients with hypercalcemia have either hyperparathyroidism or cancer. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually associated with a serum calcium concentration of less than 11 mEq/L and no symptoms, whereas malignancy o ft en presents with acute symptoms and a serum calcium level higher than 13 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of hypercalcemia is directed toward increasing urinary  calcium  excretion  and  inhibiting  bone  resorption  and further gastrointestinal absorption of calcium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since hypercalcemia is frequently associated with hypovolemia  secondary  to  polyuria,  volume  expansion  with  saline not only corrects the fl uid de fi cit  but  also  increases  urinary excretion of calcium along with administered sodium. Loop diuretics also enhance urinary excretion of both sodium and calcium  but  should  be  used  only  a ft er  appropriate  volume resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Calcitonin, bisphosphonates, or mithramycin  may  be required in disorders associated with osteoclastic bone resorption. Hydrocortisone may reduce gastrointestinal absorption of calcium in granulomatous disease, vitamin D intoxication, lymphoma, and myeloma. Oral phosphate may also be given to reduce gastrointestinal uptake of calcium if renal function is normal. Dialysis may be required for life-threatening hypercalcemia. Surgical removal of the parathyroid glands may be required to treat primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for emergency surgery in a patient with hypercalcemia is aimed at restoring intravascular volume before  induction  and  increasing  urinary  excretion  of  calcium with loop diuretics (thiazide diuretics should be avoided, because they increase renal tubular reabsorption of calcium). Ideally, surgery should be postponed until calcium levels have normalized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central  venous  pressure  or  pulmonary  artery  pressure monitoring may be advisable in some patients requiring fl uid resuscitation  and  diuresis  as  part  of  the  perioperative  treatment of hypercalcemia. Dosing of muscle relaxants must be guided  by  neuromuscular  monitoring  if  muscle  weakness, hypotonia, or loss of deep tendon re fl exes is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF MAGNESIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium  is  predominantly  found  intracellularly  and  in mineralized bone. Between 60% and 70% of serum magnesium is ionized, with 10% complexed to citrate, bicarbonate, or phosphate and approximately 30% bound to protein, mostly albumin. Th ere  is  little  di ff erence  between  extracellular  and intracellular  ionized  magnesium  concentrations,  so  there  is only a small transmembrane gradient for ionized magnesium. It is the ionized fraction of magnesium that is associated with clinical e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium is absorbed from and secreted into the gastrointestinal  tract  and fi ltered,  reabsorbed, and excreted by the kidneys. Renal reabsorption and excretion are passive, following sodium and water.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypomagnesemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some  degree  of  hypomagnesemia  occurs  in  up  to  10%  of hospitalized patients. An even higher percentage of patients in  intensive  care  units,  especially  those  receiving  parenteral nutrition  or  dialysis,  have  hypomagnesemia.  Coronary  care unit patients with hypomagnesemia have a higher mortality rate that those with normal serum levels of magnesium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of hypomagnesemia are similar to those of  hypocalcemia and involve mostly the cardiac and neuromuscular systems. Dysrhythmias, weakness, muscle twitching, tetany, apathy, and seizures can be seen. Hypokalemia and/or hypocalcemia  that  had  been  refractory  to  supplementation will respond a ft er correction of hypomagnesemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypomagnesemia is most commonly due to reduced gastrointestinal uptake (reduced dietary intake or reduced absorption  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract)  or  to  renal  wasting  of magnesium. Th ese entities can be di ff erentiated by measuring the urinary magnesium excretion rate. Much less frequently, hypomagnesemia is due to intracellular shi ft s of magnesium with no overall change in total body magnesium, to hungry bone syndrome a ft er parathyroidectomy, or to exudative cutaneous losses a ft er burn injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of hypomagnesemia depends on the severity of the de fi ciency and the signs and symptoms that are present. If cardiac dysrhythmias or seizures are present, magnesium is administered intravenously as a bolus (2 g of magnesium sulfate equals 8 mEq of magnesium), and the dose is repeated until symptoms abate. A ft er life-threatening signs have resolved, a slower infusion of magnesium sulfate can be continued for several days to allow for equilibration of intracellular and total body magnesium stores. If renal wasting is present, supplementation must be increased to account for the magnesium lost in the urine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypermagnesemia is a potential side e ff ect of the treatment of hypomagnesemia, so the patient should be monitored for signs of hypotension, facial fl ushing, and loss of deep tendon re fl exes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  hypomagnesemia includes attention to the signs of magnesium de fi ciency, magnesium  supplementation,  and  treatment  of  refractory

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypokalemia or hypocalcemia if needed. If the hypomagnesemia is secondary to malnutrition or alcoholism, the anesthetic implications of these diseases must be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular dysrhythmias should be anticipated and treated as necessary. Muscle relaxation should be guided by the results of peripheral nerve stimulation, since hypomagnesemia can be associated with both muscle weakness and muscle excitation. Fluid loading (particularly with sodium-containing solutions) and the use of diuretics should be avoided, because the renal excretion of magnesium passively follows sodium excretion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypermagnesemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypermagnesemia  (i.e.,  a  serum  magnesium  concentration of >2.5 mEq/L) is much less common than hypomagnesemia because  a  magnesium  load  can  be  briskly  excreted  if  renal function is normal. Even patients with renal failure rarely have symptomatic hypermagnesemia unless there is a signi fi cantly increased  dietary  or  intravenous  intake.  However,  milder elevations  in  serum  magnesium  levels  are  frequently  found in intensive care unit and dialysis patient populations. Hypermagnesemia  may  be  a  complication  of  magnesium  sulfate administration to treat preeclampsia/eclampsia or to provide perinatal neurologic protection in premature delivery. Magnesium infusion during pheochromocytoma surgery is popular in some centers but may also result in hypermagnesemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia begin to occur at serum levels of 4 to 5 mEq/L and include lethargy, nausea and vomiting and facial fl ushing. At levels above 6 mEq/L, a loss of deep tendon re fl exes and hypotension occur. Paralysis, apnea, heart block, and/or cardiac arrest are likely if the magnesium level exceeds 10 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

Evaluation of hypermagnesemia involves assessing renal function (creatinine clearance) and detecting any source of excess magnesium intake, such as parenteral infusion, oral ingestion of antacids, and administration of magnesium-based enemas or  cathartics.  Once  these  have  been  excluded,  less  common causes of hypermagnesemia, including hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Addison's disease, and lithium therapy, can be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Life-threatening signs of hypermagnesemia may be temporarily ameliorated with intravenous calcium administration, but hemodialysis may be required. Lesser degrees of hypermagnesemia can be treated with forced diuresis with saline and loop diuretics to increase renal excretion of magnesium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive  cardiovascular  monitoring  may  be  necessary  perioperatively  to  measure  and  treat  the  hypotension  and  vasodilation associated with hypermagnesemia and to guide fl uid resuscitation and ongoing replacement of fl uids during forced diuresis.  Acidosis  exacerbates  hypermagnesemia,  so  careful attention must be paid to ventilation and arterial pH. Initial and subsequent doses of muscle relaxant should be reduced in the presence of muscle weakness and guided by results of peripheral nerve stimulation. Hypermagnesemia and skeletal muscle weakness are not uncommon causes of failure to wean from mechanical ventilation in the intensive care setting, especially in patients with renal failure.

ACID-BASE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial acid-base balance is normally tightly regulated within the pH range of 7.35 to 7.45 to ensure optimal conditions for cellular  enzyme  function.  Values  of  arterial  blood  pH  less than 7.35 are termed acidemia, and  values  higher  than  7.45 are termed alkalemia. Th e related terms acidosis and alkalosis refer to acid-base derangements that produce either excess H + or excess OH -, respectively, but that may be present regardless of arterial pH. Intracellular pH is lower than extracellular pH and is maintained at a closely regulated level of 7.0 to 7.3. Acidbase regulation in the setting of normal metabolism requires handling of the continuous production of acidic metabolites totalling approximately 1 mEq/kg body weight per day.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stability  of  pH  is  accomplished by a system of intracellular and extracellular bu ff ers, most importantly the HCO 3 /CO2 bu ff er  pair.  Carbon  dioxide  can  enter  or  leave  the  body  via the lungs, and bicarbonate can enter or leave the body via the kidneys. Maintenance of a normal bicarbonate concentration relative to carbon dioxide tension results in an optimal ratio of approximately 20:1. Maintenance of this ratio of 20:1 allows for a relatively normal pH despite deviations from normal of either bicarbonate  concentration  or  carbon  dioxide  tension.  Other bu ff ers include proteins, bone apatite, and phosphate ions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e relationship of the CO2/HCO3 bu ff er system to pH is expressed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = 6.1 + log (serum bicarbonate concentration/0.03 × Pa co 2 ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes  in  respiration  regulate  carbon  dioxide  tension, whereas renal regulation modi fi es bicarbonate concentration. Th ese changes may be the cause of a primary acid-base disorder or can occur as a compensatory mechanism in response to another underlying disorder. In non-mechanically ventilated and nonsedated patients,  compensatory respiratory  or  renal responses can normalize an altered pH but will not overcompensate and alter the pH to the point of reversing the primary disorder. Th is is not always true in the operating room, where the  potential  for  overcompensation  for  acid-base  disorders makes familiarity with the clinical history a key part of understanding the patient's primary acid-base abnormality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  compensation  for  acid-base  derangements  may include increases in resorption or secretion of fi ltered bicarbonate  in  the  proximal  tubule.  In  addition,  protons  (i.e., hydrogen ions) can be reabsorbed in the distal tubule and collecting duct or excreted into the urine. Hydrogen ion excretion in the urine regenerates the bicarbonate originally consumed by bu ff ering a hydrogen ion in the ECF. Th e excreted hydrogen

Evaluation of acid-base disturbances begins with a determination of the primary pH derangement by measurement of arterial pH, Pa co 2 , and HCO3. A high or low pH will demonstrate the primary acid-base disorder and allow evaluation of whether there is appropriate compensation. In cases of normal pH, there may still be chronic compensated acidosis or alkalosis that can o ff er insight into the patient's comorbid condition.

If  both Pa co 2 and bicarbonate change in the same direction (i.e., both are increased or both are decreased), then there is a primary acid-base disorder with a compensatory secondary disorder that brings the ratio of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide tension back toward 20:1.

is of respiratory, metabolic, or mixed origin (Table 18-8). Th e e ff ects of acidosis are particularly detrimental to the cardiovascular system. Acidosis decreases myocardial contractility, although clinical e ff ects  are  minimal until the pH decreases to less than 7.2, which perhaps re fl ects the e ff ects of catecholamine release in response to the acidosis. When the pH is less than 7.1,   cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines decreases and  compensatory  inotropic  e ff ects  are  diminished. Th e detrimental  e ff ects  of  acidosis  may  be  accentuated  in  those with  underlying  le ft ventricular  dysfunction  or  myocardial ischemia  and  in  those  in  whom  sympathetic  nervous  system activity is impaired, such as by β -adrenergic blockade or general anesthesia.

ventricular  dysrhythmias.  Alkalosis  depresses  ventilation and can frustrate e ff orts  to  wean  patients  from  mechanical ventilation.  Hypokalemia  accompanies  both  metabolic  and respiratory alkalosis but is more prominent in the presence of metabolic  alkalosis.  Alkalosis  stimulates  anaerobic  glycolysis and increases the production of lactic acid and ketoacids. Although alkalosis can decrease the release of oxygen to the tissues by tightening the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, chronic alkalosis negates this e ff ect by increasing the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory Acidosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory acidemia is present when a decrease in alveolar ventilation  results  in  an  increase  in  the  Pa co 2 su ffi cient  to decrease arterial pH to less than 7.35 (Table 18-10). Th e most likely  cause  of  respiratory  acidosis  during  the  perioperative period is drug-induced depression of ventilation by opioids, general  anesthetics,  or  paralytics.  Respiratory  acidosis  may be complicated by metabolic acidosis when renal perfusion is decreased to the extent that reabsorption mechanisms in the renal tubules are impaired. For example, cardiac output and renal blood fl ow may be so decreased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cor pulmonale as to lead to metabolic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory acidosis  is  treated  by  correcting  the  disorder responsible  for  hypoventilation.  Mechanical  ventilation  is necessary when the increase in Pa co 2 is marked, and carbon dioxide narcosis may create a self-reinforcing disorder. It must be remembered that rapid lowering of chronically increased Pa co 2 levels by mechanical ventilation decreases body stores of  carbon  dioxide  much  more  rapidly  than  the  kidneys  can produce a corresponding decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration. Th e  resulting  metabolic  alkalosis  can  cause  neuromuscular irritability  and  excitation  of  the  central  nervous system manifesting as seizures. It is best to decrease the Pa co 2 slowly to permit su ffi cient time for renal tubular elimination of bicarbonate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic  alkalosis  may  accompany  respiratory  acidosis when the body stores of chloride and potassium are decreased. For example, decreased serum chloride concentrations facilitate renal tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate, which leads to metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia stimulates renal tubules to excrete hydrogen, which may produce metabolic alkalosis or aggravate a co-existing alkalosis caused by chloride de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of metabolic alkalosis associated with these electrolyte disturbances requires administration of potassium chloride.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory Alkalosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory alkalosis is present when an increase in alveolar ventilation results in a decrease in Pa co 2 su ffi cient to increase the  pH  to  greater  than  7.45  (Table  18-11). Th e  most  likely cause  of  acute  respiratory  alkalosis  during  the  perioperative period is iatrogenic hyperventilation as may occur during general anesthesia. Respiratory alkalosis occurs normally during pregnancy and is an important adaptive response to high altitude.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of respiratory alkalosis is directed at correcting the  underlying disorder responsible for alveolar hyperventilation.  During  anesthesia,  this  is  most  o ft en  accomplished by  adjusting  the  ventilator  to  decrease  alveolar  ventilation. Th e hypokalemia and hypochloremia that may co-exist with respiratory alkalosis may also require treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic Acidosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic  acidosis  lowers  blood  pH,  which  stimulates  the respiratory center to hyperventilate and lower carbon dioxide tension. Respiratory compensation does not in general fully counterbalance the increased acid production, but the pH will return toward normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acidoses of metabolic origin are typically divided into those with a normal anion gap and those with a high anion gap.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A high anion gap occurs when a fi xed acid is added to the extracellular  space. Th e  acid  dissociates,  the  hydrogen  ion combines  with  bicarbonate  forming  carbonic  acid,  and  the decreased  bicarbonate  concentration  produces  an  increased anion gap. Lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, and the acidoses  associated  with  many  poisonings  are  examples  of high anion gap metabolic acidoses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Non-anion  gap  metabolic  acidosis  is  the  result  of  a  net increase in chloride concentration. Bicarbonate loss is counterbalanced by a net gain of chloride ions to maintain electrical neutrality. Th erefore, a normal anion gap acidosis is o ft en called  a hyperchloremic metabolic  acidosis. Th e  most  common causes of a normal anion gap acidosis are intravenous infusion  of  sodium  chloride  and  gastrointestinal  and  renal losses of bicarbonate (diarrhea, renal tubular acidosis, early renal failure).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 18 FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
373

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since acidosis is secondary to an underlying disorder, the presentation  of  acidosis  is  complicated  by  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  the  causative  disorder.  Derangements  of  pH  have wide-ranging e ff ects  on  tissue,  organ,  and  enzyme  function, and the signs and symptoms attributable to an acidosis relate to  these  e ff ects. Th e  clinical  features  of  metabolic  acidosis depend also on the rate of development of the acidosis and are likely  to  be  more  dramatic in rapidly developing acidosis in which compensatory respiratory or renal changes are not able to limit the fall in pH.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion and laboratory  testing.  Most  commonly,  arterial  blood  is  analyzed  for pH, carbon dioxide tension, bicarbonate concentration, and anion gap. Common causes of metabolic acidosis are listed in Table 18-12.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic  acidosis  can  be  of  renal  or  nonrenal  origin. Metabolic acidosis of renal origin involves a primary dis  order of renal acidi fi cation. Th is occurs when the kidneys are unable to regenerate su ffi cient bicarbonate to replace that lost by the bu ff ering of normal endogenous acid production (distal renal tubular  acidosis)  or  when  an  abnormally  high  fraction  of fi ltered bicarbonate is not reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and is subsequently lost in the urine (proximal renal tubular acidosis  or  acetazolamide  use).  Combined  defects  occur  in renal failure. Th e most common causes of extrarenal sources of a metabolic acidosis are gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses, ketoacidosis, and lactic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of metabolic acidosis includes treatment of the cause  of  the  acidosis,  for  example,  insulin  and fl uids  for diabetic ketoacidosis and improvement in tissue perfusion for  lactic  acidosis.  Administration  of  sodium  bicarbonate for  acute  treatment  of  metabolic  acidosis  is  very  controversial.  Many  recommend  that  bicarbonate  be  given  only if  the  pH  is  less  than  7.1  or  the  bicarbonate  concentration is less than 10 mEq/L. It is thought that the bicarbonate  reacts  with  hydrogen  ions,  generating  carbon  dioxide, which di ff uses  into  cells  and  lowers  intracellular  pH  even more than before the bicarbonate treatment. It is also postulated that administration of bicarbonate to patients with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
chronic  metabolic  acidosis  may  result  in  transient  tissue hypoxia. Acute changes in pH toward normal (or alkalosis) may negate the rightward shi ft of  the  oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve caused by acidemia (Bohr e ff ect) and result in increased hemoglobin a ffi nity for oxygen, which reduces oxygen delivery at the tissue level.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e 2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care do not recommend administering sodium bicarbonate routinely during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, sodium bicarbonate may be considered for life-threatening hyperkalemia or cardiac arrest associated with hyperkalemia, or for cardiac arrest associated with a preexisting metabolic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elective  surgery  should  be  postponed  until  an  acidosis  has been treated. For urgent surgery in a patient with metabolic acidosis, invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be considered to guide fl uid resuscitation and to monitor cardiac function in marked acidosis. Laboratory measurement of acid-base parameters  should  be  performed  frequently  throughout  the perioperative period, because pH can change rapidly and signi fi cantly in response to changes in ventilation, volume status, circulation, and drug administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acidosis a ff ects the proportion of drug in the ionized and un-ionized states. Volume of distribution may also be a ff ected in patients who have uncorrected hypovolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic Alkalosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic alkalosis is marked by an increase in plasma bicarbonate  concentration  and  is  usually  compensated  for  by  an increase in carbon dioxide tension. Common causes of metabolic alkalosis are listed in Table 18-13.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic alkalosis can be of renal or extrarenal origin and  can  be  caused  by  either  a  net  loss  of  hydrogen  ions (such as loss of hydrochloric acid with vomiting) or a net gain of bicarbonate (such as being caused by tubular defects of  bicarbonate  reabsorption).  Abnormal losses of chloride with or without hydrogen ion (e.g., in cystic fi brosis, villous adenoma)  also  induce  increased  renal  bicarbonate  reabsorption in an attempt to maintain electroneutrality. Th erefore,  metabolic  alkaloses  can  be  characterized  as  chloride responsive  or  chloride  resistant.  Another  classi fi cation  of metabolic alkalosis is volume-depletion alkalosis (resulting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
374

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
from  vomiting,  diarrhea,  or  chloride  losses)  and  volumeoverload  alkalosis  (resulting  from  primary  or  secondary mineralocorticoid excess).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic alkalosis can also occur secondary to renal compensation for chronic respiratory disease with hypercarbia. In these patients, bicarbonate levels may be quite high and associated  with  urinary  losses  of  chloride  along  with  obligatory losses of sodium and potassium. If the respiratory disorder is treated  with  mechanical  ventilation  and  the  carbon  dioxide tension is reduced rapidly, a profound metabolic alkalosis may result.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressively more binding of calcium to albumin occurs as an alkalosis develops, so the signs and symptoms of alkalosis, especially those related to the neuromuscular and central nervous systems, may be very similar to those of hypocalcemia. Metabolic alkalosis may be accompanied by volume contraction,  hypochloremia  and  hypokalemia,  or  volume  overload and sodium retention, depending on the cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with metabolic acidosis, the diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis  is  dependent  on  a  high  index  of  suspicion  and  laboratory testing. Metabolic alkaloses secondary to chloride losses are associated with low urinary chloride levels (typically <10 mEq/L) and volume contraction. In contrast, metabolic alkaloses  associated  with  mineralocorticoid  excess  are  typically associated with volume overload and spot urine chloride values of more than 20 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volume-depletion  metabolic  alkalosis  is  treated  by  chloride replacement along with fl uid resuscitation using saline, which is itself weakly acidic. If the alkalosis has been caused by  gastric  losses  of  hydrochloric  acid,  then  proton  pump inhibitors can be given to stop the perpetuation of the alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis associated with loop diuretics can be  improved  by  adding  or  substituting  potassium-sparing diuretics.  In  the  case  of  volume-overload  metabolic  alkalosis,  when  excess  mineralocorticoid  is  present,  administration  of  spironolactone  plus  potassium  chloride  may  be useful  if  the  source  of  mineralocorticoid  secretion  cannot be eliminated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia includes judicious volume replacement and adequate supplementation with chloride, potassium, and magnesium as needed. Invasive monitoring may be helpful  in  some  patients.  Care  must  be  taken  not to eliminate a compensatory metabolic alkalosis in patients with  chronic  lung  disease  and  signi fi cant  carbon  dioxide retention,  because  successful  weaning  from  mechanical ventilation  will  likely  necessitate  a  return  to  the  chronic respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis the patient had at presentation.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Total  body  water  content  is  categorized  as  ICF  and  ECF , according to the location of the water relative to cell membranes. Th e distribution and concentration of electrolytes differ greatly between fl uid compartments. Th e electrophysiology of excitable cells is dependent on the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Water  balance  is  predominantly  mediated  by  osmolality sensors, neurons located in the anterior hypothalamus that stimulate thirst and cause pituitary release of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). Vasopressin is stored as granules in the posterior pituitary and acts through G protein-  coupled receptors  in  the  collecting  ducts  of  the  kidney,  causing water retention that in turn corrects serum osmolality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ As  hyponatremia  develops,  it  is  usually  associated  with extracellular  hypotonicity,  which  results  in  water  movement  into  cells  and  can  manifest  as  cerebral  edema  and increased  intracranial  pressure.  Initial  compensation  is a ff orded by the movement of ECF into the cerebrospinal fl uid. Later compensation includes the lowering of intracellular osmolality by the movement of potassium and organic solutes  out  of  brain  cells. Th is  reduces  water  movement into the intracellular space. However, when these adaptive mechanisms fail or hyponatremia progresses, central nervous system manifestations of hyponatremia occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e volume overload, hyponatremia, and hypo-osmolality that may accompany transurethral resection of the prostate is known as TURP syndrome. Th is syndrome is more likely to  occur  when  resection  is  prolonged  (>1  hour),  when the  irrigating fl uid  is  suspended  more  than  40  cm  above the operative fi eld,  and when the pressure in the bladder is allowed to increase above 15 cm H2O. TURP syndrome manifests principally with cardiovascular signs of volume overload and neurologic signs of hyponatremia.

■ Hypokalemia is diagnosed by testing the serum potassium concentration. Th e  di ff erential  diagnosis  requires  determining whether the hypokalemia is acute and secondary to intracellular potassium shi ft s such as might be seen with hyperventilation or alkalosis, or is chronic and associated with depletion of total body potassium stores.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Immediate  treatment  of  hyperkalemia  is  required  if  lifethreatening dysrhythmias or ECG signs of severe hyperkalemia are present. Th is treatment is aimed at antagonizing the  e ff ects  of  a  high  potassium  on  the  transmembrane potential and redistributing the potassium intracellularly. Calcium chloride or calcium gluconate is administered to stabilize  cellular  membranes.  Hyperventilation,  sodium bicarbonate  administration,  and  insulin  administration promote movement of potassium intracellularly.

■ Binding of calcium to albumin is pH dependent, and acidbase disturbances can change the fraction and therefore the concentration  of  ionized  calcium  without  changing  total body calcium. Alkalosis reduces the ionized calcium concentration, so ionized calcium may be signi fi cantly reduced a ft er bicarbonate administration or with hyperventilation.

■ Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia begin to occur at serum levels of 4 to 5 mEq/L and include lethargy, nausea and vomiting, and facial fl ushing. At levels above 6 mEq/L, a loss of deep tendon re fl exes and hypotension occur. Paralysis,  apnea,  and/or cardiac arrest are likely if the magnesium level exceeds 10 mEq/L.

■ Major  adverse  consequences  of  severe  systemic    acidosis (pH  <  7.2)  can  occur  independently  of  whether  the acidosis  is  of  respiratory,  metabolic,  or  mixed  origin. Acidosis decreases myocardial contractility, although clinical  e ff ects  are  minimal until the pH decreases below 7.2, which perhaps re fl ects the e ff ects of catecholamine release in response to the acidosis. When the pH is less than 7.1, cardiac  responsiveness  to  catecholamines  decreases  and compensatory inotropic e ff ects are diminished. Th e detrimental e ff ects of acidosis may be accentuated in those with underlying le ft ventricular dysfunction or myocardial ischemia and in those in whom sympathetic nervous system activity  is  impaired,  such  as  by β -adrenergic blockade or general anesthesia.

decreases  in  serum  ionized  calcium  concentration  contribute  to  the  neurologic  abnormalities  associated  with systemic  alkalosis.  Alkalosis  predisposes  patients,  especially  those  with  co-existing  heart  disease,  to  refractory  ventricular  dysrhythmias.  Alkalosis  also  depresses ventilation.
