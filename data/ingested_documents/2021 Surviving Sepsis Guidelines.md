INTRODUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (1). Sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare problems, impacting millions of people around the world each year and killing between one in three and one in six of those it affects (2-4). Early identification and appropriate management in the initial hours after the development of sepsis improve outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  recommendations  in  this  document  are  intended  to  provide  guidance  for  the  clinician  caring  for  adult  patients  with  sepsis  or  septic  shock in  the  hospital  setting.  Recommendations from these guidelines cannot replace the clinician's decision-making capability when presented with a unique patient's clinical variables. These guidelines are intended to reflect best practice ( Table 1 ).

Screening for Patients With Sepsis and Septic Shock

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis  performance  improvement  programs  generally  consist  of  sepsis screening,  education,  measurement of sepsis  bundle  performance,  patient outcomes, and actions for identified opportunities (25, 26). Despite some inconsistency, a meta-analysis of 50 observational studies on the effect of performance improvement programs showed that these programs were associated with better adherence to sepsis bundles along with a reduction in mortality (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61-0.72) in patients with sepsis and septic

shock (27). The specific components of performance improvement did not appear to be as important as the presence of a program that included sepsis screening and metrics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis screening tools are designed to promote early identification of sepsis and consist of manual methods or automated use of the electronic health record (EHR). There is wide variation in diagnostic accuracy of these tools with most having poor predictive values, although the use of some was associated with improvements in care processes (28-31). A variety of clinical variables and tools are used for sepsis screening, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, vital signs, signs of infection, quick Sequential Organ Failure Score (qSOFA) or Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) criteria, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), or Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) (26, 32). Machine learning may improve performance of screening tools,  and  in  a  meta-analysis  of  42,623  patients  from  seven  studies  for  predicting hospital acquired sepsis the pooled area under the receiving operating curve (SAUROC) (0.89; 95% CI, 0.86-0.92); sensitivity (81%; 95% CI, 80-81), and specificity (72%; 95% CI, 72-72) was higher for machine learning than the SAUROC for traditional screening tools such as SIRS (0.70), MEWS (0.50), and SOFA (0.78) (32).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Screening tools may target patients in various locations, such as in-patient wards, emergency departments, or ICUs (28-30, 32). A pooled analysis of three RCTs did not demonstrate a mortality benefit of active screening (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.51-1.58) (33-35). However, while there is wide variation in sensitivity and specificity of sepsis screening tools, they are an important component of identifying sepsis early for timely intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Standard operating procedures are a set of practices that specify a preferred response  to  specific  clinical  circumstances  (36).  Sepsis  standard  operating procedures, initially specified as Early Goal Directed Therapy have evolved to 'usual care' which includes a standard approach with components of the sepsis bundle, early identification, lactate, cultures, antibiotics, and fluids (37). A large study  examined  the  association  between  implementation  of  state-mandated sepsis  protocols,  compliance,  and  mortality.  A  retrospective  cohort  study  of 1,012,410 sepsis admissions to 509 hospitals in the United States in a retrospective cohort examined mortality before (27 months) and after (30 months) implementation of New York state sepsis regulations, with a concurrent control population from four other states (38). In this comparative interrupted time series, mortality was lower in hospitals with higher compliance with achieving the sepsis bundles successfully.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lower resource countries may experience a different effect. A meta-analysis of two RCTs in Sub-Saharan Africa found higher mortality (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.00-1.58) with standard operating procedures compared with usual care, while it was decreased in one observational study (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]; 95% CI, 0.55-0.98) (39).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend against using qSOFA compared with SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS as a single screening tool for sepsis or septic shock.

Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

Evans et al

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The qSOFA uses three variables to predict death and prolonged  ICU  stay  in  patients  with  known  or  suspected sepsis: a Glasgow Coma Score < 15, a respiratory rate ≥ 22 breaths/min and a systolic blood pressure ≤  100 mm  Hg.  When  any  two  of  these  variables  are present simultaneously, the patient is considered qSOFA positive. Data analysis used to support the recommendations of the Third International Consensus Conference  on  the  Definitions  of  Sepsis  identified qSOFA as a predictor of poor outcome in patients with known or suspected infection, but no analysis was performed to support its use as a screening tool (5). Since that time numerous studies have investigated the potential use of the qSOFA as a screening tool for sepsis (40-42). The results have been contradictory as to its usefulness.  Studies  have  shown  that  qSOFA  is  more specific but less sensitive than having two of four SIRS criteria  for  early  identification  of  infection  induced organ dysfunction (40-43). Neither SIRS nor qSOFA are ideal screening tools for sepsis and the bedside clinician needs to understand the limitations of each. In the original derivation study, authors found that only

<!-- PAGE=? -->
24% of infected patients had a qSOFA score 2 or 3, but these patients accounted for 70% of poor outcomes (5). Similar findings have also been found when comparing against the National Early warning Score (NEWS) and the Modified Early warning Score (MEWS) (44). Although the presence of a positive qSOFA should alert the clinician to the possibility of sepsis in all resource settings; given the poor sensitivity of the qSOFA, the panel issued a strong recommendation against its use as a single screening tool.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults suspected of having sepsis, we suggest measuring blood lactate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  association  of  lactate  level  with  mortality  in patients with suspected infection and sepsis is well established  (45,  46).  Its  use  is  currently  recommended as part of the SSC Hour-1 sepsis bundle for those patients with sepsis (47, 48), and an elevated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
lactate  is  part  of  the  Sepsis-3  definition  of  septic shock  (49).  It  has  been  suggested  that  lactate  can also  be  used  to  screen  for  the  presence  of  sepsis among  undifferentiated  adult  patients  with  clinically suspected (but not confirmed) sepsis. Several studies have assessed the use of lactate in this context (50-52).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The lactate cutoffs determining an elevated level ranged  from  1.6-2.5  mmol/L,  although  diagnostic characteristics were similar regardless of the cutoff. Sensitivities  range  from  66-83%,  with  specificities ranging from 80-85%. Pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios from the three studies are 4.75 and 0.29,  respectively.  Studies  showed  an  association between  the  use  of  point-of-care  lactate  measurements at presentation and reduced mortality; however, the results are inconsistent (53). In summary, the presence of an elevated or normal lactate level significantly increases or decreases, respectively, the likelihood of a final diagnosis of sepsis in patients with suspected sepsis. However, lactate alone is neither sensitive nor specific enough to rule-in or ruleout the diagnosis on its own. Lactate testing may not be  readily  available  in  many  resource-limited  settings (54-61). Therefore, we issued a weak recommendation favoring the use of serum lactate as an adjunctive test to modify the pretest probability of sepsis in patients with suspected but not confirmed sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial Resuscitation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock we suggest that at least 30  mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone. Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Remarks:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dynamic parameters include response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus, using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography, where available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest guiding resuscitation to decrease serum lactate in patients with elevated lactate level, over not using serum lactate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Remarks:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During acute resuscitation, serum lactate level should be interpreted considering the clinical context and other causes of elevated lactate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with septic shock, we suggest using capillary refill time to guide resuscitation as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Timely, effective fluid resuscitation is crucial for the stabilization  of  sepsis-induced  tissue  hypoperfusion in  sepsis  and  septic  shock.  Previous  guidelines  recommend initiating  appropriate  resuscitation  immediately upon recognition of sepsis or septic shock and having a  low  threshold  for  commencing  it  in  those patients where sepsis is not proven but is suspected. Although  the  evidence  stems  from  observational studies,  this  recommendation  is  considered  a  best practice and there are no new data suggesting that a change is needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The 2016 SSC guideline issued a recommendation for using a minimum of 30 mL/kg (ideal body weight) of  IV  crystalloids  in  initial  fluid  resuscitation.  This fixed volume of initial resuscitation was based on observational  evidence  (62).  There  are  no  prospective intervention studies comparing different volumes for initial  resuscitation in sepsis or septic shock. A retrospective analysis of adults presenting to an emergency department with sepsis or septic shock showed that  failure  to  receive  30 mL/kg  of  crystalloid  fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution  of  hypotension  and  increased  length  of stay in ICU, irrespective of comorbidities, including end-stage kidney disease and heart failure (63). In the PROCESS (64), ARISE (65) and PROMISE (66) trials, the average volume of fluid received pre-randomization was also in the range of 30 mL/kg, suggesting that  this  fluid  volume  has  been  adopted  in  routine clinical practice (67).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  patients  require  continued  fluid  administration  following  initial  resuscitation.  Such  administration  needs  to  be  balanced  with  the  risk  of  fluid

<!-- PAGE=? -->
accumulation and potential harm associated with fluid overload, especially prolonged ventilation, progression of acute kidney injury (AKI) and increased mortality. One  of  the  most  important  principles  of  managing complex septic patients is the need for a detailed initial assessment and ongoing re-evaluation of the response to treatment. To avoid over- and under-resuscitation, fluid  administration  beyond  the  initial  resuscitation should  be  guided  by  careful  assessment  of  intravascular volume status and organ perfusion. Heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP) and systolic blood pressure alone are poor indicators of fluid status. Dynamic measures  have  demonstrated  better  diagnostic  accuracy at predicting fluid responsiveness compared with static  techniques.  Dynamic measures include passive leg raising combined with cardiac output (CO) measurement, fluid challenges against stroke volume (SV), systolic  pressure  or  pulse  pressure,  and  increases  of SV in  response  to  changes  in  intrathoracic  pressure. In  a  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis,  dynamic assessment to guide fluid therapy was associated with reduced  mortality  (RR,  0.59;  95%  CI,  0.42  to  0.83), ICU length of stay (MD -1.16 days; 95% CI, -1.97 to -0.36), and duration of mechanical ventilation (-2.98 hours;  95%  CI,  -5.08  to  -0.89)  (3).  However,  in  one other  meta-analysis,  there  was  no  significant  difference in mortality between septic patients resuscitated with a volume responsiveness-guided approach compared with standard resuscitative strategies (68). Most data arise from high income settings and a paucity of evidence  exists  in  resource-limited  settings  to  guide optimal  titration  of  fluid  resuscitation  as  well  as  the appropriate safety endpoints. An RCT in patients with sepsis  and  hypotension in Zambia showed that early protocolized  resuscitation  with  administration  of  IV fluids  guided  by  jugular  venous  pressure,  respiratory rate,  and  arterial  oxygen  saturation  only,  was  associated with significantly more fluid administration in the first 6 hours (median 3.5 L [IQR, 2.7-4.0] versus 2.0 L [IQR, 1.0-2.5]) and higher hospital mortality (48.1% versus 33%) than standard care (69).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If fluid therapy beyond the initial 30 mL/kg administration is required, clinicians may use repeated small boluses guided by objective measures of SV and/or CO. In  post-cardiac  surgery  patients,  fluid  challenges  of 4 mL/kg compared to 1 to 3 mL/kg increased the sensitivity of detecting fluid responders and nonresponders based on measurement of CO (70). In resource-limited regions where measurement of CO or SV may not be possible, a >15% increase in pulse pressure could indicate that the patient is fluid responsive utilizing a passive leg-raise test for 60-90 seconds (71, 72).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serum lactate is an important biomarker of tissue hypoxia and dysfunction, but is not a direct measure of  tissue  perfusion  (73).  Recent  definitions  of  septic shock include increases in lactate as evidence of cellular stress to accompany refractory hypotension (1). Previous iterations of these guidelines have suggested using lactate  levels  as  a  target  of  resuscitation  in  the early phases of sepsis and septic shock, based on earlier studies related to goal-directed therapy and meta-analyses of multiple studies targeting reductions in serum lactate in comparison with 'standard care' or increases in central venous oxygen saturation (74, 75). The panel recognizes  that  normal  serum  lactate  levels  are  not achievable in all patients with septic shock, but these studies  support  resuscitative  strategies  that  decrease lactate toward normal. Serum lactate level should be interpreted considering the clinical context and other causes of elevated lactate. As with sepsis screening, lactate measurement may not always be available in some resource-limited settings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  advanced  hemodynamic  monitoring  is  not available,  alternative  measures  of  organ  perfusion may be used to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of volume administration.  Temperature  of  the  extremities, skin mottling and capillary refill time (CRT) have been validated and shown to be reproducible signs of tissue perfusion (76, 77). The ANDROMEDA-SHOCK study evaluated whether a resuscitation strategy targeting CRT normalization was more effective than a resuscitation strategy aiming at normalization or decreasing lactate levels by 20% every 2 hours in the first 8 hours of septic shock (58). At day 3, the CRT group had significantly less organ dysfunction as assessed by SOFA score (mean SOFA score 5.6 [SD 4.3] versus 6.6 [SD 4.7]; p =  0.045).  Twenty-eight-day  mortality  was 34.9%  in  the  peripheral  perfusion  group  and  43.4% in the lactate group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55-1.02). Despite the absence of a clear effect on mortality, using CRT during resuscitation has physiologic plausibility and  is  easily  performed,  noninvasive,  and  no  cost. However, this approach should be augmented by careful, frequent, and comprehensive patient evaluation to predict or recognize fluid overload early, particularly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
where critical care resources are constrained. Relevant consideration of the background pathology or pathological processes pertinent to the patient should also inform management (69, 78).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mean Arterial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with septic shock on vasopressors, we recommend an initial target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg over higher MAP targets.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAP is  a  key  determinant  of  mean  systemic  filling pressure, which in turn is the major driver of venous return  and  CO.  Increasing  MAP  therefore  usually results  in  increased  tissue  blood  flow  and  augments the supply side of tissue perfusion. While some tissues, such as the brain and kidneys have the ability to autoregulate blood flow, MAPs below a threshold, usually understood to be approximately 60 mm Hg, are associated  with  decreased  organ  perfusion,  which  tracks linearly with MAP (79). Previous SSC guidelines recommended targeting  a  MAP  of  greater  than  65 mm Hg for initial resuscitation. The recommendation was based principally on a RCT in septic shock comparing patients who were given vasopressors to target a MAP of 65-70 mm Hg, versus a target of 80-85 mm Hg (80). This study found no difference in mortality, although a  subgroup  analysis  demonstrated  a  10.5%  absolute reduction  in  renal  replacement  therapy  (RRT)  with higher MAP targets among patients with chronic hypertension.  Additionally,  targeting  higher  MAP  with vasopressors was associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation. A limitation of this study was that the average MAP in both arms exceeded the targeted range. A meta-analysis of two RCTs on this topic supported that higher MAP targets did not improve survival in septic shock (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90-1.23) (81).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  recent  RCT,  monitored  to  ensure  protocol  and MAP target compliance, compared a 'permissive hypotension' (MAP 60-65 mm Hg) group with a 'usual care' group that received vasopressors and MAP targets set by the treating physician in patients aged 65 years and older with septic shock (82, 83). The intervention group in this study achieved a mean MAP of 66.7 mm Hg, compared with 72.6 mm Hg in the usual care group. Among 2,463 analyzed patients, there was significantly less exposure to vasopressors in the intervention  group,  measured  by  duration  of  vasopressor infusion and total vasopressor doses expressed in norepinephrine equivalents. Ninety-day mortality in the permissive  hypotension  and  usual  care  groups  was similar (41.0% vs 43.8%).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the lack of advantage associated with higher MAP  targets  and  the  lack  of  harm  among  elderly patients with MAP targets of 60-65 mm Hg, the panel recommends targeting a MAP of 65 mm Hg in the initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock who require vasopressors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Admission to Intensive Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock who require ICU admission, we suggest admitting the patients to the ICU within 6 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The outcome of critically ill patients depends on timely application of critical care interventions in an appropriate  environment. Outside the ICU, septic patients are typically seen in the emergency department (ED) and hospital wards. Delayed admissions of critically ill patients from ED are associated with decreased sepsis bundle compliance and increased mortality, ventilator duration,  and  ICU  and  hospital  length  of  stay  (84). Data on the optimal time for transfer to the ICU stem from observational studies and registry databases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  an  observational  study  of  401  ICU  patients, authors reported an increase in ICU mortality of 1.5% for each hour delay of ED to ICU transfer (85). A retrospective  observational  study  of  14,788  critically  ill patients in the Netherlands showed a higher hospital mortality for the higher ED to ICU time quintiles (2.43.7 hr  and > 3.7 hr) compared with the lowest ED to ICU time quintile (< 1.2hr) (86). When adjusted for severity of illness, an ED to ICU time > 2.4 hr was associated with increased hospital mortality in patients with higher illness severity (ORs of 1.20 [95% CI, 1.031.39]). Patients with sepsis were not studied separately.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another study evaluated 50,322 ED patients admitted  to  120  US  ICUs  (87).  Mortality  increased  when ED stay exceeded 6 hours (17% vs 12.9%, p < 0.001).

Evans et al

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Among  hospital  survivors,  the  delayed  admission group had a longer hospital stay, higher mortality, and higher rates of mechanical ventilation and central venous catherization. Similarly, another study of 12,380 ward patients in 48 hospitals in the United Kingdom showed  that  (88)  delayed  admission  to  ICU  led  to higher  90-day  mortality  and  further  physiological deterioration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Based on existing data, timely admission of critically ill patients to an ICU environment may result in better patient outcomes. There is also evidence of improved patient satisfaction, increased patient safety, better patient flow and improved staff morale (89). However, although critical care services are likely best delivered in an ICU environment, there are multiple reasons why immediate transfer of critically ill patients with sepsis to an ICU may not always be possible, in particular in lower-  and  middle-income  countries  (LMIC),  where ICU bed availably can be limited. In this case, regular assessment, evaluation, and  appropriate treatment should not be delayed, independent of patient location.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INFECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis of Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
11. For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock but unconfirmed infection, we recommend continuously re-evaluating and searching for alternative diagnoses and discontinuing empiric antimicrobials if an alternative cause of illness is demonstrated or strongly suspected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  previous  versions  of  these  guidelines,  we  highlighted  the  importance  of  obtaining  a  full  screen  for infectious agents prior to starting antimicrobials wherever it is possible to do so in a timely fashion (12, 13). As  a  best  practice  statement,  we  recommended  that appropriate routine microbiologic cultures (including blood) should be obtained before starting antimicrobial therapy in patients with suspected sepsis and septic shock if it results in no substantial delay in the start of antimicrobials (i.e., < 45 min). This recommendation has  not  been  updated  in  this  version  but  remains  as valid as before.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The signs and symptoms of sepsis are nonspecific and  often  mimic  multiple  other  diseases  (90-92).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because there is no 'gold standard' test to diagnose sepsis, the bedside provider cannot have a differential diagnosis of sepsis alone in a patient with organ dysfunction. Indeed, a third or more of patients initially diagnosed with sepsis turn out to have noninfectious conditions  (90,  93,  94).  Best  practice  is  to  continually assess the patient to determine if other diagnoses are more or less likely, especially because a patient's clinical trajectory can evolve significantly after hospital  admission,  increasing  or  decreasing  the  likelihood of a diagnosis of sepsis. With this uncertainty, there  can  be  significant  challenges  in  determining when it is 'appropriate' to de-escalate or discontinue antibiotics.

Another major challenge is implementing a system that reminds clinicians to focus on the fact that the patient is still receiving antibiotics each day, especially as providers rotate in and out of the care team. Systems that promote such reassessment by automatic stop orders, electronic prompts, or mandatory check lists all seem useful in theory, but each has disadvantages in terms of provider acceptance or assuring that providers thoughtfully assess the need for antibiotics rather than checking a box in the electronic record or reflexively acknowledging a prompt, without considering its underlying rationale (95).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We did not identify any direct or indirect evidence assessing  this  important  issue.  Thus,  clinicians  are strongly  encouraged  to  discontinue  antimicrobials if  a  non-infectious  syndrome (or an infectious syndrome that does not benefit from antimicrobials) is demonstrated  or  strongly  suspected.  Since  this  situation  is  not  always  apparent,  continued  reassessment of the patient should optimize the chances of infected patients receiving antimicrobial therapy and non-infected  patients  avoiding  therapy  that  is  not indicated.

For adults with possible sepsis without shock, we recommend rapid assessment of the likelihood of infectious versus non-infectious causes of acute illness. Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Remarks:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rapid assessment includes history and clinical examination, tests for both infectious and non-infectious causes of acute illness and immediate treatment for acute conditions that can mimic sepsis. Whenever possible this should be completed within 3 hours of presentation so that a decision can be made as to the likelihood of an infectious cause of the patient's presentation and timely antimicrobial therapy provided if the likelihood of sepsis is thought to be high.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with possible sepsis without shock, we suggest a time-limited course of rapid investigation and if concern for infection persists, the administration of antimicrobials within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized.

Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  administration  of  appropriate  antimicrobials is  one  of  the  most  effective  interventions  to  reduce mortality  in  patients  with  sepsis  (96-98).  Delivering antimicrobials to patients with sepsis or septic shock should therefore be treated as an emergency. The imperative to provide antimicrobials as early as possible, however, must be balanced against the potential harms associated  with  administering  unnecessary  antimicrobials to patients without infection (99, 100). These include  a  range  of  adverse  events  such  as  allergic  or hypersensitivity reactions, kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, Clostridioides  difficile infection,  and  antimicrobial  resistance  (101-106).  Accurately  diagnosing sepsis  is  challenging  as  sepsis  can  present  in  subtle ways,  and  some  presentations  that  first  appear  to  be sepsis turn out to be noninfectious conditions (90, 93, 107,  108).  Evaluating  the  likelihood  of  infection  and severity of illness for each patient with suspected sepsis should inform the necessity and urgency of antimicrobials (99, 100).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The mortality reduction associated with early antimicrobials  appears  strongest  in  patients  with  septic shock, where studies have reported a strong association between time to antibiotics and death in patients with septic shock but weaker associations in patients without septic shock (98, 109, 110). In a study of 49,331 patients treated at 149 New York hospitals, each additional hour of time from ED arrival to administration of  antimicrobials  was  associated  with  1.04  increased odds of in-hospital mortality, p < 0.001 (1.07 (95% CI, 1.05-1.09) for patients receiving vasopressors vs. 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.04) for patients not on vasopressors) (98).  In  a  study  of  35,000  patients  treated  at  Kaiser Permanente Northern California, each additional hour of time from ER arrival to administration of antimicrobials  was  associated  with  1.09  increased  odds  of in-hospital  mortality  (1.07  for  patients  with  'severe' sepsis [lactate ≥ 2, at least one episode of hypotension, required noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation  or  has  organ  dysfunction]  and  1.14  for  patients with septic shock); which equated to a 0.4% absolute mortality increase for 'severe' sepsis and a 1.8% absolute increase for septic shock (110). Finally, in a study of 10,811 patients treated in four Utah hospitals, each hour delay in time from ED arrival to administration of  antimicrobials  was  associated  with  1.16  increased odds of in-hospital and 1.10 increased odds of 1-year mortality (1.13 in patients with hypotension vs 1.09 in patients  without  hypotension)  (111).  Other  studies, however, did not observe an association between antimicrobial  timing  and  mortality  (112-117).  It  should be noted that all the aforementioned studies were observational  analyses  and  hence  at  risk  of  bias  due  to insufficient  sample  size,  inadequate  risk  adjustment, blending together the effects of large delays until antibiotics with short delays, or other study design issues (118).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with sepsis without shock, the association between time to antimicrobials and mortality within the first few hours from presentation is less consistent (98, 110). Two RCTs have been published (119, 120); one failed to achieve a difference in time-to-antimicrobials between arms (120) and the other found no significant difference in mortality despite a 90-minute difference in  median  time  interval  to  antimicrobial  administration (119). Observational studies do, however, suggest that  mortality  may  increase  after  intervals  exceeding 3-5 hours from hospital arrival and/or sepsis recognition (98, 111, 119, 120). We therefore suggest initiating antibiotics in patients with possible sepsis without shock as soon as sepsis appears to be the most likely diagnosis, and no later than 3 hours after sepsis was first suspected if concern for sepsis persists at that time.

Overall,  given  the  high  risk  of  death  with  septic shock and the strong association of antimicrobial timing and mortality, the panel issued a strong recommendation to administer antimicrobials immediately, and within one hour, in all patients with potential septic shock. Additionally, for patients with confirmed/very likely sepsis, we recommend antimicrobials be administered immediately ( Figure 1 ). For patients with possible  sepsis  without  shock,  we  recommend  a  rapid assessment of infectious and noninfectious etiologies of illness be undertaken to determine, within 3 hours, whether antibiotics should be administered or whether antibiotics  should  be  deferred  while  continuing  to monitor the patient closely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Limited  data  from  resource-limited  settings  suggest that timely administration of antimicrobials in patients with sepsis and septic shock is beneficial and potentially feasible (121-126). Access and availability of a wide range of antimicrobials in such settings may however vary (54, 55, 57, 59, 61). The availability and turnaround time for laboratory testing, rapid infectious diagnostic, imaging, etc. varies widely by regions and settings. As such, the rapid  assessment  of  infectious  and  non-infectious  etiologies  of  illness  will  differ  across  settings,  depending on what is feasible to achieve. Recent recommendations pertaining to the use of antimicrobials in patients with sepsis and septic shock in resource-limited settings are in line with the current recommendations (123).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Procalcitonin  is  undetectable  in  healthy  states,  but rises rapidly in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, especially  bacterial  infections  (127).  In  theory,  procalcitonin levels in combination with clinical evaluation may facilitate the diagnosis of serious bacterial infections and prompt early initiation of antimicrobials. In a meta-analysis of 30 studies (3,244 patients), procalcitonin  had  a  pooled  sensitivity  of  77%  and specificity  of  79%  for  sepsis  in  critically  ill  patients (128).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We identified direct evidence from three RCTs that compared  procalcitonin-guided  protocols  for  antibiotic initiation vs usual care (129-131). A meta-analysis of the three trials ( n =  1,769 ICU patients) found no difference in short-term mortality (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.15), length of ICU stays (MD, 0.19 days; 95% CI, -0.98 to 1.36) or length of hospitalization (MD, 7.00 days; 95% CI, -26.24 to 12.24).

Antimicrobial Choice

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock at high risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), we recommend using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage over using antimicrobials without MRSA coverage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock at low risk of MRSA, we suggest against using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage, as compared with using antimicrobials without MRSA coverage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The decision on whether to include an antibiotic active against  MRSA  in  an  empiric  treatment  regimen  for sepsis and septic shock depends upon 1) the likelihood that the patient's infection is caused by MRSA; 2) the risk of harm associated with withholding treatment for MRSA in a patient with MRSA; and 3) the risk of harm associated with MRSA treatment in a patient without MRSA.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MRSA accounts for approximately 5% of culturepositive infections among critically ill patients (133), and  may  be  decreasing  according  to  some  reports (134, 135). The incidence of MRSA varies, however, by  region  (ranging  from  ~2%  in  Western  Europe to  10%  in  North  America)  and  by  patient-related characteristics  (133,  136,  137).  Patient-related  risk factors  for  MRSA  include  prior  history  of  MRSA infection or colonization, recent IV antibiotics, history of recurrent skin infections or chronic wounds, presence  of  invasive  devices,  hemodialysis,  recent hospital  admissions  and  severity  of  illness  (136, 138-142).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Observational  data  on  the  impact  of  including MRSA coverage in empiric regimens vary. Some studies  focus  on  patients  with  documented MRSA infections,  while  others  evaluate  the  impact  of  MRSA coverage in undifferentiated patients. Among patients with documented MRSA infections, delays of > 24-48 hours  until  antibiotic  administration  are  associated with  increased  mortality  in  some  studies  (143-147), but not in others (148-154). Among undifferentiated patients  with  pneumonia  or  sepsis,  broad-spectrum regimens including agents active against MRSA were associated  with  higher  mortality,  particularly  among patients without MRSA (137, 151, 155, 156). The undesirable  effects  associated  with  unnecessary  MRSA coverage are also supported by studies showing an association between early discontinuation of MRSA coverage  and  better  outcomes  in  patients  with  negative nares  or  bronchoalveolar  lavage  (BAL)  MRSA  PCR (157-159).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Failure to cover for MRSA in a patient with MRSA may be harmful, but unnecessary MRSA coverage in a patient without MRSA may also be harmful. Data from RCTs, including the evaluation of nasal swab testing to withhold therapy for MRSA, are warranted, and studies  on  rapid  diagnostic  tools  and  clinical  prediction rules for MRSA are needed.

Rationale

Considering the increasing frequency of MDR bacteria in many parts of the world and associations between delays in active therapy and worse outcomes, the initial use of multidrug therapy is often required to ensure the empiric regimen includes at least one effective agent that is active against the offending organism (12, 13). In  the  empiric  phase-before  causative  agent(s)  and susceptibilities are known, the optimal choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the local prevalence of resistant organisms, patient risk factors for resistant organisms, and  the  severity  of  illness.  In  the  directed/targeted phase, once causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are

<!-- PAGE=? -->
known,  sustained  double  gram-negative  coverage  is rarely  necessary  except  for  patients  with  highly  resistant organisms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This  was  borne  out  in  a  recent  systematic  review with meta-analysis of 10 RCTs, no differences in mortality  or  other  patient-important  outcomes  between empiric mono- vs. combination antibiotic therapy in adult ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were observed, also when taking disease severity into consideration  (160).  Results  from  the  largest  RCT included in the meta-analysis (a comparison of sustained  courses  of  moxifloxacin  and  meropenem  vs meropenem  alone  in  a  low  endemic  resistance  setting) were consistent with the findings from the metaanalysis (161).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations  about  the  use  of  more  than one  gram-negative  agent  for  empiric  treatment  over one  gram-negative  agent  are  challenging  given  clinical  heterogeneity,  including  patient  characteristics, source of infection, causative agents, and antibiotic resistance patterns. Local information about the resistance patterns of the most common causative agents of sepsis is essential to choose the most appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy. For this reason, we refrained from  proposing  recommendations  regarding  double gram-negative  coverage  in  patients  with  sepsis  or septic shock overall, but instead recommend tailoring the use of double coverage based on patients' risk of MDR  pathogens.  Factors  to  guide  this  decision  include:  proven  infection  or  colonization  with  antibiotic-resistant  organisms  within  the  preceding  year, local prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms, hospital-acquired/healthcare-associated (versus community-  acquired  infection),  broad-spectrum  antibiotic use within the preceding 90 days, concurrent use selective digestive decontamination (SDD), travel to a highly endemic country within the preceding 90 days (see  https://resistancemap.cddep.org/)  and  hospitalization abroad within the preceding 90 days (162-164). In the directed/targeted phase, once causative agent(s) and susceptibilities are known, sustained double gram-negative  coverage  is  not  necessary  except  possibly for patients with highly resistant organisms with no proven safe and efficacious therapeutic option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall quality of evidence was very low, and the direct costs of antibiotics can increase with the routine use of multiple agents for treatment. This may specifically have an impact in resource-limited settings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In general, in patients at high risk for MDR organisms, we suggest using two gram negative agents for empiric  treatment  to  increase  the  likelihood  of  adequate coverage,  while  in  patients  with  a  low  risk  for  MDR organisms, we suggest using a single agents for empiric treatment, as there are no apparent benefits of using two agents and the a risk of antimicrobial-associated undesirable  effects,  including  direct  toxicity, Clostridioides difficile infection and development of antibiotic resistance (165). Empiric double coverage of gram-negative bacilli is most important in patients at high risk for resistant organisms with severe illness, particularly septic shock.

For adults with sepsis or septic shock at low risk of fungal infection, we suggest against empiric use of antifungal therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis  and  septic  shock  due  to  fungi  are  most  commonly observed in ICUs and are associated with poor outcomes (166-170). Some observational studies suggested  that  prompt  initiation  of  appropriate  empiric antifungal  therapy  may  be  associated  with  a  reduction in mortality, however these studies do not prove a  causal  relationship between antifungal therapy and outcome, nor do they clarify the role of timing of treatment, and some other studies have failed to show this association (167, 171-173).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  an  updated  meta-analysis  of  empiric  antifungal  therapy versus no antifungal therapy in adult critically ill patients, no  difference  in  short-term  mortality  was  observed.  In the largest and most recent RCT-EMPIRICUS-there was also no difference in outcome between patients receiving empiric antifungal therapy (micafungin) and patients receiving placebo (174). The overall quality of evidence was low, and treatment with empiric antifungals may be associated with increased costs.

may,  for  example  patients  with  febrile  neutropenia who fail  to  defervesce  after  4-7  days  of  broad-spectrum  antibacterial  therapy  are  at  increased  risk  of having  fungal  disease  ( Table  2 )  (175,  176).  The  risk of Candida sepsis or septic shock for other immunosuppressed populations is highly disease- and therapyspecific.  Importantly,  the  decision  to  start  empiric antifungal therapy depends on the type and number of  risk  factors,  along  with  the  local  epidemiology  of fungal infections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accordingly,  we  suggest  using  empiric  antifungal therapy  in  patients  at  high  risk  of  fungal  infection, while we suggest avoiding this if the risk is low. The choice of antifungal agent for empiric therapy depends on multiple issues including host factors, prior colonization and infection, prior exposure to prophylactic or therapeutic antifungal therapy, comorbidities, and the toxicities and drug interactions of the therapeutic options.

Antiviral Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Viral infections encompass a broad spectrum of pathogens and diseases in humans but-apart from specific clinical  situations  such  as  epidemics/pandemics-are rarely the primary cause of sepsis. In a recent large international point prevalence study, viruses were documented in less than 4% of infections (133).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Historically,  influenza  has  been  one  of  the  more common viral causes of sepsis. However, it is unclear to what extent the primary viral infection as opposed to  bacterial  pneumonia  co-infection  is  the  cause  of organ dysfunction in these patients (219-222). More recently,  SARS-CoV-2  (causing  COVID-19)  is  now responsible  for  many  cases  of  infection  and  sepsis (223). The ongoing pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the understanding of this condition changing very rapidly (224).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
While there appears to be no overall effect of neuraminidase inhibitors on mortality in patients with influenza-related pneumonia, there may be an effect when administered early in the course of the disease (225).

Immunocompromised patients are particularly vulnerable to viral infections, including patients with neutropenia,  human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV) infection, hematological malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or solid organ transplants; in  these  patients  herpes  simplex  virus,  Epstein-Barr, virus, cytomegalovirus, and respiratory viruses such as adenoviruses, can cause severe disease (229). Tropical and  subtropical  regions  have  endemic  and  epidemic outbreaks of zoonotic viral infections including those caused by Dengue, Ebola, Lassa, Marburg, Sin Nombre, and Chikungunya virus. Many of these can manifest with clinical signs of sepsis, particularly in their early stages.  Unfortunately,  effective  therapies  are  lacking for most of these viruses.

The desirable effects of empiric antiviral therapy are unknown, and as for other antimicrobial agents there is a risk of undesirable effects (165). Data on cost effectiveness were not available.

Due to the rapidly changing position related to antiviral therapies in critically ill patients presenting with several acute respiratory failure, this panel decided not to issue a recommendation on antiviral therapies and to refer the reader to more specific guidelines (226).

Delivery of Antibiotics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using prolonged infusion of beta-lactams for maintenance (after an initial bolus) over conventional bolus infusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Beta-lactam antibiotics may be subject to changes in important pharmacokinetic parameters in the setting of sepsis and septic shock resulting in sub-therapeutic concentrations (230, 231). As opposed to conventional intermittent infusion (infusion ≤ 30 minutes), administration  by  prolonged  IV  infusion,  either  as  an  extended infusion (antibiotic infused over at least half of the dosing interval) or as a continuous infusion, results in  sustained  beta-lactam  concentrations  which  align with the pharmacodynamics of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two  meta-analyses  reported  similar  results  supporting reduced short-term mortality (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.87) with prolonged infusion of beta-lactams

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(232,  233).  No  trials  assessed  the  undesirable  effects of continuous infusion, and the desirable effects were deemed important, while the overall quality of evidence was moderate. Prolonged infusion is a feasible intervention if suitable IV access is present, and resources are available to ensure the beta-lactam is infused over the necessary duration. The latter may be an issue in some resource limited settings, including LMICs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of a loading dose of antibiotic before prolonged infusion is essential to avoid delays to achieving  effective  beta-lactam  concentrations  (234). Over the course of therapy, both extended and continuous  infusions  will  occupy  a  venous  catheter/lumen more than an intermittent infusion and drug-stability and  drug-drug  compatibility  considerations  are  important to ensure effectiveness of antibiotic and other IV drug therapies (235).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  reduction  in  short-term  mortality  from  prolonged infusion of beta-lactams is significant with the intervention being feasible with negligible cost implications and no data suggesting inferior outcomes with prolonged infusion. Accordingly, we suggest prolonged infusion  of  beta-lactams  over  conventional  bolus  infusion in patients with sepsis and septic shock if the necessary equipment is available. Further research is needed on long-term outcomes, on the effect on emergence of antimicrobial resistance, and on costs of prolonged versus bolus infusion of beta-lactams (236).

Antibiotics are subject to changes in PK/PD parameters in sepsis and septic shock where resultant concentrations may be too low risking clinical failure, or too high leading to toxicity ( Table 3 ) (237-239). Augmented renal clearance  (240),  AKI  (241),  hypoalbuminemia  (242),  RRT (243, 244), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (245, 246) are examples of common scenarios that affect the concentrations of some antibiotics.

PD principles and using dosing regimens developed in patients with sepsis and septic shock is more likely to result in effective and safe drug concentrations compared to use of dosing recommendations provided in the manufacturer's product information (247).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We did not identify any relevant data quantifying the value of dosing based on PK/PD principles in adults with sepsis and septic shock. Although there are no data on this topic directly derived from adults with sepsis and septic shock, data from a broader patient population, critically ill patients, support an increased likelihood of achieving effective and safe antibiotic concentrations when applying PK/PD principles to dosing (248). The application of PK/PD principles can be aided by clinical  pharmacists (249). Some studies in critically ill patients have reported benefits in terms of clinical cure (237, 250-253).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Applying  a  PK/PD  approach  to  antibiotic  dosing requires  support  from  knowledgeable  clinician  team members  (254),  use  of  a  patient  population-specific guideline  document  (255),  use  of  therapeutic  drug monitoring (256), and/or use of dosing software (238, 248). Some of these potential approaches to application of PK/PD-based dosing require extra resources, some of which may not be available in all settings, in which case  freely  available  resources  such  as  dosing  nomograms can be used (234, 257, 258). Guidance on how to  apply  a  PK/PD  approach  for  specific  drug  classes have  been  described  elsewhere  (237).  Additional  research  is  needed  on  short-  and  long-term  mortality outcomes, effect on emergence of antimicrobial resistance, impact on drug stability within prolonged infusions, and health economics of different PK/PD-based approaches  to  dosing.

Source  control  may  include  drainage  of  an  abscess, debriding infected necrotic tissue, removal of a potentially infected device, or definitive control of a source of  ongoing  microbial  contamination  (262).  Foci  of infection  readily  amenable  to  source  control  include intra-abdominal  abscesses,  gastrointestinal  perforation,  ischemic  bowel  or  volvulus,  cholangitis,  cholecystitis, pyelonephritis associated with obstruction or abscess,  necrotizing  soft  tissue  infection,  other  deep space infection (e.g., empyema or septic arthritis), and implanted device infections (262).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Source control of infectious foci was associated with improved  survival  in  recent  observational  and  cluster randomized  studies  (120,  263,  264).  Source  control should be achieved as soon as possible following initial resuscitation  (265,  266).  While  there  are  limited  data to  conclusively  issue  a  recommendation  regarding  the timeframe in which source control should be obtained, smaller studies suggest that source control within 6 to 12 hours is advantageous (265-271). Studies generally show reduced survival beyond that point. The failure to show benefit  with  source  control  implemented  in  less  than 6  hours  may be a consequence of the limited number of  patients  and  the  heterogeneity  of  the  intervention. Therefore,  any  required  source  control  intervention  in sepsis and septic shock should ideally be implemented as soon as medically and logistically practical after the diagnosis is made (120). Clinical experience suggests that without adequate source control, many severe presentations will not stabilize or improve despite rapid resuscitation and provision of appropriate antimicrobials. In view of this fact, prolonged efforts at medical stabilization in lieu of source control for severely ill patients, particularly those with septic shock, are generally not advised (272).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  selection  of  optimal  source  control  methods must weigh the benefits  and  risks  of  the  specific  intervention, the patient's preference, clinician's  expertise,  availability,  risks  of  the  procedure,  potential delays, and the probability of the procedure's success. In general, the least invasive option that will effectively achieve source control should be pursued. Open surgical  intervention  should  be  considered  when  other interventional approaches are inadequate or cannot be provided in a timely fashion. Surgical exploration may also be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists despite radiologic evaluation, when the probability of success with a percutaneous procedure is uncertain, or when the undesirable effects of a failed procedure are high. Logistic factors unique to each institution, such as surgical or interventional staff availability, may also play a role in the decision. Future research is needed to investigate the optimal timing and method of source control in patients with sepsis and septic shock with a source of infection amenable to drainage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
28. For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend prompt removal of intravascular access devices that are a possible source of sepsis or septic shock after other vascular access has been established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Removal of a potentially infected intravascular access device is considered a part of adequate source control (262). An intravascular device suspected to be a source of sepsis should be removed after establishing another site for vascular access and following successful initial resuscitation (265,  266).  In  the  absence  of  septic  shock  or  fungemia, some  implanted  tunneled  catheter  infections  may  be treated  effectively  with  prolonged  antimicrobial  therapy if removal of the catheter is not practical (273). However, catheter removal with adequate antimicrobial therapy is definitive and is the preferred treatment in most cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We identified one relevant RCT (274) and two observational studies (275, 276). There was no evidence of a difference in mortality, however, the studies were hampered by significant limitations, including risk of confounding by indication (the observational studies) and imprecision (the RCT), which is why the results should  be  interpreted  cautiously.  The  quality  of  evidence was very low.

of therapy are therefore important strategies in patients with sepsis and septic shock (165). This is particularly relevant in empiric therapy where broad-spectrum therapy is recommended, as the causative pathogen has not yet been identified. Once both the pathogen(s) and susceptibilities  are  known,  antimicrobial  de-escalation-i.e., stopping  an  antimicrobial  that  is  no  longer  necessary (in case of combination therapy) or changing an antimicrobial to narrow the spectrum is encouraged. Given the  adverse  societal  and  individual  risks  to  continued unnecessary  antimicrobial  therapy,  thoughtful  de-escalation  of  antimicrobials  based  on  adequate  clinical improvement is appropriate even if cultures are negative. Early discontinuation of all antimicrobial therapy if infection is ruled out is advisable (277). Antimicrobial de-escalation should ideally be done as soon as possible, and rapid diagnostic techniques may facilitate this.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We  identified  direct  evidence  from  13  studies (1,968  patients)  (277),  including  one  RCT  (278).  In our meta-analysis, we observed improved short-term mortality in patients who were de-escalated (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.91) (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 2).  Long-term  mortality  was  evaluated  in one study only and did not demonstrate a difference (RR,  0.99;  95%  CI,  0.64  to  1.52).  De-escalation  was associated with shorter length of stay in the hospital (MD -5.56 days; 95% CI, -7.68 to -3.44), but not in the ICU (MD -2.6 days; 95% CI, -5.91 to 0.72).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most studies were observational, and there are concerns that de-escalation is used primarily in patients who  are  getting  better,  which  is  why  the  reported improved short-term mortality should be interpreted with caution (277, 279).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
De-escalation  is  in  generally  safe,  may  offer  cost savings when  unnecessary  antibiotics are  discontinued,  and  reduced  risk  of  antimicrobial  resistance and reduced toxicity and side-effects may be important (280). Based on the overall very low quality of evidence, RCTs are warranted along with more studies on antimicrobial resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Duration of Antibiotics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
30. For adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest using shorter over longer duration of antimicrobial therapy. Weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Restricting antimicrobial therapy to the shortest course  associated  with  better  outcomes  is  an  important part of antimicrobial stewardship (281-285). The optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for a given patient with sepsis or septic shock depends on many factors, including host, microbe, drug, and anatomical site (Table 2) (99, 100).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  have  been  considerable  efforts  over  the past two decades to clarify the optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy by comparing 'short' courses with  traditional  ('longer')  courses.  There  are  data from  RCTs  in  specific  conditions  such  as  pneumonia  (286-289),  urinary  tract  infections  (290), bacteremia  (291,  292),  and  intraabdominal  infections (293). In many of the trials, the shorter course was just as effective as the longer course but associated  with  fewer  adverse  consequences.  Very  few trials,  however,  focused  exclusively  on  critically  ill patients with sepsis or septic shock, and the overall quality of evidence was very low.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given  the  lack  of  definitive  and  generalizable data  regarding  the  optimal  duration  of  therapy  for patients who are critically ill, it is not surprising that there  is  considerably  practice  variation  (281,  294). Specialist consultation appears to be associated with improved  patient  outcomes  for  a  variety  of  infectious syndromes (295-300). This has generally been ascribed to improvements in microbial appropriateness of the empiric antimicrobial regimen provided. However, it is also possible that reducing the duration of unnecessary therapy may account for at least part of the benefit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thus, for adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest a shorter course of antibiotics, as this is less costly, has fewer undesirable effects without impacting adversely on outcomes (Table 4).

Recommendation

31. For adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control where optimal duration of therapy is unclear, we suggest using procalcitonin AND clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials over clinical evaluation alone.

TABLE 4. Planned Duration of Empirical Antimicrobial Therapy in RCTs of Shorter vs Longer Duration of Therapy According to Clinical Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Shorter durations of antimicrobial therapy are in general  recommended;  however,  critically  ill  patients often receive antimicrobials for more days than necessary  (288,  301,  306).  While  typically  clinical  evaluation  alone  is  used  to  decide  duration,  biomarkers could offer additional information. C-reactive protein is  often  used  in  this  regard.  Procalcitonin  has  been studied most extensively both in critically ill and noncritically ill patients, both for initiation and discontinuation of therapy (307).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We identified  direct  evidence  from  14  RCTs  ( n = 4,499  patients)  that  assessed  use  of  procalcitonin  to guide  antimicrobial  treatment  duration  in  patients with  sepsis  (two  trials  included  critically  ill  patients in general)  (308-321).  A  meta-analysis  suggested improved  mortality  in  patients  who  were  managed using procalcitonin versus control (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99), while there was no effect on length of stay in  ICU  or  hospital.  Antibiotic  exposure  was  consistently lower in patients who were managed with procalcitonin  and  clinical  evaluation,  however,  in  many trials the total duration of therapy was still 7 days or longer in the intervention group. Also, the algorithms for  antimicrobial  therapy,  frequency  of  procalcitonin monitoring and the thresholds (or percentage change in  procalcitonin  concentration)  for  discontinuation differed across the trials. Therefore, the overall quality of evidence was judged to be low.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The undesirable effects of using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials are considered minimal, and do not outweigh the potential benefits (322). Limited data on the cost-effectiveness are available, although a single-center study reported decreased hospital costs associated with  PCT-guided  antibiotic  in  medical  ICU  patient with undifferentiated sepsis (323). Procalcitonin testing may not be available in all countries and healthcare settings, including LMICs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, we suggest using procalcitonin along with clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if procalcitonin is available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid  therapy  is  a  key  part  of  the  resuscitation  of sepsis and septic shock. Crystalloids have the advantage  of  being  inexpensive  and  widely  available.  The absence of clear benefit following the administration of colloids compared to crystalloid solutions supports the use of crystalloid solutions in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis and septic shock (324). The optimal fluid remains a subject of debate. For decades, the  administration  of  normal  saline  solution  (0.9% sodium chloride) has been common practice (325), but potential adverse effects that include hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, renal vasoconstriction, increased cytokine secretion and concern about acute kidney injury (AKI) have led to increased interest in chloride-restrictive solutions, known as balanced or buffered  solutions  (326-330).  Subsequently,  a  network meta-analysis of 14 RCTs of patients with sepsis showed in an indirect comparison that balanced crystalloids  were  associated  with  decreased  mortality, compared to saline (331).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There have been a number of recent RCTs assessing  the  question  of  which  crystalloid  may  be  most beneficial  in  patients  with  sepsis.  In  the  SPLIT  multicenter, double-blinded clinical trial, the comparison between balanced solutions and normal saline yielded no differences in mortality or AKI (332). The modest volume of infused fluid, the predominance of surgical patients, and the low number of septic patients (4%) precludes  generalizability  of  the  results.  In  2016,  the SALT pilot  trial  ( n =  974)  compared  balanced  solutions versus normal saline; with septic patients comprising  25%  and  28%  of  the  population,  respectively (333).  The  primary  outcome,  a  composite  outcome including  mortality,  new  RRT  or  persistent  renal dysfunction  (major  adverse  kidney  event  within  30 days,  MAKE30), was similar between groups (24.6% vs.  24.7%).  Subsequently,  the  SMART  trial  was  published  in  2018,  a  single-center,  multiple-crossover study including 15,802 patients who received balanced solutions or normal saline, alternating on a monthly basis (334). In the pre-specified subgroup of patients admitted with sepsis in all participating ICUs, 30-day mortality was lower in those receiving balanced solutions, compared to normal saline (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.94). Likewise, in a secondary analysis including only the 1,641 patients admitted to medical ICUs with a diagnosis of sepsis, balanced solutions were associated with reduced 30-day hospital mortality (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93) and MAKE30, and increased vasopressor- and RRT-free days (335).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The SMART trial was a single-center study without individual  patient  randomization  and  no  blinded assignment  of  the  intervention,  it  exposed  participants to moderate amount of fluid volume, identification of sepsis subgroups was based on ICD-10 codes, and  it  used  a  composite  outcome  which  may  not be  as  relevant  as  a  patient-centered  outcome  (336). However, the use of balanced solutions in sepsis may be  associated  with  improved  outcomes  compared with  chloride-rich  solutions.  No  cost-effectiveness studies compared balanced and unbalanced crystalloid  solutions.  Therefore,  we  considered  the  desirable and undesirable consequences to favor balanced solutions, but as the quality of the evidence is low, we issued  a  weak  recommendation.  Two  ongoing  large RCTs will provide additional data and inform future guideline updates (337, 338).

Although  albumin  is  theoretically  more  likely  to maintain oncotic pressure than crystalloids (339), it is more costly and there is no clear benefit with its routine use. Since the publication of the 2016 guidelines (12),

two  single-center  trials  and  two  meta-analyses  have been  published  on  this  topic  (324,  340-342).  A Cochrane review including RCTs with 12,492 patients comparing albumin versus crystalloids found no difference  in  30-day  (RR,  0.98;  95%  CI,  0.92-1.04)  or 90-day  mortality  (RR,  0.98;  95%  CI,  0.92-1.04)  or need  for  RRT  between  groups  (RR,  1.11;  95%  CI, 0.96-1.27) (324). This meta-analysis included patients with critical illness, and while the main solution included  in  the  analysis  was  albumin,  some  studies in  other  analyses  included  fresh  frozen  plasma.  A second  meta-analysis,  which  also  included  critically ill  patients, found lower static filling pressures (MD, -2.3 cm  H 2 O;  95%  CI,  3.02-1.05)  and  mean  arterial pressure (MAP) (MD, -3.53 mmHg; 95% CI, -6.71 to -0.36) with crystalloid use, but no difference in mortality  at  28  days  (RR,  1.0;  95%  CI,  0.92-1.10)  or  90 days (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.76-2.29) (340). The largest clinical  trial  in  sepsis,  the  ALBIOS  trial  comparing a  combination  of  albumin  and  crystalloids  to  crystalloids  alone  in  1,818  patients  with  sepsis  or  septic shock did not demonstrate a difference in 28-day (RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.87-1.14) or 90-day mortality (RR, 0.94; 95%  CI,  0.85-1.05)  (339).  Of  note,  in  this  trial,  albumin was given as a 20% solution, with a treatment goal of a serum albumin concentration of 30 g/L until ICU discharge or 28 days. A meta-analysis of studies including  septic  patients  did  not  show  a  significant difference in mortality (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.89-1.08). In addition, the risk of new organ failures (RR, 1.02; 95%  CI,  0.93  to  1.11),  ventilator-free  days  or  vasopressor-free  days  did  not  differ.  Although  albumin use resulted in a larger treatment effect in the septic shock subgroup (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-0.99) than in the sepsis subgroup (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91-1.17), the subgroup analysis did not detect a subgroup effect (P-interaction = 0.19).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  lack  of  proven  benefit  and  higher  cost  of  albumin  compared  to  crystalloids  contributed  to  our strong recommendation for the use of crystalloids as first-line  fluid  for  resuscitation  in  sepsis  and  septic shock. The suggestion to consider albumin in patients who received large volumes of crystalloids is informed by evidence showing higher blood pressure at early and later  time  points  (339),  higher  static  filling  pressures (340), and lower net fluid balance (339) with albumin. Limited  data  precludes  a  cutoff  value  for  crystalloid infusion above which albumin might be considered as part of resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the 2016 SSC guidelines, a strong recommendation was issued against using hydroxyethyl starch (HES) (12).  No new data were identified. A previous metaanalysis of RCTs in septic patients showed a higher risk of RRT with the use of HES 130/0.38-0.45 (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.08-1.72) and a higher risk of death in a predefined analysis of low risk of bias trials (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2) (343). A network meta-analysis of patients with sepsis or septic shock also demonstrated a higher risk of death (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.99-1.30) and need for RRT (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17-1.66) (331) with starches in a direct comparison with crystalloids. Therefore, the 2016 recommendation against the use of HES in resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock did not change (331, 343).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gelatin is a synthetic colloid used as a resuscitation fluid; there is a lack of powered well-designed studies  supporting  its  administration  in  sepsis  and septic  shock.  Included  studies  are  generally  small and include mostly postoperative, non-critically ill  patients.  In  an  indirect comparison, a four-node network  meta-analysis  conducted  in  patients  with sepsis,  showed  no  clear  effect  on  mortality  when compared with crystalloids (OR, 1.24; 95% credible interval  [CrI]  0.61-2.55)  (331).  Similarly,  another RCT did not find an effect on mortality with gelatin use  (RR,  0.87;  95%  CI,  0.66-1.12)  (344).  Adverse effects  of  gelatin  have  been  reviewed  in  a  network meta-analysis,  which  demonstrated  higher  risk  of RRT with gelatin use compared with normal saline (OR, 1.27; 95% CrI, 0.44-3.64) and balanced crystalloids (OR, 1.50; 95% CrI 0.56-3.96) (345). Overall, the quality of evidence was moderate, due to imprecision  and  indirectness.  In  a  systematic  review  of RCTs  including  patients  with  hypovolemia,  gelatin use increased the risk of anaphylaxis (RR, 3.01; 95% CI,  1.27-7.14)  in  comparison  with  crystalloids  use (346).  Furthermore,  gelatins  may  affect  hemostasis and  the  effect  on  blood  transfusions  was  unclear (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.86-1.41). Therefore, in the face of inconclusive effect on mortality, increased adverse effects, and higher costs, the panel issued a weak recommendation against the use of gelatin for acute resuscitation. More high-quality studies are needed to inform future guideline updates.

Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Norepinephrine  is  a  potent  α-1  and  β-1  adrenergic receptors  agonist,  which  results  in  vasoconstriction and increased MAP with minimal effect on heart rate. Dopamine  acts  in  a  dose-dependent  fashion  on  dopamine-1, α-1 and β-1 adrenergic receptors. At lower dosages, dopamine causes vasodilation via dopamine-1 receptor  activity  in  the  renal,  splanchnic,  cerebral, and coronary beds. With higher dosages, dopamine's α-adrenergic receptor activity predominates resulting in vasoconstriction and increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR); its β-1 adrenergic receptor activity can lead to dose-limiting arrhythmias. Norepinephrine is more potent than dopamine as a vasoconstrictor. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 RCTs, norepinephrine resulted in a lower mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.98) and lower risk of arrhythmias (RR, 0.48; 95% CI,  0.40-0.58)  compared  with  dopamine  (347).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although the β-1 activity of dopamine may be useful in  patients  with  myocardial  dysfunction,  the  higher risk of arrhythmias limits its use (348).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epinephrine's action is also dose-dependent with potent β-1 adrenergic receptor activity and moderate β-2 and α-1 adrenergic receptor activity. The activity of epinephrine, at low doses, is primarily driven by its action on  β-1  adrenergic  receptors,  resulting  in  increased cardiac  output  (CO),  decreased  systemic  vascular  resistance (SVR) and variable effects on MAP . At higher doses, however, epinephrine administration results in increased SVR and CO. Potential adverse effects of epinephrine include arrhythmias and impaired splanchnic circulation  (349).  Epinephrine  may  increase  aerobic lactate production via stimulation of skeletal muscle β-2 adrenergic receptors, making the use of serum lactate to  guide  resuscitation  challenging  (350).  A  randomized blinded study comparing epinephrine with norepinephrine in patients with shock showed no difference in 90-day mortality (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.63-1.25) and vasopressor-free days (351). The panel issued a strong recommendation  for  norepinephrine  as  the  first-line agent over other vasopressors ( Figure 2 ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasopressin  is  an  endogenous  peptide  hormone produced in the hypothalamus and stored and released by  the  posterior  pituitary  gland.  Its  mechanism  for vasoconstrictive activity is multifactorial and includes binding  of  V 1 receptors  on  vascular  smooth  muscle resulting in increased arterial blood pressure. Studies show  that  vasopressin  concentration  is  elevated  in early  septic  shock  but  decreases  to  normal  range  in most patients between 24 and 48 hours as shock continues (352, 353). This finding has been called 'relative vasopressin deficiency' as, in the presence of hypotension, vasopressin would be expected to be elevated. The significance of this finding is unknown. Unlike most vasopressors,  vasopressin  is  not  titrated  to  response, but  it  is  usually  administered  at  a  fixed  dose  of  0.03 units/min for the treatment of septic shock. In clinical trials, vasopressin was used up to 0.06 units/min (354). Higher doses of vasopressin have been associated with cardiac, digital, and splanchnic ischemia (355).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  VANISH  trial  directly  compared  the  use  of vasopressin  versus  norepinephrine  by  randomizing patients with septic shock in a factorial 2 × 2 design aiming to also assess the role of hydrocortisone. There was no significant difference between the vasopressin and norepinephrine groups in 28-day mortality (30.9%

As  for  combination  therapy,  the  main  study  (the VASST trial) comparing norepinephrine alone to norepinephrine plus vasopressin (0.01-0.03  U/min) showed no improvement in 28-day mortality (39.3% vs 35.4%, P = 0.26) (356). However, in a subgroup analysis, patients with less severe shock receiving norepinephrine < 15 μg/min had improved survival with the addition of vasopressin (26.5% vs. 35.7%, P = 0.05). Both V ANISH and VASST demonstrated a catecholamine-sparing effect of  vasopressin;  as  such,  the  early  use  of  vasopressin  in combination with norepinephrine may help reduce the adrenergic  burden  associated  with  traditional  vasoactive agents (357). In our systematic review of 10 RCTs, vasopressin  with  norepinephrine  reduced  mortality  as compared  with  norepinephrine  alone  (RR,  0.91;  95% CI, 0.83-0.99) but did not reduce the need for RRT (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.10). There was no difference in the risks of digital ischemia (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.33-9.84) or arrhythmias (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.63-1.23). The threshold for adding vasopressin varied among studies and remains unclear. Starting vasopressin when norepinephrine dose is in the range of 0.25-0.5 μg/kg/min seems sensible (354). Another  meta-analysis  of  RCTs  on  distributive  shock showed a lower risk of atrial fibrillation with the combination of vasopressin and norepinephrine compared to norepinephrine alone (358). However, a recent individual patient data meta-analysis of patients with septic shock from 4 RCTs showed that vasopressin alone or in combination with norepinephrine led to higher risk of digital ischemia (risk difference [RD] 1.7%; 95% CI, 0.3-3.2) but lower risk of arrhythmia (RD, -2.8%; 95% CI, -0.2 to -5.3) compared with norepinephrine alone (359).

The  evidence  regarding  the  optimal  therapeutic strategy for shock requiring high dose vasopressors is scant (360). Epinephrine has been suggested as second or third-line vasopressor for patients with septic shock. With the use of norepinephrine at elevated concentrations,  the  α1  receptors  may already be saturated and downregulated  (361).  Thus,  the  use  of  another  drug such  as  epinephrine  that  targets  the  same  receptors may  be  of  limited  utility  and  vasopressin  could  be more adequate in this scenario. In an indirect comparison, a network meta-analysis did not find any significant difference between epinephrine and vasopressin in  terms  of  mortality  (RR,  0.94;  95%  CI,  0.47-1.88) (362). Epinephrine might be useful in refractory septic shock patients with myocardial dysfunction.

recommendation to use norepinephrine as a first line agent  instead  of  dopamine,  vasopressin,  epinephrine and  selepressin  and  angiotensin  II  in  patients  with septic shock as a first-line agent, and a weak recommendation over selepressin and angiotensin II. Although some evidence suggests that vasopressin might be superior to norepinephrine in terms of clinical outcomes, the panel took into consideration its higher costs and lower availability and have issued a strong recommendation to use norepinephrine as first line agent instead of vasopressin. We also consider the potential benefit and undesirable consequences of using the combination  of  norepinephrine  and  vasopressin  and  issue  a weak recommendation for adding vasopressin instead of escalating the dose of norepinephrine. Further evidence is needed to properly address the role of combination therapy of vasopressors in septic shock.

The panel also recognized that availability of, and experience with, norepinephrine may vary. As part of the global  campaign  for  universal  healthcare,  the  World Health Organization (WHO) essential medicines and health  products  program  works  to  increase  global access to essential, high-quality, safe, effective, and affordable medical products. If norepinephrine is unavailable, either dopamine or epinephrine can be used with special attention given to the risk of arrhythmias.

Selepressin is a highly selective V1 agonist, inducing vasoconstriction  via  stimulation  of  vascular  smooth muscle. It does not share the typical V1b and V2 receptor effects of vasopressin (increased pro-coagulant factors,  salt,  and  water  retention,  nitric  oxide,  and corticosteroid  release)  and  has,  therefore,  been  postulated  as  a  potentially  attractive  non-catecholamine vasopressor alternative to norepinephrine. Selepressin has  been  studied  in  two  randomized  trials  in  septic shock. The first, a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled  phase  IIa  trial,  compared  three  ascending doses of selepressin (1.25, 2.5, and 3.75 ng/kg/min) in maintaining  blood  pressure,  with  open-label  norepinephrine (363). Selepressin at a dose of 2.5 ng/kg/min was demonstrated to be effective in maintaining MAP > 60 mm Hg without norepinephrine in about 50% of patients at 12 hours and about 70% of patients at 24 hours. A follow-on phase IIb/phase III trial using an adaptive design, initially comparing three doses (1.7, 2.5,  and  3.5 ng/kg/min)  with  the  potential  to  add  a further 5 ng/kg/min dose group (364). The study was stopped  for  futility  after  enrollment  of  828  patients, with no significant differences between any of the key endpoints (ventilator- and vasopressor-free days, 15.0 [selepressin]  versus  14.5  [placebo],  P  =  0.30;  90-day all-cause mortality, 40.6% vs 39.4%, P = 0.77; 30-day RRT-free days, 18.5 vs 18.2, P = 0.85; 30-day ICU-free days, 12.6 vs 12.2, P = 0.41); adverse event rates were also similar between groups. The meta-analysis of the two studies did not show significant difference in mortality  (selepressin:  41.8%  vs  norepinephrine:  40.45%; RR, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.84-1.18). As selepressin failed to demonstrate clinical superiority over norepinephrine, we  considered  the  desirable  and  undesirable  consequences to be in favor of norepinephrine and issued a weak recommendation against the use of selepressin as a first-line therapy. Furthermore, it is not currently commercially available.

Angiotensin  II  is  a  naturally  occurring  hormone with marked vasoconstrictor effects, triggered through stimulation  of  the  renin-angiotensin  system.  A  synthetic human preparation has recently become available for clinical use and has been studied in two clinical trials. After a small, short-term pilot of 20 patients with vasodilatory (septic) shock (10 patients in each group) which showed physiological efficacy without obvious safety  issues  (365),  a  larger  RCT  of  344  patients  was performed  in  patients  with  vasodilatory  shock  (approximately 90% confirmed or presumed sepsis) (366). The primary endpoint, an increase of MAP of at least 10 mm Hg or to at least 75 mm Hg, was achieved in 114 of 163 patients in the angiotensin II group and in 37 of 158 patients in the placebo group (69.9% vs 23.4%, P < 0.001). A meta-analysis found no difference in mortality rates between angiotensin II and norepinephrine (46.2% vs 54.2%; RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.69-1.06]; very low  quality).  There  was  no  clear  increase  in  adverse events with the use of angiotensin II. As the available evidence is of very low quality, and clinical experience in  sepsis  and,  therefore,  demonstration  of  safety  remains limited, the panel considered that angiotensin should  not  be  used  as  a  first-line  agent,  but  having demonstrated physiological effectiveness, it may have a role as an adjunctive vasopressor therapy.

Terlipressin is a prodrug and is converted to lysine vasopressin  by  endothelial  peptidases,  producing  a 'slow release' effect and giving an effective half-life of around 6 hours.

involving  950  patients  in  total.  Our  meta-analysis showed no difference in mortality (terlipressin: 42.9% vs 49.0%; RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.70-1.13]; low quality) but an increase in adverse events. The largest of these studies  enrolled  617  patients  with  septic  shock,  in  a randomized, blinded fashion, with terlipressin (or placebo)  added  at  a  dose  of  between  20  mcg/hr  to  160 mcg/hr to a standard norepinephrine-based approach, to  achieve  a  MAP  of  65-75  mmHg  (367).  The  primary outcome was death from any cause at 28 days. The 28-day mortality in the two groups was 40% for terlipressin  and  38%  for  norepinephrine  (OR,  0.93; 95% CI, 0.55-1.56, P = 0.80), and there were no differences in SOFA score at day 7 or vasopressor-free days. More  patients  who  received  terlipressin  had  serious adverse events; 33 of 260 patients (12%) experienced digital ischemia after receiving terlipressin, versus only one patient who received norepinephrine (P < 0.0001); diarrhea  was  also  more  common  in  the  terlipressin group (2.7% versus 0.35%, P = 0.037). There were three cases of mesenteric ischemia in the terlipressin group versus one in the norepinephrine group. Therefore, the panel  considered  that  the  undesirable  consequences are  higher  with  the  use  of  terlipressin  and  issued  a weak recommendation against its use in patients with septic shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction is recognized  as  a  major  contributor  to  the  hemodynamic instability  and  is  associated  with  worse  outcomes  of patients  with  septic  shock  (368).  Inotropic  therapy can be used in patients with persistent hypoperfusion after adequate fluid resuscitation, and in patients with myocardial dysfunction, based on suspected or measured  low  CO  and  elevated  cardiac  filling  pressures. Dobutamine and epinephrine are the most commonly used inotropes. Physiologic studies demonstrate that dobutamine  increases CO  and  oxygen  transport, increases splanchnic perfusion and tissue oxygenation, improves  intramucosal  acidosis  and  hyperlactatemia (369).  However, these effects may not be predictable (370). Dobutamine infusion may produce severe vasodilation  and  result  in  lower  MAP .  In  addition,  the inotropic  response  may  be  blunted  in  sepsis  with  a preserved chronotropic effect causing tachycardia without an increase in stroke volume (SV) (370). No RCTs compared dobutamine to placebo in this population. Indirect comparison from network meta-analysis showed that dobutamine with norepinephrine had no clear impact on mortality when compared to no inotropic agents (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.47) (362). None of the trials directly compared dobutamine combined  with  norepinephrine  to  norepinephrine  alone. In an observational study of 420 patients with septic shock,  the  use  of  an  inotropic  agent  (dobutamine, levosimendan,  epinephrine,  or  milrinone)  was  independently associated with increased 90-day mortality (OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.33 to 3.94) even after propensity score adjustment (371). However, the analysis adjusted only to baseline characteristics, without accounting for time-varying confounders including the patient condition  at  the  time  of  initiating  inotropes  which  may explain the association with mortality. The panel considered the network meta-analysis as a higher quality than observational studies and issued a suggestion to use inotropes only in selected situations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No evidence supports the superiority of dobutamine over epinephrine. Epinephrine is commonly available especially  in  low-resource  settings  (372).  In  an  indirect comparison of dobutamine versus epinephrine, a network meta-analysis showed no clear effect on mortality (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.47-3.97) (362). Therefore, we  considered  the  desirable  and  undesirable  consequences to be comparable for both drugs and issued a weak recommendation to use either one for patients with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction with persistent  hypoperfusion  despite  adequate  fluid  status  and MAP. Both should be discontinued in the absence of improvement in hypoperfusion or in the presence of adverse  events.  Further  evidence  derived  from  high quality RCTs is needed to properly address the role of inotropes in sepsis.

Levosimendan  is  a  calcium-sensitizing  drug  with inotropic and vasodilatory properties. It has been evaluated in septic shock (373). A meta-analysis of three RCTs ( n = 781) showed that levosimendan, compared with no inotropic agents, did not impact mortality (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.28). Data from the LeoPARDS trial  ( n =  515)  showed  that  levosimendan  versus  no inotropic agents was associated with a lower likelihood of  successful  weaning  from  mechanical  ventilation and a higher risk of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia (373). A meta-analysis of seven RCTs comparing levosimendan with dobutamine showed that levosimendan was not superior to dobutamine in adults with sepsis in  terms  of  mortality  (OR,  0.80;  95%  CI,  0.48,  1.33; p = 0.39) (374). Thus, the panel issued a weak recommendation against the use of levosimendan based on the lack of benefit, in addition to the safety profile, cost and the limited availability of the drug.

Remark:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Estimation of blood pressure using a noninvasive cuff tends to be inaccurate and the discrepancy more pronounced  in  shock  states  (375-379).  Insertion  of  an arterial catheter permits safe, reliable and continuous measurement of arterial pressure and allows real time analysis so that therapeutic decisions can be based on immediate  and  accurate  blood  pressure  information (380).  A  systematic  review  of  observational  studies showed that the risk of limb ischemia and bleeding was less than 1% for radial catheters, and the risk of limb ischemia  and  bleeding  was  less  than  1%  and  1.58%, respectively for femoral catheters. The most common complication  was  localized  hematoma,  14%  for  radial  and  6%  for  femoral  catheters  (381).  Ultrasound guidance  may  increase  the  first  attempt  success  rate and decrease the complication rate (382, 383). A systematic review showed higher risk of infections when femoral arterial catheters were used compared to radial artery catheters (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.32-2.84), and the overall pooled incidence of bloodstream infection was 0.96 per 1,000 catheter days (384). In the previous version  of  these  guidelines,  a  weak  recommendation was  issued  for  using  invasive  monitoring  of  arterial blood  pressure  over  noninvasive  monitoring  (12). Since then, no new relevant evidence became available. Large, randomized trials that compare arterial blood pressure monitoring versus noninvasive methods are still lacking. In view of the low complication rate and likely higher accuracy of blood pressure measurement, the  benefits  of  arterial  catheters  probably  outweigh the  risks.  However,  the  potentially  limited  resources in  some countries and the lack of high-quality studies need to be considered. Therefore, the panel issued a  weak  recommendation in favor of arterial catheter placement.  Arterial  catheters  should  be  removed  as soon  as  continuous  hemodynamic  monitoring  is  no longer required to minimize the risk of complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  prompt  initiation  of  vasopressors  to  restore blood pressure is an integral component of the management of septic shock. Vasopressors have been traditionally  administered  via  a  central  venous  access due to concerns of extravasation, local tissue ischemia and injury if administered peripherally. However, the process of securing central venous access can be time consuming  and  requires  specialized  equipment  and training that may not be available in under resourced settings  even  in  high  income  countries,  leading  to  a delayed  initiation  of  vasopressors  (385).  Large,  randomized  trials  that  compare  central  and  peripheral catheters for initial infusion of vasopressor are lacking. A small study ( n = 263) randomly allocated patients to receive  peripheral  vascular  access  or  a  central  access (386). The need for vasopressor was the indication for venous  access  in  70%  of  the  patients.  The  incidence of  major  catheter-related  complications  was  higher in  those  randomized to peripheral venous lines with no  significant  difference  in  the  incidence  of  minor catheter-related complication. The most common peripheral  venous  line  complication  was  difficulty  in placement. Almost half of the patients assigned to the

peripheral  access  group  did  not  need  a  central  line throughout their ICU stay. Other authors also showed that central lines could be avoided by peripheral line insertion  (387).  The  administration  of  vasopressors through  peripheral  IV  catheters  is  generally  safe.  A recent  systematic  review  showed  that  extravasation occurred in 3.4% (95% CI, 2.5-4.7%) of patients with no  reported  episodes  of  tissue  necrosis  or  limb  ischemia (388). Most of the studies reported no need for active treatment of the extravasation, and a systematic review concluded that most patients who experience extravasation events have no long-term sequelae (389). Extravasation may occur more frequently if vasopressors  are  infused  distally  to  the  antecubital  fossa;  a meta-analysis showed that 85% of reported extravasation events occurred when vasopressors were infused by a catheter that was located distal to the antecubital fossa (389). The occurrence of local tissue injury may be more likely with prolonged administration of vasopressors.  Administration  of  vasopressors  for  a  short period of time (< 6 hours) in a well-placed peripheral catheter proximal to the antecubital fossa is unlikely to cause local tissue injury (389).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The time to initiation of vasopressors may be shorter if peripheral access is used. A post-hoc analysis of the ARISE trial showed that 42% of patients had vasopressors initiated via a peripheral catheter with a shorter time  to  initiation  of  vasopressors  (2.4  [1.3-3.9]  vs. 4.9 hours [3.5-6.6], p < 0.001) (385). Moreover, most patients  who  had  vasopressors  started  peripherally achieved a MAP > 65 mmHg within 1 hour. Delay in vasopressor initiation and achieving MAP of 65 is associated with increased mortality (390, 391).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the low complication rate of peripheral vasopressors  and  the  possibility  of  restoring  blood  pressure faster, the benefits of initiating vasopressors for a short period of time in a vein proximal to the antecubital fossa probably outweigh the risks. Therefore, we issued a weak recommendation in favor of the rapid initiation of vasopressors peripherally. If the infusion of vasopressors is still needed after a short period of time,  as  soon  as  practical  and  if  resources  are  available, they should be infused through a central venous access to minimize the risk of complications. The lack of  availability  and  expertise  in  placement  of  central venous catheters in different settings is an important consideration (55). Though data are generally sparse on the latter, a study of mostly senior resident doctors in  Nigeria  concluded  that  knowledge  of  central  venous  catheter  placement  was  limited  (392).  Though the  panel  suggests  peripheral  administration  of  norepinephrine as a temporizing measure until a central venous catheter can be placed, its longer-term central administration may not be possible in some settings. Larger prospective studies are needed to provide better evidence on the adequacy and safety of peripheral lines in this scenario.

Fluid Balance

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock who still have signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after initial resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Remark:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid resuscitation should be given only if patients present with signs of hypoperfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The current literature does not provide clear guidance about the best fluid strategy following the initial resuscitation bolus of fluids. The four largest clinical trials in sepsis resuscitation used moderate to large amounts of fluids in the first 72 hours. Although Rivers (393) administered over 13 L of fluids, ProCESS (64), ARISE (65)  and  ProMISe  (66)  administered  approximately 7 to 8 L in the usual care groups with a reported low mortality rate. However, recent evidence suggests that IV  fluids  used  to  restore  organ  perfusion  may  damage  vascular  integrity  and  lead  to  organ  dysfunction (394).  Data  from  observational  studies  have  shown an association of high-volume fluid resuscitation and increased mortality, but these studies are likely affected by unmeasured  variables  (i.e., the administration of  higher  amounts  of  fluids  to  sicker  patients)  (395, 396). Recent data emerging from Africa showed that higher volume fluid resuscitation in adults was associated with increased mortality, but the generalizability of these data is limited due to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and malnutrition in the patients enrolled and the resource-scarce conditions with limited access to ICUs (69).

varies with respect to the inclusion criteria, the definition  of  restrictive  and  liberal  fluid  strategies,  the criteria  guiding  the  administration  of  additional IV  fluids  (e.g.,  perfusion  parameters  vs.  hemodynamic variables),  and  the  duration  of  the  interventions  (397-401).  Moreover,  the  primary  outcomes were mostly related to IV fluid volumes administered during the study period and given the small sample sizes, they were not powered to identify differences in patient-centered outcomes. The ongoing Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS)  trial  and  the  Conservative  vs  liberal fluid  therapy  in  septic  shock  (CLASSIC)  trial  will shed some light to this matter (402, 403). Given the quality of the evidence and the variability among existing  studies,  the  panel  issued  no  recommendation for  either  restrictive  or  liberal  fluid  management in the first 24 hours of resuscitation after the initial fluid bolus in patients with sepsis and septic shock. However, it is important to emphasize this discussion does not affect the recommendation for the initial IV fluid  bolus  and  that  the  administration  of  IV  fluids after the initial fluid bolus should be guided by perfusion parameters and not only by a response in hemodynamic variables.

Oxygen Targets

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of conservative oxygen targets in adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  who  are  undergoing  mechanical  ventilation in  the  ICU  often  receive  a  high  fraction  of  inspired oxygen and have a high arterial oxygen tension. The conservative use of oxygen may reduce oxygen exposure and diminish lung and systemic oxidative injury. The evidence for the use of conservative oxygen targets (generally defined as PaO 2 55  to  70  mmHg; SpO 2 88 to 92%) and therapy in patients with sepsis is limited, with three randomized trials in the critically ill population (404-406). In the 1,000-participant ICU-ROX trial  (405),  conservative  oxygen  therapy  did  not  significantly affect the primary outcome, which was the number of ventilator-free days, compared with liberal oxygen therapy for ventilated adults in ICU. Mortality at  90  and  180  days  did  not  differ.  These  findings  are at  variance  with  the  results  of  a  previous  single-centre trial, which was stopped early after an unplanned interim  analysis.  In  that  trial,  conservative  oxygen therapy  in  the  ICU  was  associated  with  a  markedly lower rate of death than usual oxygen therapy (404). In  a  recent  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  of multiple  clinical  syndromes,  investigators  found  that a  conservative oxygen strategy was associated with a lower rate of death in acutely ill adults than a liberal oxygen strategy (407). However, in a post hoc analysis of the ICU-ROX trial including adults with sepsis, point estimates for the treatment effect of conservative oxygen therapy on 90-day mortality raise the possibility of clinically important harm (408). The LOCO-2 study was terminated early by the data safety and monitoring board and reported no difference in 28-day survival in ARDS patients managed with a conservative oxygenation  strategy  (409).  There  are  several  ongoing  trials of  conservative  oxygen  targets  that  will  inform  clinical practice in the future. At this point in time, there is  insufficient  evidence  to  make  an  evidence-based recommendation.

High-Flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy

Recommendation

For adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure, we suggest the use of high flow nasal oxygen over noninvasive ventilation.

Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

Acute  hypoxemic  respiratory  failure  can  result  from causes of sepsis such as pneumonia or non-pulmonary infections resulting in ARDS. Patients presenting with hypoxia  without  hypercapnia  are  treated  with  high concentrations of inhaled oxygen which may be delivered  conventionally  with  interfaces  including  nasal prongs, facemask with reservoir or Venturi mask.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advanced  interventions  for  patients  with  severe hypoxia requiring escalation of support include noninvasive ventilation (NIV) or high flow oxygen. Both therapies avoid the complications of intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation and promote patient interaction. In addition to improving gas exchange, NIV

may help to reduce work of breathing in select patients. However, NIV use can be associated with development of complications including increased risk of gastric insufflation and aspiration, facial skin breakdown, excessively high tidal volumes as well as patient discomfort related to inability to eat or effectively phonate during therapy.

High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a noninvasive, high concentration oxygen delivery interface that confers  warming  and  humidification  of  secretions,  high flow  rates  to  better  match  patient  demand,  washout of  nasopharyngeal  dead  space,  and  modest  positive airway pressure effect. The single inspiratory limb of HFNC allows for airflows as high as 60 liters per minute to achieve inspired oxygen fractions (FiO 2 ) as high as 95-100%. However, HFNC is less effective at reducing work of breathing and supplying a moderate or higher level  of  PEEP  (410).  Complications  with  HFNC  are possible; however, they are usually self-limited and do not require discontinuing therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  comparing  the  strategies  of  NIV  versus HFNC  for  acute  hypoxemic  respiratory  failure despite  conventional  oxygen ,  a  single,  large,  randomized trial  has  been  conducted for direct comparison (411).  Although  the  primary  outcome  of  intubation rate  at  28  days  was  not  different,  this  study  demonstrated  improved  90-day  survival  with  HFNC  compared with NIV (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.85) and HFNC patients  experienced  significantly  more  days free of mechanical ventilation during a 28-day study period (411). In a post hoc analysis of patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 200 mm Hg) from the above trial, HFNC resulted in lower intubation rates compared with NIV (35% versus 58%, respectively). A systematic review and meta-analysis of nine RCTs (2,093  patients)  showed  that  HFNC  reduces  intubation  compared  with  conventional  oxygen  (RR,  0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.99) but does not affect the risk of death or ICU length of stay (412-414). However, the NIV technique was not standardized, and the experience of the centers varied.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although the quality of evidence is low, the benefits of  a  trial  of  HFNC  for  the  sepsis  patient  with  nonhypercapnic progressive hypoxia over NIV seems justified.  Patients  requiring HFNC for acute hypoxemic respiratory  failure  are  at  high  risk  of  requiring  intubation; therefore, such trials must be accompanied by careful surveillance for ventilatory failure.

Noninvasive Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of noninvasive ventilation in comparison to invasive ventilation for adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When directly compared with invasive positive pressure ventilation,  NIV may be able to achieve similar physiologic benefits including improved gas exchange and reduced work of breathing in select patients, while avoiding  complications  associated  with  intubation, invasive  ventilation,  and  accompanying  sedation.  In contrast, NIV can cause mask-related discomfort, unrecognized patient-ventilator asynchrony due to leaks, and gastric insufflation. The main risk of NIV for the indication of acute respiratory failure is the potential for delaying needed intubation and increasing the risk of an interval aspiration events. Studies have suggested that NIV failure is an independent risk factor for mortality specifically in this population, although careful patient selection may reduce this risk (415, 416).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure may or may not have a competing chronic respiratory disease (COPD, obesity) and the use of NIV for  the  rescue  of  patients  with  exclusively  acute  hypoxic respiratory failure ('de novo respiratory failure') is less well studied, but not uncommon. For example, the LUNG SAFE trial demonstrated that NIV was used in 15% of patients with ARDS with varying failure and mortality rates, depending on ARDS severity (417).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A few small RCTs have shown benefit with NIV for early  or  mild  ARDS  or  de  novo  hypoxic  respiratory failure (418, 419). Since the last guideline distribution, only one additional study was added for analysis (420). Due to a small number of patients studied, low quality of evidence, uncertainty regarding whether clinicians can identify hypoxic patients in respiratory failure in whom NIV might be beneficial, and observational data that  suggest the potential for harm with NIV in this setting, no clear recommendation can be made. If NIV is used for patients with sepsis-associated hypoxic respiratory failure, we suggest monitoring for an early reduction in work of breathing and close monitoring of tidal volumes (421).

Protective Ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
49. For adults with sepsis-induced ARDS, we recommend using a low tidal volume ventilation strategy (6  mL/kg), over a high tidal volume strategy (> 10  mL/kg).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This recommendation is the same as that of the previous  guidelines.  Of  note,  the  studies  that  guide  the recommendations  in  this  section  enrolled  patients using criteria from the American-European Consensus Criteria Definition for Acute Lung Injury and ARDS (422).  For  the  current  document,  we  used  the  2012 Berlin  definition  and  the  terms  mild,  moderate,  and severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 300, ≤ 200, and ≤ 100 mm Hg, respectively) (423). Several multicenter RCTs have been  performed  in  patients  with  established  ARDS to evaluate the effects of limiting inspiratory pressure through moderation of tidal volume (424-427). These studies showed differing results, which may have been caused by differences in airway pressures in the treatment and control groups (423, 424, 428).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several meta-analyses suggest decreased mortality in patients with a pressure- and volume-limited strategy for  established  ARDS  (353,  354).  The  largest  trial  of a  volume-  and  pressure-limited  strategy  showed  9% absolute decrease in mortality in ARDS patients ventilated with tidal volumes of 6 mL/kg compared with 12 mL/kg predicted body weight (PBW), and aiming for plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H 2 O (424).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  use  of  lung-protective  strategies  for  patients with ARDS is supported by clinical trials and has been widely  accepted;  however,  the  precise  tidal  volume for  an  individual  ARDS  patient  requires  adjustment for  factors  such  as  the  plateau  pressure,  the  selected positive  end-expiratory  pressure  (PEEP),  thoracoabdominal compliance, and the patient's breathing effort. Patients  with  profound  metabolic  acidosis,  high  minute  ventilation,  or  short  stature  may  require  additional manipulation of tidal volumes. Some clinicians believe it may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes >  6 mL/kg  PBW,  as  long  as  plateau  pressure  can  be maintained ≤ 30 cm H 2 O (429, 430). The plateau pressure  is  only  truly  valuable  if  the  patient  is  passive during the inspiratory hold. Conversely, patients with very stiff chest/abdominal walls and high pleural pressures  may  tolerate  plateau  pressures  >  30 cm  H 2 O because transpulmonary pressures will be lower. A retrospective study suggested that tidal volumes should be lowered even with plateau pressures ≤ 30 cm H 2 O (431)  because  lower  plateau  pressures  were  associated  with  reduced  hospital  mortality  (432).  A  recent  patient-level  mediation  analysis  suggested  that a tidal volume that results in a driving pressure (plateau pressure minus set PEEP) below 12-15 cm H 2 O may be advantageous in patients without spontaneous breathing efforts (433). Prospective validation of tidal volume titration by driving pressure is needed before this approach can be recommended. Tidal volumes > 6  cc/kg  coupled with plateau pressures > 30 cm H 2 O should be avoided in ARDS. Clinicians should use as a starting point the objective of reducing tidal volume over 1 to 2 hours from its initial value toward the goal of a 'low' tidal volume (≈ 6 mL/kg PBW) achieved in conjunction with an end-inspiratory plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H 2 O. If plateau pressure remains > 30 cm H 2 O after reduction of tidal volume to 6 mL/kg PBW , tidal volume may be further reduced to as low as 4 mL/kg PBW. The clinician should keep in mind that very low tidal volumes may result in significant patient-ventilatory dyssynchrony and patient discomfort. Respiratory rate should be increased to a maximum of 35 breaths/ min during tidal volume reduction to maintain minute ventilation. Volume- and pressure-limited ventilation may lead  to  hypercapnia  even  with  these  maximum tolerated set respiratory rates; this appears to be tolerated and safe in the absence of contraindications (e.g., high intracranial pressure, sickle cell crisis). No single mode of ventilation (pressure control, volume control) has consistently been shown to be advantageous when compared with any other that respects the same principles of lung protection.

pressure have been published since then. Of note, the  three  RCTs  that  guide  this  recommendation (424, 426, 427) enrolled patients using the criteria from  the  American-European  Consensus  Criteria Definition for Acute Lung Injury and ARDS (422) whereas the current document use the 2012 Berlin definition  and  the  terms  mild,  moderate,  and  severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 300, ≤ 200, and ≤ 100 mm Hg,  respectively)  (423).  These  three  RCTS  compared  a  strategy  of  low  tidal  volume  and  limited plateau pressure with a strategy using higher tidal volume and plateau  pressure;  pooled  data  suggest reduced mortality (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.97) and  more  ventilator-free  days  (MD  1.8  days;  95% CI, 0.35 to 3.25) in patients managed with low plateau pressures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  recent  systematic  review  which  included  five RCTs  also  identified  a  strong  relationship  between plateau  pressure  and  mortality  (434).  The  recommendation is also supported by observational data. LUNGSAFE,  a  large international observational study,  which  reported  that  plateau  pressure  correlated  with  mortality;  however,  the  relationship  between the two was not evident when plateau pressure was below 20 cm H 2 O (435). A secondary analysis of five  observational  studies  identified  a  plateau  pressure cut-off value of 29 cm H 2 O, above which an ordinal increment was accompanied by an increment of risk of death (436). We therefore recommend that the upper limit goal for plateau pressure should be less than 30 cm H 2 O.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
51. For adults with moderate to severe sepsis-induced ARDS, we suggest using higher PEEP over lower PEEP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The recommendation is unchanged from 2016. Two RCTs (437, 438) were published since the 2016 Guidelines (12, 13), but we did not include these trials in the meta-analyses because both studies applied recruitment maneuvers to titrate PEEP levels. Our conclusions did not change in a sensitivity analysis which includes these two trials.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Applying higher PEEP in patients with ARDS may open lung units to participate in gas exchange and may increase  PaO 2 .  We  included  three  multicenter  RCTs (439-441) and one pilot RCT (442), investigating use of  higher PEEP versus lower PEEP strategies in  conjunction  with  low  tidal  volumes for  the  management of  patients  with  ARDS.  Among  patients  with  ARDS receiving lower VTs, we did not identify a significant benefit  for  use  of  a  higher  PEEP  versus  lower  PEEP strategy  for  improving  mortality  (RR,  0.93;  95%  CI, 0.83-1.03), days on mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.00; 95% CI, -1.02-1.02), or ventilator-free days (RR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.19-2.76); and there was no increase in the risk of barotrauma (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 0.99-2.23).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  patient-level  meta-analysis  showed  no  benefit of  higher  PEEP  in all  patients with  ARDS;  however, patients with moderate or severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 200 mm Hg) had decreased mortality with the use of higher PEEP, whereas those with mild ARDS did not (443). A patient-level analysis of two of the randomized PEEP trials (440, 441) suggested that patients with ARDS who respond to increased PEEP with improved oxygenation have a lower risk of death; this association was stronger in patients with more severe ARDS (PaO 2 /FiO 2 <  150 mm  Hg)  compared  with  patients with less severe ARDS (444).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  optimal  method  of  selecting  a  higher  PEEP level  is  not  clear.  One  option  is  to  titrate  PEEP according to  bedside  measurements  of  thoracopulmonary compliance with the objective of obtaining the  best  compliance  or  lowest  driving  pressure,  reflecting a favorable balance of lung recruitment and overdistension (445). The second option is to titrate PEEP upward while the patient is receiving a  tidal volume  of  6 mL/kg  PBW,  until  the  plateau  airway pressure is 28 cm H 2 O (441). A third option is to use a PEEP/FiO 2 titration table that titrates PEEP based on  the  combination  of  FiO 2 and  PEEP  required  to maintain adequate oxygenation (439-441). A PEEP >5 cm H 2 O is usually required to avoid lung collapse (446).  Esophageal  pressure  guided  PEEP  titration has been evaluated in two trials (447, 448). While the pilot  study  suggested  benefit  (448),  the  subsequent 200  patient  multicenter  RCT  that  compared  PEEP titration  guided  by  esophageal  (P ES )  measurement versus  empirical  high  PEEP-FiO 2 titration,  showed no  significant  difference  in  a  composite  outcome

Low Tidal Volume in non-ARDS Respiratory Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Previous versions of SSC guidelines issued a strong recommendation with a moderate-quality evidence for  using  low  tidal  volume  (Vt)  ventilation  (Vt 4-8 mL/kg  of  predicted  body  weight),  over  higher tidal  volumes  (Vt  >  8 mL/kg)  in  the  management of patients with ARDS (12, 13, 226). There is not as strong  an  evidence  base,  however,  for  the  patients presenting  with  acute  respiratory  failure  requiring mechanical  ventilation  who  do  not  fulfil  the  criteria  for  ARDS. A 2015 systematic review and metaanalysis found a reduction in the risk of a composite endpoint  of  ARDS  or  pneumonia  during  the  hospital stay in the low tidal volume ventilation group compared to the high tidal volume ventilation group (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98) (450). Our analysis of three RCTs (1,129 patients) showed no difference in mortality with low Vt ventilation (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.26), with a trend toward lower risk of developing  ARDs  (RR,  0.59;  95%  CI,  0.34  to  1.02) (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are limited data on ventilation strategies for patients  with  sepsis-induced  respiratory  failure  who do not meet criteria for ARDS. However, sepsis is an independent risk factor for the development of ARDS, and delays in diagnosing ARDS may result in delayed use  of  low  tidal  volumes.  We  therefore  suggest  that low  tidal  volume  ventilation  be  used  in  all  patients with sepsis who are receiving mechanical ventilation to avoid underuse or delayed use of this intervention. Furthermore, the use of low tidal volume ventilation avoids the risk of promoting ventilator induced lung injury  in  septic  patients  in  whom  the  diagnosis  of ARDS has been missed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recruitment Maneuvers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many strategies exist for treating refractory hypoxemia in patients with severe ARDS (451). Temporarily raising transpulmonary pressure may facilitate opening atelectatic alveoli to permit gas exchange (446), but could also over  distend  aerated  lung  units  leading  to  ventilatorinduced  lung  injury  and  transient  hypotension.  Since the  publication  of  the  previous  SSC  Guidelines,  two important RCTs were published both of which utilized a  'non-traditional'  approach  to  recruitment  maneuvers. Instead of the 'traditional' recruitment maneuver which consists of  the  application  of  sustained  continuous positive airway pressure (e.g., 30-40 cm H 2 O for 30-40 seconds), both trials conducted lung recruitment with incremental PEEP levels, followed by a decremental PEEP titration according to either best respiratorysystem  static  compliance  (452)  or  oxygen  saturation (437). When the incremental PEEP recruitment studies are analyzed separately from studies utilizing traditional recruitment maneuvers, recruitment with incremental PEEP is associated with increased 28-day mortality RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.00-1.25), which justifies the strong recommendation against using incremental PEEP titration for  recruitment.  Traditional  recruitment  maneuvers appear to improve 28-day mortality (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.64-0.96) in patients with ARDS (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 4). Although the effects of recruitment  maneuvers  improve  oxygenation  initially,  the effects can be transient (453). Selected patients with severe hypoxemia may benefit from recruitment maneuvers in conjunction with higher levels of PEEP , but little evidence supports the routine use in all ARDS patients, so  we  have  focused  our  recommendations  to  patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (453). Any patient receiving  recruitment  maneuvers  should  be  monitored closely  and  recruitment  maneuvers should be discontinued if deterioration in clinical status is observed.

Prone Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
55. For adults with sepsis-induced moderate-severe ARDS, we recommend using prone ventilation for more than 12 hours daily.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  were  no  new  randomized,  controlled  trials evaluating the use of prone ventilation in sepsis induced severe ARDS published since the 2016 guidelines.  Therefore,  no  change  in  the  recommendation was  made.  In  2017,  a  meta-analysis  was  published (454) that was updated from a previous meta-analysis published in 2010 (455), to which only one study, the PROSEVA trial published in 2013 (456), was added. This  repeated  meta-analysis  confirmed  the  results from the previous published work: In patients with ARDS and a PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 200, the use of prone compared  with  supine  position  within  the  first  36 hours of intubation, when performed for > 12 hours a  day,  showed  improved  survival.  Meta-analysis  including this study demonstrated reduced mortality in severe  ARDS patients treated with prone compared with supine position (RR, 0.74; 95%CI 0.56-.99) as well as improved oxygenation as measured by change in  PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio  (median  23.5  higher;  95%  CI, 12.4-34.5  higher)  (454).  Most  patients  respond  to the  prone  position  with  improved  oxygenation  and may also have improved lung compliance (457-459). While prone position may be associated with potentially  life-threatening  complications  including  accidental  removal  of  the  endotracheal  tube,  this  was not  evident  in  pooled  analysis  (RR,  1.09;  95%  CI, 0.85-1.39). However, prone position was associated with an increase in pressure sores (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05-1.41) (460, 461), and some patients have contraindications to the prone position (460, 461).

Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
56. For adults with sepsis induced moderate-severe ARDS, we suggest using intermittent NMBA boluses, over NMBA continuous infusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The most common  indication for neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) use in the ICU is to facilitate  mechanical  ventilation  (462).  These  drugs  may improve  chest  wall  compliance,  prevent  respiratory dyssynchrony, and reduce peak airway pressures (463). In  addition,  use  of  NMBA  may  reduce  oxygen  consumption by decreasing the work of breathing (464). In the 2016 SSC guidelines we issued a weak recommendation for using NMBA infusion for 48 hours in sepsis-induced  moderate  to  severe  ARDS  (12,  13). This recommendation was based on a meta-analysis of three trials that examined the role of NMBAs in ARDS (465-467), showing reduced risks of death (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.58-0.91) and barotrauma (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.90) with the use of cisatracurium infusion (468).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since then, several RCTs have been published (469471),  the  largest  of  which  is  the  ROSE  Trial  (471). Because of the presence of significant statistical and clinical heterogeneity, a meta-analysis of all seven trials was not appropriate. A continuous NMBA infusion did not improve mortality when compared with a light sedation strategy with as needed NMBA boluses but no continuous  infusion  (RR,  0.99;  95%  CI,  0.86-1.15).  On  the other hand, continuous NMBA infusion reduced mortality when compared to deep sedation with as needed NMBA boluses (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.89). Overall, continuous NMBA infusion reduced the risk of barotrauma (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.85), but the effect on ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU-acquired weakness was unclear (472, 473).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given  the  uncertainty  that  still  exists  pertaining  to these important outcomes and the balance between benefits and potential harms, the panel issued a weak recommendation favoring intermittent NMBA boluses over a continuous infusion. Importantly, if NMBAs are used, clinicians  must  ensure  adequate  patient  sedation  and analgesia (191, 474). Recently updated clinical practice guidelines are also available for specific guidance (472).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used in patients with severe acute respiratory failure to facilitate gas exchange in the setting of  refractory  hypoxemia  or  hypercapnic  respiratory acidosis  (475).  It  may  also  be  used  to  facilitate  a  reduction in the intensity of mechanical ventilation. The evidence for the use of VV-ECMO in sepsis-induced ARDS is limited, with two RCTs completed in the last 10 years to assess the potential efficacy of VV-ECMO for severe ARDS (476, 477). The inclusion criteria of the trials were strict and focused on a very sick population  of  patients  with  severe  ARDS  refractory  to conventional  ventilation  strategies  and  other  rescue therapies such as prone position. The evidence in this guideline was downgraded to very low quality due to indirectness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  were  methodological  limitations  of  the  included  studies.  In  one  trial,  all  intervention  participants were treated at one center, which may have inflated  the  effect  size  because  the  center  specialized in  ECMO  management  (477).  Additionally,  some  of the  participants  in  this  trial  did  not  receive  the  intervention (477). However, one recent systematic review found that VV-ECMO delivered at expert centers reduced mortality for patients with severe ARDS (475). In clinical practice, patient selection is important and usually  discussed  prior  to  initiation  of  ECMO  at  an ECMO center. Cost and equity are substantial issues; and registry data will be very important to document longer term outcomes in these patients outside of the clinical trial context.

Corticosteroids

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy we suggest using IV corticosteroids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation; moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Remarks:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The typical corticosteroid used in adults with septic shock is IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200  mg/d given as 50  mg intravenously every 6 hours or as a continuous infusion. It is suggested that this is commenced at a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min at least 4 hours after initiation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  2016  guidance,  the  accumulated  evidence  did not  support  a  recommendation  for  their  use  if  adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy were able to restore hemodynamic stability (12, 13). Since then, three large RCTs have been published (354, 478, 479). An updated meta-analysis (480) found systemic corticosteroid to accelerate resolution of shock (MD, 1.52  days;  95%  CI,  1.71  to  1.32).  A  meta-analysis conducted  for  this  guideline  revision  (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 5) found an increase vasopressor-free days (MD, 1.5 days; 95% CI, 0.8 to 3.11 days);  however,  corticosteroid  use  increased  neuromuscular weakness (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.45), without a clear effect on short- or long-term mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The overall quality of evidence was moderate. The panel  judged  the  desirable  effects  (shock  resolution, vasopressor  free  days)  to  outweigh  the  undesirable effects  of  low  dose  corticosteroid.  This  observation, when taken into consideration with the resources required,  cost  of  the  intervention,  and  feasibility  supported a weak recommendation in favor of using low dose corticosteroid therapy in septic shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The optimal dose, timing of initiation, and duration of  corticosteroids  remain  uncertain;  recent  RCTs  used 200 mg per day of IV hydrocortisone in divided doses (354, 479, 480). The three trials (354, 478, 479) also used different inclusion criteria: in ADRENAL (479) eligible patients were those on any dose of vasopressor or inotrope for ≥ 4 hours to maintain a MAP > 60 mm Hg, and present at the time of randomization. In APROCCHSS (478) the dose of vasopressor was ≥ 0.25 µg/kg/min or ≥ 1  mg/hr of norepinephrine or epinephrine, or any other vasopressor for at least 6 hours to maintain a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg. In the ADRENAL (479) study, hydrocortisone was administered for a maximum of seven days or until ICU discharge or death; in APROCCHSS (478) hydrocortisone was administered for seven days; in V ANISH (354) 200 mg of hydrocortisone was administered daily for 5 days and then tapered over further 6 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our recommendation focuses on adults with septic shock and ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy. We defined ongoing requirement as a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min for at least 4 hours after initiation to maintain the target MAP. The dose of hydrocortisone is typically 200 mg/d. No dose response benefit was seen in a prior systematic review and meta-analysis (480).

The previous guidelines made no recommendation regarding the use of blood purification techniques (12, 13). The updated literature search for guideline identified one new relevant RCT (481).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  most  widely  investigated  technique  involves the  use  of  polymyxin  B-immobilized  polystyrenederived  fibers.  Randomized  trials  of  this  technique have  been  previously  summarized  in  a  systematic review  and  meta-analysis  (482).  An  updated  metaanalysis  of  all  available  RCTs  (Supplemental  Digital Content:  Appendix  5)  demonstrated  a  possible  reduction  in  mortality  (RR,  0.87;  95%  CI,  0.77-0.98, low  quality),  however  this  finding  was  challenged by  sensitivity  analyses:  after  excluding  high  risk  of bias trials the risk ratio is 1.14 (95% CI, 0.96-1.36); and after excluding trials published prior to 2010 we observed higher mortality with hemoperfusion (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.04-1.46). Overall, the quality of evidence is judged as low (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Substantial  uncertainty  as  to  any  beneficial  effect exists  and  the  frequency  of  undesirable  effects  is  reported in few trials. Polymyxin B hemoperfusion is expensive, resource intensive, potentially reduces health equity, and is infeasible in low-income economies. All considered, the panel issued a weak recommendation against the use of polymyxin B hemoperfusion therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We did not identify new evidence on other modalities such as hemofiltration, combined hemoperfusion and hemofiltration or plasma exchange. Accordingly, no recommendation regarding the use of these modalities  is  made  and  this  is  unchanged  from  the  2016 guidelines. Since the analysis, new data has emerged, but at this stage was not sufficient for us to reconsider the recommendation (483).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Further research is needed to determine the effect of  various  blood  purification  techniques  on  patient outcomes.

Red Blood Cell (RBC) Transfusion Targets

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using a restrictive (over liberal) transfusion strategy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Strong recommendation; moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Remarks:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A restrictive transfusion strategy typically includes a hemoglobin concentration transfusion trigger of 70  g/L; however, RBC transfusion should not be guided by hemoglobin concentration alone. Assessment of a patient's overall clinical status and consideration of extenuating circumstances such as acute myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia or acute hemorrhage is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  previous  guidance  was  informed  by  two  RCTs (484,  485).  The  Transfusion  Requirements  in  Septic Shock (TRISS) trial addressed a transfusion threshold of 70 g/L versus 90 g/L in 1,000 septic shock patients after  admission  to  the  ICU.  The  results  showed  similar 90-day mortality, ischemic events, and use of life support in the two treatment groups with fewer transfusions in the lower-threshold group. The Transfusion requirements in in Critical Care trial (TRICC), which compared a restrictive transfusion threshold of 70 g/L versus 100 g/L in 838 euvolemic ICU patients, demonstrated no difference in the primary outcome (30-day mortality). In the subgroup of 218 patients with sepsis or septic shock 30-day mortality was similar in the two groups (22.8% in the restrictive group vs. 29.7% in the liberal group, p = 0.36).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our literature search identified a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs (486) and one new RCT:  The  Transfusion  Requirements  in  Critically  Ill Oncologic  Patients  (TRICOP)  trial  (487).  This  trial randomized  300  adult  cancer  patients  with  septic shock to either a liberal (hemoglobin  threshold, < 90 g/L) or restrictive strategy (hemoglobin threshold, < 70 g/L) of RBC transfusion. At 28 days after randomization, the mortality rate in the liberal group was 45% (67 patients) versus 56% (84 patients) in the restrictive group (HR 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53-1.04; p = 0.08) with no

differences in ICU and hospital length of stay. At 90 days after randomization, mortality rate in the liberal group was lower (59% vs 70%) than in the restrictive group (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.97).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our update of the meta-analysis showed no difference in 28-day mortality (OR, 0.99 95% CI, 0.67-1.46, moderate quality). This is due to the inclusion of the TRICOP study where lower 28 mortality was observed with a liberal strategy. Overall, the quality of evidence was judged moderate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  overall  balance  of  effects  is  uncertain  and does not favor either the intervention or comparator. However, a restrictive strategy was determined likely beneficial with regards to resources required, cost effectiveness,  and  health  equity  considerations.  A  restrictive strategy is feasible in low- and middle-income countries. The 2016 strong recommendation favoring a restrictive strategy is unchanged; however, the overall quality of evidence changed from strong to moderate.

Immunoglobulins

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
62. For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using intravenous immunoglobulins Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  sepsis  and  septic  shock  may  have  evidence of hyper-inflammation and immunosuppression (488).  There  are  no  high-quality  studies  examining the  effect  of  intravenous  (IV)  immunoglobulins  on the outcomes of patients with sepsis or septic shock. The previous  guidance  was  a  weak  recommendation against their use (12, 13).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our  literature  search  identified  two  new  RCTs (489,  490)  and  three  meta-analyses  (350,  491,  492) evaluating  the  effects  of  polyclonal  IV  immunoglobulins  (IVIG)  and  immunoglobulin M-enriched polyclonal  Ig  (IVIGM)  in  patients  with  sepsis.  The updated meta-analyses demonstrated reduced mortality with IVIG (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51-0.91) and IVIGM (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.85), however the quality of evidence is low with many of the included studies at high risks of bias including single-center trials with small sample size, undefined randomization,  allocation  and  blinding  procedures,  different dosing regimens and durations of treatment, different controls and few studies reported adverse events. Furthermore, after excluding high risk of bias studies, the significant reduction in mortality is no longer apparent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall,  the  balance  of  effects  (beneficial  and  undesirable) remains uncertain. Intravenous  immunoglobulin  is  also  relatively  expensive,  possibly  not cost-effective  and  may  reduce  health  equity.  Its  cost also  limits  its  feasibility  in  countries  with  low-  and middle-income  economies.  Based  on  these  judgements,  clinicians  may  consider  avoiding  the  routine use  of  IV  immunoglobulins  in  patients  with  sepsis and  septic  shock.  Large,  multicenter,  well  designed, RCTs are needed to resolve the uncertainty regarding the  role  of  immunoglobulin  therapies  in  this  patient population.

Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
63. For adults with sepsis or septic shock, and who have risk factors for gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, we suggest using stress ulcer prophylaxis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stress ulcers develop in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of critically ill patients and can be associated with significant  morbidity  and  mortality  (493).  In  2016,  this guideline  recommended  stress  ulcer  prophylaxis  for patients with risk factors (12, 13).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our literature search identified one new RCT (494) and the meta-analysis from the previous guideline was updated.  This  demonstrated  no  effect  on  mortality (RR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.93-1.10) and a reduction in GI hemorrhage  (RR,  0.52  95%  CI,  0.45-0.61).  A  sensitivity analysis including only trials at low risk of bias provided similar results. No increase in Clostridioides difficile colitis or pneumonia was observed. However, it  was  noted  that  the  most  recent  (and  largest)  RCT did not demonstrate any effect of pantoprazole versus placebo on 90-day mortality and a composite outcome of  clinically  important  events  (494).  A  recent  metaanalysis published since the finalization of the literature searches has suggested that there is a higher risk of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infections with proton pump inhibitors (495).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall, it was judged that the evidence probably favored the administration of stress ulcer prophylaxis. This is driven by a modest reduction in gastrointestinal hemorrhage for which there is moderate quality of evidence (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 5). While no adverse effects  were  observed,  the  quality  of  evidence for these outcomes was low. Stress ulcer prophylaxis is relatively  inexpensive,  requires  limited  resources  and is applicable to countries with low-income economies. These judgements support a weak recommendation for the  use  of  stress  ulcer  prophylaxis  in  at-risk  patients. This represents a downgrading of the strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence made in 2016.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A recent systematic review evaluated risk factors for clinically important GI bleeding (496). After excluding high risk of bias studies, risk factors included: coagulopathy (relative effect (RE) 4.76; 95% CI, 2.62-8.63), shock (RE 2.60; 95% CI, 1.25-5.42), and chronic liver disease (RE 7.64; 95% CI, 3.32-17.58). The effect of mechanical  ventilation  on  clinically  important  bleeding was unclear (RE 1.93, 0.57-6.50, very low certainty).

Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis unless a contraindication to such therapy exists. Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) over unfractionated heparin (UFH) for VTE prophylaxis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using mechanical VTE prophylaxis in addition to pharmacological prophylaxis, over pharmacologic prophylaxis alone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Critically ill patients are at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as well as pulmonary embolism (PE). The incidence of DVT acquired in the ICU may be as high as  10%  (497),  the  incidence  of  acquired  PE  may  be 2%-4% (498, 499).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No  new  RCT  evidence  was  identified.  Our  previous meta-analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in both DVT and PE and no increase in bleeding complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On balance, the effect favors the intervention with a  moderate  quality  of  evidence.  The  cost  of  intervention is not large, and it is likely feasible in countries with low- and middle-income economies. These judgements support a recommendation for the use of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis unless a contraindication exists. The recommendation is unchanged from the 2016 guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our  literature  review  found  no  new  RCT  evidence comparing the administration of low molecular weight heparin  (LMWH)  to  unfractionated  heparin  (UFH). The prior meta-analysis demonstrated significantly lower rates  of  DVT  following  the  administration  of  LMWH compared to UFH (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98). No difference in the rates of clinically significant bleeding, mortality or PE were observed. The overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate: it was downgraded for imprecision. It was determined that the balance of overall effects favored LMWH over UFH. Any difference in resources required between the two interventions was considered negligible, and LMWH administration was feasible and applicable  in  countries  with  low-  and  middle-income economies. Further, LMWH may have greater consumer acceptance  as  it  requires  only  one  subcutaneous  injection daily. These judgements support a recommendation for the use of LMWH over UFH for VTE prophylaxis in patients with sepsis or septic shock. This recommendation is unchanged from the 2016 guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combined  pharmacologic  prophylaxis  and  mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression  (IPC)  and/or  graduated  stockings  may offer another option for patients with sepsis and septic shock. In the 2016 guidelines, a suggestion to use combination therapy whenever possible, was based on indirect and imprecise data (12, 13). Our literature search identified one new RCT that compared the combination  of  mechanical  and  pharmacological  prophylaxis to pharmacological prophylaxis alone (500).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The PREVENT study randomized 2003 critically ill patients  to  intermittent  pneumatic  calf  compression alone or in combination with pharmacological prophylaxis (500). No difference in mortality (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.84-1.13), or the rates of DVT and PE were observed. No difference in lower extremity ischemia was demonstrated. The study was downgraded during the quality assessment for imprecision. For the outcome of mortality,  the  quality  was  assessed  as  moderate;  for  other outcomes it was further downgraded for risk of bias.

It was judged that any effects of the intervention (mechanical prophylaxis in addition to pharmacologic), either beneficial or undesirable, were likely trivial (Supplemental Digital  Content:  Appendix  5).  However,  there  are  resource implications and costs associated with the use of mechanical  VTE  prophylaxis.  These,  together  with  the lack of any effect on a patient centered outcome support a weak recommendation against the use of the combination of mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is acknowledged that in some patents with sepsis and septic  shock  pharmacologic  prophylaxis  may  be contraindicated. These patients may benefit from mechanical VTE prophylaxis. No data for this population exist. Further research is indicated.

Renal Replacement Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In adults with sepsis or septic shock and AKI who require renal replacement therapy, we suggest using either continuous or intermittent renal replacement therapy. Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In adults with sepsis or septic shock and AKI, with no definitive indications for renal replacement therapy, we suggest against using renal replacement therapy. Weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses (501, 502) summarized the total body of evidence: they do not show a difference in mortality between patients who receive continuous (CRRT) versus intermittent hemodialysis  (IHD).  The  results  remained  the  same  when the analysis is restricted to RCTs (502).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our  updated  literature  search  identified  no  new RCTs  but  two  meta-analysis  comparing  continuous and  intermittent  renal  replacement  therapies  (503, 504). The quality of evidence was judged as low. The balance  of  effects  favored  neither  (IHD)  nor  CRRT. It  was  acknowledged  that  the  resources  required  for the  interventions  vary.  In  low-  and  middle-income economies, the  specialized  equipment,  expertise  and personal required for continuous modalities may not be available. The recommendation, for either intervention, is unchanged from the 2016 guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Timing  of  renal  replacement  therapy  initiation  is  of importance. Prior research has suggested benefit (505) or harm (506) for 'early' versus 'delayed' initiation of RRT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our search identified a new RCT comparing early versus  delayed  RRT  (507).This  trial  included  488 patients  with  AKI  and  septic  shock.  It  was  stopped early,  after  the  second  planned  interim  analysis,  for futility. Eligible patients were those with septic shock (within 48 hours of the onset of vasopressor therapy and AKI defined as oliguria (< 0.3 mL/kg/hr for ≥ 24 hours), anuria for 12 hours or more, or a serum creatinine level 3 times baseline accompanied by a rapid increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL. Subsequent to the censor date for  our  literature  search,  the  results  of  the  STARRTAKI  trial  were  published.  The  trial,  which  randomized 3,000 participants, demonstrated no difference in mortality in those allocated to an accelerated strategy of RRT compared with those allocated to a 'standard' strategy.  No  differential  effect  was  observed  in  the  a priori sepsis subgroup of 1,689 patients (508).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The results of this trial were included in an updated metaanalysis (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 5). No effect of the timing of initiation of renal replacement  therapy  on  mortality  and  renal  recovery  was observed. The IDEAL-ICU trial (507) did not report central  venous  access  device  (CVAD)  infections:  the results for this outcome are unchanged from 2016. The certainty  of  evidence  for  the  key  outcomes  of  mortality, renal recovery and CVAD infection was a least moderate and was only downgraded for imprecision (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 5). Overall, the balance of effects favored delayed rather than early initiation  of  RRT.  This  is  principally  driven  by  the higher rate of CVAD infection in the 'early' initiation. Therefore, after considering of the resources required, cost and health equity issues, the panel issued a weak recommendation  against  the  use  of  RRT  in  patients with sepsis and AKI for increases in creatinine or oliguria alone, and without other absolute indications for dialysis  (uremic  complications,  refractory  academia, refractory fluid overload or hyperkalemia).

Glucose Control

Recommendation

69. For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend initiating insulin therapy at a glucose level of ≥ 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L).

Remark:

Following initiation of an insulin therapy, a typical target blood glucose range is 144-180 mg/dL (8-10 mmol/L).

Evans et al

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycemia  (>  180mg/dL),  hypoglycemia  and increased  glycemic  variability  are  associated  with increased  mortality  in  critically  ill  patients  (509511).  The  American  Diabetes  Association,  in  its most  recent  recommendations  for  glycemic  control of  critically  ill  patients,  recommended  the  initiation of insulin therapy for persistent hyperglycemia > 180 mg/dL and thereafter a target glucose range of 140-180 mg/dL (512).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In a single-center study, targeting blood glucose to 80-110 mg/dL reduced ICU mortality (513), however this  finding  was  not  reproduced  in  subsequent  multicenter RCTs (514, 515). Meta-analyses also report a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (glucose < 40 mg/dL) in critically patients where blood glucose was targeted to  80-110 mg/dL  (516,  517).  The  previous  recommendation  to  commence  insulin  when  two  consecutive  blood  glucose  levels  are  >  180 mg/dL  derives from  the  NICE-SUGAR  trial  (518).  A  summary  of the evidence for this trigger of > 180 mg/dL is found in Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 5. In this version of the guideline, we asked a new question: in adults with sepsis of septic shock, what level of glucose should trigger one to start an insulin infusion (> 180 or > 150 mg/dL)?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We  identified  a  recent  network  meta-analysis  of 35  RCTs  (519).  The  analysis  compared  four  different  blood glucose targets (< 110, 110-144, 144-180, and > 180 mg/dL). No significant difference in the risk of  hospital  mortality  was  observed  between  the  four blood glucose ranges. Target concentrations of < 110 and  110-144 mg/dL  were  associated  with  a  four-  to nine-fold  increase  in  the  risk  of  hypoglycemia  compared with 144-180 and > 180 mg/dL. No significant difference  in  the  risk  of  hypoglycemia  comparing  a target of 144-180 and > 180 mg/dL was demonstrated (OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.79-3.7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate  (Supplemental  Digital  Content:  Appendix  5). Overall, the balance of effects favored initiation of insulin  therapy  at  a  glucose  level  of  >  180 mg/dl.  This was principally driven by the increased risk of hypoglycemia observed with lower targets. No significant differences existed between the two-insulin initiation blood glucose levels evaluated. After considering the resources required, cost, health equity issues, and applicability to low- and middle-income economies, the panel made a strong recommendation for the initiation of insulin therapy at a glucose level of ≥ 180 mg/ dL (10 mmol/L).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Further research is indicated to: (1) identify which technologies  including  electronic  glucose  management,  continuous  glucose  monitoring,  and  closed loop systems, can more safely achieve better glycemic control and lower rates of hypoglycemia; and (2) determine the optimal glycemic control for different patient  populations  including  diabetic  and  nondiabetic patients, medical and surgical patients.

Vitamin C

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
70. For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using IV vitamin C.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vitamin C is known to have anti-inflammatory properties (520). In 2017, a single center before and after study reported shorter duration of vasopressor therapy and  lower  mortality  following  the  administration  of combination of high dose vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine to patients with sepsis and septic shock (521). Our literature review found one systematic review  and  meta-analysis  (522)  (containing  six  RCTs) and one additional RCT (523).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our updated analysis (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 5) included seven RCTs (416 critically ill patients). The use of vitamin C did not reduce mortality compared to usual care (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.1, low quality). One study reported reduced vasopressor  use  at  168  hours  (523).  Of  the  patients alive  at  7  days,  22%  (16/72)  administered  vitamin  C remained  on  vasopressor  therapy  compared  to  10% (6/59) of controls.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subsequent  to  the  censor  date  for  our  literature search, the results of two additional RCTs of Vitamin C  versus  placebo  were  published  (524,  525).  In  the study by Fujii et al (524), 211 adults with septic shock were  randomized  to  the  combination  of  vitamin  C, hydrocortisone, and thiamine vs hydrocortisone alone. The authors reported no difference for the primary outcome of time alive and free of vasopressors up  to  168  hours  between  the  intervention  and  control group (median 122.1 hr [IQR, 76.3-145.4 hr] vs

124.6 hr  [IQR,  82.1-147  hr]; p =  0.83).  Ninety-day mortality was 28.6% (30/105) in the vitamin C group, and 24.5% (25/102) in the control group (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.69 to 2.0). In the study by Moskowitz et al (525), 200 patients were randomized to a combination of vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine vs placebo. No difference in the primary outcome of mean SOFA score at 72 hours post enrollment was observed. At 30 days, 34.7% (35/101) of patients randomized to combination therapy had died vs. 29.3% (29/99) randomized to placebo (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.2; p = 0.26). When these data are added to our meta-analysis, the point estimate for mortality becomes RR, 0.9 (95% CI, 0.69-1.18: low quality).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The overall size of any desirable effect was judged as small with a low quality of evidence (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 5). There are limited available data of any undesirable effects: it was noted that the point estimate of the HR for 90-day mortality in the largest RCT (524) was 1.18 (95% CI, 0.69-2.00) i.e., favoring the control group. The balance of effects was accordingly judged as favoring neither the intervention  nor  the  comparator.  The  intervention  itself requires limited resources and is feasible in low- and middle-income economies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  panel  issued  a  weak  recommendation  against the use of vitamin C in patients with sepsis and septic shock. The results of ongoing RCTs may influence the quality of evidence and future updates of the guidelines.

Bicarbonate Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
71. For adults with septic shock and hypoperfusioninduced lactic acidemia, we suggest against using sodium bicarbonate therapy to improve hemodynamics or to reduce vasopressor requirements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with septic shock, severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7 .2) and AKI (AKIN score 2 or 3), we suggest using sodium bicarbonate therapy. Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  previous  guidance  was  based  on  two  small, blinded  crossover  RCTs  that  compared  equimolar  saline  vs  sodium  bicarbonate  in  patients  with lactic acidosis and failed to reveal any difference in hemodynamic variables or vasopressor requirements (526,  527).  A  weak  recommendation  was  made against  the  use  of  bicarbonate  therapy  to  improve hemodynamics  or  to  reduce  vasopressor  requirements in patients with hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia with pH ≥ 7.15.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our  literature  search  identified  one  new  RCT (528). In this multicenter trial, 400 patients with severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.20) were randomly allocated  to  receive  IV  4.2%  sodium  bicarbonate with the aim of achieving an arterial pH of 7.3, or control (no bicarbonate). No between-group difference was observed in the primary outcome of a composite of 28-day mortality and organ failure at day 7. However,  hypernatremia,  hypocalcemia,  and  metabolic  alkalosis  were  observed  more  frequently  in those randomized to bicarbonate. In the subgroup of patients with AKI defined as AKI Network (AKIN) stage 2 or 3 at randomization (182/389-47%), lower mortality  was  observed  with  bicarbonate  therapy: control 57/90 (63%), bicarbonate (42/92, 46%), absolute risk reduction (ARR) -17·7% (-33·0 to -2·3), p =  0·016.  There was a significant differential effect between patients with an AKIN score of 2 or 3 compared with those with a score of 0-1 ( p value for heterogeneity = 0.023).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis was present in 61% (238/389) of patients at the time of randomization. No differential effect was observed between patients with vs without sepsis. The outcomes of patients with both sepsis and AKI were not reported.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall, the quality of evidence is low (Supplemental  Digital  Content:  Appendix  5).  The summary  of  judgements  supported  a  weak  recommendation  against  the  intervention.  The  2016  recommendation  is essentially unchanged. However, when  considering  the  subset  of  patients  with  septic shock,  severe  metabolic  acidosis  and  AKI,  the  balance of effects probably favors IV bicarbonate. A weak recommendation for the use of IV bicarbonate in this population was made.

The early administration of enteral nutrition in patients with sepsis and septic shock has potential physiologic advantages related to the maintenance of gut integrity and prevention of intestinal permeability, dampening of the inflammatory response, and modulation of metabolic  responses  that  may  reduce  insulin  resistance (529, 530). Our literature search defined early enteral nutrition  as  enteral  nutrition  commenced  within  72 hours of ICU admission. The comparator was enteral nutrition commenced after 72 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The literature search identified one new RCT (531). This  multicenter  trial  conducted  in  44  French  ICUs randomized  2,410  invasively  mechanically  ventilated patients with shock to early enteral nutrition vs early parenteral nutrition. Of those participants, 1,504 (62%) had sepsis. The results of this trial were included in a meta-analysis with four relevant trials from the 2016 guidelines  (532-535).  No  significant  effect  favoring early enteral nutrition was observed for all outcomes evaluated. The quality of evidence was assessed low or very low: downgrades were for risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  overall  balance  of  effects  did  not  favor  either early enteral feeding (within 72 hours) compared with enteral feeding commenced after that time. Although the available evidence is of low quality, it does not suggest  harm  following  the  institution  of  early  enteral feeding.  Neither  intervention  was  considered  more beneficial when considering resources utilization, cost effectiveness, and equity issues. The institution of early enteral nutrition was also considered feasible in lowand middle-income economies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given  the  plausible  possibility  of  benefit  when considering  the  available  physiological  data,  and  the absence of any apparent harm, a weak recommendation to start feeding early in patients with sepsis and septic  shock  was  made.  Further  research  addressing this question in patients with sepsis and septic shock is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LONG-TERM OUTCOMES AND GOALS OF CARE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  who  survive  a  protracted  period  of  ICU  care for sepsis typically face a long and complicated road to recovery. There will not only be physical rehabilitation challenges to overcome but also great uncertainty about the way to organize and coordinate care, both to promote recovery/avoid complications/recurrence and to ensure care is matched to patient and family goals of care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is broad consensus that the current healthcare system is likely falling short of what optimal care during the recovery period might look like for this patient population. However, generating a robust evidence base upon which to make concrete recommendations about changes in the care paradigm has proven to be extraordinarily difficult. Some of the difficulties relate to:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 not all patients are the same, and understanding which patients ought to receive which interventions is very poor;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 not all healthcare delivery systems are the sameeven within one system, some patients may be very well supported while others may not-really complicating what 'control' care looks like;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 lack of understanding about dosing and intensity of many of the proposed interventions, and when and whether they should be combined in packages is generally missing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
While these issues of patient heterogeneity, variable control care, and lack of understanding about ideal configuration of interventions are protean, they are exquisitely true in this setting: while two ICUs may be different, each ICU discharges patients into a broad and variable milieu of settings. The variation in both ICU and postICU management of critically ill patients increases the complexity of understanding and defining best practice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thus, putting all this together, there are some overarching  conceptual  features  about  'best  practice'  that the panel endorses, recognizing, however, that the nature, timing, and combination of these broad aspects of care may vary, and strong unambiguous evidence for the 'how to' for these things is often going to be lacking.

Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with sepsis or septic shock are at high risk of multi-organ  failure,  long-term  functional  sequelae, and death. Some patients may accept any and all treatments  for  their  condition,  but  others  may  consider limitations depending on prognosis, invasiveness of  interventions,  and  predicted  quality  of  life  (QoL). A discussion of goals of care and prognosis is essential to determine which treatments are acceptable and those interventions that are not desired (536).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There were no studies identified that compared discussions of goals of care and prognosis versus no such discussion in critically ill or septic patients. While advance care planning in patients with life-limiting illness  may  reduce  use  of  life-sustaining  treatments,  it may also increase  use  of  hospice  and  palliative  care, and  improve  concordance  between  treatment  and patient  values  (537).  The  relevance  of  advance  care planning for future health needs to goals of care discussions  at  the  time  of  a  critical  illness  is  unclear. Despite lack of evidence, the panel recognized that discussion of prognosis and exploration of goals of care with patients and/or family is a necessary precondition to  determine  patient  treatment  preferences  and  providing value-concordant care. Thus, the panel made a best practice recommendation to discuss goals of care and prognosis with patients and families.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The timing of discussions of goals of care and prognosis  in  the  ICU  was  addressed  in  one  study  where 26% of patients had infection or sepsis as a primary diagnosis (538). A multicomponent family support intervention included a meeting at 48 hours after ICU admission  that  included  discussion  of  goals  of  care and prognosis. The support intervention did not affect family  psychological  outcomes  but  did  improve  perceived  quality  of  communication  and  perception  of patient- and family-centeredness of care. A reduction in ICU length of stay was noted, yet it is unknown if the reduction is due to increased mortality. Based on this study, early (within 72 hours of ICU admission) discussion of the goals of care is suggested.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We identified  several  studies  exploring  the  use  of specific criteria to trigger a goals of care discussion in critically ill patients, though none report the proportion  of  patients  with  sepsis  or  septic  shock.  Conflict over values-based treatment was used to trigger ethics  consultation  in  the  intervention  group  in  three randomized  ICU  studies  (539-541).  Reductions  in ICU and ventilator days in intervention patients who died before hospital discharge were found in two studies (539, 540), and the third study found overall shorter ICU and hospital stay in the ethics consultation group (541). Ethics consultation did not affect overall mortality in any study. Duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of ICU stay were used to trigger specific interventions  in  two  randomized  studies  (542,  543). The study by Carson et al randomized patients after 7 days of mechanical ventilation to a group receiving an informational brochure, and two family meetings with palliative care specialists to address goals of care or a group receiving an informational brochure and meetings led by the ICU team (543). Palliative care meetings failed to show benefit in decreasing anxiety and depression in surrogate decision makers in the intervention  group  but  did  increase  post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. There was no benefit demonstrated on family satisfaction, ICU days, or hospital days. Andereck et al randomized patients after 5 days or more in a medical-surgical ICU to proactive ethics consultation versus usual care (542). Ethics consultation did not result in a reduction in ICU stay, hospital stay, or life-sustaining treatments in patients who did not survive to discharge. Neither study demonstrated an effect of interventions on mortality. One study (544) investigated  the  use  of  an  automated  early  warning system alert in patients hospitalized on medical units (27% with infection). The early warning system did not impact hospital mortality or hospital length of stay but did reduce ICU transfers and ICU length of stay and increased documentation of advance directives and resuscitation status compared to the usual care group.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the variety of triggers used in these studies and  the  lack  of  superiority  of  any  single  trigger,  no recommendation can be made for specific criteria to initiate  a  goals  of  care  discussion.  The  timing of and triggers for such discussions should take into consideration the current condition of the patient, premorbid health  and  QoL,  prognosis,  response  to  treatment, interventions  under  consideration,  anticipated  QoL following  treatment,  availability of resources,  and readiness and ability of the patient or family to engage in the discussion.

Palliative Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend integrating principles of palliative care (which may include palliative care consultation based on clinician judgement) into the treatment plan, when appropriate, to address patient and family symptoms and suffering. Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against routine formal palliative care consultation for all patients over palliative care consultation based on clinician judgement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
While the goal of treating most patients with sepsis or septic shock is to improve survival, some patients have significant comorbidities that may be life limiting or significantly impair QoL. Palliative (supportive) care may  be  particularly  helpful  in  patients  with  sepsis who  are  not  responding  to  treatment  or  for  whom sepsis  is  an  end-stage  manifestation  of  their  underlying chronic illness. Studies have evaluated palliative care interventions in the ICU but not specifically in patients with sepsis (543, 545-548). However, indirect evidence from these studies was judged likely to apply to patients with sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Criteria  for  patient  inclusion  and  the  interventions in these studies demonstrate significant heterogeneity. Inclusion criteria for ICU patients consisted of mechanical ventilation for 7 days (543), high risk on  a  palliative  care  screen  (548),  physician  determination  that  care  should  not  be  escalated  or  care should be withdrawn (545), physician belief that the patient would die in a few days (547), or death in the ICU or within 30 hours of transfer out of the ICU (546). Interventions comprised formal palliative care consultation (543, 545, 548), a complex quality improvement project to improve end-of-life care (546), and a planned end-of-life conference conducted by intensivists  according  to  specific  guidelines  along with a bereavement brochure (547).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Various  outcome  measures  are  reported  but  none of the studies evaluated critical patient-centered outcomes  such  as  QoL,  physical  or  cognitive  recovery, psychological outcomes, or symptoms. Only one study with  a  structured  palliative  care  intervention  (547) demonstrated  a  beneficial  effect  of  lower  prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms and PTSD symptoms  in  family  members  90  days  after  the  patient's death. In contrast, Carson et al. found an increase in PTSD symptoms in family surrogate decision makers with palliative care consultation (543). Palliative care interventions had no significant impact on family satisfaction with care, ICU length of stay (543, 545-548), hospital  length  of  stay  (543,  545,  548),  or  mortality (543, 545, 548).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall evidence for routine formal palliative care interventions  in  ICU  patients  is  of  low  quality  and provides  mixed  evidence  of  benefit.  Thus,  the  panel suggests against routine formal palliative care consultation for all patients with sepsis or septic shock, instead  using  clinician  judgment  to  determine  which patients and families may benefit from a palliative care consultation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite  the  lack  of  evidence  for  formal  palliative care consultation, the panel and public members judged that  the  principles  of  palliative  care,  whether instituted by palliative care specialists, intensivists or other clinicians are essential to address symptoms and suffering in patients and their families. Therefore, the panel made a best practice statement recommending incorporation of palliative care principles in the care of patients with sepsis and septic shock.

Peer Support Groups

For adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock and their families, we suggest referral to peer support groups over no such referral.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
care  and  sepsis  (549-551).  With  increased  recognition of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) in survivors of critical illness and their families, peer support represents  a  patient-centered  approach  to  improve long-term  outcomes  (552,  553).  Public  members suggested that referral to an individual peer support person  during  the  sepsis  hospitalization  may  provide a means of support and hope for recovery while referring sepsis survivors and their families to a peer support group may help them regain functional and emotional health.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Models of peer support are numerous and include community-based in person or virtual peer support; outpatient  ICU  follow-up  clinics  (with  or  without psychologist support); within-ICU peer support; and individual  peer  mentors  (551).  We  did  not  identify sufficient studies to allow for meta-analysis. Four observational studies examined the impact of peer support groups on ICU patients, though they were not specific  to  sepsis  patients.  These  studies  evaluated the impact of peer support in ICU survivors from a surgical ICU (554), two general ICUs (555-557) and two cardiac ICUs (555, 558). Group models varied, with facilitated in-person (554, 557), group-based integrated with rehabilitation (555, 556) or a 'buddy' with  a  former  patient-to-patient  program  (558).  In several  qualitative  studies,  ICU  survivors  described peer support as a helpful aid to recovery (559-563). Three  qualitative  studies  identified  two  common themes  of  peer  support,  1)  benefit  of  knowing  that others  shared  similar  experiences  and  2)  benefit  of shared coping with others (564).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall quality of evidence was judged to be very low for the impact of peer support groups on outcomes. No studies described costs associated with support groups, which will vary given the model and resource availability. Research evaluating support groups is needed with at least two RCTs planned (564-566).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the very low certainty of evidence, the panel made  a  weak  recommendation  in  favor  of  referring patients  and  families  to  peer  support,  which  will  increase the equity of access to such services. As individuals who receive referral to peer support have the choice to participate or not (based on personal preference, timing, location, functional status, and resources required) a weak recommendation provides an opportunity to access support for sepsis survivors who otherwise may not know where to turn (552).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transitions of Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using a handoff process of critically important information at transitions of care, over no such handoff process. Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for the use of any specific structured handoff tool over usual handoff processes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transitions of care are prone to communication errors, which have been identified as a barrier to the timely detection and management of sepsis (567). Improving handoff at transitions in care represents an opportunity  to  improve  patient  outcomes  across  the  entire spectrum of sepsis care, from hospitalization to return to the community.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We did not identify any studies specifically evaluating patients with sepsis. Structured handoff interventions  for  critically  ill  patients  have  been evaluated  at  many  transitions  of  patient  care  (ED/ ICU, OR/ICU, ICU/ward, and hospital/home). The majority are observational pre-post studies and report  process  measures  such  as  completeness  and accuracy  of  communication  rather  than  clinical outcomes. There were insufficient data to allow for meta-analysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A single RCT using a stepped-wedge design in eight ICUs evaluated the impact of a standardized handoff process, finding no effect upon duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay or duration of handover (568).  Observational  studies  of  structured  handoff process have demonstrated mixed effects, with some finding reductions in unexpected clinical events (569), or ICU readmission (570, 571) and others without impact upon length of stay (572), mortality (572, 573) or hospital readmission (572, 573).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall quality of evidence was judged to be very low.  While  it  is  unclear  whether  structured  handoffs impact important patient outcomes, many sepsis interventions  and  tests  are  time-dependent  and  communication  failures  may  increase  the  chances  of  critical medical errors. Structured handoff processes appear to result in more complete and accurate transfer of information, without any undesirable effects. Thus, despite the low certainty of evidence, the panel made a weak

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
recommendation in favor of structured handoff processes at transitions of care. Of the structured handover tools studied, none specifically applies to sepsis. Given  the  wide  variety  of  hospital  staffing  models, medical records, and discharge processes, along with the lack of evidence to recommend any one tool over another, the panel chose to make no recommendation for a specific structured handover tool.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Screening for Economic or Social Support

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
82. For adults with sepsis or septic shock and their families, we recommend screening for economic and social support (including housing, nutritional, financial, and spiritual support), and make referrals where available to meet these needs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonmedical  social  needs  and  potentially  modifiable factors such as economic and social support largely influence health outcomes. While survival from sepsis is improving, long-term health requires survivors to have the resources to recover and thrive. Notably, critically ill  patients  have  a  decline  in  socio-economic  status (SES)  after  their  illness  (574).  Many  observational studies describe the relationship between various socioeconomic supports and patient outcomes that suggest that  low  SES,  substance  abuse  and  poor  nutritional status lead to poor outcomes, and that critical illness itself results in lower SES post-illness. Additionally, living in neighborhoods with low SES is associated with an increased risk of sepsis (575), community-acquired bacteremia  (575)  and  death  from  bacteremia  (576) and worse outcomes (577). Racial disparities in sepsis (578) are at least partially explained by living in medically underserved neighborhoods (579).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Screening  for  economic  and  social  support  may help reduce these inequities. Although socioeconomic screening is considered part of standard clinical practice, all clinical teams in many settings may not do it. This may be particularly true in the critical care setting where patients are often unable to communicate, and social  determinants  of  health  may  not  be  addressed during management of the acute illness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No  studies  were  identified  comparing  screening versus no screening for economic and social support.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Furthermore, it is unlikely that many research studies would be conducted, since locally available social needs and supports vary. In LMIC where resources are limited, needs may be vast. Despite these variations, social and economic screening may identify challenges that sepsis  survivors  are  experiencing,  allowing  clinicians to identify potential resources and referrals, which can assist to improve long-term health outcomes.

Sepsis Education for Patients and Families

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adults with sepsis or septic shock and their families, we suggest offering written and verbal sepsis education (diagnosis, treatment, and post-ICU/postsepsis syndrome) prior to hospital discharge and in the follow-up setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost  40%  of  sepsis  survivors  are  re-hospitalized within  3  months,  often  for  preventable  conditions (580), contributing to increased healthcare costs (581). Given the risk of post-sepsis morbidity, sepsis education may have a role in the timely healthcare seeking behavior in sepsis survivors who experience complications. In an international survey of sepsis survivors from 41 countries, 45% and 63% reported dissatisfaction with sepsis education at the acute and post-acute phase, respectively (582). We identified six RCTs that evaluated  educational  interventions  for  critically  ill patients  and  their  families  (583-588).  Only  one  specifically studied patients with sepsis (588), evaluating a complex intervention, which included education along with primary care follow-up and post-discharge monitoring.  Varied  education  methods  were  employed, including delivery by trained nurses (586, 588), multimedia nursing education (585), information booklets developed by nurses (584), a family information leaflet (583),  and  informational  videos  with  accompanying web-based content (587).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
These studies provided limited data for review. ICU education  did  not  appear  to  impact  patients'  anxiety and depression (584, 586, 588), but did improve families' satisfaction with care (583). The panel judged that  education  would  likely  have  variable  acceptability, as a qualitative study showed that patients who survived sepsis had diverse viewpoints ranging from

appreciating the education about sepsis to not being able to recall the education session, to even disliking it as a reminder of the severity of their condition (587). Based  on  these  data  and  feedback  from  the  public panel, we suggest that multiple opportunities for education be offered prior to hospital discharge and in the follow-up setting, taking into account the patients' and/or  families'  readiness  to  process  information. Sepsis  education  is  regarded  as  a  low  cost  intervention  and  feasible,  even  in  low-resource  settings,  as  a number of online and published sepsis education resources exist (589). Future studies are needed to better understand the effects, the cost-effectiveness, and the optimal approach for educating patients and families after sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Shared Decision Making

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Shared  decision  making  (SDM)  is  a  process  in  which health professionals, patients and their caregivers collaborate in making decisions about a patient's care options (590). This patient-centered approach may be less routinely used in post-ICU and hospital discharge planning than  in  other  aspects  of  acute  patient  care.  No  studies were identified that compared SDM with other types of ICU or hospital discharge planning. Despite the lack of evidence,  SDM  in  discharge  planning  as  in  other  care decisions is more likely to result in decisions consistent with the values and preferences of the patient and family. Patient  and  family  involvement  in  discharge  planning may also  increase  family  satisfaction.  A  small  study  of ICU  relatives  found  that  anxiety  and  depression  rates were lower in those who preferred an active role or shared responsibility  in  decision-making  compared  to  those who preferred a passive role (591). A family care conference with nursing staff at the time of discharge from the ICU resulted in lower anxiety scores for family members compared to a control group although it is not clear that families participated in SDM (592). Family caregivers of critically ill patients discharged home felt overwhelmed and  unprepared  and  had  difficulty  managing  expectations (593). Communication through SDM at the time of  ICU  or  hospital  discharge  may  improve  support  for family  caregivers  as  communication  was  found  to  be important  to  decision-making  for  family  surrogates  of chronic critically ill patients (594). Studies of tools employed to promote SDM in patients with other serious illnesses show improved patient knowledge and awareness of treatment options (595). Due to the potential benefits of  SDM  and  the  current  emphasis  on  patient-centered care, the opportunity for patients and/or family to participate in SDM for ICU and hospital discharge planning is recommended as a best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Discharge Planning

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transfer from ICU to general floor and discharge from the  hospital  are  both  vulnerable  periods  for  patients, with high frequency of medication errors and information loss (596-602). Sepsis patients, with longer than average hospitalizations and higher comorbidity burden, may be at particular risk for poor outcomes with transitions. Several studies, mostly before-and-after design, have examined the impact of critical care transition programs on reducing ICU readmission or death among patients  transferred  from  ICU  to  the  ward  (597,  601, 603-611).  These  programs  have  used  varied  models, but generally involve ICU clinicians (e.g., nurse, respiratory  therapist,  and/or  physician)  following  patients daily on the wards after transferring out of the ICU for a

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
few days or until clinically stable. Meta-analysis of these studies  suggests  that  critical  care  transition  programs reduce risk of in-hospital mortality and potentially reduce risk of ICU readmission. Effects on ICU workload and workflow have not been systematically examined. Public  panel  members  were  supportive  of  such  programs, as they may provide reassurance and a sense of protection to patients after they leave the ICU.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medication reconciliation is broadly recognized to be important during patient transitions. Hospitalization and ICU  admission  are  high-risk  periods  for  unintentional medication error-both continuations of medications for temporary indications and unintentional discontinuations of  chronic  medications (596, 599, 600, 602). Medication reconciliation has been associated with fewer medication errors (598, 612) and may help reduce hospital readmission (613, 614). Given the frequency of medication changes during an ICU stay, we recommend reconciling medications at both ICU and hospital discharge. Medication reconciliation  surrounding  sepsis  hospitalization  involves getting the correct list of medications and adjusting medication dosing regularly in response to dynamic physiologic changes during and after critical illness (580).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Key information from hospitalization is often missing  on  hospital  discharge  documentation  (615-618). Information  on  post-intensive  care  syndrome  (PICS) may be provided to only one in three ICU survivors (550,  618).  We  recommend  providing  information about  the  ICU  stay,  sepsis  diagnosis,  key  treatments (e.g.,  mechanical ventilation, dialysis), and post-ICU/ post-sepsis syndrome. Public panel members stressed the importance of providing information in both verbal and  written  form  and  assessing  that  the  information was understood. There are a growing number of online resources and informational brochures regarding 'post intensive care'/'post-sepsis syndrome' (580), but more research is needed to determine the optimal approaches to  providing  anticipatory  guidance  to  patients  and families after critical illness (582, 619).

Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
89. There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on early post-hospital discharge follow-up compared to routine post-hospital discharge follow-up.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many sepsis survivors experience short and/or longterm sequela such as cognitive and/or physical disability, with ongoing recovery persisting for months to years (620). Public panelists rated cognitive and physical recovery, psychologic symptoms in survivors and their  families,  QoL  and  readmission  to  the  hospital and/or  ICU  as  critically  important  outcomes.  These outcomes were consistent with a 2019 qualitative analysis of health related QoL domains identified by sepsis survivors (621). Follow-up with a provider after hospital discharge is one-step in the recovery process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis survivors are at risk for hospital readmission, which  has  been  associated  with  increased  mortality or discharge to hospice (622, 623). Hospital readmission  within  90  days  of  discharge  occurs  in  approximately 40% of sepsis survivors and is associated with high costs (624). Additionally, sepsis survivors are at increased  risk  for  recurrent  infection,  AKI  and  new cardiovascular  events  compared  to  patients  hospitalized for other diagnoses (580). Observational studies in  patients  with  congestive  heart  failure  have  associated early (within 7-14 days) post-discharge follow-up with  reduced  hospital  readmissions  (625).  Among older  adults,  early  post  discharge  follow-up  (within 7 days) with a primary care physician was associated with lower risk of 30-day readmission (626, 627).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Three  studies,  one  RCT  (628)  and  two  observational studies (629, 630) evaluated early post-hospital follow-up in patients with critical illness. None of the three studies specifically evaluated a sepsis population or reported the proportion of sepsis patients. The interventions  and  QoL  measures  varied  among  the  three studies each with severe limitations. In an analysis of older adults with severe sepsis, one study found that the combination of early home health care and a visit with a medical provider was associated with a reduced readmission risk (631). There were insufficient studies to allow meta-analysis and the limited evidence is of very low quality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite  these  limitations,  the  panel  recommends follow-up  with  a  provider  after  hospital  discharge to  manage  new  impairments  associated  with  sepsis. Due to the low quality and lack of evidence specific to  sepsis,  we  are  unable  to  make  a  recommendation for  early  (7-14  days)  provider  follow-up  versus  routine follow-up upon hospital discharge. Timely, coordinated resources and provider follow-up may lead to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis is associated with newly acquired cognitive impairment and functional disability amongst survivors (620). Long-term impairments in memory, attention, verbal  fluency,  decision-making  and  executive  functioning  may  be  linked  to  a  variety  of  mechanisms such  as  metabolic  derangements,  cerebral  ischemia, overwhelming  inflammation,  disrupted  blood-brain barrier, oxidative stress, and severe microglial activation,  particularly  within  the  limbic  system  (632).  A feasibility, pilot, randomized trial in general medical/ surgical  ICU  survivors  comparing  usual  care  to  an intervention  of  combined  in-home  cognitive,  physical, and functional rehabilitation following discharge showed improved executive functioning at three months (633). Some small single center studies tested specific early cognitive therapies to enhance cognitive and  overall  functional  recovery  after  critical  illness (634, 635).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A proof-of-concept single-center pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the use of a multifaceted  early  intervention  (cognitive  therapy  within ICU) in patients with respiratory failure and/or shock (634). ICU patients were randomized to receive either combined cognitive and physical therapy or physical therapy alone. The results demonstrated that the intervention was feasible and safe, but the study was underpowered  and  therefore  inconclusive  regarding  its clinical effects on cognitive function and health-related QoL outcomes  at  3-month  follow-up.  In  addition,  a prospective cohort study testing a series of cognitive training sessions starting in the ICU and continued for up to two months, found overall minimal clinical relevance  as  Minimum  Clinically  Important  Difference (MID)  of  Montreal  Cognitive  Assessment  (MOCA) was  small,  with  some  meaningful  results  in  younger patients, but not in the middle-aged or older population (635, 636).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In view of these findings, the panel judged there to be  insufficient  evidence  to  make  a  recommendation. In  centers  where  cognitive  therapy  is  used,  it  could reasonably be continued as it is likely acceptable and feasible,  but  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  change practice in centers without such therapy. Further larger studies  in  patients  with  sepsis  are  required  to  determine the impact of early cognitive therapy, as well as costs and type of intervention.

Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock, we recommend assessment and follow-up for physical, cognitive, and emotional problems after hospital discharge. Best practice statement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock, we suggest referral to a post-critical illness follow-up program if available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock receiving mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours or an ICU stay of > 72 hours, we suggest referral to a post-hospital rehabilitation program.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rationale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given  the  prevalence  of  new  or  worsening  physical, cognitive,  and  emotional  problems  experienced  by sepsis  survivors  (580,  620),  we  recommend  assessment and follow-up for these problems after hospital discharge.  There  are  insufficient  data  to  suggest  any specific tool to assess for these problems, and the optimal approach will vary by patient and setting. At a minimum, physicians should ask patients and families about new problems in these domains.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Post-critical  illness  programs  have  been  developed as a means of screening for and addressing the multifaceted issues faced by ICU survivors. These programs vary in their structure, and are not consistently available  worldwide  (637).  Few  randomized  studies  have assessed post-critical illness clinics (588, 628, 638, 639), and-consistent with a recent Cochrane review (640)our  meta-analysis  found  no  differences  from  usual care  in  terms  of  mortality,  QoL,  physical  function,  or

cognition, with possible small improvements in psychological  symptoms  (anxiety,  depression,  PTSD).  More studies of post-sepsis follow-up programs are in process (641, 642). We suggest offering referral to post-critical illness  clinics  where  available.  While  efficacy  data  are equivocal,  these  programs  are  consistently  well-liked by  patients  and  offer  an  environment  to  learn  about challenges sepsis survivors face, as well as to pilot and test  interventions  for  enhancing  recovery  (637,  643). Lessons  learned  in  post-critical  care  clinics  could  be adapted  to  other,  more-scalable  interventions  such  as telehealth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several randomized studies have assessed physical rehabilitation programs for survivors of critical illness  (581,  606,  644-651).  These  studies  focused on critically ill patients, generally defined by days in ICU or days with mechanical ventilation and begin on the floor or post-hospital setting. Meta-analysis suggests possible small improvements in QoL and depressive  symptoms,  but  no  difference  in  mortality,  physical  function,  or  anxiety.  Nonetheless, based on their strong rationale, and benefit in related  populations  (580)  (e.g.,  older  patients  with cognitive impairment, patients following stroke or traumatic  brain  injury),  we  suggest  referral  to  rehabilitation  programs  in  survivors  of  sepsis.  This suggestion  is  consistent  with  the  guidance  of  several expert panels (646, 652, 653). Future research is needed to determine an optimal approach to functional rehabilitation (timing, dosing, intensity, duration) and patient selection (643).

There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of noninvasive ventilation in comparison to invasive ventilation for adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure.                                                        | No recommendation                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
