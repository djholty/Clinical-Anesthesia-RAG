Patients with preoperative respiratory diseases are at increased risk of perioperative respiratory complications. Th ere is increasing awareness of the importance of postoperative pulmonary complications in contributing to morbidity, mortality, and  increased  hospital  length  of  stay.  Pulmonary  complications  also  play  an  important  part  in  determining  long-term mortality  a ft er  surgery.  Modi fi cation  of  disease  severity  and optimization of the patient's condition before surgery signi fi -cantly decrease the incidence of these complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory  diseases  can  be  divided  into  the  following groups  for  discussion  of  their  in fl uence on anesthetic  management:  acute  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute respiratory failure, restrictive lung disease, pulmonary embolism, and lung transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Every year approximately 25 million patients visit their doctors with an uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Th e common cold syndrome results in about 20 million days of absence from work and 22 million days of absence from school. It is likely, then, that there will be a population of patients scheduled for elective surgery who have an active URI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious  (viral  or  bacterial)  nasopharyngitis  accounts for  approximately  95%  of  all  URIs,  with  the  most  common

responsible viruses being rhinovirus, coronavirus, in fl uenzavirus, parain fl uenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Noninfectious nasopharyngitis is allergic and vasomotor in origin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with nasopharyngitis present with a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms. Sneezing, runny nose, and a history of allergies point to an allergic cause. When nasopharyngitis is associated with infection, there is usually a history of fever, purulent  nasal  discharge,  productive  cough,  fever,  and  malaise. On examination, the patient may be tachypneic or wheezing or show signs of toxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of a URI is usually based on clinical signs and symptoms.  Although  viral  cultures  and  laboratory  tests  are available to con fi rm the diagnosis, they lack sensitivity and are impractical in a busy clinical setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  studies  regarding  the  e ff ects  of  URI  on  postoperative complications have involved pediatric patients. Th ere is  evidence  to  show  an  increased  incidence  of  respiratory  complications  in  patients  with  a  history  of  copious  secretions, endotracheal intubation, prematurity, parental smoking, nasal congestion, and reactive airway disease and in those undergoing airway surgery. Th ose with clear systemic signs of infection  such  as  fever,  purulent  rhinitis,  productive  cough,  and rhonchi who are undergoing elective surgery, particularly airway surgery, are at considerable risk of perioperative adverse events. Consultation with the surgeon regarding the urgency of the case must be undertaken. A patient who has had a URI for days or weeks and is in stable or improving condition can be  safely  managed  without  postponing  surgery.  Delaying surgery does not reduce the incidence of adverse respiratory events if the patient undergoes anesthesia within 4 weeks of the URI. Airway hyperreactivity may require 6 weeks or more to abate. Th e economic and practical aspects of canceling surgery should be taken into consideration before a decision is made to postpone surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Viral infections, particularly during the infectious phase, can cause morphologic and functional changes in the respiratory epithelium. Th e relationship between epithelial damage, viral infection,  airway  reactivity,  and  anesthesia  remains  unclear. Tracheal mucociliary fl ow and pulmonary bactericidal activity can be decreased by general anesthesia. It is possible that positive pressure ventilation may help in spreading infection from the upper to the lower respiratory tract. Th e immune response of the body is altered by surgery and anesthesia. A reduction in B-lymphocyte numbers, T-lymphocyte responsiveness, and antibody  production  may  be  associated  with  anesthesia,  but the clinical signi fi cance of this remains to be elucidated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anesthetic  management of  a  patient  with  a  URI  should include adequate hydration, reducing secretions, and limiting manipulation of a potentially sensitive airway. Use of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may be a good alternative to endotracheal intubation to reduce the risk of bronchospasm from airway manipulation. Th e role of prophylactic administration of  bronchodilators  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  perioperative bronchospasm has not been clearly established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reported  adverse  respiratory  events  in  patients  with  URIs include  bronchospasm,  laryngospasm,  airway  obstruction, postintubation croup, desaturation, and atelectasis. Long-term complications from general anesthesia in patients with URIs have not been demonstrated. Intraoperative and immediately postoperative hypoxemia is common and amenable to treatment with supplemental oxygen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASTHMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is a disease characterized by chronic airway in fl ammation, reversible expiratory air fl ow obstruction in response to  various  stimuli,  and  bronchial  hyperreactivity.  Data  from the  American  Academy  of  Allergy,  Asthma  and  Immunology indicate that an estimated 300 million people worldwide have asthma, and the prevalence is increasing. Some 250,000 deaths each year are attributed to the disease. Th e prevalence of asthma in adult women was 23% greater than the rate in men in 2006.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is an episodic disease with acute exacerbations interspersed with symptom-free periods. Most attacks are shortlived, lasting minutes to hours, and clinically the patient seems to recover completely a ft er an attack. However, there can be a phase in which the patient experiences some degree of airway obstruction daily. Th is phase can be mild, with or without superimposed  severe  episodes,  or  much  more  serious,  with signi fi cant  obstruction  persisting  for  days  or  weeks.  Status asthmaticus is de fi ned as life-threatening bronchospasm that persists  despite  treatment.  When  patient  history  is  elicited, attention should be paid to factors associated with increased risk, such as previous intubation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), two or more hospitalizations for asthma in the past year, and the presence of co-existing diseases. Clinical manifestations of asthma include wheezing, productive or nonproductive cough, dyspnea, chest discomfort or tightness that may lead to air hunger, and eosinophilia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and genetic (atopic) and environmental factors such as viruses, occupational exposure, and  allergens  contribute  to  its  initiation  and  continuance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
183

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stimuli  provoking  an  episode  of  asthma  are  summarized  in Table 9-1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Features that support the allergen-induced  immunologic model of the etiology of asthma include the following: (1) Atopy is the single greatest risk factor for the development of asthma. (2) A personal and/or family history of allergic diseases such as rhinitis, urticaria, and eczema is o ft en   present. (3) Th ere  is  usually  a  positive  wheal-andfl are  skin  reaction to  intradermal  injection  of  extracts  of  airborne  antigens. (4) Serum immunoglobulin E levels are increased and/or there is a positive response to provocative tests involving the inhalation  of  speci fi c  antigens.  (5)  Evidence  of  a  genetic  linkage between high total serum immunoglobulin E levels and atopy has been observed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  alternative  explanation  for  the  characteristic  features of asthma is abnormal autonomic regulation of neural function, speci fi cally an imbalance between excitatory (bronchoconstrictor) and inhibitory (bronchodilator) neural input. It is likely that chemical mediators released from mast cells interact with the autonomic nervous system. Some chemical mediators can stimulate airway receptors to trigger re fl ex bronchoconstriction, whereas other mediators sensitize bronchial smooth muscle to the e ff ects of acetylcholine. In addition, stimulation of  muscarinic  receptors  can  facilitate  mediator  release  from mast  cells,  providing  a  positive  feedback  loop  for  sustained in fl ammation and bronchoconstriction.

SPIROMETRY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 )  and maximum mid-expiratory fl ow (MMEF) rate are direct measures of the severity of expiratory air fl ow obstruction (Figure 9-1 and Tables 9-2 and 9-3).* Th ese measurements provide objective data that can be used to assess the severity and monitor the course of an exacerbation of asthma. Th e typical asthmatic patient who comes  to  the  hospital  for  treatment  has  an  FEV 1 that  is  less than 35% of normal and a MMEF that is 20% or less of normal. Flow-volume loops show characteristic downward scooping of the expiratory limb of the loop. Flow-volume loops in which the inhaled or exhaled portion of the loop is fl at help distinguish wheezing caused by airway obstruction (foreign body, tracheal stenosis, mediastinal tumor) from asthma (Figures 9-2 and 9-3). During  moderate  to  severe  asthmatic  attacks,  the  functional residual  capacity  (FRC)  may  increase  substantially,  but  total lung  capacity  usually  remains  within  the  normal  range.  Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide is not changed. Bronchodilator responsiveness can provide supporting evidence when asthma is suspected on clinical grounds. In patients with expiratory air fl ow obstruction, an increase in air fl ow a ft er inhalation of a bronchodilator suggests asthma. Abnormalities in pulmonary function test results may persist for several days a ft er an acute asthmatic attack despite the absence of symptoms. Since asthma is  an  episodic  illness,  its  diagnosis  may  be  suspected even when results of pulmonary function tests are normal.

CO is rapidly taken up by hemoglobin. Its transfer is therefore limited mainly by diffusion. A single breath of 0.3% CO and 10% helium is held for 20 sec. Expired partial pressure of CO is measured.

rather neural re fl exes in the lungs. Hypocarbia and respiratory alkalosis are the most common arterial blood gas fi ndings in the presence of asthma. As the severity of expiratory air fl ow obstruction  increases,  the  associated  ventilation/perfusion mismatching may result in a Pa o 2 of less than 60 mm Hg while breathing room air. Th e Pa co 2 is  likely to increase when the FEV1 is less than 25% of the predicted value. Fatigue of the skeletal muscles necessary for breathing may also contribute to the development of hypercarbia.

Th e di ff erential diagnosis of asthma includes viral tracheobronchitis, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis with bronchiolitis, and  extrinsic  compression  (thoracic  aneurysm,  mediastinal neoplasm) or intrinsic compression (epiglottitis, croup) of the upper  airway.  Upper  airway  obstruction  produces  a  characteristic fl ow-volume loop (see Figure 9-3). A history of recent trauma,  surgery,  or  tracheal  intubation  may  be  present  in patients  with  upper  airway  obstruction  mimicking  asthma. Congestive heart failure and pulmonary embolism may cause dyspnea  and  wheezing.  Wheezing  in  association  with  pulmonary  edema  has  been  characterized  as  "cardiac  asthma."

TABLE 9-4 ■ Pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of asthma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Historically, treatment of asthma has been directed at preventing and controlling bronchospasm with bronchodilator drugs. However,  recognition  of  the  consistent  presence  of  airway in fl ammation in patients with asthma has resulted in a change in pharmacologic therapy. Th e emphasis now is on preventing  and  controlling  bronchial  in fl ammation. Bronchodilator therapy does not in fl uence in fl ammatory changes in the airways and could mask underlying in fl ammation by relieving symptoms and allowing continued exposure to allergens. Th e various drugs used to treat asthma are listed in Table 9-4.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma  treatment  has  two  components. Th e fi rst  is  the use  of  "controller"  treatments,  which  modify  the  airway environment so that acute airway narrowing occurs less frequently. Controller treatments include inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, theophylline, and antileukotrienes. Th e other component  of  asthma  treatment  is  the  use  of  "reliever"  or rescue  agents  for  acute  bronchospasm.  Reliever  treatments include β -adrenergic agonists and  anticholinergic drugs. Al  buterol  is  the  inhaled β 2 -agonist  that  is  most  commonly used.  Levalbuterol,  the R -enantiomer  of  albuterol,  has  been used in emergency medicine and appears to be e ff ective at half the dose of racemic albuterol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium have a relatively slow onset of action and can be used along with short-acting β 2 -agonists  to  produce  a  prolonged  bronchodilatory  e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
186

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If oral corticosteroids are needed, the usual treatment is prednisone 40 to 80 mg/day given in a single dose or in two divided doses. Traditionally aminophylline was a mainstay in the treatment of asthma. However, it appears that the addition of intravenous aminophylline to therapy with inhaled β -agonists in adult patients with acute asthma provides no additional bene fi t and is associated with an increased frequency of adverse e ff ects.  Routine  use  of  antibiotics,  aggressive  hydration,  and administration of mucolytics are not recommended for acute exacerbations of asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serial determination of pulmonary function test values is useful  for  monitoring  the  response  to  treatment.  When  the FEV1 improves to about 50% of normal, patients usually have minimal or no symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STATUS ASTHMATICUS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Status asthmaticus is de fi ned as bronchospasm that does not resolve  despite  treatment  and  is  considered  life  threatening. Emergency treatment of status asthmaticus consists of intermittent or continuous administration of β 2 -agonists by inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler or a nebulizer. β 2 -Agonists can be administered every 15 to 20 minutes for several doses without  signi fi cant  adverse  hemodynamic  e ff ects,  although patients may experience unpleasant sensations resulting from adrenergic overstimulation. Continuous rather than intermittent administration of β 2 -agonists by nebulizer may be more e ff ective for delivery of these drugs to relieve airway spasm. Intravenous  corticosteroids  are  administered  early  in  treatment, because it takes several hours for their e ff ect to appear. Th e corticosteroids most commonly selected are (1) cortisol 2 mg/kg IV followed by 0.5 mg/kg/hr by infusion, and (2) methylprednisolone 60 to 125 mg IV every 6 hours. Supplemental  oxygen  is  administered  to  help  maintain  arterial  oxygen saturation above 90%. Other drugs used in intractable cases include  magnesium  sulfate  and  oral  leukotriene  inhibitors. Studies of the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate indicate that  it  may  signi fi cantly  improve  lung  function  and  reduce rates of hospital admission in children. Th e National Asthma Education  and  Prevention  Program  Expert  Panel  and  the Global Initiative for Asthma have the most recent evidencebased guidelines for treatment of asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurements  of  lung  function  can  be  very  helpful  in assessing the severity of status asthmaticus and the response to treatment. Patients whose FEV 1 or peak expiratory fl ow rate is decreased to 25% of normal or less are at risk of the development of hypercarbia and respiratory failure. Th e presence of hypercarbia (Pa co 2 >  50  mm  Hg)  despite  aggressive  antiinfl ammatory and bronchodilator therapy is a sign of respiratory fatigue that requires tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Th e pattern of mechanical ventilation is particularly important in the patient with status asthmaticus. Because of the bronchoconstriction, high peak airway pressures may be required to deliver acceptable tidal volumes. High gas fl ows allow for a shorter inspiratory time and a longer time for exhalation. Th e  expiratory phase must be prolonged to allow for complete exhalation and to prevent self-generated or intrinsic positive  end-expiratory  pressure  (auto-PEEP).  To  prevent barotrauma, some recommend a degree of permissive hypercarbia. When the FEV 1 or peak expiratory fl ow rate improves to 50% of normal or more, patients usually have minimal or no  symptoms.  At  this  point,  the  frequency  and  intensity  of bronchodilator therapy can be decreased, and weaning from mechanical ventilation can ensue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When a patient's status asthmaticus is resistant to therapy, it  is  likely  that  the  expiratory  air fl ow  obstruction  is  caused predominantly by airway edema and intraluminal secretions. Indeed, patients with status asthmaticus are at risk of asphyxia due  to  the  presence  of  mucus-plugged  airways.  In  rare  circumstances, when life-threatening status asthmaticus persists despite  aggressive  pharmacologic  therapy,  it  may  be  necessary to consider general anesthesia to produce bronchodilation. Halothane, en fl urane, iso fl urane, and sevo fl urane have all been described as e ff ective bronchodilators in this situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e occurrence of clinically signi fi cant "severe" bronchospasm has been reported in 0.2% to 4.2% of all procedures involving general anesthesia performed in asthmatic patients. Factors  that  are  more  signi fi cant  in  predicting  the  occurrence of  severe  bronchospasm  include  the  type  of  surgery  (risk  is higher with upper abdominal surgery and oncologic surgery) and the proximity of the most recent asthmatic attack to the date of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  could  explain  the contribution of general anesthesia to increased airway resistance. Among these are depression of the cough re fl ex, impairment of mucociliary function, reduction of palatopharyngeal muscle  tone,  depression  of  diaphragmatic  function,  and  an increase in the amount of fl uid on the airway wall. In addition,  direct  mechanical  airway  stimulation  by  endotracheal intubation, parasympathetic nervous system activation, and/ or release of neurotransmitters of pain such as substance P and neurokinins may play a role.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  asthma  requires  an assessment  of  disease  severity,  the  e ff ectiveness  of  current pharmacologic management, and the potential need for additional therapy before surgery. Th e goal of preoperative evaluation is to formulate an anesthetic plan that prevents or blunts expiratory air fl ow obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation begins with taking a clinical history  to  elicit  the  severity  and  characteristics  of  the  patient's asthma  (Table  9-5).  On  physical  examination,  the  general appearance of the patient and any use of accessory muscles of  respiration  should  be  noted.  Auscultation  of  the  chest  to detect  wheezing  or  crepitations  is  important.  Blood  eosinophil counts o ft en parallel the degree of airway in fl ammation, and  airway  hyperreactivity  provides  an  indirect  assessment of the current status of the disease.

Chest physiotherapy, antibiotic therapy, and bronchodilator therapy during the preoperative period can o ft en improve reversible  components  of  asthma.  Measurement  of  arterial blood gases is indicated if there is any question about the adequacy of ventilation or oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of anticholinergic drugs should be individualized, and it should be kept in mind that these drugs can increase the viscosity of airway secretions. Intramuscular doses of anticholinergic drugs such as those used for preanesthetic medication are unlikely to decrease airway resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antiin fl ammatory and  bronchodilator  therapy  should  be continued until the time of anesthesia induction. Supplementation with stress-dose corticosteroids may be indicated before major surgery if hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression by drugs used to treat asthma is a possibility. However, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  suppression  is  very  unlikely  with inhaled  corticosteroids.  In  selected  patients,  a  preoperative course of oral corticosteroids may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients should be free of wheezing and have a peak expiratory fl ow of more than 80% of predicted or at the level of the patient's personal best value before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During induction and maintenance of anesthesia in asthmatic patients, airway re fl exes must be suppressed to avoid bronchoconstriction in response to mechanical stimulation of hyperreactive airways. Stimuli that do not ordinarily evoke airway responses can precipitate life-threatening bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because it  avoids  instrumentation  of  the  airway  and  tracheal  intubation,  regional  anesthesia  is  an  attractive  option when the operative site is suitable for this. Concerns that high sensory levels of anesthesia will lead to sympathetic blockade and consequent bronchospasm are unfounded.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When general anesthesia is selected, induction of anesthesia  is  most  o ft en  accomplished  with  an  intravenous  induction drug. Th e incidence of wheezing is higher in asthmatic patients receiving thiopental for induction than in those given propofol. Th iopental itself does not cause bronchospasm, but it may inadequately suppress upper airway re fl exes so airway instrumentation may trigger bronchospasm. Th e mechanism of propofol's relative bronchodilating e ff ect is unknown. Ketamine  can  produce  smooth  muscle  relaxation  and  contribute to decreased airway resistance, especially in patients who are  actively  wheezing.  However,  ketamine  increases  airway secretions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft er  the  patient  is  rendered  unconscious,  the  lungs  are o ft en ventilated for a time with a gas mixture containing a volatile anesthetic. Th e goal is to establish a depth of anesthesia that depresses hyperreactive airway re fl exes su ffi ciently to permit tracheal intubation without precipitating bronchospasm. Th e lesser pungency of halothane and sevo fl urane (compared with iso fl urane and des fl urane) may decrease the likelihood of  coughing,  which  can  trigger  bronchospasm.  An  alternative  method to suppress airway re fl exes before intubation is the intravenous or intratracheal injection of lidocaine (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) 1 to 3 minutes before endotracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioids  should  be  administered  to  suppress  the  cough re fl ex and to achieve deep anesthesia. However, prolongation of  opioid e ff ects can cause postoperative respiratory depression.  Remifentanil  (continuous  IV  infusion  at  0.05  to  0.1 mcg/kg/min) may be particularly useful because it is ultrashort-acting and does not accumulate. All opioids have some histamine-releasing e ff ects, but fentanyl and analogous agents can be used safely in asthmatic patients. Th e administration of opioids during intubation can prevent increased airway resistance,  but  muscle  rigidity  caused  by  opioid  administration can decrease lung compliance and impair ventilation. Opioidinduced  muscle  rigidity  can  be  decreased  by  the  combined use  of  intravenous  anesthetics  and  neuromuscular  blocking agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Insertion of a laryngeal mask airway is less likely to result in bronchoconstriction than insertion of an endotracheal tube. Th erefore,  use  of  a  laryngeal  mask  airway  may  be  a  better method of airway management in asthmatic patients who are not at risk of re fl ux or aspiration. A ft er endotracheal intubation, it may be di ffi cult to di ff erentiate light anesthesia from bronchospasm as the cause of a decrease in pulmonary compliance.  Administration  of  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs relieves the di ffi culty of ventilation resulting from light anesthesia but has no e ff ect on bronchospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperatively, the desirable level of arterial oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal is usually provided by mechanical ventilation. In asthmatic patients, a slow inspiratory fl ow rate produces optimal distribution of ventilation relative to perfusion. Su ffi cient time for exhalation is necessary to prevent air trapping. Humidi fi cation and warming of inspired gases may be especially useful in patients with exercise-induced asthma, in  whom  bronchospasm  is  presumably  due  to  transmucosal  loss  of  heat.  Liberal  administration  of fl uids  during  the perioperative  period  is  important  for  maintaining  adequate hydration  and  ensuring  the  presence  of  less  viscous  airway secretions that can be removed more easily.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skeletal  muscle  relaxation  is  usually  provided  with  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants.  Drugs  with  limited  ability  to evoke the release of histamine should be selected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th eoretically, antagonism of neuromuscular blockade with anticholinesterase  drugs  can  precipitate  bronchospasm  secondary  to  stimulation  of  postganglionic  cholinergic  receptors in airway smooth muscle. Such bronchospasm does not predictably  occur  a ft er  administration  of  anticholinesterase drugs,  probably  because  of  the  protective  bronchodilating e ff ects provided by the simultaneous administration of anticholinergic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At the conclusion of surgery, it is prudent to remove the endotracheal  tube  while  anesthesia  is  still  su ffi cient  to  suppress hyperreactive airway re fl exes, a technique referred to as "deep extubation." When it is deemed unwise to extubate the trachea before the patient is fully awake, suppressing airway re fl exes and/or the risk of bronchospasm by administration of intravenous lidocaine or pretreatment with inhaled bronchodilators should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Bronchospasm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperatively,  bronchospasm  is  o ft en  due  to  factors other than asthma (Table 9-6). Treatment with bronchodilator drugs should not be instituted until causes of wheezing such as mechanical obstruction of the breathing circuit, the airway, or the endotracheal tube are considered. Bronchospasm resulting from asthma may respond to deepening of the anesthetic with a volatile agent. If bronchospasm persists, then β 2 -agonist therapy should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  bronchospasm  persists  despite β 2 -agonist  therapy  and deep  general  anesthesia,  corticosteroid  administration  may be  necessary.  It  must  be  recognized  that  several  hours  may pass before the therapeutic e ff ects of corticosteroids become apparent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emergency surgery in the asthmatic patient introduces a con fl ict between protection of the airway in someone at risk of aspiration and the possibility of triggering bronchospasm. In addition, there may be insu ffi cient time to optimize bronchodilator therapy before surgery. Regional anesthesia may be preferable if the site of surgery is suitable.

CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition mainly related to smoking. Th e burden of the disease is increasing, and it is projected that by 2020, COPD will rank fift h among diseases worldwide. COPD causes 100,000 deaths per year in the United States. Patients with COPD pose a challenge to the anesthesiologist, because intraoperative and postoperative  pulmonary  complications  are  more  common in this population, and COPD can lead to increased length of hospital stay and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPD is characterized by the progressive development of air fl ow  limitation  that  is  not  fully  reversible.  COPD  causes (1) pathologic deterioration in elasticity or "recoil" within the lung parenchyma, which normally maintains the airways in an open position; (2) pathologic changes that decrease the rigidity of the bronchiolar wall and thus predispose them to collapse during exhalation; (3) an increase in gas velocity in narrowed bronchioli,  which  lowers  the  pressure  inside  the  bronchioli and further favors airway collapse; (4) active bronchospasm and  obstruction  resulting  from  increased  pulmonary  secretions; and (5) destruction of lung parenchyma, enlargement of air sacs, and development of emphysema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk factors for development of COPD are (1) cigarette smoking;  (2)  respiratory  infection;  (3)  occupational  exposure to dust, especially in coal mining, gold mining, and the textile industry; and (4) genetic factors such as α 1 -antitrypsin de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical fi ndings vary with the severity of COPD, and during the early stages of the disease, the physical examination may yield normal fi ndings. As expiratory air fl ow obstruction increases  in  severity,  tachypnea  and  a  prolonged  expiratory phase are evident. Breath sounds are likely to be decreased, and expiratory wheezes are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A chronic productive cough, progressive exercise limitation, and expiratory air fl ow obstruction are characteristic of COPD (Table 9-7). Although these symptoms are nonspeci fi c, a diagnosis of COPD is likely if the patient has smoked cigarettes for a long period. Patients with predominantly chronic bronchitis have a chronic productive cough, whereas patients with predominantly emphysema report dyspnea. Patients with emphysema experience dyspnea during the activities of daily living when the FEV1 is less than 40% of the normal value. Orthopnea is o ft en present in patients with advanced COPD, especially if there are substantial airway secretions. Th e orthopnea of COPD may be di ffi cult to di ff erentiate from that resulting from  congestive  heart  failure.  Transient  periods  of  sputum discoloration occur in association with respiratory tract infection. Wheezing is common with mucus accumulation in the airways and may mimic asthma. Th e combination of chronic

PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Results  of  pulmonary  function  tests  reveal  a  decrease  in the  FEV 1 /FVC  ratio  and  an  even  greater  decrease  in  the forced expiratory fl ow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity  (FEF 25%-75% ).  Measurement  of  lung  volumes  may  reveal an increased residual volume and normal to increased FRC and  total  lung  capacity  (Figure  9-4).

are responsible for the increase in residual volume. Th e pathophysiologic "advantage" of an increased residual volume and FRC in patients with COPD is an enlarged airway diameter and  increased  elastic  recoil  for  exhalation. Th e  cost  is  the greater work of breathing at the higher lung volumes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHEST RADIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiographic abnormalities may be minimal, even in the presence of severe COPD. Hyperlucency due to arterial vascular de fi ciency in the lung periphery and hyperin fl ation ( fl attening of the diaphragm with loss of its normal domed appearance and a very vertical cardiac silhouette) suggest the diagnosis of emphysema. If bullae are present, the diagnosis of emphysema is certain. However, only a small percentage of patients with emphysema have bullae. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest can also be useful for diagnosing emphysema. Chronic bronchitis is rarely diagnosed by chest radiography.

GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE CLASSIFICATION/SEVERITY GRADING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Global  Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease (GOLD) works with health care professionals and public health o ffi cials around the world to raise awareness of COPD and to improve prevention and treatment of this lung disease. GOLD was launched in 1997 in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung,  and  Blood  Institute  of  the  U.S.  National  Institutes  of Health and the World Health Organization. GOLD developed a classi fi cation/severity grading system that is now commonly used by physicians around the world (Table 9-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CESSATION OF SMOKING AND OXYGEN SUPPLEMENTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Smoking cessation and long-term oxygen administration are the two important therapeutic interventions that can alter the natural progression of COPD. Smoking cessation causes the symptoms of chronic bronchitis to diminish or entirely disappear, and it eliminates the accelerated loss of lung function observed in those who continue to smoke. Long-term oxygen administration (home oxygen therapy) is recommended if the Pa o 2 is less than 55 mm Hg, the hematocrit is more than 55%, or there is evidence of cor pulmonale. Th e goal of supplemental oxygen administration is to achieve a Pa o 2 between 60 and 80 mm Hg. Th is goal can usually be accomplished by delivering oxygen through a nasal cannula at 2 L/min. Ultimately, the fl ow rate of oxygen is titrated as needed according to arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry measurements. Relief of arterial hypoxemia with supplemental oxygen administration is more e ff ective than any known drug therapy in decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension and in preventing erythrocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DRUG THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchodilators are the mainstay of drug therapy for COPD. Bronchodilators  cause  only  a  small  increase  in  FEV 1 but may  alleviate  symptoms  by  decreasing  hyperin fl ation  and dyspnea. Th ey may thus improve exercise tolerance, despite the fact that there is little improvement in spirometric measurements. An additional bene fi t of β 2 -agonists may be fewer infections, since these drugs decrease the adhesion of bacteria such as Haemophilus in fl uenzae to airway epithelial cells. COPD is  o ft en  more  e ff ectively  treated  by  anticholinergic drugs than by β 2 -agonists. Th is is in contrast to asthma, in which β 2 -agonists  are  usually  more  e ff ective.  Inhaled  corticosteroids  are  widely  prescribed  for  COPD.  Intermittent administration  of  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  is  indicated for  acute  episodes  of  increased  dyspnea  associated  with excessive or purulent sputum production. Annual vaccination against in fl uenza is bene fi cial. Administration of pneumococcal  vaccine  is  also  recommended.  Exacerbations  of COPD may be due to viral infection of the upper respiratory tract or may be noninfective, so antibiotic treatment is not always warranted. Diuretic therapy may be considered for patients with cor pulmonale and right ventricular failure with  peripheral  edema.  Diuretic-induced  chloride  depletion may produce a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis that depresses  the  ventilatory  drive  and  may  aggravate  chronic carbon  dioxide  retention.  Physical  training  programs  can increase the exercise capacity of patients with COPD despite the  absence  of  detectable  e ff ects  on  the  FEV 1 .  However, prompt deconditioning  occurs  when  the  exercise  program is abandoned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LUNG VOLUME REDUCTION SURGERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung volume reduction surgery may be considered in selected patients with emphysema who have regions of overdistended, poorly functioning lung tissue. Surgical removal of these overdistended areas allows more normal areas of the lung to expand and improves not only lung function but quality of life. Lung volume  reduction  surgery  is  performed  by  either  a  median sternotomy  or  video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery  (VATS) approach. Th e  proposed  mechanisms  for  improvement  in lung function a ft er this surgery include (1) an increase in elastic  recoil,  which  increases  expiratory  air fl ow; (2)  a  decrease in  the  degree  of  hyperin fl ation,  which  results  in  improved diaphragmatic and chest wall mechanics; and (3) a decrease in  the  inhomogeneity  of  regional  ventilation  and  perfusion, which results in improved alveolar gas exchange and increased e ff ectiveness of ventilation. Currently research is under way to examine nonsurgical approaches for achieving bene fi ts similar to those provided by lung volume reduction surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  for  lung  volume  reduction surgery includes use of a double-lumen endobronchial tube to  permit  lung  separation,  avoidance  of  nitrous  oxide,  and avoidance  of  excessive  positive  airway  pressure.  Monitoring of central venous pressure as a guide to fl uid management is unreliable in this situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e history and physical examination fi ndings of patients with COPD provide a more accurate assessment of the likelihood of  postoperative  pulmonary  complications  than  pulmonary function test results or measurement of arterial blood gases. A history of poor exercise tolerance, chronic cough, or unexplained  dyspnea  combined  with  diminished  breath  sounds, wheezing,  and  a  prolonged  expiratory  phase  predicts  an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Preoperative preparation of patients with COPD includes smoking cessation, treatment of bronchospasm, and eradication of bacterial infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary Function Testing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  value  of  routine  preoperative  pulmonary  function testing remains controversial. Th e results of pulmonary function  tests  and  arterial  blood  gas  analysis  can  be  useful  for predicting pulmonary function following lung resection, but they  do  not  reliably  predict  the  likelihood  of  postoperative pulmonary complications a ft er nonthoracic surgery. Clinical fi ndings  (smoking,  di ff use  wheezing,  productive  cough)  are more predictive of pulmonary complications than spirometric results. Patients with mild pulmonary disease undergoing peripheral surgery do not require pulmonary function tests. If doubt exists, simple spirometry with measurement of FEV 1 is su ffi cient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Even patients de fi ned as high risk by spirometry (FEV 1 < 70% of predicted, FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 65%) or arterial blood gas analysis (Pa co 2 > 45 mm Hg) can undergo surgery, including

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
lung resection, with an acceptable risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.  Pulmonary  function  tests  should  be viewed as a management tool to optimize preoperative pulmonary function but not as a means to predict risk. Indications for a preoperative pulmonary evaluation (which may include consultation  with  a  pulmonologist  and/or  performance  of pulmonary  function  tests)  typically  include  (1)  hypoxemia on room air or the need for home oxygen therapy without a known cause, (2) a bicarbonate concentration of more than 33 mEq/L or P co 2 of more than 50 mm Hg in a patient whose pulmonary disease has not been previously  evaluated,  (3)  a history  of  respiratory  failure  resulting  from  a  problem  that still  exists,  (4)  severe shortness of breath attributed to respiratory disease, (5) planned pneumonectomy, (6) di ffi culty in assessing pulmonary function by clinical signs, (7) the need to  distinguish  among potential causes of signi fi cant respiratory compromise, (8) the need to determine the response to bronchodilators, and (9) suspected pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right ventricular function should be carefully assessed by clinical  examination  and  echocardiography  in  patients  with advanced pulmonary disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilatory function is quanti fi ed under static conditions by  measuring  lung  volumes  and  under  dynamic  conditions by measuring fl ow rates.  In  assessing  lung  function,  expiratory fl ow rates can be plotted against lung volumes to produce fl ow-volume curves. When fl ow rates during inspiration are added to these curves, fl ow-volume loops are obtained. Th e fl ow rate is zero at total lung capacity before the start of expiration.  Once  forced  expiration  begins,  the  peak fl ow rate  is achieved rapidly and fl ow rate then falls in a linear fashion as the lung volume decreases to residual volume. During maximal inspiration from residual volume to total lung capacity, the inspiratory fl ow is most rapid at the midpoint of inspiration, so that the inspiratory curve is U -shaped.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with COPD, there is a decrease in the expiratory fl ow rate at any given lung volume. Th e expiratory curve is  concave upward due to uniform emptying of the airways. Th e residual volume is increased because of air trapping (see Figure 9-2).

encourage  the  patient  to  stop  smoking  temporarily  before the surgery or, preferably, permanently. Th e intervention can be carried out at the surgical clinic or anesthetic preadmission testing clinic, via phone calls by nurses or health care workers, or in a letter indicating the risks of postoperative complications  caused  by  continued  smoking.  Recent  evidence shows that the earlier the intervention before surgery, the more e ff ective it  is  in  reducing  the  postoperative  complications and maintaining abstinence. Cigarette smoking is the single most important risk factor for the development of COPD and death caused by lung disease. Th e e ff ects of smoking on di ff erent organ systems are described in Table 9-11. Smoking cessation is strongly encouraged by the U.S. Public Health Service (http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco). It  recommends systematically identifying all tobacco users who come in contact with the health care system to urge and help them to quit smoking. Th e American Society of Anesthesiologists also has a Stop Smoking Initiative and provides resources to help practitioners encourage smoking cessation (http://www.asahq.org/For-Members/Clinical-Information/ ASA-Stop-Smoking-Initiative.aspx).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Among smokers, predictive factors for the development of pulmonary complications are a lower di ff using capacity than predicted and a smoking history of more than 60 pack-years. Th ose who have smoked more than 60 pack-years have double the risk of any pulmonary complication and triple the risk of pneumonia compared with those who have smoked less than 60  pack-years.  Smoking  cessation  causes  the  symptoms  of chronic  bronchitis  to  diminish  or  disappear  and  eliminates the accelerated loss of lung function observed in those who continue to smoke.

Among adults with chronic pain, smoking is associated with higher levels of pain, greater levels of depression and anxiety, worse physical functioning, and use of larger amounts of prescription opioids. However, it is not known how smoking cessation might a ff ect pain symptoms.

short -term effects . Th e adverse e ff ects of carbon monoxide on oxygen-carrying capacity and of nicotine on the cardiovascular system are short-lived. Th e elimination half-life of carbon monoxide is approximately 4 to 6 hours when breathing room air. Within 12 hours a ft er cessation of smoking the Pa o 2 at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated with oxygen (P 50 ) increases from 22.9 to 26.4 mm Hg, and the plasma levels of carboxyhemoglobin  decrease  from  6.5%  to  approximately 1%.  Carbon  monoxide  may  have  negative  inotropic  e ff ects. Despite  the  favorable  e ff ects  on  plasma  carboxyhemoglobin concentration, short-term abstinence from cigarettes has not been proven to decrease the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Th e sympathomimetic e ff ects of nicotine on the heart are transient, lasting only 20 to 30 minutes.

intermediate -term effects . Cigarette smoking causes mucus hypersecretion, impairment of mucociliary transport, and narrowing of small airways. In contrast to the rapid favorable  e ff ect  of  short-term  abstinence  from  smoking  on  carboxyhemoglobin concentrations, improved ciliary and small airway  function  and  decreased  sputum  production  occur slowly over a period of weeks a ft er smoking cessation. Cigarette smoking may interfere with normal immune responses and  could  interfere  with  the  ability  of  smokers  to  respond to  pulmonary  infection  following  anesthesia  and  surgery. A decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications resulting  from  smoking  cessation  is  thought  to  be  related  to  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
physiologic improvement in ciliary action, macrophage activity, and small airway function, as well as a decrease in sputum production. However, these changes take weeks to months to occur.  Return  of  normal  immune  function  requires  at  least 6  weeks  of  abstinence  from  smoking.  Some  components  of cigarette smoke stimulate hepatic enzymes. As with immune responses, it may take 6 weeks or longer for hepatic enzyme activity to return to normal following cessation of smoking.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  optimal  timing  of  smoking  cessation  before  surgery to  reduce  postoperative  pulmonary  complications  remains unclear, but many suggest it to be around 4 to 8 weeks. Smokers scheduled for surgery in less than 4 weeks should be advised to quit and should be o ff ered e ff ective interventions, including behavioral support and pharmacotherapy, to help achieve this goal. Despite the clear advantages of long-term smoking cessation, there can be disadvantages to smoking cessation in the immediate preoperative period. Th ese include an increase in sputum production, patient fear of the inability to handle stress, nicotine withdrawal, and symptoms including irritability, restlessness, sleep disturbances, and depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Countless methods have been devised to aid in smoking cessation. Most involve some form of counseling and pharmacotherapy. Nicotine replacement therapy, with various delivery systems including patches, inhalers, nasal sprays, lozenges, and gum, is generally well tolerated. Th e major side e ff ect is local irritation at the site of drug delivery. Th e atypical antidepressant bupropion in a sustained-release formulation can also aid in smoking cessation. Th e drug is typically started 1 to 2 weeks before smoking is stopped.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional  Status. Poor  nutritional  status  with  a  low serum albumin level (<3.5 mg/dL) is a powerful predictor of postoperative  pulmonary  complications  in  COPD  patients. Malnutrition can increase the risk of prolonged postoperative air leaks in patients a ft er lung surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia is suitable for operations that do not invade  the  peritoneum  and  for  surgical  procedures  performed  on  the  extremities.  Lower  intraabdominal  surgery can also  be  performed  using  a  regional  technique.  General anesthesia is the usual choice for upper abdominal and intrathoracic surgery. Th e choice of anesthetic technique or speci fi c anesthetic drugs does not seem to alter the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Studies in patients with COPD suggest that there is a higher incidence of postoperative respiratory failure in patients who undergo general anesthesia, but whether this re fl ects the nature and complexity of the surgery and/or the operative site, or the selection of  anesthetic  drugs  or  technique  is  unclear.  Whether  there is a relationship between the duration of anesthesia and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications is controversial. Some suggest that operations lasting longer than 3 hours are more likely to be associated with postoperative pulmonary complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia via peripheral nerve blockade such as an axillary blockade carries a lower risk of pulmonary complications than either spinal or general anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is a useful choice in patients with COPD only if large doses of sedative and anxiolytic drugs will not be needed. It must be appreciated that COPD patients can be extremely sensitive  to  the  ventilatory  depressant  e ff ects  of  sedative  drugs. Elderly  patients  may  be  especially  susceptible.  O ft en  small doses of a benzodiazepine such as midazolam, in increments of 1 to 2 mg IV , can be administered without producing undesirable degrees of ventilatory depression. Use of regional anesthetic techniques that produce sensory anesthesia above T6 is not recommended, because such high blocks can impair the ventilatory functions requiring active exhalation; this a ff ects parameters such as expiratory  reserve  volume,  peak  expiratory fl ow, and maximum minute ventilation. Clinically, this is manifested as an inadequate cough.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthesia  is  o ft en  accomplished  with  volatile anesthetics. Volatile anesthetics are useful because of the ability of these drugs (especially des fl urane and sevo fl urane) to be rapidly eliminated. Residual ventilatory depression during the early postoperative period is thereby minimized. Volatile anesthetics are also known to cause bronchodilation and have been used to treat bronchospasm in status asthmaticus. Des fl urane, however, may cause irritation of the bronchi and increased airway resistance, so there may be an advantage to choosing a less irritating  agent such as sevo fl urane for induction and emergence  in  cases  of  severe  airway  reactivity.  Emergence  from anesthesia with inhalational agents can be prolonged signi fi -cantly, especially in patients with signi fi cant airway obstruction, because air trapping also traps inhalational agents as they fl ood out of the body's compartments into the lungs. An alternative is total intravenous anesthesia with propofol. A shortacting  analgesic  such  as  remifentanil  can  be  used  to  relieve the irritation of the endotracheal tube su ffi ciently so that the required level of propofol can be diminished considerably and the attendant risk of hypotension is reduced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nitrous  oxide  can  be  administered  in  combination  with a  volatile  anesthetic.  When  nitrous  oxide  is  used,  there  is the  potential  for  passage  of  this  gas  into  pulmonary  bullae. Th is  could  lead  to  enlargement  or  even  rupture  of  the  bullae,  resulting  in  development  of  a  pneumothorax.  Another potential disadvantage of nitrous oxide is the limitation on the inspired oxygen concentration that it imposes. It is important to remember that inhaled anesthetics may attenuate regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and produce more intrapulmonary shunting. Increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (F io 2 ) may be necessary to o ff set this loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioids  may  be  less  useful  than  inhaled  anesthetics  for maintenance  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  COPD  because they  can  be  associated  with  prolonged  ventilatory  depression as a result of their slow rate of metabolism or elimination. Even the duration of ventilatory depression produced by

<!-- PAGE=? -->
194

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
drugs such as thiopental and midazolam may be prolonged in patients with COPD compared with healthy individuals. A high  inspired  concentration  of  nitrous  oxide  might  be  used to ensure amnesia when opioids are used for maintenance of anesthesia. Th is may be di ffi cult to achieve if a high F io 2 is also required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An endotracheal tube bypasses most of the natural airway humidi fi cation  system,  so  humidi fi cation  of  inspired  gases and use of low gas fl ows are needed to keep airway secretions moist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Controlled  mechanical  ventilation  is  useful  for  optimizing oxygenation in patients with COPD who are undergoing operations requiring general anesthesia. Tidal volumes of 6 to 8 mL/kg combined with slow inspiratory fl ow rates minimize the likelihood of turbulent air fl ow and help maintain optimal ventilation/perfusion matching. Slow respiratory rates (6 to 10 breaths per minute) provide su ffi cient time for complete exhalation to occur, which is particularly important if air trapping is  to  be  minimized.  Slow  rates  also  allow  su ffi cient  time  for venous return and are less likely to be associated with undesirable  degrees  of  hyperventilation. Th e  phenomenon of  air trapping or dynamic hyperin fl ation is  enhanced when positive pressure ventilation is applied and insu ffi cient expiratory time  is  allowed. Th is  contributes  to  increased  intrathoracic pressure, impedes venous return, and transmits the elevated intrathoracic  pressure  to  the  pulmonary  artery.  An  increase in pulmonary vascular resistance can lead to right ventricular strain. Hyperin fl ated lungs may exert direct pressure on the heart, limiting its ability to expand fully during diastole even with  adequate  preload.  Shi ft of  the  ventricular  septum  and ventricular  interdependence  due  to  the  shared  pericardium may cause a distended right ventricle to impinge on the fi lling of the le ft ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Air trapping can be detected during mechanical ventilation intraoperatively by the following methods:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
   Capnography  shows  that  the  carbon  dioxide  concentration does not plateau but is still upsloping at the time of the  next  breath. Th is  indicates  that  there  is  still  admixture of air from dead space reducing the carbon dioxide concentration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
   Direct measurement of fl ow may be displayed graphically by the ventilator, showing that the expiratory fl ow has not reached baseline (zero) before initiation of the next breath.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
   Direct  measurement  of  the  resulting  PEEP  can  be  performed using more advanced ventilators that are capable of an expiratory hold.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e patient can simply be disconnected from the ventilator brie fl y and observed to see whether the blood pressure increases signi fi cantly as PEEP is eliminated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e hazard of pulmonary barotrauma in the presence of bullae should be appreciated, particularly when high positive airway  pressures  are  required  to  provide  adequate  ventilation  If  spontaneous  breathing  is  permitted  during  anesthesia  in  patients  with  COPD,  it  should  be  appreciated  that the  ventilatory  depression  produced  by  volatile  anesthetics may be greater in these patients than in individuals without COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylaxis against the development of postoperative pulmonary  complications  is  based  on  maintaining  adequate  lung volumes, especially FRC, and facilitating an e ff ective  cough. Identi fi cation of the FRC as the most important lung volume during  the  postoperative  period  provides  a  speci fi c  goal  for therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung Expansion Maneuvers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung  expansion  maneuvers  (deep  breathing  exercises, incentive  spirometry,  chest  physiotherapy,  positive  pressure breathing  techniques)  are  of  proven  bene fi t  for  preventing postoperative pulmonary complications in patients at high risk. Th ese techniques decrease the risk of atelectasis by increasing lung volumes. All regimens seem to be e ffi cacious in decreasing the frequency of postoperative pulmonary complications by approximately twofold compared with no therapy. Incentive spirometry is simple and inexpensive and provides objective goals for and monitoring of patient performance. Patients are given a particular inspired volume as a goal to achieve and hold. Th is provides sustained lung in fl ation, which is important for reexpanding collapsed alveoli. Th e major disadvantage of incentive spirometry is the need for patient cooperation to accomplish the treatment. Providing education in lung expansion  maneuvers  before  surgery  decreases  the  incidence  of pulmonary complications to a greater degree than beginning education a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intermittent  positive  pressure  breathing  can  decrease  the incidence  of  postoperative  pulmonary  complications,  but its  complexity  has  resulted  in  a  decline  in  its  use.  Continuous positive airway pressure is reserved for the prevention of postoperative  pulmonary  complications  in  patients  who  are not able to perform deep-breathing exercises or incentive spirometry. Nasal positive airway pressure can also minimize the expected decrease in lung volumes a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative neuraxial analgesia with opioids may permit early  tracheal  extubation. Th e  sympathetic  blockade,  muscle  weakness,  and  loss  of  proprioception  that  are  produced by  local  anesthetics  are  not  produced  by  neuraxial  opioids. Th erefore,  early  ambulation  is  possible.  Ambulation  serves to  increase  FRC  and  improve  oxygenation,  presumably  by improving  ventilation/perfusion  matching.  Neuraxial  opioids  may  be  especially  useful  a ft er  intrathoracic  and  upper abdominal surgery. Breakthrough pain may require treatment with systemic opioids administered by bolus or via patientcontrolled analgesia. Sedation may accompany neuraxial opioid  administration,  and  delayed  respiratory  depression  can be seen, especially when poorly lipid-soluble opioids such as morphine are used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  quality  of  neuraxial  analgesia  (epidural  or  spinal) may be superior to that  provided  by  parenteral  administration of opioids, but it has not been possible to document that

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
neuraxial analgesia decreases the incidence of clinically signi fi cant postoperative pulmonary complications or is superior to  parenteral  opioids  in  this  regard.  Postoperative  neuraxial analgesia  is  recommended a ft er  high-risk  thoracic,  abdominal,  and  major  vascular  surgery.  Intermittent  or  continuous intercostal nerve blockade may be an alternative if neuraxial analgesia is ine ff ective or technically di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continued mechanical ventilation during the immediately postoperative period may be necessary in patients with severe COPD who have undergone major abdominal or intrathoracic surgery.  Patients  with  preoperative  FEV 1 /FVC  ratios  of  less than 0.5 or with a preoperative Pa co 2 of more than 50 mm Hg are likely to need some postoperative mechanical ventilation. If the Pa co 2 has been increased for a long period, it is important not to correct the hypercarbia too quickly, because this will result in a metabolic alkalosis that can be associated with cardiac dysrhythmias and central nervous system irritability and even seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When continued mechanical ventilation  is  necessary,  F io 2 and  ventilator  settings  should  be  adjusted  to  keep  the  Pa o 2 between  60  and  100  mm  Hg  and  the  Pa co 2 in  a  range  that maintains the arterial pH (pHa) at 7.35 to 7.45. Reduction of the respiratory rate or the I:E ratio allows more time for exhalation and thus reduces the likelihood of air trapping. However, this  may  also  lower  the  tidal  volume  and  minute  ventilation and exacerbate hypercapnia, hypoxia, and acidosis. Pulmonary vascular resistance may increase and can lead to right ventricular strain. Electrolyte shi ft s  resulting from acidemia can cause cardiac dysrhythmias in patients with COPD or asthma. Extubation  of  the  high-risk  patient  to  continuous  positive  airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure may reduce the work of breathing and air trapping. However, use of positive airway pressure in the setting of an unprotected airway raises concern about insu ffl ation of the stomach and the risk of vomiting and aspiration.  Treatment  with  sympathomimetic  bronchodilators such as albuterol and inhaled anticholinergics such as ipratropium may improve air fl ow if a reactive component of air trapping is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest Physiotherapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  combination  of  chest  physiotherapy  and  postural drainage  plus  deep-breathing  exercises  taught  during  the preoperative  period  may  decrease  the  incidence  of  postoperative  pulmonary  complications.  Presumably,  vibrations  produced  on  the  chest  wall  by  physiotherapy  result in  dislodgment  of  mucus  plugs  from  peripheral  airways. Appropriate positioning facilitates elimination of loosened mucus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LESS COMMON CAUSES OF EXPIRATORY AIRFLOW OBSTRUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Expiratory air fl ow obstruction occurs, although less o ft en, in conditions other than chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiectasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiectasis  is  a  chronic  suppurative  disease  of  the  airways  that,  if  su ffi ciently  widespread,  may  cause  expiratory air fl ow obstruction  similar  to  that  seen  in  COPD.  Despite the availability of antibiotics, bronchiectasis is an important cause  of  chronic  productive  cough  with  purulent  sputum and  accounts  for  a  signi fi cant  number  of  cases  of  massive hemoptysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiectasis  is  characterized  by  the  localized,  irreversible dilation  of  a  bronchus  caused  by  destructive  in fl ammatory processes involving the bronchial wall. Mycobacterial or other bacterial infections are presumed to be responsible for most cases of bronchiectasis. Th e  most important consequence of bronchiectatic destruction of airways is an increased susceptibility  to  recurrent  or  persistent  bacterial  infection,  which re fl ects impaired mucociliary activity and pooling of mucus in dilated airways. Once bacterial superinfection is established, it is nearly impossible to eradicate, and daily expectoration of purulent sputum persists.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  history  of  a  chronic  cough  productive of purulent sputum  is  highly  suggestive  of  bronchiectasis.  Clubbing  of  the fi ngers occurs in most patients with signi fi cant bronchiectasis and is a valuable diagnostic clue, especially since this change is  not  characteristic  of  COPD. Pulmonary function changes vary  considerably  and  range  from  no  change  to  alterations characteristic of COPD or restrictive lung disease. Computed tomography provides excellent images of bronchiectatic airways and can be used to con fi rm the presence and extent of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiectasis is treated by administration of antibiotics and postural drainage. Results of periodic sputum cultures guide antibiotic selection. Pseudomonas is the most common organism cultured. Mild hemoptysis can be controlled with appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, massive hemoptysis (>200 mL  over  a  24-hour  period)  may  require  surgical  resection of  the  involved  lung  segment  or  selective  bronchial  arterial embolization. Postural drainage is useful to assist in expectoration of secretions that pool distal to the diseased airways. Chest  physiotherapy  with  chest  percussion  and  vibration  is another aid for bronchopulmonary drainage. Surgical resection has played a declining role in the management of bronchiectasis in the modern antibiotic era and is considered only in the rare instance in which severe symptoms persist or recurrent complications occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before elective surgery, the pulmonary status of patients with bronchiectasis  is  optimized  by  antibiotic  therapy  and  postural  drainage.  Airway  management  might  include  use  of  a

double-lumen endobronchial tube to prevent spillage of purulent sputum into normal areas of the lungs. Instrumentation of the nares should be avoided because of the high incidence of chronic sinusitis in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cystic Fibrosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cystic fi brosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It a ff ects an estimated 30,000 persons in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cause of cystic fi brosis is a mutation in a single gene on chromosome  7  that  encodes  the  cystic fi brosis  transmembrane  conductance  regulator. Th e  result  of  this  mutation  is defective chloride ion transport in epithelial cells in the lungs, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive organs. Decreased  chloride  transport  is  accompanied  by  decreased transport of sodium and water, which results in dehydrated, viscous  secretions  that  are  associated  with  luminal  obstruction  as  well  as  destruction  and  scarring  of  various  exocrine glands.  Pancreatic  insu ffi ciency,  meconium  ileus  at  birth, diabetes mellitus, obstructive hepatobiliary tract disease, and azoospermia are o ft en present, but the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fi brosis is chronic pulmonary infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  a  sweat  chloride  concentration  higher  than 80 mEq/L plus the characteristic clinical manifestations (cough, chronic purulent sputum production, exertional dyspnea) or family history of the disease con fi rms the diagnosis of cystic fi brosis. Chronic pansinusitis is almost universal. Th e presence of normal sinuses on radiographic examination is strong evidence that cystic fi brosis  is  not  present.  Malabsorption  with a response to pancreatic enzyme treatment is evidence of the exocrine insu ffi ciency associated with cystic fi brosis. Obstructive azoospermia con fi rmed by testicular biopsy is also strong evidence  of  cystic fi brosis.  Bronchoalveolar  lavage  typically shows  a  high  percentage  of  neutrophils,  a  sign  of  airway in fl ammation. COPD is present in virtually all adult patients with cystic fi brosis and follows a relentless course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of cystic fi brosis is similar to that for bronchiectasis and is directed toward alleviation of symptoms (mobilization and clearance of lower airway secretions and treatment of pulmonary infection) and correction of organ dysfunction (pancreatic enzyme replacement).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clearance of Airway Secretions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  abnormal  viscoelastic  properties  of  the  sputum  in patients  with  cystic fi brosis  lead  to  sputum  retention  resulting  in  airway  obstruction. Th e  principal  nonpharmacologic approach to enhancing clearance of pulmonary secretions is chest  physiotherapy  with  postural  drainage.  High-frequency chest compression with an in fl atable vest and airway oscillation with  a fl utter  valve  are  alternative  methods  of  physiotherapy that are less time consuming and do not require trained personnel.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchodilator Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchial  reactivity  to  histamine  and  other  provocative stimuli is greater in patients with cystic fi brosis than in individuals without the disease. Bronchodilator therapy is considered if patients have an increase of 10% or more in FEV 1 in response to an inhaled bronchodilator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reduction in Viscoelasticity of Sputum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  abnormal  viscosity  of  airway  secretions  is  due  primarily to the presence of neutrophils and their degradation products.  DNA released from neutrophils forms long fi brils that contribute to the viscosity of the sputum. Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (dornase alfa [Pulmozyme]) can cleave this DNA and increase the clearance of sputum in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotic Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  cystic fi brosis  have  periodic  exacerbations of  pulmonary  infection  that  are  recognized  primarily  by  an increase in symptoms and in sputum production. Antibiotic therapy  is  based  on  identi fi cation  and  susceptibility  testing of  bacteria  isolated  from  the  sputum.  In  patients  in  whom cultures  yield  no  pathogens,  bronchoscopy  to  remove  lower airway secretions may be indicated. Many patients with cystic fi brosis are given long-term maintenance antibiotic therapy in hope of suppressing chronic infection and the development of bronchiectasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with cystic fi brosis follows the same principles as outlined for patients with COPD and  bronchiectasis.  Elective  surgical  procedures  should  be delayed  until  optimal  pulmonary  function  can  be  ensured by controlling bronchial infection and facilitating removal of airway secretions. Vitamin K treatment may be necessary if hepatic function is poor or if absorption of fat-soluble vitamins from the gastrointestinal tract is impaired. Maintenance of anesthesia with volatile anesthetics permits the use of high inspired concentrations of oxygen, decreases airway resistance by decreasing bronchial smooth muscle tone, and decreases the  responsiveness  of  hyperreactive  airways.  Humidi fi cation of inspired gases, hydration, and avoidance of anticholinergic drugs are important to maintain secretions in a less viscous state. Frequent tracheal suctioning may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  ciliary  dyskinesia  is  characterized  by  congenital impairment  of  ciliary  activity  in  respiratory  tract  epithelial cells  and  sperm  tails  (spermatozoa  are  alive  but  immobile). As  a  result  of  impaired  ciliary  activity  in  the  respiratory tract,  chronic  sinusitis,  recurrent  respiratory  infections,  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
bronchiectasis develop. Not only is there infertility in males, but fertility  is  decreased  in  females  since  oviducts  also  have ciliated epithelium. Th e triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis,  and  situs  inversus  is  known  as Kartagener's  syndrome. It  is  speculated that the normal asymmetrical positioning of body organs is dependent on normal ciliary function of the embryonic epithelium. In the absence of normal ciliary function, placement of organs to the le ft or  the  right  is  random. As  expected,  approximately  one  half  of  patients  with  congenitally nonfunctioning cilia manifest situs inversus. Isolated dextrocardia is almost always associated with congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative preparation is directed at treating active pulmonary  infection  and  determining  whether  any  signi fi cant organ inversion is present. In the presence of dextrocardia, it is necessary to reverse the ECG leads to permit accurate interpretation. Inversion of the great vessels is a reason to select the le ft internal jugular vein for central venous cannulation. Uterine displacement in parturient women is logically to the right in these patients. Should a double-lumen endobronchial tube be considered, it is necessary to appreciate the altered anatomy introduced by pulmonary inversion. In view of the high incidence of sinusitis, nasopharyngeal airways should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiolitis Obliterans

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiolitis is a disease of childhood and is most o ft en the result of infection with respiratory syncytial virus. Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare cause of COPD in adults. Th e process may  accompany  viral  pneumonia,  collagen  vascular  disease (especially  rheumatoid arthritis),  and  inhalation  of  nitrogen dioxide (silo fi ller's  disease), or it may be a sequela of gra ft -versus-host disease a ft er bone marrow transplantation. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a clinical  entity  that  shares  certain  features  of  interstitial  lung disease and bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment of bronchiolitis  obliterans  is  usually  ine ff ective,  although  corticosteroids may be administered in an attempt to suppress in fl ammation involving the bronchioles. BOOP, however, does respond well to  corticosteroid  therapy.  Symptomatic  improvement  may accompany the use of bronchodilators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal stenosis typically develops a ft er prolonged endotracheal intubation. Tracheal mucosal ischemia that may progress to destruction of cartilaginous rings and subsequent circumferential constricting scar formation is minimized by the use of  high-volume,  low-pressure  cu ff s  on  endotracheal  tubes. Infection and hypotension may also contribute to events that culminate in tracheal stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal  stenosis  becomes  symptomatic  when  the  lumen  of the adult trachea is decreased to less than 5 mm in diameter. Symptoms may not develop until several weeks a ft er tracheal extubation. Dyspnea is prominent even at rest. Th ese patients must use accessory muscles of respiration during all phases of the breathing cycle and must breathe slowly. Peak expiratory fl ow rates are decreased. Stridor is usually audible. Flow-volume loops display fl attened inspiratory and expiratory curves (see  Figure  9-3, A ).  Tomograms of the trachea demonstrate tracheal narrowing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal  dilation is useful in some  patients, but surgical  resection  of  the  stenotic  tracheal  segment  with  primary reanastomosis is o ft en required. Translaryngeal endotracheal intubation is accomplished. A ft er surgical exposure, the distal normal trachea is opened and a sterile cu ff ed tube is inserted and attached to the anesthetic circuit. Maintenance of anesthesia with volatile anesthetics is useful for ensuring maximum inspired  concentrations  of  oxygen.  High-frequency  ventilation  is  helpful  in  selected  patients.  Anesthesia  for  tracheal resection may be facilitated by the addition of helium to the inspired gases. Th is decreases the density of the gases and may improve fl ow through the area of tracheal narrowing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Restrictive pulmonary diseases include both acute and chronic intrinsic  pulmonary  disorders  as  well  as  extrinsic  (extrapulmonary)  disorders  involving  the  pleura,  chest  wall,  diaphragm, and neuromuscular function (Table 9-12). Restrictive lung disease is characterized by decreases in all lung volumes, decreased  lung  compliance,  and  preservation  of  expiratory fl ow rates (Figure 9-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary Edema

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE INTRINSIC RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary edema is due to leakage of intravascular fl uid into the interstitium of the lungs and into the alveoli. Acute pulmonary edema can be caused by increased capillary pressure (hydrostatic or cardiogenic pulmonary edema) or by increased capillary  permeability.  Pulmonary  edema  typically  manifests as bilateral symmetrical opacities on chest radiography. A perihilar distribution (butter fl y pattern) of the lung opacity is common. However, this pattern of lung opacity is more commonly seen with increased capillary pressure than with increased capillary permeability. Th e presence of air bronchograms on chest radiography suggests increased-permeability pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by extreme dyspnea, tachypnea, and signs of sympathetic  nervous  system  activation  (hypertension,  tachycardia, diaphoresis) that may be more pronounced than in patients with  increased-permeability  pulmonary  edema.  Pulmonary edema caused by increased capillary permeability is characterized by a high concentration of protein and secretory products in the edema fl uid. Di ff use alveolar damage is typically present with the increased-permeability pulmonary edema associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASPIRATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspirated acidic gastric fl uid is rapidly distributed throughout the  lung  and  produces  destruction  of  surfactant-producing cells and damage to the pulmonary capillary endothelium. As a result, there is atelectasis and leakage of intravascular fl uid into  the  lungs,  producing  capillary  permeability  pulmonary edema. Th e clinical picture is similar to that of ARDS. Arterial hypoxemia is typically present. In addition, there may be tachypnea,  bronchospasm,  and  acute  pulmonary  hypertension.  Chest  radiographs  may  not  demonstrate  evidence  of aspiration pneumonitis for 6 to 12 hours a ft er the event. Evidence of aspiration, when it does appear, is most likely to be in the right lower lobe if the patient aspirated while in the supine position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurement of gastric fl uid pH is useful since it re fl ects the pH of the aspirated fl uid. Measurement of tracheal aspirate pH is of no value because the aspirated gastric fl uid is rapidly diluted by airway secretions. Th e aspirated gastric fl uid is also rapidly distributed to peripheral lung regions, so lung lavage is  not  useful  unless  there  has  been  aspiration  of  particulate material.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspiration pneumonitis is best treated by delivery of supplemental oxygen and PEEP. Bronchodilation may be needed to relieve bronchospasm. Th ere is no evidence that prophylactic antibiotics decrease the incidence of pulmonary infection or alter outcome. Corticosteroid treatment of aspiration pneumonitis is controversial. Despite the absence of con fi rmatory evidence that corticosteroids are bene fi cial, some practitioners treat aspiration pneumonitis with very large dosages of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone.

NEUROGENIC PROBLEMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurogenic problems develop in a small proportion of patients experiencing acute brain injury. Typically, this form of pulmonary edema occurs minutes to hours a ft er central nervous system injury and may manifest during the perioperative period. Th ere is a massive outpouring of sympathetic impulses from the injured central nervous system that results in generalized

vasoconstriction and a shi ft of blood volume into the pulmonary circulation. Presumably, increased pulmonary capillary pressure  leads  to  transudation  of fl uid  into  the  interstitium and alveoli.  Pulmonary hypertension and hypervolemia can also injure blood vessels in the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e association of pulmonary edema with a recent central nervous system injury should suggest the diagnosis of neurogenic pulmonary edema. Th e principal entity in the di ff erential  diagnosis  is  aspiration  pneumonitis.  Unlike  neurogenic pulmonary edema, chemical pneumonitis resulting from aspiration frequently persists longer and is o ft en complicated by secondary bacterial infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OPIOID OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  noncardiogenic  pulmonary  edema  can  occur  a ft er administration of a number of drugs, especially opioids (heroin)  and  cocaine.  High-permeability  pulmonary  edema  is suggested  by  high  protein  concentrations  in  the  pulmonary edema fl uid. Cocaine can also cause pulmonary vasoconstriction,  acute  myocardial  ischemia,  and  myocardial  infarction. Th ere is no evidence that administration of naloxone speeds resolution of opioid-induced pulmonary edema. Treatment of patients who develop drug-induced pulmonary edema is supportive and may include tracheal intubation for airway protection and mechanical ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIGH-ALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High-altitude pulmonary edema may occur at heights ranging from 2500 to 5000 m and is in fl uenced by the rate of ascent to that altitude. Th e  onset of symptoms is o ft en gradual but typically  occurs  within  48  to  72  hours  at  high  altitude.  Fulminant pulmonary edema may be preceded by the less severe symptoms of acute mountain sickness. Th e cause of this highpermeability  pulmonary  edema  is  presumed  to  be  hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which increases pulmonary vascular pressures. Treatment includes administration of oxygen and prompt descent from the high altitude. Inhalation of nitric oxide may improve oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REEXPANSION OF COLLAPSED LUNG

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rapid  expansion  of  a  collapsed  lung  may  lead  to  pulmonary edema in that lung. Th e risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema a ft er relief of a pneumothorax or pleural e ff usion is related  to  the  amount  of  air  or  liquid  that  was  present  in the pleural space (>1 L increases the risk), the duration of collapse (>24 hours increases the risk), and the rapidity of reexpansion.  High  protein  concentrations  in  the  edema fl uid suggest that enhanced capillary membrane permeability is important in the development of this form of pulmonary  edema.  Treatment  of  reexpansion  pulmonary  edema is supportive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (NEGATIVE-PRESSURE)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Negative-pressure pulmonary edema may follow relief of acute upper airway obstruction (postobstructive pulmonary edema) caused by postextubation laryngospasm, epiglottitis, tumors, obesity, hiccups, or obstructive sleep apnea in spontaneously breathing patients. Th e  time  to  onset  of  pulmonary  edema a ft er relief of airway obstruction ranges from a few minutes to as long as 2 to 3 hours. Tachypnea, cough, and failure to maintain oxygen saturation above 95% are common presenting signs and may be confused with pulmonary aspiration or pulmonary embolism. It is possible that many cases of postoperative oxygen desaturation are due to unrecognized negativepressure pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pathogenesis  of  negative-pressure  pulmonary  edema is  related  to  the  development  of  high  negative  intrapleural pressure by vigorous inspiratory e ff orts against an obstructed upper  airway.  High  negative  intrapleural  pressure  decreases the interstitial hydrostatic pressure, increases venous return, and increases le ft ventricular a ft erload. In addition, such negative  pressure  leads  to  intense  sympathetic  nervous  system activation,  hypertension,  and  central  displacement  of  blood volume.  Together  these  factors  produce  acute  pulmonary edema by increasing the transcapillary pressure gradient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance  of  a  patent  upper  airway  and  administration of supplemental oxygen are su ffi cient treatment, because this form of pulmonary edema is typically transient and selflimited.  Mechanical  ventilation  may  occasionally  be  needed for a brief period of time. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals normal  right  and  le ft ventricular  function.  Central  venous pressure  and  pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure  are  normal. Radiographic evidence of this form of pulmonary edema resolves within 12 to 24 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elective surgery should be delayed in patients with acute pulmonary edema, and every e ff ort must be made to optimize cardiorespiratory function. Large pleural e ff usions may need to be drained. Persistent hypoxemia may require mechanical ventilation and PEEP. Hemodynamic monitoring may be useful in both the assessment and treatment of pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  pulmonary  edema  are  critically  ill.  Intraoperative management should be a continuation of critical care management and include a plan for intraoperative ventilator management. Th e  best  way  to  ventilate  patients  with  acute respiratory  failure  and  restrictive  lung  disease  has  not  been determined.  However,  because  the  pathophysiology  is  similar to that of acute lung injury and because there is the risk of hemodynamic  compromise  and  barotrauma  with  the  use  of large tidal volumes and high airway pressures, it is reasonable to ventilate with low tidal volumes (e.g., 6 mL/kg) with a compensatory increase in ventilatory rate (14 to 18 breaths per minute) while attempting to keep the end-inspiratory plateau pressure at less than 30 cm H 2 O. Typical anesthesia ventilators may not be adequate for patients with severe ARDS, and more sophisticated  ICU  ventilators  may  occasionally  be  needed.  Patients with restrictive lung disease typically breathe rapidly and shallowly, so tachypnea is likely during the weaning process and

should not be used as the sole reason for delaying extubation if gas exchange and results of other assessments are satisfactory.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic Intrinsic Restrictive Lung Disease (Interstitial Lung Disease)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interstitial  disease is characterized by changes in the intrinsic properties of the lungs, most o ft en caused by pulmonary fi brosis. Th is produces a chronic restrictive form of lung disease. Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale develop as progressive pulmonary fi brosis results in the loss of pulmonary vasculature. Dyspnea is prominent and breathing is rapid and shallow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SARCOIDOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder that involves many tissues  but  has  a  predilection  for  intrathoracic  lymph nodes  and  the  lungs.  Most  patients  have  no  symptoms  at the  time  of  presentation,  and  the  disease  is  identi fi ed  only because of abnormal fi ndings on chest radiographs. Patients may have respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea and cough. Ocular sarcoidosis may produce uveitis; myocardial sarcoidosis may produce conduction defects and dysrhythmias. Th e most common form of neurologic involvement in sarcoidosis is unilateral facial nerve palsy. Endobronchial sarcoid is common. Laryngeal sarcoidosis occurs in up to 5% of patients and may interfere with the passage of adult-size tracheal tubes. Cor pulmonale may develop. Hypercalcemia occurs in fewer than 10% of patients but is a classic manifestation of sarcoidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mediastinoscopy may be necessary to provide lymph node tissue for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity is increased in patients with sarcoidosis, presumably due to production of this enzyme by cells within the granuloma. However, this increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity does not have useful diagnostic or prognostic signi fi cance. Corticosteroids are administered to suppress the manifestations of sarcoidosis and to treat the hypercalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is characterized by di ff use interstitial granulomatous reactions in the lungs a ft er inhalation of dust containing fungi, spores, and animal or plant material. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis include the onset of dyspnea and cough 4 to 6 hours a ft er inhalation of the antigens. Th is is followed by leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and o ft en arterial hypoxemia. Chest radiographs show multiple pulmonary in fi ltrates. Repeated episodes of hypersensitivity pneumonitis may lead to pulmonary fi brosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EOSINOPHILIC GRANULOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary fi brosis  accompanies  the  disease  process  known as eosinophilic granuloma (histiocytosis X). No treatment has been shown to be bene fi cial for this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by the deposition of lipid-rich proteinaceous material  in  the  alveoli.  Dyspnea  and  arterial  hypoxemia  are the  typical  clinical  manifestations. Th is  process  may  occur independently or in association with chemotherapy, acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome, or inhalation of mineral dusts. Although  spontaneous  remission  may  occur,  treatment  of severe  cases  requires  whole-lung  lavage  to  remove  alveolar material  and  improve  macrophage  function.  Lung  lavage  in patients  with  hypoxemia  may  further  decrease  the  level  of oxygenation. Airway management during anesthesia for lung lavage includes placement of a double-lumen endobronchial tube to facilitate lavage of each lung and optimize oxygenation during lavage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LYMPHANGIOLEIOMYOMATOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis  is  the  proliferation  of  smooth muscle in airways, lymphatics, and blood vessels that occurs in females of reproductive age. Pulmonary function test results show restrictive and obstructive lung disease with a decrease in  di ff using  capacity.  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis  presents clinically as progressive dyspnea, hemoptysis, recurrent pneumothorax, and pleural  e ff usions.  Nearly  all  lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells express progesterone receptors. Progesterone or tamoxifen can be used for treatment, but there is progressive deterioration in pulmonary function, and most patients die within 10 years of the onset of symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  usually  have  dyspnea  and  nonproductive  cough. Cor  pulmonale  may  be  present.  Coarse  breath  sounds  with crepitations  are  heard  on  auscultation.  A  chest  radiograph may show a ground glass or nodular pattern. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals hypoxemia with normocarbia. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive ventilatory defects, and carbon monoxide di ff using capacity is decreased. A vital capacity of less than 15 mL/kg indicates severe pulmonary dysfunction. Infection should be treated, secretions cleared, and smoking stopped preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with interstitial lung disease tolerate apneic periods very poorly because of their small FRC and low oxygen stores. General anesthesia, the supine position, and controlled ventilation all contribute to further decreases in FRC. Alterations in FRC and the risk of hypoxia continue into the postoperative period. Uptake of inhaled anesthetics is faster in these patients because  of  the  small  FRC.  Peak  airway  pressures  should  be kept as low as possible to minimize the risk of barotrauma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of the Chest Wall, Pleura, and Mediastinum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic extrinsic restrictive lung disease is most o ft en due to disorders of the thoracic cage (chest wall) that interfere with lung expansion (Table 9-12). Th e  lungs  are  compressed  and lung volumes are reduced. Th e work of breathing is increased

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
because of the abnormal mechanical properties of the chest and the increased airway resistance that results from decreased lung volumes. Any thoracic deformity may cause compression of  the  pulmonary  vasculature  and  lead  to  right  ventricular dysfunction.  Recurrent  pulmonary  infection  resulting  from poor cough dynamics may lead to the development of COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DEFORMITIES OF THE COSTOVERTEBRAL SKELETAL STRUCTURES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  two  basic  types  of  costovertebral  skeletal  deformity  are scoliosis (lateral curvature with rotation of the vertebral column) and kyphosis (anterior fl exion of the vertebral column), which are most commonly present in combination as kyphoscoliosis. Idiopathic kyphoscoliosis accounts for 80% of cases. It commonly begins during late childhood or early adolescence and may progress in severity during the years of rapid skeletal growth. Mild to moderate kyphoscoliosis (scoliotic angle of <60 degrees) is associated with minimal to mild restrictive ventilatory defects. Dyspnea may occur during exercise, but as the skeletal deformity worsens, the vital capacity declines and dyspnea becomes a common complaint with even moderate exertion. Severe deformities (scoliotic angle of >100 degrees) may  lead  to  chronic  alveolar  hypoventilation,  hypoxemia, secondary  erythrocytosis,  pulmonary  hypertension,  and  cor pulmonale. Respiratory failure is most likely in patients with kyphoscoliosis  associated  with  a  vital  capacity  of  less  than 45% of the predicted value and a scoliotic angle of more than 110 degrees. Compression of underlying lung tissue results in an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen di ff erence. Patients with severe kyphoscoliosis are at increased risk of developing pneumonia and hypoventilation when exposed to central nervous system depressant drugs. Supplemental oxygen therapy augmented by nocturnal ventilatory support may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DEFORMITIES OF THE STERNUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deformities  of  the  sternum  and  costochondral  articulations are  characterized  by  pectus  excavatum  (inward  concavity  of the lower sternum) and pectus carinatum (outward protuberance of the upper, middle, or lower sternum). In most patients with  pectus  excavatum,  there  are  no  signi fi cant  functional limitations.  Lung  volumes  and  cardiovascular  function  are preserved.  Surgical  correction  is  indicated  when  the  sternal deformity is accompanied by evidence of pulmonary restriction or cardiovascular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FLAIL CHEST

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multiple rib fractures, especially when they occur in a parallel vertical orientation, can produce a fl ail chest characterized by paradoxical inward movement of the unstable portion of the thoracic cage while the remainder of the thoracic cage moves outward during inspiration. Th e fl ail portion of the chest then moves outward with exhalation. Th e pathophysiology of a fl ail chest can also result from dehiscence of a median sternotomy. Tidal volumes are diminished because the region of the lung associated  with  the  chest  wall  abnormality  paradoxically increases  its  volume  during  exhalation  and  de fl ates  during inspiration. Th e result is progressive hypoxemia and alveolar hypoventilation.  Treatment  of  a fl ail  chest  includes  positive pressure ventilation until a de fi nitive stabilization procedure can be carried out or the rib fractures are stabilized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PLEURAL EFFUSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pleural e ff usion is most o ft en con fi rmed by chest radiography when blunting of the costophrenic angle is seen with as little as 25 to 50 mL of pleural fl uid. Larger amounts of fl uid produce a  characteristic  homogeneous  opacity  that  forms  a  concave meniscus with the chest wall. Ultrasonography and CT are also useful in evaluating a pleural e ff usion. In patients with congestive heart failure, pleural fl uid may collect in the interlobular fi ssure as an interlobular e ff usion. Various types of fl uid may accumulate in the pleural space, including blood (hemothorax), pus (empyema), lipids (chylothorax), and serous liquid (hydrothorax). All these conditions have an identical radiographic appearance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pleural  e ff usion  is  diagnosed  and  treated  by  thoracentesis. Th e pleural fl uid can be either transudative or exudative, and the distinction points to potential diagnoses and the need for  further  evaluation.  Bloody  pleural  e ff usion  is  common in  patients  with  malignant  disease,  trauma,  or  pulmonary infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PNEUMOTHORAX

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumothorax  is  the  presence  of  gas  in  the  pleural  space caused  by  disruption  of  either  the  parietal  pleura  (external penetrating injury) or visceral pleura (tear or rupture in the lung parenchyma). When the gas originates in the lung, the rupture may occur in the absence of known lung disease (simple pneumothorax) or as a result of parenchymal disease (secondary pneumothorax). Idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax occurs most o ft en in tall, thin males 20 to 40 years of age and is due to rupture of apical subpleural blebs. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of primary spontaneous pneumothorax 20-fold. Most episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax occur while patients are at rest. Exercise or airline travel does not increase the likelihood of spontaneous pneumothorax.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDIASTINAL MASS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the evaluation of mediastinal widening, contrast-enhanced CT can distinguish between vascular structures, so ft tissues, and calci fi cations. Lymphoma,  thymoma,  teratoma, and retrosternal goiter are common causes of an anterior mediastinal mass. Large mediastinal tumors may be associated with progressive airway obstruction, loss of lung volumes, pulmonary artery  or  cardiac  compression,  and  superior  vena  cava obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Superior vena cava syndrome is a constellation of signs that develops in patients with a mediastinal tumor that obstructs venous drainage in the upper thorax. Increased venous pressure leads to (1) dilation of collateral veins in the thorax and neck; (2) edema and cyanosis of the face, neck, and upper chest; (3) edema of the conjunctiva; and (4) evidence of increased intracranial pressure, including headache and altered mental

MEDIASTINITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  mediastinitis  usually  results  from  bacterial  contamination a ft er esophageal perforation. Symptoms include chest pain and fever. It is treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical drainage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumomediastinum may follow a tear in the esophagus or tracheobronchial  tree  or  alveolar  rupture,  although  it  most o ft en occurs without a known cause. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum has been observed a ft er recreational cocaine use. Symptoms  of  retrosternal  chest  pain  and  dyspnea  are  typically abrupt in onset and usually follow exaggerated breathing e ff orts  (cough,  emesis,  Valsalva's  maneuver).  Subcutaneous emphysema may be  extensive  in  the  neck,  arms,  abdomen, and scrotum. Gas in the mediastinum may decompress into the pleural space leading to pneumothorax, usually on the le ft . Th e diagnosis of pneumomediastinum is established by chest radiography. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum resolves without  speci fi c  therapy.  When  pneumomediastinum  is  a result of organ rupture, surgical drainage and repair may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BRONCHOGENIC CYSTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchogenic cysts are fl uid- or airfi lled  cysts  arising  from the  primitive  foregut  that  are  lined  with  respiratory  epithelium. Th ey are usually located in the mediastinum or in the lung  parenchyma. Th ese  cysts  may  be  asymptomatic,  the focus of recurrent pulmonary infection, or the cause of lifethreatening airway obstruction. Cysts located in the mediastinum are more likely to be fi lled with fl uid than air and are usually not in direct communication with the airways. Th ese masses cause symptoms of airway compression as they grow. Surgical excision may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th eoretical  concerns  in  patients  with  bronchogenic  cysts include  the  hazards  related  to  nitrous  oxide  administration and  the  use  of  positive  pressure  ventilation.  Nitrous  oxide can di ff use into airfi lled bronchogenic cysts and cause their expansion, with associated life-threatening respiratory or cardiovascular compromise. Institution of positive pressure ventilation may have a ball-valve e ff ect, particularly in cysts that extrinsically compress the tracheobronchial tree, resulting in air trapping. Despite these concerns, clinical experience confi rms that nitrous oxide and positive pressure ventilation o ft en may be safely used in patients with bronchogenic cysts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuromuscular  disorders  that  interfere  with  the  transfer  of central nervous system input to the skeletal muscles necessary for  inspiration  and  exhalation  can  result  in  restrictive  lung disease. Abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular  junction,  or  skeletal  muscles  may  result  in restrictive  pulmonary  defects  characterized  by  an  inability to  generate  normal  respiratory  pressures.  In  contrast  to  the mechanical disorders of the thoracic cage, in which an e ff ective cough is typically preserved, the expiratory muscle weakness characteristic of neuromuscular disorders prevents generation of  su ffi cient  expiratory air fl ow velocity to provide a forceful cough. Th e extreme example is cervical spinal cord injury in which paralysis of abdominal and intercostal muscles severely decreases  the  ability  to  cough.  Acute  respiratory  failure  is likely when atelectasis associated with pneumonia (caused by retained secretions resulting from an ine ff ective cough) occurs or  depressant  drugs  are  administered.  Patients  with  neuromuscular disorders are somewhat dependent on the state of wakefulness to maintain adequate ventilation. During sleep, hypoxemia and hypercapnia may develop and contribute to the development of cor pulmonale. Vital capacity is an important indicator of the total impact of a neuromuscular disorder on ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal Cord Transection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Breathing  is  maintained  solely  or  predominantly  by  the diaphragm  in  quadriplegic  patients  (transection  must  be at  or  below  C4  or  the  diaphragm is paralyzed). Because the diaphragm  is  active  only  during  inspiration,  cough-which requires activity by expiratory muscles, including those of the abdominal wall-is almost totally absent. Intercostal muscles are  required  to  stabilize  the  upper  rib  cage  against  inward collapse  when  negative  intrathoracic  pressure  is  produced by descent of the diaphragm. With diaphragmatic breathing, there is a paradoxical inward motion of the upper thorax during inspiration. Th e result is a diminished tidal volume. When quadriplegic patients are placed in the upright position, the weight  of  the  abdominal  contents  pulls  on  the  diaphragm, and the absence of abdominal muscle tone results in less e ffi -cient function of the diaphragm. Abdominal binders serve to replace lost abdominal muscle tone and may be useful whenever tidal volume decreases in the upright posture. Quadriplegic patients have mild degrees of bronchial constriction caused by the parasympathetic tone that is unopposed by sympathetic activity from the spinal cord. Use of anticholinergic bronchodilating drugs can reverse this abnormality. Respiratory failure almost never occurs in quadriplegic patients in the absence of complications such as pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guillain-Barré Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory  insu ffi ciency  that  requires  mechanical  ventilation occurs in 20% to 25% of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Ventilatory  support  is  needed,  on  average,  for 2 months. A small number of patients have persistent skeletal muscle weakness and are susceptible to recurring episodes of respiratory failure in association with pulmonary infection.

Disorders of Neuromuscular Transmission

Myasthenia  gravis  is  the  most  common  of  the  disorders a ff ecting neuromuscular transmission that may result in respiratory  failure.  Myasthenic  syndrome  (Eaton-Lambert  syndrome) may be confused with myasthenia gravis. Prolonged

skeletal  muscle  paralysis  or  weakness  may  occur  following administration  of  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blocking drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscular Dystrophy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with pseudohypertrophic (Duchenne's) muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, and other forms of muscular dystrophy  are  predisposed  to  pulmonary  complications  and respiratory  failure.  Chronic  alveolar  hypoventilation  caused by inspiratory muscle weakness may develop. Expiratory muscle weakness impairs cough, and accompanying weakness of the swallowing muscles may lead to pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. As with all neuromuscular syndromes, central  nervous  system  depressant  drugs  should  be  avoided  or administered in minimal dosages when necessary. Nocturnal ventilation  with  noninvasive  techniques  such  as  nasal  intermittent positive pressure or external negative pressure ventilation may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAPHRAGMATIC PARALYSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the absence of respiratory complications, neuromuscular disorders rarely progress to the point of hypercapnic respiratory  failure  unless  diaphragmatic  weakness  or  paralysis is present. Th us, quadriplegic patients who have preserved phrenic nerve and diaphragmatic function are unlikely to develop respiratory failure in the absence of pneumonia or administration of central nervous system depressant drugs. In the supine position, patients with diaphragmatic paralysis  may  develop  a  ventilatory  pattern  similar  to  that  seen with a fl ail chest (abdominal contents push the diaphragm into the chest). In the upright posture these patients experience  a  signi fi cant  increase  in  vital  capacity  and  improved oxygenation and ventilation.  Most  cases  of  unilateral  diaphragmatic  paralysis  are  the  result  of  neoplastic  invasion of  the  phrenic  nerve.  In  the  absence  of  associated  pleuropulmonary disease, most adult patients with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis remain asymptomatic, and the defect is detected as an incidental fi nding on chest radiography. In contrast, infants are more dependent on bilateral diaphragmatic function for adequate respiratory function. In these patients and in symptomatic adults, plication of the hemidiaphragm may be necessary to prevent fl ail motion of the thoracic cage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transient diaphragmatic dysfunction  may  occur  a ft er abdominal surgery. Lung volumes are decreased, the alveolararterial oxygen di ff erence increases, and respiratory frequency increases. Th ese  changes  may  be  caused  by  irritation  of  the diaphragm,  which  causes  re fl ex  inhibition  of  phrenic  nerve activity. As a result of postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction, atelectasis and arterial hypoxemia may occur. Incentive spirometry may alleviate these abnormalities.

DISORDERS OF THE PLEURA AND MEDIASTINUM

Disorders  of  the  pleura  and  mediastinum  may  contribute  to  mechanical  changes  that  interfere  with  optimal  lung expansion.

Pleural Fibrosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pleural fi brosis  may  follow  hemothorax,  empyema,  or surgical pleurodesis for the treatment of recurrent pneumothorax.  Despite  obliteration  of  the  pleural  space,  functional restrictive  lung  abnormalities  remain  but  are  usually  minor. Surgical decortication to remove thick fi brous pleura is technically di ffi cult and is considered only if the restrictive lung disease is symptomatic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tension  pneumothorax  develops  when  gas  enters  the  pleural  space  during  inspiration  and  is  prevented  from  escaping during exhalation. Th e result is a progressive increase in the amount  of  air  trapped  under  increasing  pressure  (tension). Tension pneumothorax occurs in fewer than 2% of patients experiencing an idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax, but it is a common manifestation of rib fractures, insertion of central  lines,  and  barotrauma  in  patients  undergoing  mechanical  ventilation.  Dyspnea,  hypoxemia,  and  hypotension  may be severe. Immediate evacuation of gas through a needle or a small-bore catheter placed into the second anterior intercostal space may be lifesaving.

Signs  and  Symptoms. Dyspnea  is  always  present  with  a pneumothorax. Most patients also have ipsilateral chest pain and cough. Arterial hypoxemia, hypotension, and hypercarbia may occur. Physical fi ndings are o ft en subtle, which emphasizes the importance of considering this diagnosis whenever dyspnea and chest pain occur acutely. Tachycardia is the most common physical fi nding. In patients with a large pneumothorax, the fi ndings on physical examination of the a ff ected side may include decreased chest wall movement, hyperresonance to percussion, and decreased or absent breath sounds.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment. Treatment  of  a  symptomatic  pneumothorax requires  evacuation  of  air  from  the  pleural  space  by  aspiration through a small-bore plastic catheter or placement of a chest tube. Aspiration of a pneumothorax followed by catheter removal is successful in 70% of patients with a small to moderate-sized  primary  spontaneous  pneumothorax.  When the pneumothorax is small (<15% of the volume of the hemithorax)  and  symptoms  are  absent,  observation  may  su ffi ce. Oxygen supplementation accelerates the reabsorption of air in the pleural space. A continued air leak from the lung requires chest  tube  placement.  Most  air  leaks  resolve  within  7  days. Complications  of  chest  tube  drainage  include  pain,  pleural infection, hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema related to lung reexpansion. Recurrent pneumothoraces may require surgical intervention including chemical pleurodesis.

mass  and  the  degree  of  tracheal  compression  can  be  established by CT, and this study is a useful predictor of whether airway di ffi culties during anesthesia are to be expected. Flexible fi beroptic bronchoscopy under topical anesthesia may also be useful for evaluating airway obstruction. Interestingly, the severity of preoperative pulmonary symptoms bears no relationship to the degree of respiratory compromise that can be encountered during anesthesia. Indeed, a number of asymptomatic patients have developed unexpected airway obstruction during anesthesia. Preoperative radiation therapy should be  considered  whenever  possible.  In  symptomatic  patients requiring  a  diagnostic  tissue  biopsy,  a  local  anesthetic  technique, if feasible, is best. Patients with mediastinal tumors may be asymptomatic while awake yet develop airway obstruction during anesthesia in the supine position. During anesthesia, the  tumor  may  increase  in  size  because  of  venous  engorgement, and its position may shi ft somewhat. As a result, it may compress the airway, the vena cava, the pulmonary artery, or the atria and create life-threatening hypoxemia, hypotension, or even cardiac arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Restrictive  lung  disease  does  not  in fl uence  the  choice  of drugs used for induction or maintenance of anesthesia. Drugs with prolonged respiratory-depressant e ff ects that may persist into the postoperative period should be avoided. A high index of suspicion for the presence of a pneumothorax and the need to  avoid  or  discontinue  nitrous  oxide  must  be  maintained. Regional anesthesia can be considered for peripheral operations, but  it  must  be  appreciated  that  involvement  of  sensory  levels above T10 can be associated with impairment of the respiratory muscle activity needed by patients with restrictive lung disease to maintain acceptable ventilation. Mechanical ventilation during  the  intraoperative  period  facilitates  optimal  oxygenation and ventilation. Since the lungs are poorly compliant, increased inspiratory pressures may be necessary. Postoperative mechanical  ventilation  is  o ft en  required  in  patients  with  signi fi cantly impaired pulmonary function. Restrictive lung disease contributes to the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e method of induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation in the presence of mediastinal tumors depends on the preoperative assessment of the airway. External edema associated with superior vena cava syndrome may be accompanied by similar edema inside the mouth and hypopharynx. If edema resulting  from  caval  obstruction  is  severe,  it  may  be  necessary to establish intravenous access in the legs rather than in the arms. A central venous or pulmonary artery catheter can be  inserted  through  the  femoral  vein.  Invasive  blood  pressure monitoring should be considered. Symptomatic patients may need to be in the sitting position to breathe adequately. If so, anesthetic induction in this position may proceed a ft er the airway has been secured. Topical anesthesia of the airway with or without sedation can be used to facilitate fi beroptic laryngoscopy. In very young patients, an inhalation induction with maintenance of spontaneous ventilation may be necessary. If severe airway obstruction occurs, it can be alleviated by placing the patient in the lateral or prone position. Spontaneous ventilation throughout surgery is recommended whenever possible. Worsening of superior vena cava syndrome may occur as a result of generous intraoperative fl uid replacement. Diuretics may decrease the tumor volume, but the reduction in preload in these patients with already compromised venous return may result in signi fi cant hypotension. Surgical bleeding is o ft en increased due to an increased central venous pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

Postoperatively, tumor swelling as a result of partial resection  or  biopsy  may  increase  airway  obstruction  and  require reintubation of the trachea.

DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES IN PATIENTS WITH LUNG DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fiberoptic  bronchoscopy  has  generally  replaced  rigid  bronchoscopy  for  visualizing  the  airways  and  obtaining  samples for  culture,  cytologic  examination,  and  biopsy.  Pneumothorax occurs in 5% to 10% of patients a ft er transbronchial lung biopsy and in 10% to 20% of patients a ft er percutaneous needle biopsy of peripheral lung lesions. Th e principal contraindication to pleural biopsy is a coagulopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mediastinoscopy  is  performed  under  general  anesthesia through a small transverse incision just above the suprasternal notch. Blunt dissection along the pretracheal fascia is performed, which permits biopsy of paratracheal lymph nodes to the level of the carina. Complications include pneumothorax, mediastinal hemorrhage, venous air embolism, and injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve leading to hoarseness and vocal cord  paralysis. Th e  mediastinoscope  can  also  exert  pressure against the right innominate artery, causing loss of pulses in the right arm and compromise of right carotid artery blood fl ow.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Respiratory Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory failure is the inability to provide adequate arterial oxygenation and/or elimination of carbon dioxide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute respiratory failure is considered to be present when the Pa o 2 is less than 60 mm Hg despite oxygen supplementation and in the absence of a right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt. In the presence of acute respiratory failure, Pa co 2 can be increased, unchanged,  or  decreased  depending  on  the  relationship  of alveolar ventilation to metabolic production of carbon dioxide. A Pa co 2 higher than 50 mm Hg in the absence of respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis is consistent with the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  respiratory  failure  is  distinguished  from  chronic respiratory failure based on the relationship of Pa co 2 to pHa. Acute respiratory failure is typically accompanied by abrupt increases  in  Pa co 2 and  by  corresponding  decreases  in  pHa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
205

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the presence of chronic respiratory failure, pHa is usually between 7.35 and 7.45 despite an increased Pa co 2 . Th is normal pHa re fl ects renal compensation for the respiratory acidosis via renal tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory failure is o ft en accompanied by a decrease in FRC  and  lung  compliance.  Increased  pulmonary  vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension are likely to develop if respiratory failure persists.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute/Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ARDS is caused by an in fl ammatory injury to the lung and is manifested clinically as acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical disorders and risk factors associated with the development of ARDS include events that cause direct lung injury as well as those that lead to indirect injury to the lungs in the setting  of  a  systemic  process  (Table  9-13).  Overall,  sepsis  is associated with the highest risk of progression of acute lung injury  to  ARDS. Th e  acute  phase  of  ARDS  manifests  as  the rapid  onset  of  respiratory  failure  accompanied  by  arterial hypoxemia  refractory  to  treatment  and  radiographic fi ndings indistinguishable from those of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Th ere is an in fl ux of protein-rich edema fl uid into the alveoli  as  a  result  of  increased  alveolar  capillary  membrane permeability. Th ere  is  evidence  of  neutrophil-mediated lung injury.  Proin fl ammatory cytokines may be produced locally in the lungs. Th is acute phase usually resolves completely, but in some patients, it may progress to fi brosing alveolitis with persistent arterial hypoxemia and decreased pulmonary compliance. Th e recovery or resolution phase of ARDS is characterized by gradual resolution of the hypoxemia and improved lung  compliance.  Typically,  the  radiographic  abnormalities resolve completely.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial hypoxemia resistant to treatment with supplemental oxygen is usually the fi rst sign. Radiographic signs may appear before symptoms develop. Patients usually have a normal pulmonary  capillary  wedge  pressure.  Pulmonary  hypertension can occur due to pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and obliteration of portions of the pulmonary capillary bed and, when severe, can cause right-sided heart failure. Death from ARDS is most o ft en a result of sepsis or multiple organ failure rather than respiratory failure, although some deaths can be directly related to lung injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis of ARDS is dependent on the presentation of acute refractory hypoxemia, di ff use in fi ltrates on chest radiograph  consistent  with  pulmonary  edema,  and  a  pulmonary capillary  wedge pressure of less than 18 mm Hg. Th e  Pa o 2 / F io 2 ratio is typically less than 200 mm Hg. A less severe form of ARDS is acute lung injury, which has a similar presentation, but the Pa o 2 /F io 2 ratio is less than 300 mm Hg. An algorithm for clinical di ff erentiation of cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is shown in Figure 9-7.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of acute respiratory failure is directed at initiating speci fi c  therapies  that  support  oxygenation  and  ventilation. Th e three principal goals in the management of acute respiratory failure are (1) correcting hypoxemia, (2) removing excess carbon dioxide, and (3) securing a patent upper airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Improved  supportive  care  of  patients  with  acute  lung injury and ARDS may contribute to improved survival rates (Table 9-14). Th ere should be a thorough search for the underlying cause, with particular attention paid to the possibility of a treatable infection such as sepsis or pneumonia. Prevention or  early  treatment  of  nosocomial  infection  is  critical.  Adequate  nutrition  should  be  provided,  preferably  through  the use of enteral feedings. Prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding and thromboembolism is important. At the present time, routine use of surfactant therapy or inhaled nitric oxide is not recommended.

the resolution phase of ARDS, including the ability to remove alveolar fl uid and sustain improvements in oxygenation, may become as important as traditional ventilatory management. Inhaled β -agonists may be of value in removal of pulmonary edema fl uid, stimulating the secretion of surfactant and even exerting  antiin fl ammatory  e ff ects  that  may  help  restore  the proper vascular permeability to the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal Intubation and PEEP Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  steps  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  acute respiratory failure and ARDS who cannot be adequately oxygenated are endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Inspired oxygen concentrations are adjusted to maintain the Pa o 2 between 60 and 80 mm Hg. Th e higher tidal volumes (12 to 15 mL/kg) used in the past for treatment of ARDS are associated  with  decreased  pulmonary  compliance  and  can result in alveolar overdistention and barotrauma. Th e risk of barotrauma can be lessened by adjustment of tidal volumes so that increases in peak airway pressure do not exceed 35 to 40 cm H2O. Ideal tidal volume is determined by assessing lung mechanics rather than by measuring arterial blood gases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application of PEEP is one of the most e ff ective  ways  to improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS. PEEP helps prevent alveolar collapse at end expiration and thereby increases lung  volumes  (especially  FRC),  improves  ventilation/perfusion  matching,  and  decreases  the  magnitude  of  right-tole ft intrapulmonary  shunting.  PEEP  does  not  decrease  the amount of extravascular lung water or prevent the formation of pulmonary edema fl uid. However, edema fl uid is likely to be redistributed to the interstitial lung regions, which causes previously fl ooded alveoli to become ventilated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application of PEEP is indicated when high concentrations of inspired oxygen (F io 2 >   0.5) are needed for prolonged periods to maintain an acceptable Pa o 2 and may introduce the risk of oxygen toxicity. It is possible that PEEP may decrease the shear stress associated with the opening and closing of alveoli  in  ARDS. Th e  lowest  level  of  PEEP  necessary  to  achieve acceptable  oxygenation  at  nontoxic  oxygen  concentrations should  be  employed.  High  levels  of  PEEP  decrease  cardiac output and increase the incidence of barotrauma. Th e level of PEEP that results in optimal pulmonary compliance is usually similar to the level associated with optimal oxygenation. PEEP is typically added in increments of 2.5- to 5.0-cm H 2 O until the Pa o 2 is at least 60 mm Hg with an F io 2 of less than 0.5. Most patients show maximal improvement in oxygen transport and pulmonary compliance with levels of PEEP below 15 cm H 2 O. Excessive levels of PEEP can decrease the Pa o 2 by overdistending alveoli and compressing the capillaries surrounding these alveoli, and shunting more blood to less ventilated areas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An important adverse e ff ect of PEEP is decreased cardiac output  resulting  from  interference  with  venous  return  and le ft ward displacement of the interventricular septum, which restricts le ft ventricular fi lling. Th e decrease in cardiac output caused by PEEP is exaggerated in the presence of hypovolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
207

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Replacement  of  intravascular fl uid  volume  and  administration of inotropic drugs may o ff set  the  e ff ects of PEEP on venous  return  and  improve  myocardial  contractility.  A  pulmonary artery catheter is useful for monitoring the adequacy of  intravascular fl uid  replacement,  myocardial  contractility, and tissue oxygenation in patients being treated with PEEP. Measurement of pulmonary artery occlusion pressures may be complicated by transmission of PEEP (intraalveolar pressure) to the pulmonary capillaries, which causes an erroneous interpretation of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inverse-ratio ventilation is characterized by an inspiratory time that exceeds the expiratory time; that is, the inspiratory/ expiratory ratio is greater than 1. Th is is accomplished by adding  an  end-inspiratory  pause  to  maintain  the  alveolar  pressure brie fl y at the plateau level. Arterial oxygenation may be improved without increasing minute ventilation or PEEP . Risks of inverse-ratio ventilation include barotrauma and hypotension caused by development of auto-PEEP as a result of the shortened expiratory time. Although inverse-ratio ventilation may improve oxygenation in some patients with ARDS, prospective studies have not con fi rmed a bene fi t in most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid and Hemodynamic Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  rationale  for  restricting fl uids  in  patients  with  acute lung injury and ARDS is to decrease the magnitude of the pulmonary edema. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressures below 15 mm Hg may re fl ect inadequate intravascular fl uid volume. Urine outputs of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg/hr are consistent with an adequate cardiac output and intravascular fl uid volume. Diuresis using furosemide may be e ff ective in reversing some e ff ects of  excessive fl uid  administration  as  evidenced  by  improved oxygenation  and  resolution  of  pulmonary  in fi ltrates.  Measurement of central venous pressure is not a reliable guide for monitoring intravascular fl uid volume in patients with ARDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A reasonable goal of fl uid therapy is to maintain the intravascular fl uid  volume  at  the  lowest  level  consistent  with adequate organ perfusion as assessed by metabolic acid-base balance  and  renal  function.  If  organ  perfusion  cannot  be maintained a ft er restoration of intravascular fl uid volume, as in patients with septic shock, treatment with vasopressors may be necessary to improve organ perfusion pressures and normalize tissue oxygen delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the recognized role of in fl ammation in acute lung injury and ARDS, the value of corticosteroid administration early  in  the  course  of  the  disease  remains  unproven.  Corticosteroids may have value in treatment of the later fi brosing alveolitis phase of ARDS or as rescue therapy in patients with severe ARDS that is not resolving.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Removal of Secretions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimal removal of airway secretions is facilitated by adequate hydration and humidi fi cation of inspired gases. Tracheal suctioning,  chest  physiotherapy,  and  postural  drainage  may also enhance secretion removal. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy may be indicated to remove thicker accumulated secretions that are contributing to atelectasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Control of Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Control of infection using speci fi c antibiotic therapy based on sputum culture and sensitivity testing is a valuable adjunct in the management of ARDS. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended because this practice leads to overgrowth with resistant  organisms.  Not  uncommonly,  the earliest evidence of infection in patients with ARDS is a further deterioration in pulmonary function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional Support

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional support is important to prevent skeletal muscle  weakness.  Hypophosphatemia  may  contribute  to  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  to  the  poor  contractility  of  the diaphragm that may accompany acute respiratory failure and ARDS.  Increased  carbohydrate  intake,  such  as  that  associated  with  hyperalimentation,  increases  the  respiratory  quotient and thereby increases the production of carbon dioxide, which necessitates greater alveolar ventilation. In the severely compromised patient, meeting this need for greater ventilation  might  not  be  possible  without  mechanical  support  of ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical Support of Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental  oxygen  can  be  provided  to  spontaneously breathing patients using a nasal cannula, Venturi mask, nonrebreathing mask, or T-piece. Th ese devices seldom provide inspired oxygen concentrations higher than 50% and therefore are of value only in correcting the hypoxemia resulting from  mild  to  moderate  ventilation/perfusion  mismatching. When these methods of oxygen delivery fail to maintain the Pa o 2 above 60 mm Hg, continuous positive airway pressure by face mask can be tried. Continuous positive airway pressure  may increase lung volumes by opening collapsed alveoli  and  decreasing  right-to-le ft intrapulmonary  shunting. A  disadvantage  of  continuous  positive  airway  pressure  by face mask is that the tight mask fi t required may increase the risk  of  aspiration  should  the  patient  vomit.  Maintenance  of the Pa o 2 above approximately 60 mm Hg is adequate because hemoglobin saturation with oxygen is >90% at this level. In some patients, it is necessary to perform tracheal intubation and  institute  mechanical  ventilation  to  maintain  acceptable oxygenation and ventilation. Typical devices that provide positive pressure ventilation include volume-cycled and pressurecycled ventilators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volume-Cycled Ventilation. Volume-cycled ventilation provides  a fi xed  tidal  volume,  and  in fl ation  pressure  is  the dependent  variable.  A  pressure  limit  can  be  set,  and  when in fl ation  pressure  exceeds  this  value,  a  pressure  relief  valve prevents further gas fl ow. Th is valve prevents the development of  dangerously high peak airway and alveolar pressures and warns that a change in pulmonary compliance has occurred. Large increases in peak airway pressure may re fl ect worsening

pulmonary  edema,  development  of  a  pneumothorax,  kinking  of  the  tracheal  tube,  or  the  presence  of  mucus  plugs  in the tube or large airways. Tidal volume is maintained despite small changes in peak airway pressure. Th is is in contrast to pressure-cycled ventilation. A disadvantage of volume-cycled ventilation is the inability of these devices to compensate for leaks in the delivery system. Th e primary modalities of ventilation using volume-cycled ventilation are assist-control ventilation and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (Figure 9-8).

Management  of  Patients  Receiving  Mechanical  Support of Ventilation. Critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation may bene fi t from continuous infusion of sedative drugs to treat anxiety and agitation and to facilitate coordination with ventilator-delivered breaths. Inadequate sedation or agitation can lead to life-threatening problems such as selfextubation,  acute  deterioration  in  gas  exchange,  and  barotrauma. Th e need for neuromuscular blockade is reduced by the optimum use of sedation. However, when acceptable sedation without hemodynamic compromise cannot be achieved, it  may  be  necessary  to  produce  skeletal  muscle  paralysis  to ensure appropriate ventilation and oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
P aralysis . When sedation is inadequate or hypotension accompanies the administration of drugs used for sedation, the  use  of  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs to  produce  skeletal  muscle  relaxation  may  be  necessary  to permit  optimal  mechanical  ventilation. Th e  dependence  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
S edation . Benzodiazepines,  propofol,  and  narcotics  are the drugs most commonly administered to decrease anxiety, produce amnesia, increase patient comfort, and provide analgesia  during  mechanical  ventilation.  Newer  approaches  to mechanical ventilation involving the use of permissive hypercapnia (Pa co 2 may reach 50 mm Hg) can cause substantial discomfort and necessitate deep sedation. Continuous infusion of  drugs  rather  than  intermittent  injection  provides  a  more constant and desirable level of sedative e ff ect. Daily interruption of sedative infusions to allow the patient to "awaken" may facilitate  evaluation  of  mental  status  and  ultimately  shorten the period of mechanical ventilation. Continuous infusion of propofol is uniquely attractive for this purpose, because the brief context-sensitive half-life of this drug is not in fl uenced by the duration of the infusion, and rapid awakening is predictable.  Prompt  recovery  from  the  e ff ects  of  a  remifentanil infusion also is not a ff ected by the duration of the intravenous drug infusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
certain of these drugs on renal clearance should be considered. It is better to use intermittent rather than continuous skeletal muscle paralysis to allow periodic assessment of the adequacy  of  sedation  and  the  need  for  ongoing  paralysis. Monitoring of neuromuscular blockade and titration of muscle relaxant doses so that a twitch response remains present is prudent. A risk of prolonged drug-induced skeletal muscle paralysis is accentuation of the di ff use polyneuropathy that may accompany critical illness.

COMPLICATIONS

Infection

In mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure, tracheal intubation is the single most important predisposing factor for development of nosocomial pneumonia (ventilator-associated  pneumonia). Th e  major  pathogenic mechanism  is  microaspiration  of  contaminated  secretions around the tracheal tube cu ff . Diagnosis of pneumonia in the presence  of  acute  respiratory  failure  may  be  di ffi cult,  since fever  and  pulmonary  in fi ltrates  may  already  be  present  in association with the cause of the acute respiratory failure.

Nosocomial sinusitis is strongly related to the presence of a nasotracheal tube. Treatment of nosocomial sinusitis includes administration of antibiotics, replacement of nasal tubes with oral  tubes,  and  use  of  decongestants  and  head  elevation  to facilitate sinus drainage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alveolar Overdistention

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alveolar overdistention resulting from large tidal volumes (10  to  12  mL/kg)  and  high  airway  pressures  (>50  cm  H 2 O) may result in alveolar rupture and alveolar hemorrhage. In the presence of acute lung injury and ARDS, a ventilator-delivered breath  preferentially  follows  the  path  of  least  resistance  and travels to better-aerated regions of the lungs, which puts the alveoli there at risk of overdistention. Th ese alveoli may collapse and reopen repeatedly, and this could be responsible for ventilator-induced lung injury. A gentler form of mechanical ventilation  using  tidal  volumes  of  5  to  8  mL/kg  and  airway pressures not exceeding 30 cm H 2 O may be indicated for treating acute respiratory failure and ARDS. However, use of this form of ventilation may require acceptance of some degree of hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis and o ft en a Pa o 2 of  less than 60 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Permissive hypercapnia or controlled hypoventilation may accompany the reduction in tidal volume and airway pressure designed to minimize or prevent alveolar overdistention. Th e increased respiratory drive associated with permissive hypercapnia causes discomfort, which makes deep sedation, skeletal muscle paralysis,  or  both  necessary.  Permissive  hypercapnia is  not  recommended  in  patients  with  increased  intracranial pressure, cardiac dysrhythmias, or pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Barotrauma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Barotrauma may present as subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum,  pulmonary  interstitial  emphysema,  pneumoperitoneum,  pneumopericardium,  arterial  gas  embolism, or tension pneumothorax. Th ese examples of extraalveolar air almost always re fl ect  dissection  or  passage  of  air  from  overdistended  and  ruptured  alveoli.  Infection  increases  the  risk of  barotrauma,  presumably  by  weakening  pulmonary  tissue. Tension pneumothorax is the most common life-threatening manifestation of ventilator-induced barotrauma. Hypotension, worsening hypoxemia, and increased airway pressure suggest the presence of a tension pneumothorax.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atelectasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atelectasis is a common cause of hypoxemia that develops during mechanical ventilation. Migration of the tracheal tube into the le ft or right main bronchus or development of mucus plugs should be considered when abrupt worsening of oxygenation occurs in the absence of hypotension. Arterial hypoxemia resulting from atelectasis is not responsive to an increase in F io 2 .  Other causes of sudden hypoxemia in mechanically ventilated patients include tension pneumothorax and pulmonary embolism, but in contrast to atelectasis, these are usually accompanied by hypotension. Bronchoscopy may be necessary to remove mucus plugs responsible for persistent atelectasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Critical Illness Myopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who undergo mechanical ventilation for treatment of acute respiratory failure are at risk of neuromuscular weakness that persists long a ft er the cause of the respiratory failure has resolved. A common cause of di ff use skeletal muscle weakness is polyneuropathy of critical illness, an axonal disorder that occurs in the presence of sepsis and multiple organ system failure. Prolonged administration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs may contribute to the development  of  an  acute  myopathy,  particularly  in  patients  who undergo concomitant therapy with corticosteroids. Th e duration  of  drug-induced  paralysis  rather  than  the  speci fi c  neuromuscular blocker used seems to be more important in the development of persistent weakness. Decreased clearance of active metabolites of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs resulting from renal and/or hepatic dysfunction is also  a  consideration  when  persistent  weakness  follows  prolonged administration of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring the progress of the treatment of acute respiratory failure includes evaluation of pulmonary gas exchange (arterial and venous blood gases, pHa) and cardiac function (cardiac output, cardiac fi lling pressures, intrapulmonary shunt). A pulmonary artery catheter is useful for performing many of these measurements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weaning from the Ventilator

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical ventilatory support can be withdrawn when a patient can maintain oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination  without  assistance.  When  determining  whether  the patient can be safely weaned from mechanical ventilation and will tolerate extubation, important considerations are that the patient be alert and cooperative and able to tolerate a trial of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
210

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
spontaneous ventilation without excessive tachypnea, tachycardia, or respiratory distress. Some of the guidelines that have been proposed for indicating the feasibility of discontinuing mechanical ventilation include (1) vital capacity of more than 15 mL/kg, (2) alveolar-arterial oxygen di ff erence of less than 350 cm H2O while breathing 100% oxygen, (3) Pa o 2 of more than 60 mm Hg with F io 2 of less than 0.5, (4) negative inspiratory pressure of more than -20 cm H2O, (5) normal pHa, (6)  respiratory  rate  of  less  than  20  breaths  per  minute,  and (7) dead-space ventilation/tidal volume ratio (V D/VT) of less than 0.6. Breathing at rapid rates and with low tidal volumes usually signi fi es an inability to tolerate extubation. Ultimately, the decision to attempt withdrawal of mechanical ventilation is individualized and considers not only pulmonary function but also the presence of co-existing abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  a  patient  is  ready  for  a  trial  of  withdrawal  from mechanical support of ventilation, three options may be considered: (1) synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, which allows spontaneous breathing amid progressively fewer mandatory breaths per minute until the patient is breathing unassisted; (2) intermittent trials of total removal of mechanical support and breathing through a T-piece; and (3) use of decreasing levels of pressure-support ventilation. Overall, correcting the underlying condition responsible for the need for mechanical support of ventilation seems to be more important  for  successful  extubation  than  the  weaning  method. Deterioration in oxygenation a ft er withdrawal of mechanical ventilation  may  re fl ect  progressive  alveolar  collapse,  which can be responsive to treatment with continuous positive airway   pressure rather than reinstitution of mechanical ventilation.  Presumably  continuous  positive  airway  pressure  helps maintain FRC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  things  may  interfere  with  successful  withdrawal from mechanical ventilation and extubation. Excessive workload  on  the  respiratory  muscles  imposed  by  hyperin fl ation, copious  secretions,  bronchospasm,  increased  lung  water,  or increased carbon dioxide production from fever or parenteral nutrition  greatly  decreases  the  likelihood  of  successful  tracheal  extubation.  Use  of  noninvasive  ventilation  as  a  bridge to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation may occasionally be considered. Th is involves early extubation with immediate application of a form of noninvasive ventilation. Th is method of weaning may be associated with a decreased incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, a shorter ICU stay, and a reduction in mortality. However, noninvasive ventilation may impair the ability to clear airway secretions if the patient does not have a good cough, and there may be inadequate control of minute ventilation. Careful patient selection is required if this modality is being considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal Extubation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal  extubation  should  be  considered  when  patients tolerate 30 minutes of spontaneous breathing with a continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H 2 O without deterioration in arterial blood gas concentrations, mental status, or cardiac function. Th e Pa o 2 should remain above 60 mm Hg with an F io 2 of less than 0.5. Likewise, the Pa co 2 should remain less than 50 mm Hg, and the pHa should remain above 7.30. Additional criteria for tracheal extubation include the need for less than 5 cm H2O PEEP, spontaneous breathing rates of less than 20 breaths per minute, and vital capacity of more than 15 mL/kg. Patients should be alert with active laryngeal re fl exes and the ability  to  generate  an  e ff ective  cough  and  clear  secretions. Protective  glottic  closure  function  may  be  impaired  following tracheal extubation, which results in an increased risk of aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen Supplementation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen  supplementation  is  o ft en  needed  a ft er  tracheal extubation. Th is  need  re fl ects  the  persistence  of  ventilation/ perfusion mismatching. Weaning from supplemental oxygen is accomplished by gradually decreasing the inspired concentration  of  oxygen,  as  guided  by  measurements  of  Pa o 2 and monitoring of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen Exchange and Arterial Oxygenation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adequacy  of  oxygen  exchange  across  alveolar-capillary membranes  is  re fl ected  by  the  Pa o 2 . Th e  e ffi cacy  of  this exchange is paralleled by the di ff erences between the calculated Pao 2 and measured Pa o 2 . Calculation of P ao 2 -Pa o 2 is useful for evaluating the gas-exchange function of the lungs and  for  distinguishing  among  the  various  causes  of  arterial hypoxemia (Table 9-15).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant desaturation of arterial  blood  occurs  only when the Pa o 2 is less than 60 mm Hg. Ventilation/perfusion mismatching, right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunting, and

hypoventilation  are  the  principal  causes  of  arterial  hypoxemia. Increasing the inspired oxygen concentration is likely to improve Pa o 2 in all these conditions, with the exception of a signi fi cant right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compensatory  responses  to  arterial  hypoxemia  vary.  As a  general  rule,  these  responses  are  stimulated  by  an  acute decrease in Pa o 2 below 60 mm Hg. Compensatory responses are  also  present  in  chronic  hypoxemia  when  the  Pa o 2 is less  than 50 mm Hg. Th ese responses to arterial hypoxemia include (1) carotid body-induced increase in alveolar ventilation, (2) regional pulmonary artery vasoconstriction (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction) to divert pulmonary blood fl ow away  from  hypoxic  alveoli,  and  (3)  increased  sympathetic nervous system activity to enhance tissue oxygen delivery by increasing cardiac output. With chronic hypoxemia, there is also an increase in red blood cell mass to improve the oxygencarrying capacity of the blood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carbon Dioxide Elimination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  adequacy  of  alveolar  ventilation  relative  to  the  metabolic  production  of  carbon  dioxide  is  re fl ected  by  the  Pa co 2 (Table 9-16). Th e  e ffi cacy  of  carbon  dioxide  transfer  across alveolar-capillary membranes is re fl ected by V D/VT. Th is ratio indicates areas in the lungs that receive adequate ventilation but inadequate or no pulmonary blood fl ow.  Ventilation  to  these alveoli is described as "wasted ventilation" or dead-space ventilation. Normally, the V D/VT is less than 0.3, but it may increase to 0.6 or more when there is an increase in dead-space ventilation. An increased V D/VT occurs in the presence of acute respiratory failure, a decrease in cardiac output, and pulmonary embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercarbia is de fi ned as a Pa co 2 of more than 45 mm Hg. Permissive  hypercapnia  is  the  strategy  of  allowing  Pa co 2 to  increase  to  up  to  55  mm  Hg  in  spontaneously  breathing patients to avoid or delay the need for tracheal intubation and mechanical  ventilation.  Symptoms  and  signs  of  hypercarbia depend on the rate of increase and the ultimate level of Pa co 2 . Acute increases in Pa co 2 are associated with increased cerebral blood fl ow and increased intracranial pressure. Extreme increases in Pa co 2 to more than 80 mm Hg may result in central nervous system depression.

Mixed Venous Partial Pressure of Oxygen

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  mixed  venous  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  (Pv o 2 )  and the  arterial-venous  oxygen  di ff erence  (Ca o 2 -Cv o 2 )  re fl ect the overall adequacy of the oxygen transport system (cardiac output)  relative  to  tissue  oxygen  extraction.  For  example, a  decrease  in  cardiac  output  that  occurs  in  the  presence  of unchanged tissue oxygen consumption causes Pv o 2 to decrease and Ca o 2 -Cv o 2 to increase. Th ese changes re fl ect the continued extraction of the same amount of oxygen by the tissues during a time of decreased tissue blood fl ow. A Pv o 2 of less than 30  mm Hg or a Ca o 2 -Cv o 2 higher  than  6  mL/dL  indicates the need to increase cardiac output to facilitate tissue oxygenation. A pulmonary artery catheter permits sampling of mixed venous blood, measurement of Pv o 2 , and calculation of Cv o 2 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial pH

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurement  of  pHa  is  necessary  to  detect  acidemia  or alkalemia.  Metabolic  acidosis  predictably  accompanies  arterial hypoxemia and inadequate delivery of oxygen to tissues. Acidemia caused by respiratory or metabolic derangements is associated with dysrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkalemia  is  o ft en  associated  with  mechanical  hyperventilation  and  diuretic  use,  which  lead  to  loss  of  chloride and potassium ions. Th e  incidence  of  dysrhythmias  may  be increased by metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. Th e presence of alkalemia in patients recovering from acute respiratory failure can delay or prevent successful weaning from mechanical ventilation because of the compensatory hypoventilation that will occur in an e ff ort to correct the pH disturbance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intrapulmonary Shunt

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right-to-le ft intrapulmonary  shunting  occurs  when  there is perfusion of alveoli that are not ventilated. Th e net e ff ect is a decrease in Pa o 2 , re fl ecting dilution of oxygen in blood exposed to ventilated alveoli with blood containing little oxygen coming from unventilated alveoli. Calculation of the shunt fraction provides a reliable assessment of ventilation/perfusion matching and serves as a useful estimate of the response to various therapeutic interventions during treatment of acute respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologic  shunt  normally  comprises  2%  to  5%  of  the cardiac  output. Th is  degree  of  right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunting  re fl ects  the  passage  of  pulmonary  arterial  blood directly to the le ft side of the circulation through the bronchial and thebesian veins. It should be appreciated that determination of the shunt fraction in a patient breathing less than 100% oxygen re fl ects the contribution of ventilation/perfusion mismatching and right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunting. Calculation of the shunt fraction from measurements obtained when the patient breathes 100% oxygen eliminates the contribution of ventilation/perfusion mismatching.

PULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery  predisposes  patients  to  pulmonary  thromboembolism even as late as 1 month postoperatively. Despite signi fi -cant advances in the prophylaxis and diagnosis of deep venous

<!-- PAGE=? -->
212

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
thrombosis, the mortality and recurrence rate of pulmonary embolism remain high. Th e clinical presentation of acute pulmonary thromboembolism ranges from shock or sustained hypotension  to  mild  dyspnea.  Pulmonary  embolism  may even be asymptomatic and diagnosed by imaging procedures performed for other purposes. Depending on the clinical presentation, the case fatality rate for acute pulmonary embolism ranges from 1% to 60%. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for pulmonary embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accurate  detection  of  pulmonary  embolism  remains  di ffi -cult, and the di ff erential diagnosis is extensive (Table 9-17). Pulmonary embolism can accompany or mimic other cardiopulmonary  illnesses.  Clinical  manifestations  of  pulmonary  embolism  are  nonspeci fi c,  and  the  diagnosis  is  o ft en di ffi cult to establish on clinical grounds alone (Table 9-18). Th e most consistent symptom of acute pulmonary embolism is  acute dyspnea. Pleuritic or substernal chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis suggest pulmonary infarction resulting from an embolism near the pleural surface. Tachypnea and tachycardia are the most common signs of pulmonary embolism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
but are nonspeci fi c. Other physical fi ndings include wheezing, fever, rales, a pleural rub, a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular li ft , and bulging neck veins. Arterial blood gas values can be normal or demonstrate arterial hypoxemia and hypocapnia (from stimulation of airway irritant receptors that causes hyperventilation), but this is not speci fi c to pulmonary embolism. In the presence  of  a  patent  foramen  ovale  or  atrial  septal  defect, paradoxical  embolization  may  occur  and  interatrial  rightto-le ft shunting of blood may cause severe hypoxemia. ECG fi ndings  in  the  majority  of  patients  with  acute  pulmonary embolism include ST-T wave changes and right axis deviation.  Peaked  P  waves,  atrial fi brillation,  and  right  bundle branch block may be present if the pulmonary embolism is su ffi ciently large to cause acute cor pulmonale. Th e principal utility of the ECG is to help distinguish between pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial infarction or other alternative diagnoses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transthoracic echocardiography may be particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload as well as myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and pericardial tamponade, which can mimic pulmonary embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography may show acute dilation of the right atrium and right ventricle, pulmonary hypertension, and occasionally even thrombus in the main pulmonary arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations  of  pulmonary  embolism  during  anesthesia are nonspeci fi c and o ft en transient. Changes suggestive of pulmonary embolism during anesthesia include unexplained arterial  hypoxemia,  hypotension,  tachycardia,  and  bronchospasm. Th e  ECG  and  central  venous  pressure  may  indicate the  onset  of  pulmonary  hypertension  and  right  ventricular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Capnography will demonstrate a decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension. Th is represents an increase in dead-space ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory testing that aids in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism includes the D-dimer test. A positive D-dimer test  result  means  that  a  pulmonary  embolism  is  possible. A negative D-dimer result strongly suggests that thromboembolism is absent. Th e negative predictive value of the D-dimer test is above 99%. Troponin levels may be elevated and may represent right ventricular myocyte damage caused by acute right ventricular strain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spiral CT scanning with contrast is useful for diagnosing both acute and chronic pulmonary embolism and has replaced ventilation-perfusion scanning in many centers. It is most useful in detecting clots in the main, lobar, and segmental pulmonary arteries and is much less sensitive in detecting emboli in smaller blood vessels. However, it is these larger emboli that are most important clinically.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary arteriography is the gold standard for the diagnosis  of  pulmonary  embolism.  It  is  used  when  pulmonary embolism must be diagnosed or excluded and other preliminary testing has yielded inconclusive results.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilation-perfusion  lung  scanning  and  ultrasonography  of  leg  veins  are  other  noninvasive  tests  that  can  aid  in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  assessment  of  the  clinical  probability  of  pulmonary  embolism  is  based  on  clinical  judgment.  Patients are considered to be in hemodynamically unstable condition if  they are in shock or have a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease in blood pressure of more than 40 mm Hg for longer than 15 minutes in the absence of newonset dysrhythmias, hypovolemia, or sepsis. In cases in which spiral CT is not available or in patients with renal failure or allergy to contrast dye, the use of ventilation-perfusion scanning is the best alternative. However, spiral CT should be performed when the patient's condition has stabilized if doubts remain about clinical management. In patients who are candidates for percutaneous embolectomy, conventional pulmonary angiography can be performed to con fi rm the diagnosis of  pulmonary  embolism  immediately  before  the  embolectomy procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  options  for  acute  pulmonary  embolism  include anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy, inferior vena caval fi lter placement, and surgical embolectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heparin  remains  the  cornerstone  of  treatment  for  acute pulmonary  embolism.  An  intravenous  bolus  of  unfractionated heparin (5000 to 10,000 units) followed by a continuous intravenous infusion should be administered immediately to any  patient  considered  to  have  a  high  clinical  likelihood  of pulmonary embolism. An alternative is low-molecular-weight heparin given subcutaneously. Th e optimal duration of anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism remains uncertain, but it is known that a treatment period of 6 months is associated with many fewer recurrences than a treatment period of 6 weeks. Th is  extended  period  of  anticoagulation  is  usually  accomplished with warfarin in a dosage that maintains an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who cannot undergo anticoagulation, experience signi fi cant bleeding while being treated with anticoagulants, or  have  recurrent  pulmonary  emboli  despite  receiving  anticoagulant therapy may require insertion of a vena cava fi lter to  prevent  lower-extremity  thrombi  from  becoming  pulmonary emboli. Th e use of vena cava fi lters should be reserved for patients with contraindications to anticoagulant treatment. Retrievable vena cava fi lters may be an option for patients with presumed  time-limited  contraindications  to  anticoagulant therapy  or  for  patients  requiring  procedures  that  are  associated with both a risk of bleeding and a risk of pulmonary embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombolytic therapy may be considered to hasten dissolution of pulmonary emboli, especially if there is hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia. Hemorrhage is the principal adverse e ff ect of thrombolytic therapy, and so this treatment is contraindicated in patients at high risk of bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hypotension  caused  by  a  pulmonary  embolism  may require treatment with inotropes such as dopamine and dobutamine or a vasoconstrictor such as norepinephrine. A pulmonary vasodilator may be needed to help control pulmonary hypertension. Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Analgesics to treat the pain associated with pulmonary embolism are important but must be administered very carefully because of the underlying cardiovascular instability. Pulmonary artery embolectomy is reserved for patients who have a massive pulmonary embolism that is unresponsive to medical therapy and who cannot receive thrombolytic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for the surgical treatment of lifethreatening pulmonary embolism is designed to support vital organ function and to minimize anesthetic-induced myocardial depression. Patients typically arrive in the operating room intubated and mechanically ventilated, o ft en with a high F io 2. Monitoring of intraarterial pressure and cardiac fi lling pressures is necessary. Right atrial fi lling pressure can be a guide to intravenous fl uid administration aimed at optimizing right ventricular fi lling pressure and stroke volume in the presence of a marked increase in right ventricular a ft erload. It may be necessary to support cardiac output with inotropic drugs. Catecholamines such as dopamine and dobutamine may increase myocardial  contractility  but  have  little  e ff ect  on  pulmonary vascular  resistance. Th e  phosphodiesterase  inhibitors  amrinone and milrinone increase myocardial contractility and are excellent pulmonary artery vasodilators. Th is combination of e ff ects may be particularly useful in this situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction and maintenance of anesthesia must avoid any accentuation of arterial hypoxemia, systemic hypotension, or pulmonary hypertension. Anesthesia can be maintained with any drug or combination of drugs that does not produce signi fi cant myocardial depression. Nitrous oxide is not a likely selection, because of the need to administer high concentrations  of  oxygen  and  the  potential  for  this  drug  to  increase pulmonary vascular resistance. A nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug that does not release histamine is best.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Removal of embolic fragments from the distal pulmonary artery may be facilitated by the application of positive pressure while the surgeon applies suction through the arteriotomy in the  main  pulmonary  artery.  Although  the  cardiopulmonary status of these patients is perilous before surgery, signi fi cant hemodynamic improvement usually occurs postoperatively.

FAT EMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e syndrome of fat embolism typically appears 12 to 72 hours a ft er  long-bone  fractures,  especially  fractures  of  the  femur or  tibia.  Fat  embolism  syndrome  has  also  been  observed  in association with acute pancreatitis, cardiopulmonary bypass, parenteral  infusion  of  lipids,  and  liposuction. Th e  triad  of hypoxemia, mental confusion, and petechiae in patients with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
214

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
tibia or femur fractures should arouse suspicion of fat embolism.  Associated  pulmonary  dysfunction  may  be  limited  to arterial hypoxemia, which is always present, or it may progress  from  tachypnea  to  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome. Central nervous system dysfunction ranges from confusion to seizures and coma. Petechiae, especially over the neck, shoulders, and chest, occur in at least 50% of patients with clinical evidence of fat embolism and are thought to be caused by embolic fat rather than by thrombocytopenia or other disorders of coagulation. An increased serum lipase concentration or the presence of lipiduria is suggestive of fat embolism but may also occur a ft er trauma in the absence of a fat embolism. Signi fi cant fever and tachycardia are o ft en present. Magnetic resonance imaging can show the characteristic cerebral lesions during the acute stage of fat embolism syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e source of fat producing a fat embolism is most likely disruption  of  the  adipose  architecture  of  the  bone  marrow. Th e  pathophysiology  of  fat  embolism  syndrome  relates  to obstruction  of  blood  vessels  by  fat  particles  and  the  deleterious e ff ects of free fatty acids released from the fat particles as  a  result  of  lipase  activity. Th ese free fatty acids can cause an acute, di ff use vasculitis, especially of the cerebral and pulmonary  vasculature.  Treatment  of  fat  embolism  syndrome includes management of acute respiratory distress syndrome and  immobilization  of long-bone  fractures. Prophylactic administration  of  corticosteroids  to  patients  at  risk  may  be useful, but the e ffi cacy of corticosteroids for treatment of the established syndrome has not been documented. Conceptually, corticosteroids could decrease the incidence of fat embolism syndrome by limiting the endothelial damage caused by free fatty acids.

In patients with pulmonary hypertension,  high  vascular  resistance  in  the  remaining  native  lung requires  the  allogra ft to  handle  nearly  the  entire  cardiac output. Th is  could  result  in  reperfusion  pulmonary  edema and poor allogra ft function  in  the  period  immediately  a ft er surgery.  Fibrotic  lung  disease  responds  well  to  single-lung transplantation  because  both  ventilation  and  perfusion  are distributed  preferentially  to  the  transplanted  lung.  Bilateral sequential  lung  transplantation  involves  the  sequential  performance of two single-lung transplants at one time. In the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension, cardiopulmonary bypass can usually be avoided by ventilating the contralateral lung  during  each  implantation. Th e  primary  indications  for double-lung transplantation are cystic fi brosis and other forms of bronchiectasis. Immunosuppression is initiated intraoperatively and continued for life.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTATION

Management of anesthesia for lung transplantation invokes the same principles followed when pneumonectomy is performed.

Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologically,  patients  selected  for  lung  transplantation most o ft en have restrictive lung disease and a large P ao 2 -Pa o 2 . Th ese  patients  generally  have  irreversible  and  progressive pulmonary disease. (Malignancy is regarded as a contraindication to transplantation because of the risk of cancer recurrence with immunosuppression.) Mild to moderate degrees of pulmonary hypertension and some degree of right-sided heart failure are o ft en present. Smokers should have quit smoking at least 6 to 12 months before transplantation. Th e ability of the right ventricle to maintain an adequate stroke volume in the presence of the acute increase in pulmonary vascular resistance produced by clamping the pulmonary artery before the native lung is removed needs to be assessed. Evaluation of oxygen dependence and steroid use, hematologic and biochemical analyses, and tests of lung and other major organ system function are also required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posterolateral  thoracotomy  is  performed  for  single-lung transplantation  and  bilateral  anterothoracosternotomy  for bilateral or sequential single-lung transplantation. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be needed if cardiac or respiratory instability  develops  during  the  procedure. Th e  lung  with  poorer perfusion is removed in single-lung transplantation. Monitoring includes placement of intraarterial and pulmonary artery catheters. Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is especially important. During surgery, care must be taken to make sure that the pulmonary artery catheter is withdrawn from the pulmonary artery to be stapled and re fl oated to the nonoperative lung. Transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring can be used to evaluate right and le ft ventricular function and fl uid

balance. Th ere  are  no  speci fi c  recommendations  regarding drugs for induction and maintenance of anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis for lung transplantation. Drug-induced histamine release is undesirable, and drug-induced bronchodilation is useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  trachea is  intubated with a double-lumen endobronchial tube, and its proper placement is veri fi ed by fi beroptic bronchoscopy. Possible intraoperative problems include arterial hypoxemia, especially during one-lung ventilation. Continuous  positive  airway  pressure  to  the  nondependent  lung, PEEP  to  the  dependent  lung,  or  some  form  of  di ff erential lung ventilation may be needed to minimize intrapulmonary shunting. Severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure can occur when the pulmonary artery is clamped. Infusion of a pulmonary vasodilator such as prostacyclin or inhalation of nitric oxide may be helpful for controlling pulmonary hypertension. In extreme cases, support with partial cardiopulmonary bypass is required. Connection of the donor lung to the recipient is usually performed in the sequence of pulmonary veins to the le ft atrium, then anastomosis of the pulmonary artery, and fi nally anastomosis of the bronchus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative mechanical ventilation is continued as needed. Th e principal causes of mortality with lung transplantation are bronchial dehiscence and respiratory failure due to sepsis or rejection. Th e denervation of the donor lung deprives patients of normal cough re fl exes from the lower airways and predisposes to the development of pneumonia. In the absence of rejection, pulmonary function test results can be normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA IN LUNG TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management in patients requiring surgery following lung transplantation should focus on (1) the function of the transplanted lung, (2) the possibility of rejection or infection in the transplanted lung, (3) the e ff ect of immunosuppressive therapy on other organ systems and the e ff ect of other organ system dysfunction on the transplanted lung, (4) the disease in the native lung, and (5) the planned surgical procedure and its likely e ff ects on the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation before surgery includes obtaining a history suggestive  of  rejection  or  infection,  auscultation  of  the  lungs (normally  clear),  and  evaluation  of  the  results  of  pulmonary  function  tests,  arterial  blood  gas  analyses,  and  chest radiographs. If rejection or infection is suspected, elective surgery should be postponed. Th e side e ff ects of immunosuppressive drugs should be noted. Hypertension and renal dysfunction related to cyclosporine therapy are present in many patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because transplanted lungs may have ongoing rejection that can adversely a ff ect  pulmonary function, it is recommended that  spirometry  be  performed  preoperatively.  It  may  be  diffi cult to di ff erentiate between chronic rejection and infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With  chronic  rejection,  the  FEV 1 ,  vital  capacity,  and  total lung capacity decrease and arterial blood gas values show an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, but carbon dioxide retention is rare. Bronchiolitis obliterans usually presents as a nonproductive cough developing a ft er the third month following transplantation. Symptoms can mimic those of URI and include fever and fatigue. Dyspnea occurs within months and is followed by a clinical course similar to that of COPD. Chest radiographs show peribronchial and interstitial in fi ltrates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Premedication  is  acceptable  if  pulmonary  function  is adequate.  Hypercarbia  is  common  during  the  early  posttransplantation period. Th is  could  be  exacerbated  by  opioid administration.  Antisialagogues  can  be  useful,  since  secretions can be excessive. Supplemental corticosteroids may be needed for long, stressful surgical procedures. A major cause of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  transplant  recipients  is  infection. Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated, and strict aseptic technique is required for placement of intravascular catheters. Lung denervation has limited e ff ects on the pattern of breathing,  but  bronchial  hyperreactivity  and  bronchoconstriction are common. Denervation ablates a ff erent sensation below the level of the tracheal anastomosis. Patients lose the cough re fl ex and are prone to retention of secretions and silent aspiration. Response to carbon dioxide rebreathing is normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because lung transplant recipients lack a cough re fl ex below the tracheal anastomosis, they do not clear secretions unless they are awake. Because of the diminished cough re fl ex, the potential  for  bronchoconstriction,  and  the  increased  risk  of pulmonary infection, it is recommended that regional anesthesia  be  selected  whenever  possible.  Epidural  and  spinal anesthesia  are  acceptable.  However,  depression  of  intercostal  muscle  function  may  have  special  implications  in  these patients. Any nerve blockade procedure carries a risk of introducing  infection. Th e  importance  of  using  sterile  technique in this high-risk population cannot be overemphasized. Fluid preloading before spinal or epidural anesthesia may be risky in patients with a transplanted lung, because disruption of the lymphatic drainage in the transplanted lung causes interstitial fl uid accumulation. Th is is particularly problematic during the early posttransplantation period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In heart-lung  transplant recipients, fl uid  management may  be  particularly  challenging,  because  the  heart  requires adequate  preload  to  maintain  cardiac  output,  but  the  lungs have a lower than normal threshold for developing pulmonary edema.  In  this  situation,  invasive  monitoring  may  be  very useful, but the bene fi ts  must be balanced against the risk of infection.  Transesophageal  echocardiography  can  be  useful for monitoring volume status and cardiac function. If a central venous catheter is inserted via the internal jugular vein, it is prudent to select the internal jugular vein on the side of the native lung. Cardiac denervation is another consideration in  patients  who  have  undergone  heart-lung  transplantation. Th ese  patients  may  develop  intraoperative  bradycardia  that does not respond to administration of atropine. Epinephrine

and/or  isoproterenol  may  be  required  to  increase  the  heart rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  important  goal  of  anesthetic  management  is  prompt recovery of adequate respiratory function and early tracheal extubation. Volatile anesthetics are well tolerated, and use of nitrous oxide is acceptable in the absence of bullous disease. Immunosuppressive drugs may interact with neuromuscular blocking  drugs,  and  the  impaired  renal  function  caused  by immunosuppressive drugs may prolong the e ff ects of certain muscle relaxants. Th e  e ff ects  of  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blockers  are  routinely  antagonized  pharmacologically, because  even  minimal  residual  weakness  can  compromise ventilation in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When an endotracheal tube is positioned, it is best to place the cu ff just  beyond the vocal cords to minimize the risk of traumatizing  the  tracheal  anastomosis.  Inadvertent  endobronchial intubation of the native or transplanted lung must be avoided. If the surgical procedure requires use of a doublelumen endobronchial tube, it is preferable to place the endobronchial portion of the tube in the native bronchus, so as to avoid contact with the tracheal anastomosis. In patients with a single lung transplant, positive pressure ventilation may be complicated  by  di ff erences  in  lung  compliance  between  the native and transplanted lung.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologic Effects

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Single or bilateral lung transplantation in patients with endstage  lung  disease  can  dramatically  improve  lung  function. Peak improvement is usually achieved within 3 to 6 months. Arterial  oxygenation rapidly returns to normal, and supplemental oxygen is no longer needed. In patients with pulmonary vascular disease, both single and bilateral lung transplantation result  in  immediate  and  sustained  normalization  of  pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. Th is is accompanied by a prompt increase in cardiac output and a gradual remodeling of the right ventricle with a decrease in ventricular  wall  thickness.  Exercise  capacity  improves  su ffi -ciently to permit most lung transplant patients to resume an active lifestyle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e innervation of the lung, the lymphatic drainage of the lung,  and  the  bronchial  circulation  are  disrupted  when  the donor  pneumonectomy  is  performed. Th e  principal  e ff ect of lung denervation is loss of the cough re fl ex, which places patients at risk of aspiration and pulmonary infection. Mucociliary  clearance  is  impaired  during  the  early  postoperative period.  Lymphatic  drainage  disrupted  by  transection  of  the trachea and bronchi may be reestablished during the fi rst few weeks  postoperatively.  O ft en  a  blunted  ventilatory  response to  carbon dioxide persists even though pulmonary function improves. Denervation of the heart is another consideration in patients undergoing heart-lung transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mild transient pulmonary edema is common in a newly transplanted lung. In some patients, however, pulmonary edema is su ffi ciently severe to cause a form of acute respiratory failure termed primary gra ft failure. Th e diagnosis is con fi rmed by the appearance of in fi ltrates on chest radiographs and severe hypoxemia during the fi rst 72 hours postoperatively. Treatment is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation. Mortality is high.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dehiscence of the bronchial anastomosis mandates immediate surgical correction or retransplantation. Stenosis of the bronchial anastomosis is the most common airway complication and typically occurs several weeks a ft er transplantation. Evidence of clinically signi fi cant airway stenosis includes focal wheezing, recurrent lower respiratory tract infection, and suboptimal pulmonary function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  rate  of  infection  in  lung  transplant recipients is several times higher than that in recipients of other transplanted organs and is most likely related to exposure of the allogra ft to the external environment. Bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract is the most common manifestation of pulmonary infection. A ubiquitous organism acquired by inhalation is Aspergillus, which frequently colonizes the airways of lung transplant recipients. However, clinical infection with Aspergillus develops in only a small number of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute rejection of a lung allogra ft is a common event and is usually seen during the fi rst 100 days following transplantation.  Clinical  manifestations  are  nonspeci fi c  and  include malaise,  low-grade  fever,  dyspnea,  impaired  oxygenation, and leukocytosis. Transbronchial lung biopsy is needed for a de fi nitive diagnosis. Treatment of acute rejection consists of intravenous methylprednisolone. Most patients have a prompt clinical  response,  although  histologic  evidence  of  rejection may persist even in the absence of clinical symptoms and signs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic rejection is manifested as bronchiolitis obliterans, a fi broproliferative process that targets the small airways and leads to submucosal fi brosis and luminal obliteration. Bronchiolitis  obliterans  is  uncommon  during  the fi rst  6  months following  transplantation,  but  its  incidence  exceeds  60%  in patients  who  survive  at  least  5  years. Th e  onset  of  this  syndrome  is  insidious  and  is  characterized  by  dyspnea,  cough, and colonization of the airways with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which produces recurrent bouts of purulent tracheobronchitis. Th e overall prognosis is poor. Retransplantation is the only de fi nitive treatment for severe bronchiolitis obliterans.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Surgical patients with preexisting respiratory disease are at increased risk of respiratory complications both during and a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e anesthetic management of a patient with a recent URI should  be  focused  on  reducing  secretions  and  limiting manipulation of a potentially hyperresponsive airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Asthma treatment has two components. Th e fi rst is the use of controller treatments, which modify the airway environment so that acute airway narrowing occurs less frequently. Th e second is the use of reliever or rescue agents for acute bronchospasm.  Reliever  treatments  include β -adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In  asthmatic  patients,  the  goal  during  induction  and maintenance  of  anesthesia  is  to  depress  airway  re fl exes su ffi ciently  to  avoid  bronchoconstriction  in  response  to mechanical stimulation of the airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cessation  of  smoking  and  long-term  oxygen  therapy  are two  important  therapeutic  interventions  that  may  favorably alter the natural progression of COPD associated with hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Pulmonary function tests have limited value in predicting the likelihood of postoperative pulmonary complications, and the results of pulmonary function tests alone should not be used to deny patients surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients with COPD need to be ventilated at slow respiratory rates to allow su ffi cient time for exhalation to occur. Th is minimizes the risk of air trapping and auto-PEEP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In  patients  with  COPD,  prophylaxis  against  the  development of postoperative pulmonary complications is based on restoring diminished lung volumes, especially FRC, and facilitating production of an e ff ective cough to remove airway secretions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e most e ff ective treatment for aspiration pneumonitis is delivery of supplemental oxygen and initiation of PEEP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Treatment options for acute pulmonary embolism include anticoagulation,  thrombolytic  therapy,  inferior  vena  cava fi lter placement, and surgical embolectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e principal e ff ect of lung denervation as a result of lung transplantation  is  loss  of  the  cough  re fl ex,  which  places patients at risk of aspiration and pulmonary infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In heart-lung transplant recipients, fl uid management is a challenge  because  the  heart  requires  adequate  preload  to maintain cardiac output, but the lungs have a low threshold for developing pulmonary edema.
