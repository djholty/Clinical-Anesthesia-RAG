Abstract

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Purpose The purpose of this Continuing Professional Development Module is to review the issues pertinent to one-lung ventilation (OLV) and to propose a management strategy for ventilation before, during, and after lung isolation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Principal findings The need for optimal lung isolation has increased with the advent of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, as surgical exposure is critical for successful surgery. Continuous positive airway pressure applied to the operative lung or intermittent two-lung ventilation should therefore be avoided if possible. Optimal management of OLV should provide adequate oxygenation and also prevent acute lung injury (ALI), the leading cause of death following lung resection. Research conducted in the last decade suggests implementing a protective ventilation strategy during OLV that consists of small tidal volumes based on ideal body weight, routine use of positive end-expiratory pressure, low inspired oxygen

High respiratory rates to compensate for low tidal volumes may predispose to significant air trapping during OLV, so permissive hypercapnea is routinely employed. The management of OLV extends into the period of two-lung ventilation, as the period prior to OLV impacts lung collapse, and both the time before and after OLV influence the extent of ALI. Lung re-expansion at the conclusion of OLV is an important component of ensuring adequate ventilation and oxygenation postoperatively but may be harmful to the lung.

Conclusions Optimal perioperative care of the thoracic patient includes a protective ventilation strategy from intubation to extubation and into the immediate postoperative period. Anesthetic goals include the prevention of perioperative hypoxemia and postoperative ALI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advances in one-lung ventilation (OLV) techniques have enabled increasingly complex intrathoracic procedures and are essential to the success of videoassisted thoracic surgery (VATS). The purpose of lung isolation is to provide surgical exposure while ensuring adequate gas exchange in the face of a significant right-toleft shunt created by the collapse of the operative lung.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditionally, anesthesiologists were taught to ventilate the non-operative lung during OLV with a tidal volume (Vt) equal to those used during two-lung ventilation (TLV), zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP), and a high inspired oxygen fraction (F I O2). These recommendations were based on studies showing improved oxygenation with a larger Vt. 1,2 In the last decade, however, two significant changes have impacted the management of OLV: the recognition of OLV-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the increasing popularity of VATS as a surgical technique. Hypoxemia, previously the primary concern of anesthesiologists during OLV, has become less frequent due to improved lung isolation, newer anesthetic agents, and better ventilation management. 3

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The primary objective of this review is to present evidence-based recommendations for clinical OLV. Optimal ventilatory management of the non-operative lung ensures stable oxygenation in the majority of cases and minimizes the need for interventions on the operative lung that may interfere with the surgical procedure. The best management practices recommended here are based as much as possible on the published literature. When consensus is not well established, we express our opinion as clinical experts in the field of thoracic anesthesia. After a brief review of the basic physiologic principles and complications of OLV, we propose a strategy for OLV focused on optimal oxygenation and prevention of lung injury (see Table 1 for the summary of clinical recommendations).

Physiology of OLV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The induction of anesthesia and muscle paralysis results in a decrease in functional residual capacity secondary to the

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
loss of muscle tone in the chest wall and diaphragm. With the lateral decubitus (LD) position, dependent lung compliance is reduced, shifting most of the Vt towards the upper lung during TLV. Pulmonary perfusion preferentially goes to the dependent lung due to gravity. Once lung isolation is established, ventilation is restricted to the dependent lung and any residual perfusion to the non-dependent lung becomes true shunt flow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxemia during OLV is primarily caused by the obligatory shunt through the collapsed lung, and the distribution of perfusion is the major determinant of the degree of venous admixture. Shunt fraction will be higher in a right-sided surgery, as the right lung is known to receive a larger proportion of the cardiac output (estimated at 55% compared with 45% for the left lung). Multiple beneficial factors are at play to reduce the perfusion to the non-dependent lung: gravity in the LD position, surgical manipulation, retraction of the lung, and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). 3-5

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is a potent physiological process that reduces blood flow to poorly ventilated lung areas in an attempt to improve ventilation/ perfusion (V/Q) matching. The primary stimulus for HPV is a decrease in the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen (PAO2), which results in rapid vasoconstriction with an initial plateau at 15 min following lung isolation. Maximal vasoconstriction, which is thought to reduce shunt flow by 40%, is reached only after four hours. 3 Dose-dependent inhibition of HPV has been shown with the older inhaled anesthetics (halothane, nitrous oxide) 4 but is less well documented with the newer agents (desflurane, sevoflurane). 6,7 Other factors affecting HPV include systemic and pulmonary vasodilators, acid/base imbalance, and variations in cardiac output. 3,4

Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the early days of thoracic anesthesia, hypoxemia was encountered in as many as 40% of cases with a Carlens double-lumen tube and manual ventilation. 8 The incidence of perioperative hypoxemia has decreased significantly over the years, likely due to better lung isolation, improved tube design, and newer volatile anesthetics with lesser effects on HPV. Rates of hypoxemia as low as 1% have been reported. 9 Nevertheless, hypoxemia likely continues to occur in up to 10% of patients and remains a significant clinical concern. 10

Failure of lung isolation is a well-recognized mechanism for intraoperative hypoxemia. Routine fibreoptic bronchoscopy is strongly recommended to confirm initial

Acute lung injury

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The diagnosis of ALI is based on an acute reduction in the PaO2/ F I O2 ratio to \ 300 along with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph in the absence of left heart failure. There is accumulating evidence that OLV management can influence the incidence and severity of this complication.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fortunately, ALI after lung resection is rare, occurring in 2.5% of all lung resections combined, with a greater incidence of 7.9% after pneumonectomies. 12 Nevertheless, ALI is a major cause of overall mortality after thoracic surgery due to its high mortality rate (25-40%). 13 A biphasic distribution has been described for ALI which corresponds to different pathogenic triggers: a primary form triggered by perioperative factors occurs within three days, and a second delayed form triggered by postoperative complications is generally observed between postoperative days 3 and 10. 14 Risk factors for primary ALI in thoracic surgery include peak inspiratory pressure [ 40 cm H2O, plateau pressure [ 29 cm H2O, long duration of OLV, excessive fluid administration, pneumonectomy, and

FEV1 = forced expiratory volume after one second; MAC = minimum alveolar concentration; OLV = one-lung ventilation; PaO2 = arterial oxygen pressure preoperative alcohol abuse (Table 2). 3,15 The etiology of post-thoracotomy lung injury, however, is likely multifactorial and probably involves a multiple-hit sequence of deleterious events that culminate in alveolar and capillary injury. 3,16

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diffuse alveolar damage develops from the direct effect of high pressure on the lungs (barotrauma), lung overdistension (volutrauma), repetitive opening and closing of alveoli (atelectotrauma), and local inflammatory mediators and cytokines (biotrauma). 17 Due to the similarities with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a comparable ventilation strategy has been adopted which consists of lower Vt(4-6 mL /C1 kg -1 of ideal body weight [IBW]), plateau pressure \ 30 cm H2O, application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and periodic recruitment maneuvers. 18,19

Indications and contraindications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditional absolute indications for lung isolation were the prevention of spillage of blood or pus from a diseased contralateral lung or loss of Vt across a bronchopulmonary fistula. Nowadays, surgical exposure has become an absolute indication in the majority of intrathoracic procedures, particularly with the increased use of minimally invasive techniques. There is no true contraindication to lung isolation and OLV other than inadequate lung function to support OLV.

Predictors of hypoxemia

Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Standard Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society monitoring 20 may be sufficient for simple procedures requiring short-term OLV, such as diagnostic thoracoscopies. Nevertheless, arterial blood gas analysis is extremely helpful to assess oxygenation and the adequacy of ventilation in light of the increased end-tidal and arterial pressure carbon dioxide (ETCO2-PaCO2) gradients during OLV. Beyond blood gas analyses, arterial line access enables hemodynamic monitoring in more complicated surgical procedures with significant risk for hemodynamic instability, hemorrhage, or fluid shifts. Continuous spirometry is a valuable adjunct to assess changes in lung compliance due to recruitment/ derecruitment and to diagnose air leaks and air-trapping. Cerebral oximetry is currently being assessed with regard to its value in thoracic surgery. 21 Transesophageal echocardiography can also be helpful in the perioperative assessment of right heart dysfunction, which may be worsened due to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance induced by the initiation of OLV and/or the clamping of the branches of the pulmonary artery.

From induction of anesthesia to OLV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines are emerging for routine use of protective lung ventilation during TLV in patients without lung injury. 22 A recent trial involving 400 patients at intermediate to high risk of pulmonary complications in abdominal surgery showed improved clinical outcomes with a low Vt (mean 6.4 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW) and PEEP (median 6 cm H2O) compared with non-protective ventilation (mean Vt of 11.1 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW and no PEEP). 23 Ideal (or predicted) body weight can be readily estimated based on patient height and sex (Table 4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application of PEEP with a small Vt based on IBW during protective ventilation is essential to prevent derecruitment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1107

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Derecruitment is a common cause of desaturation during OLV and does occur early during TLV, particularly after induction with high F I O2 and bronchoscopy for positioning a device for lung isolation. 16 Alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARM) improve oxygenation and ventilation during TLV, and these effects can persist into the period of OLV. 16 An ARM prior to OLV increases aeration and lung compliance during OLV. Furthermore, it decreases tidal recruitment during OLV, a marker of repetitive alveolar opening/closure (atelectotrauma) that is known to cause ALI. Repeated ARMscanbeinjurious to the lung; therefore, we recommend the application of an ARM maneuver followed by sufficient PEEP to prevent the need for further recruitment prior to OLV. A variety of ARMs have been described. In its most simple form, an ARM consists of a vital capacity maneuver with a breath hold at 30 cm H2O for 10-40 sec. More sophisticated (cycling) maneuvers have been described that consist of stepwise increases in peak inspiratory pressure and PEEP held for 5-10 breaths per step up to 40/20 cm H2O. 24 Formal cycling ARMs are gradually becoming available on newer anesthetic ventilators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
While a high F IO2 may predispose to lung injury and absorption atelectasis, it affords a longer safe apnea period at induction and accelerates lung collapse on initiation of OLV. 25

Tidal volume

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Large Vt used to be recommended to avoid atelectasis and hypoxemia; however, this is now known to be associated with ALI. In a retrospective review of pneumonectomies, larger intraoperative Vt (8.3 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW) was associated with the development of postoperative respiratory failure when compared with lower Vt (6.7 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW). 26 Similarly, in another study of pneumonectomies, each increase in Vt of 1 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW was independently associated with an increased risk of developing ALI/ARDS. 27 In a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing esophagectomy, ventilation with 5 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW and PEEP 5 cm H2O resulted in lower serum cytokine levels, improved oxygenation, and shorter postoperative mechanical ventilation when compared with a traditional Vt of 9 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW with ZEEP. In an historical cohort study comparing patients undergoing lung cancer surgery in years 1998-2003 to those in years 2003-2008, Licker et al. showeda decreased incidence of ALI, fewer admissions to the intensive care unit, and briefer hospitalization after routine implementation of protective lung ventilation. 15 In their cohort, protective lung ventilation consisted of a low Vt (mean 5.3 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW compared with 7.1 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW) during OLV, pressure-controlled ventilation, routine PEEP, and frequent recruitment maneuvers. Yang et al. randomized 102 patients undergoing elective lobectomy to conventional ventilation (F I O2 1.0, Vt 10 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW, ZEEP, volumecontrolled ventilation) or protective ventilation (F I O2 0.5, Vt 6 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW, PEEP 5 cm H2O, pressure-controlled ventilation) and showed that pulmonary dysfunction was significantly lower in the protective vs conventional ventilation group (4% vs 22%, respectively). 28

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Vt during OLV should be 4-6 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Positive end-expiratory pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
While optimal PEEP remains controversial from an oxygenation perspective, there is consensus about its role in protective ventilation for prevention of lung injury. 28-30 Oxygenation can worsen with PEEP during OLV because of increased pulmonary vascular resistance and diversion of blood flow to the operative lung, particularly when a large Vt is used. Conversely, with low Vt, inadequate PEEP may promote derecruitment and increase the shunt fraction in the ventilated lung. Patients are most likely to benefit from PEEP if their pulmonary function is normal, as extrinsic PEEP tends to increase the end-expiratory pressure towards the lower inflection point of the pressure-volume curve. On the other hand, in patients with obstructive lung disease and a reduced forced expiratory volume after one second, extrinsic PEEP is more likely to raise the end-expiratory pressure above the lower inflection point and create or enhance intrinsic PEEP during OLV. 31 Development of intrinsic PEEP can be detected by the presence of an interrupted expiratory flow on a flow-volume curve, worsening lung compliance on spirometry, or increasing plateau pressures. 3 Ferrando et al. recently showed improved oxygenation and lung mechanics when external PEEP was set based on achieving optimal dynamiclungcomplianceusingaPEEPdecrementtrialaftera lung recruitment maneuver. 32

C. L. Brassard et al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PEEP should be set at 3-10 cm H2O during OLV, titrated to the highest lung compliance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Attention should be directed to auto-PEEP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inspired oxygen fraction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High F I O2 may result in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Oxygen toxicity occurs during OLV from ischemia-reperfusion injury, as surgical manipulation and lung collapse may initiate tissue hypoperfusion. Reperfusion upon lung reexpansion leads to lung damage owing to the formation of ROS. 33 Prolonged OLV ( [ 120 min) and generation of oxidative stress have been associated with increased rates of respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and pulmonary hypertension. 34 Moreover, high F I O2 can lead to absorption atelectasis in poorly ventilated lung regions when oxygen absorption in denitrogenated alveoli results in alveolar collapse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A FI O2 of 0.4 can provide adequate oxygenation in the LD position during OLV. 35 A FIO2 of 0.5-0.8 should be adequate at the initiation of OLV in the majority of cases, after which, it should be titrated to the minimum required to achieve oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92-96%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A FI O2 of 0.5-0.8 should be adequate at the beginning of OLV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Titrate F I O2 to a target SpO2 of 92-96%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recruitment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atelectasis in the non-operative lung must be avoided as it will worsen the already high shunt fraction from lung isolation. An ARM at the beginning of OLV, or immediately prior to, improves oxygenation. 36 Additional recruitment maneuvers may be used as indicated by declining oxygen saturation and/or declining lung compliance. Improvement in oxygenation or lung compliance after an ARM indicates that an inadequate level of PEEP was being used. The optimal level and duration of ARMs is not established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peak/plateau pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peak pressures [ 40 cm H2O as well as plateau pressures > 29 cm H2O have been shown to be associated with ALI. Based on the critical care literature, however, there does not appear to be a critical pressure plateau below which no injury occurs. 3 Protective ventilation has been shown to lower both peak and plateau pressures and reduce associated lung injury. 30,37,38

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Minimize peak and plateau inspiratory pressure during OLV (i.e., peak pressure \ 30 cm H2O and plateau pressure \ 20 cm H2O).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory rate / permissive hypercapnia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Permissive hypercapnia is an integral part of lung protection as it allows reduced ventilatory pressures and mechanical stress. Aside from specific contraindications (e.g., elevated intracranial pressure), moderate hypercapnia is well tolerated. Moderate CO2 elevations predictably increase pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure, but also increase right ventricular performance and cardiac index secondary to sympathetic stimulation. 39,40 Caution is required in patients with significant right ventricular dysfunction or depressed adrenergic state, particularly with a more pronounced hypercapnia (PaCO2 [ 70 mmHg).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PaCO2 levels as high as 70-135 mmHg have been observed during OLV and were shown to be associated with ventricular arrhythmias, oxygenation difficulties, and frequently the need for inotropic support. 41

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The respiratory rate (RR) needs to be increased slightly upon initiation of OLV to avoid excessive hypercapnia with a protective Vt. High RR, however, will decrease both inspiratory and expiratory time. The shortened inspiratory time invariably will result in increased peak inspiratory pressures, while the shortened expiratory time, particularly in the patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, may create or further increase intrinsic PEEP and result in increased plateau pressures. Significant increases in RR in an attempt to normalize CO2 elimination may therefore negate any protective benefit of ventilation using low Vt. The inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio may be adjusted to afford maximum exhalation time (1:4-1:6) for the patient with obstructive lung disease and maximum inspiratory time (1:1-2:1) for the patient with restrictive lung disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The RR should be 12-16 breaths /C1 min -1 .

PaCO2 should be 40-60 mmHg.

Pressure-control vs volume-control ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pressure-control ventilation (PCV) has been suggested as preferable to volume-control ventilation (VCV) for OLV. 16 While PCV is associated with lower ventilatory pressures, differences in intrabronchial pressure are minimal. 42 Whether PCV actually improves oxygenation is highly controversial, as studies have failed to find a consistent benefit. 43,44

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of either VCV or PCV (remains controversial).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhalational anesthetics have long been considered detrimental for oxygenation during OLV due to inhibition of HPV. The newer inhalation anesthetics, desflurane and sevoflurane, however, appear to have lesser effects on HPV and provide equivalent oxygenation compared with propofol at similar anesthetic depths. 7 Furthermore, inhalational anesthetics appear to be lung protective. With OLV, a pro-inflammatory reaction takes place, exhibited by increased cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage samples in either lung. Compared with controls under propofol anesthesia, inhaled anesthetics result in attenuation of cytokine elevations in both the ventilated and the operative lung. 44,45 This approach appears to translate into better outcomes, as patients in the sevoflurane arm experienced less composite adverse events. 45

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintain anesthesia with sevoflurane or desflurane.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of hypoxemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of hypoxemia during OLV is beyond the scope of this manuscript and has been reviewed in detail elsewhere. 45,46 In brief, initial interventions consist of increasing the FI O2, confirming lung isolation, ensuring adequate cardiac output, and using recruitment maneuvers to the ventilated lung. If desaturation is not resolved with initial interventions, application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to the operative lung or intermittent TLV may be used, realizing that it may interfere with surgical exposure and progress. Direct O2 insufflation into the operative lung is controversial and unlikely to improve oxygenation unless combined with partial lung recruitment in the face of complete lung collapse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From OLV to extubation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Re-expansion of the operative lung

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung recruitment at the conclusion of OLV serves multiple purposes. Restoration of normal lung expansion is necessary to re-establish the pleural interface and minimize any postoperative pneumothorax. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers optimize postoperative pulmonary function, restore V/Q matching, and thereby improve oxygenation. In the case of lung resection, caution needs to be exercised not to disrupt staple lines and create undue hemodynamic instability in the face of commonly practiced relative hypovolemia. Based on animal experiments of lung recruitment in ALI, gradual re-expansion potentially induces less ALI in the operative lung. 33 The lung should therefore be re-expanded at a slow rate and to a lower plateau pressure. 47

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung re-expansion may worsen lung injury due to ischemic reperfusion injury in the presence of ROS and oxidative stress. Lower FIO2 should likely be employed when recruiting the lung after prolonged lung collapse, as hypoxemic reperfusion has been shown to attenuate the inflammatory response and organ injury after intestinal ischemia. 48 The use of a two-lung vital capacity maneuver is undesirable as it may cause overdistension and potential volutrauma in the non-operative lung which is vastly more compliant than the atelectatic operative lung. Selective lung re-expansion with the use of either a second circuit or transient isolation of the non-operative lung allows application of targeted pressure to the atelectatic operative lung while avoiding pulmonary tamponade and hypotension. 49

Two-lung ventilation: post-OLV to emergence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The period after OLV is important for returning the patients lungs as close as possible to baseline function. Postoperative lung function is impaired for a multitude of reasons, including general anesthesia, residual paralysis, lung edema due to fluids, manipulation, and inflammation, but also likely residual atelectasis. Patients may be at particular risk of lung injury at this time, as they have encountered a ''first hit'' in the form of lung surgery and OLV. After recruitment of the operative lung, TLV needs to be established with a protective ventilation strategy. Tidal volumes may be increased slightly to 6-8 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW if overall lung volumes are unchanged and should remain at 4-6 mL /C1 kg -1 if significant lung resection has occurred. Appropriate PEEP needs to be maintained until extubation, as the operative lung is particularly prone to recollapse. The F I O2 should be titrated to an SpO2 of 92-96% to limit oxidative stress. Lung recruitment can be used as needed, taking care to limit airway pressure and high volume delivery to the operative lung. Considering the propensity to derecruitment and the increased airflow resistance of double-lumen endotracheal tubes, it is preferable not to switch the patient to unsupported spontaneous ventilation on emergence. Hypoventilation, particularly in the setting of high FI O2, will encourage atelectasis. Pressure-supported ventilation with PEEP is more likely to maintain optimal lung volumes during emergence.

Conclusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of OLV has undergone a major transformation from traditional ventilation parameters. Perioperative management of thoracic surgery patients begins before lung isolation and ends after extubation. Based on the literature and our experience, we propose step-by-step clinical management of OLV that entails the dual objective of prevention of both hypoxemia and acute lung injury. Nevertheless, only larger multicentre randomized controlled trials can definitively answer the question as to whether protective lung ventilation decreases postoperative morbidity and mortality in thoracic surgery.

Clinical case scenario

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Youare urgently called to assist a colleague in a neighbouring operating room suite where a case of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is about to proceed. The patient has just been placed in a left decubitus position, and the left lung is being ventilated with a double-lumen tube. When you enter the operating room, you immediately notice the sound of pulse oximetry indicating markedly reduced oxygenation. A quick look at the monitors reveals an oxygen saturation of 84% and slight hypotension (85/50). Your colleague appears flustered and asks you to ''help with lung isolation' '.

Objectif L'objectif de ce module de de ´veloppement professionnel continu est de passer en revue les proble ´matiques pertinentes a ` la ventilation sur un poumon ou ventilation unipulmonaire (VUP) et de proposer une strate ´gie de prise en charge ventilatoire avant, pendant et apre `s l'isolation du poumon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Constatations principales Le besoin d'isolation optimale du poumon a augmente ´ depuis l'ave `nement de la chirurgie thoracoscopique vide ´o-assiste ´e, e ´ tant donne ´ que l'exposition chirurgicale est cruciale au succe `s de la chirurgie. Par conse ´quent, dans la mesure du possible, il convient d'e ´viter la pression positive continue applique ´e au poumon ope ´re ´ ou une ventilation bipulmonaire intermittente. La prise en charge optimale de la VUP devrait procurer une oxyge ´nation ade ´quate tout en pre ´venant les le ´sions pulmonaires aigue ¨s (LPA), celles-ci e ´ tant la cause principale de de ´ce `s apre `s une re ´ section pulmonaire. Les recherches mene ´es au cours des dix dernie `res anne ´es sugge `rent la mise en œuvre d'une strate ´gie de ventilation protectrice pendant la VUP, consistant en petits volumes courants selon le poids corporel ide ´al, l'utilisation de routine de pression positive te ´le ´-expiratoire, ainsi qu'une faible fraction d'oxyge `ne inspire ´ avec de faibles pressions d'insufflation de pointe et de plateau. Des fre ´quences respiratoires e ´leve ´es destine ´es a ` compenser les volumes courants bas pourraient pre ´disposer a ` un trappage conside ´rable d'air pendant la VUP, c'est pourquoi l'hypercapnie permissive est couramment utilise ´e. La ne ´cessite ´ d'une VUP influence aussi la pe ´riode de ventilation a ` deux poumons, e ´tant donne ´ que la pe ´riode pre ´ce ´dant la VUP a un impact sur l'affaissement des poumons, et que les moments avant et apre `s la VUP ont un impact sur la gravite ´ des LPA. La re ´ expansion pulmonaire apre `s la VUP est une composante importante pour garantir une ventilation et une oxyge ´nation adapte ´es apre `s l'ope ´ration mais pourrait nuire au poumon.

Conclusion Une strate ´gie de ventilation protectrice englobant la pe ´riode de l'intubation a ` l'extubation et au cours de la pe ´riode postope ´ratoire imme ´diate fait partie des soins pe ´riope ´ratoires optimaux du patient en chirurgie thoracique.

Les progre `s des techniques de ventilation sur un poumon ou ventilation unipulmonaire (VUP) ont permis la re ´ alisation d'interventions intrathoraciques de plus en plus complexes et ces techniques sont cruciales a ` la re ´ ussite des vide ´othoracoscopies. On isole le poumon afin de procurer une exposition chirurgicale tout en garantissant un e ´change gazeux adapte ´ face a ` un shunt droit-gauche important cre ´e ´ par l'affaissement du poumon ope ´re ´.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditionnellement, les anesthe ´siologistes ont appris a ` ventiler le poumon non ope ´re ´ pendant la VUP avec des volumes courants (Vc) e ´ gaux a ` ceux utilise ´s pendant une ventilation bipulmonaire (VBP), une pression te ´le ´-expiratoire e ´ gale a ` ze ´ro (ZEEP) et une fraction d'oxyge `ne inspire ´ (F I O2) e ´leve ´e. Ces recommandations se fondaient sur des e ´ tudes de ´montrant une meilleure oxyge ´nation lors de l'utilisation de volumes courants plus e ´ leve ´s. 1,2 Au cours de la dernie `re de ´cennie toutefois, deux changements majeurs ont eu un impact sur la prise en charge de la VUP : l'identification des le ´sions pulmonaires aigue ¨s (LPA) induites par la VUP et la popularite ´ croissante de la vide ´othoracoscopie en tant que technique chirurgicale. L'hypoxe ´mie, qui constituait auparavant la principale inquie ´tude des anesthe ´siologistes pendant la VUP, est moins fre ´quente gra ˆce a ` une meilleure isolation pulmonaire, a ` de nouveaux agents anesthe ´siques et a ` une meilleure prise en charge de la ventilation. 3

diaphragme. En position de de ´cubitus late ´ral (DL), la compliance du poumon de ´pendant est re ´duite, de ´plac ¸ant la majorite ´ du Vc vers le poumon supe ´rieur pendant la VBP. En raison de la gravite ´, la perfusion pulmonaire va de fac ¸on pre ´fe ´rentielle vers le poumon de ´pendant. Une fois l'isolation pulmonaire en place, la ventilation est restreinte au poumon de ´pendant et toute perfusion re ´ siduelle vers le poumon non de ´pendant alimente un ve ´ritable shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'hypoxe ´mie survenant pendant la VUP est principalement cause ´e par le shunt obligatoire a ` travers le poumon affaisse ´, et la distribution de la perfusion est la principale de ´terminante du degre ´ de me ´lange veineux. La fraction de shunt sera plus e ´ leve ´e dans une chirurgie a ` droite, e ´ tant donne ´ qu'on sait que le poumon droit rec ¸oit une proportion plus importante du de ´bit cardiaque (estime ´ a ` 55 % par rapport a ` 45 % pour le poumon gauche). De nombreux facteurs jouent un ro ˆle be ´ne ´fique pour re ´duire la perfusion du poumon non de ´pendant : la gravite ´ en position de DL, la manipulation chirurgicale, la re ´traction pulmonaire, et la vasoconstriction pulmonaire hypoxique (VPH). 3-5

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La VPH est un processus physiologique puissant qui re ´ duit le de ´bit sanguin dans les zones pulmonaires mal ventile ´es dans une tentative d'ame ´liorer le rapport ventilation/perfusion (V/Q). Le stimulus principal de la VPH est une re ´duction de la pression partielle alve ´olaire d'oxyge `ne (PAO2), qui provoque une vasoconstriction rapide avec un plateau initial a ` 15 min apre `s l'isolation pulmonaire. La vasoconstriction maximale, qui pourrait re ´ duire le de ´bit du shunt de 40 %, n'est atteinte qu'apre `s quatre heures. 3 Une inhibition dose-de ´pendante de la VPH a e ´te ´ de ´montre ´e avec les agents d'inhalation plus anciens (halothane, protoxyde d'azote), 4 mais cette re ´ action est moins bien documente ´e pour les agents plus re ´ cents (desflurane, se ´ voflurane). 6,7 Les vasodilatateurs syste ´miques et pulmonaires, un de ´se ´quilibre acide/base et les variations de de ´bit cardiaque sont d'autres facteurs affectant la VPH. 3,4

Aux de ´buts de l'anesthe ´sie thoracique, l'hypoxe ´mie e ´ tait pre ´sente dans pre `s de 40 % des cas re ´alise ´s avec une sonde double lumie `re Carlens et la ventilation manuelle. 8 L'incidence d'hypoxe ´mie pe ´riope ´ratoire a conside ´rablement diminue ´ au fil du temps, probablement gra ˆce a ` la meilleure isolation des poumons,uneconceptioname ´liore ´e des sondes, et de nouveaux agents anesthe ´siques volatils ayant des effets moindres sur la VPH. On a rapporte ´ des taux d'hypoxe ´mie aussi bas que 1 %. 9 Ceci e ´tant dit, l'hypoxe ´mie survient probablement encore chez pre `s de 10 % des patients et demeure une inquie ´tude clinique importante. 10

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une mauvaise isolation du poumon est un me ´canisme bien connu provoquant l'hypoxe ´mie perope ´ratoire. Le recours syste ´matique a ` la bronchoscopie flexible est fortement recommande ´ afin de confirmer le positionnement initial du dispositif d'isolation du poumon; en outre, cette technique devrait e ˆtre re ´pe ´te ´e au besoin afin d'exclure tout de ´placement du dispositif pendant le positionnement du patient ou la chirurgie. 11

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les le ´sions pulmonaires aigue ¨s

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le diagnostic de LPA se fonde sur une re ´duction aigue ¨ du ratio PaO2/F IO2 a ` \ 300 accompagne ´e d'infiltrats pulmonaires bilate ´raux observables sur une radiographie des poumons en l'absence d'insuffisance cardiaque gauche. Il existe un nombre croissant de donne ´es probantes soutenant que la prise en charge de la VUP peut avoir un impact sur l'incidence et la gravite ´ de cette complication.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heureusement, les LPA sont rares apre `s une re ´section pulmonaire, survenant dans 2,5 % de toutes les re ´sections pulmonaires, et affichant une incidence plus e ´leve ´e de 7,9 % apre `s des pneumonectomies. 12 Les LPA sont toutefois une cause majeure de mortalite ´ globale apre `s une chirurgie thoracique en raison de leur taux de mortalite ´ e ´ leve ´ (25-40%). 13 Une distribution biphasique des LPA a e ´te ´ de ´crite, qui correspond a ` diffe ´rents de ´clencheurs pathoge `nes : une forme primaire de ´clenche ´e par des facteurs pe ´riope ´ratoires survient au cours des trois premiers jours, et unedeuxie `me forme retarde ´e, pre ´cipite ´e par les complications postope ´ratoires, peut ge ´ne ´ralement e ˆtre observe ´e entre le 3 e ` me et le 10 e ` me jour postope ´ratoire. 14 Les facteurs de risque de LPA primaires en chirurgie thoracique comprennent une pression inspiratoire de pointe [ 40 cm H2O, une pression de plateau [ 29 cm H2O, une dure ´e prolonge ´e de VUP, un apport liquidien excessif, une pneumonectomie et l'abus d'alcool pre ´ope ´ratoire (Tableau 2). 3,15 L'e ´tiologie de la le ´sion pulmonaire post-thoracotomie, toutefois, est probablement multifactorielle et ne ´cessite vraisemblablement une se ´quence demultiplese ´ve `nements de ´le ´te `res qui culminent en une le ´sion alve ´olaire et capillaire. 3,16

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les le ´sions alve ´olaires diffuses surviennent en raison de l'effet direct d'une pression e ´ leve ´e sur les poumons (barotraumatisme), de la distension pulmonaire excessive (volutraumatisme), de l'ouverture et de la fermeture re ´ pe ´titive des alve ´oles (ate ´lectraumatisme), et des

Indications et contre-indications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Par le passe ´, la pre ´vention d'une contamination par du sang ou du pus e ´manant d'un poumon contralate ´ral malade et la perte de volume courant a ` travers une fistule bronchopulmonaire constituaient des indications absolues pour l'isolation d'un poumon. De nos jours, l'exposition chirurgicale est devenue une indication absolue dans la majorite ´ des interventions intrathoraciques, particulie `rement en raison de l'utilisation accrue des techniques minimalement invasives. Il n'existe pas de contre-indication ve ´ritable a ` l'isolation d'un poumon et a ` la VUP autre qu'une fonction pulmonaire insuffisante pour soutenir la VUP.

Les pre ´dicteurs de l'hypoxe ´mie

Outre les analyses de gaz sanguins, l'acce `s a ` une ligne arte ´rielle permet de surveiller l'he ´modynamie dans les interventions chirurgicales plus complexes et pre ´sentant un risque significatif d'instabilite ´ he ´modynamique, d'he ´morragie ou de changements liquidiens. La spirome ´trie continue est un ajout pre ´cieux pour e ´valuer les changements de compliance pulmonaire dus au recrutement / de ´recrutement alve ´olaire et pour diagnostiquer les fuites et le trappage d'air. A ` l'heure actuelle, des e ´ tudes e ´ valuent l'utilisation de l'oxyme ´trie ce ´ re ´brale en chirurgie thoracique. 21 L'e ´chocardiographie transœsophagienne peut e ´ galement e ˆ tre utile dans l'e ´valuation pe ´riope ´ratoire de la dysfonction du cœur droit, qui pourrait se de ´te ´riorer en raison de la re ´ sistance vasculaire pulmonaire accrue induite par l'amorce de la VUP et/ou le clampage des branches de l'arte `re pulmonaire.

De l'induction de l'anesthe ´sie a ` la VUP

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Des recommandations voient le jour concernant l'utilisation de routine d'une ventilation pulmonaire protectrice pendant la VBP chez les patients sans le ´sion pulmonaire. 22 Une e ´tude re ´ cente portant sur 400 patients pre ´sentant un risque interme ´diaire a ` e ´leve ´ de complications pulmonaires apre `s une chirurgie abdominale a montre ´ une ame ´lioration des devenirs cliniques a ` la suite du recours a ` des Vc bas (moyenne 6,4 mL /C1 kg -1 du PCI) et a ` une PEEP (moyenne 6 cm H2O) par rapport a ` une ventilation non protectrice (Vc moyen de 11,1 mL /C1 kg -1 du PCI et pas de PEEP). 23 Le PCI (ou pre ´dit) peut e ˆ tre facilement estime ´ selon la taille et le sexe du patient (Tableau 4).

de ´recrutement alve ´olaire est une cause fre ´quente de de ´saturation pendant la VUP et survient to ˆt pendant la VBP, particulie `rement apre `s une induction avec une F IO2 e ´ leve ´e et une bronchoscopie pour le positionnement d'un dispositif d'isolation pulmonaire. 16 Les manœuvres de recrutement alve ´olaire (MRA) ame ´liorent l'oxyge ´nation et la ventilation pendant la VBP, et ces effets peuvent perdurer pendant la pe ´riode de VUP. 16 Une MRA pratique ´e avant la VUP augmente l'ae ´ration et la compliance pulmonaire pendant la VUP. En outre, elle re ´ duit le volume alve ´olaire recrute ´ associe ´ au Vc pendant la VUP, un marqueur d'ouverture/fermeture alve ´olaire re ´ pe ´titive (ate ´lectraumatisme) causant la LPA. Des MRA re ´pe ´te ´es peuvent e ˆtre nocives pour le poumon; par conse ´quent, nous recommandons l'application d'une MRA suivie d'une PEEP suffisante pour pre ´venir la ne ´cessite ´ d'un recrutement alve ´olaire supple ´mentaire avant la VUP. Toutes sortes de MRA ont e ´te ´ de ´crites. Dans sa forme la plus simple, une MRA consiste en une manœuvre de capacite ´ vitale avec maintien d'une pression a ` 30 cm H2O pour 10-40 sec. Des manœuvres plus sophistique ´es (en cycle) ont e ´te ´ de ´crites, qui consistent en une augmentation par e ´tapes de la pression inspiratoire et de la PEEP tenue pour 5-10 respirations par e ´tapes, jusqu'a ` atteindre 40/20 cm H2O. 24 Petit a ` petit, les nouveaux ventilateurs d'anesthe ´sie commencent a ` e ˆ tre e ´ quipe ´s de MRA cycliques.

Dans un compte-rendu re ´ trospectif s'inte ´ressant aux pneumonectomies, un Vc perope ´ratoire plus e ´ leve ´ (8,3 mL /C1 kg -1 du PCI) a e ´ te ´ associe ´ a ` l'apparition d'insuffisance respiratoire postope ´ratoire comparativement a ` un Vc plus bas (6,7 mL /C1 kg -1 du PCI). 26 De la me ˆme fac ¸on, dans une autre e ´ tude portant sur les pneumonectomies, chaque augmentation de Vc de 1 mL /C1 kg -1 du PCI a e ´te ´ associe ´e de fac ¸on inde ´pendante a ` un risque accru de LPA/ SDRA. 27 Dans une e ´tude randomise ´e contro ˆle ´e portant sur des patients subissant une oesophagectomie, une ventilation avec 5 mL /C1 kg-1 du PCI et une PEEP a ` 5 cm H 2 Oontre ´sulte ´ en une re ´duction des niveaux de cytokine se ´rique, une meilleure oxyge ´nation, et une ventilation me ´canique postope ´ratoire plus courte par rapport a ` un Vc conventionnel de 9 mL /C1 kg -1 du PCI avec une ZEEP.

Bien que la PEEP optimale demeure controverse ´e du point de vue de l'oxyge ´nation, il y a consensus quant a ` son ro ˆle dans la ventilation protectrice pour la pre ´vention des le ´sions pulmonaires. 28-30 L'oxyge ´nation peut se de ´te ´riorer avec une PEEP pendant la VUP en raison de la re ´ sistance vasculaire pulmonaire accrue et de la diversion du de ´bit sanguin vers le poumon ope ´re ´, particulie `rement lors de l'utilisation d'un Vc e ´ leve ´. A ` l'inverse, dans le cas d'un Vc bas, une PEEP inadapte ´e pourrait favoriser le de ´recrutement et augmenter la fraction de shunt dans le poumon ventile ´. Les patients

Une FIO2 e ´ leve ´e pourrait favoriser la production de de ´rive ´s re ´ actifs de l'oxyge `ne (DRO) et de cytokines pro-inflammatoires. La toxicite ´ de l'oxyge `ne survient pendant la VUP lors d'une le ´sion d'ische ´mie-reperfusion, e ´ tant donne ´ que la manipulation chirurgicale et l'affaissement pulmonaire pourraient provoquer une hypoperfusion tissulaire. La reperfusion lors de la re ´ expansion pulmonaire entraı ˆne des le ´sions aux poumons en raison de la formation de DRO. 33 Une VUP prolonge ´e ( [ 120 min) et la ge ´ne ´ration de stress oxydatif ont e ´ te ´ associe ´es a ` des taux accrus d'insuffisance respiratoire, d'arythmies cardiaques et d'hypertension pulmonaire. 34 De plus, une FIO2 e ´ leve ´e peut provoquer une ate ´lectasie d'absorption dans les re ´gions pulmonaires mal ventile ´es lorsque l'absorption d'oxyge `ne dans les alve ´oles de ´nitroge ´ne ´es entraı ˆne un collapsus alve ´olaire.

Une FIO2 de 0,4 peut procurer une oxyge ´nation ade ´quate en position de DL pendant la VUP. 35 Dans la plupart des cas, une FIO2 de 0,5-0,8 est adapte ´e a ` l'amorce de la VUP, apre `s quoi elle devra e ˆtre titre ´e au minimum requis afin d'atteindre une saturation d'oxyge `ne (SpO2) de 92-96 %.

Recrutement

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Il convient d'e ´viter l'ate ´lectasie dans le poumon non ope ´re ´ e ´ tant donne ´ qu'elle augmenterait le shunt de ´ja ` e ´ leve ´ en raison de l'isolation pulmonaire. Une MRA re ´alise ´e au de ´but de la VUP, ou imme ´diatement avant, ame ´liore l'oxyge ´nation. 36 Des manœuvres de recrutement supple ´mentaires peuvent e ˆ tre utilise ´es si une diminution de la SpO2 et/ou une re ´ duction de la compliance pulmonaire surviennent. L'ame ´lioration de l'oxyge ´nation ou de la compliance pulmonaire apre `s une MRA indique qu'un niveau inadapte ´ de PEEP e ´tait utilise ´. Le niveau et la dure ´e optimaux des MRA n'ont pas e ´te ´ e ´tablis.

Il a e ´te ´ de ´montre ´ que des pressions de pointe [ 40 cm H2O ainsi que des pressions de plateau [ 29 cm H2O e ´taient associe ´es a ` des LPA. Toutefois, si l'on se fonde sur la litte ´rature de soins intensifs, il ne semble pas y avoir de plateau de pression critique au-dessous duquel il n'y a pas de le ´sion. 3 Il a e ´te ´ de ´montre ´ que la ventilation protectrice re ´ duisait les pressions de pointe et de plateau ainsi que les le ´sions pulmonaires associe ´es. 30,37,38

<!-- PAGE=? -->
re ´ duites ge ´ne ´rant un stress me ´canique moindre. Hormis les contre-indications spe ´cifiques (par ex., une pression intracra ˆnienne e ´ leve ´e), l'hypercapnie mode ´re ´e est bien tole ´re ´e. Des e ´le ´vations mode ´re ´es de CO2 augmentent de fac ¸on pre ´visible la re ´ sistance vasculaire pulmonaire et la pression arte ´rielle pulmonaire, mais elles augmentent e ´ galement la performance ventriculaire droite et l'index cardiaque secondaire a ` la stimulation sympathique. 39,40 Il faut faire preuve de prudence avec les patients pre ´sentant une dysfonction ventriculaire droite importante ou un e ´tat adre ´nergique de ´prime ´, particulie `rement avec une hypercapnie plus prononce ´e (PaCO2 [ 70 mmHg).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Des niveaux de PaCO2 aussi e ´leve ´s que 70-135 mmHg ont e ´te ´ observe ´s pendant la VUP et il a e ´te ´ de ´montre ´ qu'ils e ´ taient associe ´s a ` des arythmies ventriculaires, des difficulte ´s d'oxyge ´nation et, fre ´quemment, au besoin de support inotropique. 41

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La fre ´quence respiratoire (FR) doit e ˆ tre le ´ge `rement augmente ´e au de ´but de la VUP afin d'e ´viter une hypercapnie excessive avec des volumes courants protecteurs. Une FR e ´leve ´e re ´duira cependant le temps d'inspiration et le temps d'expiration. Un temps d'inspiration re ´duit aura invariablement comme conse ´quence des pressions d'insufflation de pointe plus e ´ leve ´es, alors qu'un temps d'expiration re ´duit, particulie `rement chez un patient souffrant de maladie pulmonaire obstructive chronique, pourrait cre ´er ou augmenter encore une PEEP intrinse `que et entraı ˆner des pressions de plateau plus e ´ leve ´es. Par conse ´quent, des augmentations significatives de la FR dans une tentative de normaliser l'e ´limination de CO2 pourraient annuler tout avantage protecteur de la ventilation avec des volumes courants bas. Le ratio inspiration vs expiration (I:E) peut e ˆ tre ajuste ´ afin de permettre un temps d'expiration maximal (1:4-1:6) chez le patient atteint de maladie pulmonaire obstructive et un temps d'inspiration maximal (1:1-2:1) chez le patient atteint de maladie pulmonaire restrictive.

Maintien de l'anesthe ´sie

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On a longtemps conside ´re ´ les agents haloge ´ne ´s comme de ´le ´te `res pour l'oxyge ´nation pendant la VUP en raison de l'inhibition de la VPH. Cependant le desflurane et le se ´ voflurane, des agents d'inhalation plus re ´cents, semblent avoir des effets moindres sur la VPH tout en procurant une oxyge ´nation e ´ quivalente comparativement au propofol a ` des profondeurs d'anesthe ´sie semblables. 7 En outre, les agents d'inhalation semblent avoir un effet protecteur sur les poumons. Avec la VUP, une re ´action pro-inflammatoire a lieu, comme le de ´montrent les niveaux accrus de cytokines dans les e ´ chantillons de liquide de lavage broncho-alve ´olaire dans l'un et l'autre poumon. Comparativement aux te ´moins sous anesthe ´sie au propofol, les agents d'inhalation provoquent une atte ´nuation de l'e ´le ´vation de cytokines dans le poumon ventile ´ et dans le poumon ope ´re ´. 44,45 Cette approche semble se traduire par une ame ´lioration du pronostic, les patients du groupe se ´ voflurane ayant pre ´sente ´ moins d'e ´ve `nements inde ´sirables. 45

Prise en charge de l'hypoxe ´mie

La prise en charge de l'hypoxe ´mie pendant la VUP va au-dela ` des objectifs de cet article et a e ´te ´ de ´crite de fac ¸on de ´taille ´e ailleurs dans la litte ´rature. 45,46 En bref, les interventions initiales consistent a ` augmenter la FI O2, confirmer l'isolation du poumon, s'assurer d'un de ´bit cardiaque ade ´quat, et a ` utiliser des manœuvres de recrutement sur le poumon ventile ´. Si la de ´saturation n'est pas re ´ solue suite a ` ces interventions initiales, l'application d'une ventilation a ` pression positive continue (CPAP) au poumon ope ´re ´ ou d'une VBP intermittente peut e ˆtre envisage ´e, tout en sachant que ces manœuvres pourraient ge ˆner l'exposition chirurgicale et le progre `s de l'intervention.

De la VUP a ` l'extubation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Re ´expansion du poumon ope ´re ´

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ` la fin de la VUP, le recrutement pulmonaire a plusieurs buts. La restauration de l'expansion pulmonaire normale est ne ´cessaire afin de re ´ tablir l'interface pleurale et de minimiser tout pneumothorax postope ´ratoire. Les manœuvres de recrutement alve ´olaire optimisent la fonction pulmonaire postope ´ratoire, restaurent la correspondance V/Q et ainsi ame ´liorent l'oxyge ´nation. Dans le cas d'une re ´section pulmonaire, il convient de faire preuve de prudence afin de ne pas de ´ranger les lignes d'agrafes et de cre ´er une instabilite ´ he ´modynamique excessive face a ` l'hypovole ´mie relative commune ´ment pratique ´e. Selon des e ´ tudes animales sur le recrutement pulmonaire lors de LPA, la re ´expansion progressive induit potentiellement moins de LPA dans le poumon ope ´re ´. 33 Par conse ´quent, le poumon devrait e ˆtre regonfle ´ lentement et jusqu'a ` une pression de plateau plus basse. 47

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La re ´expansion pulmonaire pourrait aggraver les le ´sions pulmonaires en raison des le ´sions de reperfusion ische ´mique en pre ´sence de DRO et de stress oxydatif. Il faudrait probablement utiliser une F I O2 plus basse lors du recrutement pulmonaire apre `s un affaissement prolonge ´ du poumon, e ´ tant donne ´ qu'il a e ´ te ´ de ´montre ´ que la reperfusion hypoxe ´mique atte ´nuait la re ´ ponse inflammatoire et les le ´sions aux organes apre `s une ische ´mie intestinale. 48 Le recours a ` une manœuvre de capacite ´ vitale bipulmonaire n'est pas souhaitable e ´ tant donne ´ que cela pourrait provoquer une distension excessive et un volutraumatisme potentiel dans le poumon non ope ´re ´, lequel est beaucoup plus compliant que le poumon ope ´re ´ ate ´lectasique. La re ´ expansion pulmonaire se ´ lective, re ´ alise ´e en utilisant un deuxie `me circuit ou en isolant temporairement le poumon non ope ´re ´, permet d'appliquer une pression cible ´e au poumon ope ´re ´ ate ´lectasique tout en e ´ vitant la tamponnade pulmonaire et l'hypotension. 49

La ventilation a ` deux poumons : l'apre `s-ventilation unipulmonaire jusqu'au re ´veil

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La pe ´riode suivant la VUP est importante pour re ´tablir la fonction pulmonaire des patients a ` des niveaux aussi semblables que possible de sa fonction de base. La fonction pulmonaire postope ´ratoire est entrave ´e pour de nombreuses raisons, notamment l'anesthe ´sie ge ´ne ´rale, la curarisation re ´siduelle, l'œde `me pulmonaire provoque ´ par les liquides, la manipulation et l'inflammation, mais e ´ galement probablement en raison d'une ate ´lectasie re ´ siduelle. Les patients pourraient courir un risque particulier de le ´sion pulmonaire a ` ce moment, e ´tant donne ´ qu'ils ont de ´ja ` e ´ te ´ expose ´s a ` une premie `re e ´ preuve sous forme de chirurgie pulmonaire et de VUP. Apre `s le recrutement du poumon ope ´re ´, il faut e ´tablir une VBP avec une strate ´gie de ventilation protectrice. On peut augmenter le ´ge `rement les Vc a ` 6-8 mL /C1 kg -1 du PCI si les volumes pulmonaires globaux demeurent inchange ´s et ils devraient rester a ` 4-6 mL /C1 kg -1 s'il y a eu une re ´section pulmonaire importante. Une PEEP adapte ´e doit e ˆtre maintenue jusqu'a ` l'extubation, e ´ tant donne ´ que le poumon ope ´re ´ est particulie `rement a ` risque de se re ´affaisser. La F I O2 devrait e ˆ tre titre ´e a ` une SpO2 de 92-96 % afin de limiter le stress oxydatif. Le recrutement pulmonaire peut e ˆ tre utilise ´ au besoin, si l'on prend soin de limiter la pression dans les voies ae ´riennes et la distribution de grands volumes dans le poumon ope ´re ´. E ´ tant donne ´ la propension au de ´recrutement et la re ´sistance accrue au flot respiratoire associe ´e aux sondes endotrache ´ales a ` double lumie `re, il est pre ´fe ´rable de ne pas mettre le patient sous ventilation spontane ´e sans assistance au re ´ veil. L'hypoventilation, particulie `rement dans le contexte d'une F I O2 e ´leve ´e, favorisera l'ate ´lectasie. Il est plus probable qu'une ventilation avec aide inspiratoire avec une PEEP maintienne des volumes pulmonaires optimaux pendant le re ´veil.

Conclusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La prise en charge de la VUP a beaucoup e ´volue ´ et s'est e ´ carte ´e des parame `tres de ventilation traditionnels. La prise en charge pe ´riope ´ratoire des patients de chirurgie thoracique commence avant l'isolation des poumons et se termine apre `s l'extubation. En nous appuyant sur la litte ´rature et notre expe ´rience, nous proposons une prise en charge clinique e ´ tape par e ´tape de la VUP qui a l'objectif double de pre ´venir l'hypoxe ´mie et les le ´sions pulmonaires aigue ¨s. Toutefois, seules des e ´tudes randomise ´es contro ˆle ´es multicentriques plus importantes pourront re ´pondre de fac ¸on de ´finitive a ` la question de savoir si la ventilation pulmonaire protectrice re ´ duit la morbidite ´ et la mortalite ´ postope ´ratoires apre `s une chirurgie thoracique.
