Preamble

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) are committed to the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases through professional education and research for clinicians, providers, and patients. Since 1980, the ACC and AHA have shared a responsibility to translate  scientific  evidence  into  clinical  practice  guidelines (CPGs)  with  recommendations  to  standardize  and  improve cardiovascular  health.  These  CPGs,  based  on  systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of quality cardiovascular care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  response  to  published  reports  from  the  Institute  of Medicine 1,2   and  the  ACC/AHA's  mandate  to  evaluate  new knowledge and maintain relevance  at  the  point  of  care,  the ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Task Force) began modifying its methodology. This modernization effort is  published  in  the  2012  Methodology  Summit  Report 3 and 2014  perspective  article. 4 The  latter  recounts  the  history  of the  collaboration,  changes  over  time,  current  policies,  and planned initiatives to meet the needs of an evolving healthcare environment. Recommendations on value in proportion to  resource  utilization  will  be  incorporated  as  high-quality comparative-effectiveness  data  become  available. 5 The  relationships between CPGs and data standards, appropriate use criteria, and performance measures are addressed elsewhere. 4

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intended  UseCPGs  provide  recommendations  applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but CPGs developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although CPGs may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and be aligned with the patient's best interest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evidence  ReviewGuideline  writing  committee  (GWC) members are charged with reviewing the literature; weighing the strength and quality of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and estimating expected health outcomes when data exist. In analyzing the data and developing CPGs, the GWC uses evidence-based methodologies developed by the Task Force. 6  A key component of the ACC/AHA CPG methodology is the development of recommendations on the  basis  of  all  available  evidence.  Literature  searches  focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only selected references are cited in the CPG. To ensure that CPGs remain current, new data are reviewed biannually by the GWCs and the Task Force to determine if recommendations should be updated or modified. In general, a target cycle of 5 years is planned for full revision. 1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Task Force recognizes the need for objective, independent  Evidence  Review  Committees  (ERCs)  to  address  key clinical questions posed in the PICOTS format (P=population; I=intervention; C=comparator; O=outcome; T=timing; S=setting).  The  ERCs  include  methodologists,  epidemiologists, clinicians,  and  biostatisticians  who  systematically  survey, abstract, and assess the quality of the evidence base. 3,4 Practical considerations, including time and resource constraints, limit the ERCs to addressing key clinical questions for which the evidence relevant to the guideline topic lends itself to systematic  review  and  analysis  when  the  systematic  review  could impact the sense or strength of related recommendations. The GWC develops recommendations on the basis of the systematic review and denotes them with superscripted 'SR' (ie,  SR ) to emphasize support derived from formal systematic review.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guideline-Directed Medical TherapyRecognizing ad  vances in medical therapy across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, the Task Force designated the term 'guideline-directed medical therapy' (GDMT) to represent recommended medical therapy  as  defined  mainly  by  Class  I  measures-generally  a combination of lifestyle modification and drug- and device-based therapeutics. As medical science advances, GDMT evolves, and hence  GDMT  is  preferred  to  'optimal  medical  therapy.'  For GDMT and all other recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm the dosage with product insert material  and  carefully  evaluate  for  contraindications  and  possible drug interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class of Recommendation and Level of EvidenceOnce recommendations are written, the Class of Recommendation (COR; ie,  the  strength  the  GWC  assigns  to  the  recommendation,  which  encompasses  the  anticipated  magnitude  and judged certainty of benefit in proportion to risk) is assigned by the GWC. Concurrently, the Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the scientific evidence supporting the effect of the intervention on the basis of the type, quality, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports (Table 1). 4

without  commercial  support,  and  members  volunteer  their time for this activity. The Task Force makes every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All GWC members and reviewers are required to fully disclose current industry relationships or personal interests, from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced GWC and requires  that  both  the  chair  and  a  majority  of  GWC  members  have  no  relevant  RWI  (see Appendix  1  for  the  definition of relevance). GWC members are restricted with regard to  writing  or  voting  on  sections  to  which  their  RWI  apply.

In  addition,  for  transparency,  GWC  members'  comprehensive disclosure information is available as an online supplement.  Comprehensive  disclosure  information  for  the  Task Force  is  also  available  at  http://www.cardiosource.org/en/ ACC/About-ACC/Who-We-Are/Leadership/Guidelines-andDocuments-Task-Forces.aspx. The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds representing  different  geographic  regions,  genders,  ethnicities,  intellectual  perspectives/biases,  and  scopes  of  clinical practice.  Selected  organizations  and  professional  societies with related interests and expertise are invited to participate as partners or collaborators.

Individualizing Care in Patients With Associated Conditions and ComorbiditiesThe ACC and AHA recognize the complexity of managing patients with multiple conditions, compared with managing patients with a single disease, and the challenge is compounded when CPGs for evaluation or treatment of several coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting. 7   CPGs attempt to define practices that meet the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and do not replace clinical judgment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  ImplementationManagement  in  accordance with CPG recommendations is effective only when followed; therefore, to enhance the patient's commitment to treatment and compliance with lifestyle adjustment, clinicians should engage  the  patient  to  participate  in  selecting  interventions on  the  basis  of  the  patient's  individual  values  and  preferences,  taking  associated  conditions  and  comorbidities  into consideration  (eg,  shared  decision  making).  Consequently, there are circumstances in which deviations from these CPGs are appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The recommendations in this CPG are the official policy of the ACC and AHA until they are superseded by a published addendum, focused update, or revised full-text CPG.

1. Introduction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The recommendations listed in this CPG are, whenever possible, evidence based. In April 2013, an extensive evidence review  was  conducted,  which  included  a  literature  review through  July  2013.  Other  selected  references  published through  May  2014  were  also  incorporated  by  the  GWC. Literature included was derived from research involving  human  subjects,  published  in  English,  and  indexed  in MEDLINE  (through  PubMed),  EMBASE,  the  Cochrane Library,  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Reports, and other selected databases relevant to this CPG. The relevant data are included in evidence tables in the Data Supplement available online. Key search words included but were  not  limited  to  the  following: anesthesia  protection; arrhythmia; atrial fibrillation; atrioventricular block; bundle branch  block;  cardiac  ischemia;  cardioprotection;  cardiovascular  implantable  electronic  device;  conduction  disturbance;  dysrhythmia;  electrocardiography;  electrocautery; electromagnetic  interference;  heart  disease;  heart  failure; implantable  cardioverter-defibrillator;  intraoperative;  left ventricular ejection fraction; left ventricular function; myocardial infarction; myocardial protection; National Surgical Quality  Improvement  Program;  pacemaker;  perioperative; perioperative  pain  management;  perioperative  risk;  postoperative;  preoperative;  preoperative  evaluation;  surgical procedures; ventricular premature beats; ventricular tachycardia; and volatile anesthetics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An independent ERC was commissioned to perform a systematic review of a key question, the results of which were considered by the GWC for incorporation into this CPG. See the  systematic  review  report  published  in  conjunction  with this CPG 8 and its respective data supplements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1.2. Organization of the GWC

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The GWC was composed of clinicians with content and methodological expertise, including general cardiologists, subspecialty cardiologists, anesthesiologists, a surgeon, a hospitalist, and a patient representative/lay volunteer. The GWC included representatives from the ACC, AHA, American College of Surgeons, American Society  of Anesthesiologists, American  Society  of Echocardiography, American  Society  of  Nuclear  Cardiology, Heart  Rhythm  Society  (HRS),  Society  for  Cardiovascular Angiography  and  Interventions,  Society  of  Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and Society for Vascular Medicine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1.3. Document Review and Approval

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This document was reviewed by 2 official reviewers each from the ACC and the AHA; 1 reviewer each from the American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists, American  Society  of  Echocardiography,  American  Society of  Nuclear  Cardiology,  HRS,  Society  for  Cardiovascular Angiography  and  Interventions,  Society  of  Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, Society of Hospital Medicine, and Society for  Vascular  Medicine;  and  24  individual  content  reviewers  (including  members  of  the  ACC  Adult  Congenital  and Pediatric Cardiology Section Leadership Council,  ACC Electrophysiology  Section  Leadership  Council,  ACC  Heart Failure  and  Transplant  Section  Leadership  Council,  ACC Interventional Section Leadership Council, and ACC Surgeons' Council). Reviewers' RWI information was distributed to the GWC and is published in this document (Appendix 2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1.4. Scope of the CPG

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  focus  of  this  CPG  is  the  perioperative  cardiovascular evaluation and management of the adult patient undergoing noncardiac  surgery.  This  includes  preoperative  risk  assessment and cardiovascular testing, as well as (when indicated) perioperative pharmacological (including anesthetic) management and perioperative monitoring that includes devices and biochemical markers. This CPG is intended to inform all the medical professionals involved in the care of these patients. The preoperative evaluation of the patient undergoing noncardiac surgery can be performed for multiple purposes, including 1) assessment of perioperative risk (which can be used to inform the decision to proceed or the choice of surgery and which includes the patient's perspective), 2) determination of the need for changes in management, and 3) identification of cardiovascular conditions or risk factors requiring longer-term management. Changes in management can include the decision to change medical therapies, the decision to perform further cardiovascular interventions, or recommendations about postoperative monitoring. This may lead to recommendations and discussions with the perioperative team about the optimal location and timing of surgery (eg, ambulatory surgery center

<!-- PAGE=? -->
versus outpatient hospital, or inpatient admission) or alternative strategies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The key to optimal management is communication among all of the relevant parties (ie, surgeon, anesthesiologist, primary caregiver, and consultants) and the patient. The goal of preoperative evaluation is to promote patient engagement and facilitate shared decision making by providing patients and their providers with clear, understandable information about perioperative cardiovascular risk in the context of the overall risk of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Task Force has chosen to make recommendations about care management on the basis of available evidence from studies of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Extrapolation from data from the nonsurgical arena or cardiac surgical arena was made only when no other data were available and the benefits of extrapolating the data outweighed the risks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  the  initiation  of  the  writing  effort,  concern  was expressed by Erasmus University about the scientific integrity of studies led by Poldermans. 9  The GWC reviewed 2 reports from Erasmus University published on the Internet, 9,10 as well as other relevant articles on this body of scientific investigation. 11-13  The 2012 report from Erasmus University concluded that the conduct in the DECREASE (Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echocardiography) IV  and V  trials  'was  in  several  respects  negligent  and  scientifically  incorrect'  and  that  'essential  source  documents are lacking' to make conclusions about other studies led by Poldermans. 9  Additionally, Erasmus University was contacted to ensure that the GWC had up-to-date information. On the basis of the published information, discussions between the Task  Force  and  GWC  leadership  ensued  to  determine  how best to treat any study in which Poldermans was the senior investigator (ie, either the first or last author). The Task Force developed the following framework for this document:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The ERC will include the DECREASE trials in the sensitivity analysis, but the systematic review report will be based on the published data on perioperative beta blockade, with data from all DECREASE trials excluded.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The DECREASE trials and other derivative studies by Poldermans should not be included in the CPG data supplements and evidence tables.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  nonretracted  DECREASE  publications  and/or  other derivative  studies  by  Poldermans  are  relevant  to  the topic, they can only be cited in the text with a comment about the finding compared with the current recommendation but should not form the basis of that recommendation or be used as a reference for the recommendation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Task Force and the GWC believe that it is crucial, for the sake of transparency, to include the nonretracted publications in the text of the document. This is particularly important because further investigation is occurring simultaneously with deliberation of the CPG recommendations. Because of the availability of new evidence and the international impact of the controversy about  the  DECREASE  trials,  the  ACC/AHA  and  European Society  of  Cardiology/European  Society  of  Anesthesiology began revising their respective CPGs concurrently. The respective  GWCs  performed  their  literature  reviews  and  analyses independently  and  then  developed  their  recommendations. Once peer review of both CPGs was completed, the GWCs chose  to  discuss  their  respective  recommendations  for  betablocker therapy and other relevant issues. Any differences in recommendations were discussed and clearly articulated in the text; however, the GWCs aligned a few recommendations to avoid confusion within the clinical community, except where international practice variation was prevalent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In developing this CPG, the GWC reviewed prior published CPGs and related statements. Table 2 lists these publications and statements deemed pertinent to this effort and is intended for use as a resource. However, because of the availability of new evidence, the current CPG may include recommendations that supersede those previously published.

In describing the temporal necessity of operations in this CPG, the  GWC developed the following definitions by consensus. An emergency procedure is one in which life or limb is threatened if not in the operating room where there is time for no or very limited or minimal clinical evaluation, typically within <6 hours. An urgent procedure is one in which there may be time for a limited clinical evaluation, usually when life or limb is  threatened if not in the operating room, typically between 6 and 24 hours. A time-sensitive procedure is one in which a delay of >1 to 6 weeks to allow for an evaluation and significant changes in management will negatively affect outcome. Most oncologic procedures would fall into this category. An elective procedure is one in which the procedure could be delayed for up to 1 year. Individual institutions may use slightly different definitions, but this framework could be mapped to local categories. A low-risk procedure is one in which the combined surgical  and  patient  characteristics  predict  a  risk  of  a  major adverse cardiac event (MACE) of death or myocardial infarction (MI) of <1%. Selected examples of low-risk procedures include cataract and plastic surgery. 34,35 Procedures with a risk of MACE of ≥ 1% are considered elevated risk .  Many previous risk-stratification schema have included intermediate- and high-risk classifications. Because recommendations for intermediate-  and  high-risk  procedures  are  similar,  classification into 2 categories simplifies the recommendations without loss of fidelity. Additionally, a risk calculator has been developed that  allows  more  precise  calculation  of  surgical  risk,  which can  be  incorporated  into  perioperative  decision  making. 36 Approaches to establishing low and elevated risk are developed more fully in Section 3.

2.1. Coronary Artery Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative mortality and morbidity due to coronary artery disease (CAD) are untoward complications of noncardiac surgery. The incidence of cardiac morbidity after surgery depends on  the  definition,  which  ranges  from  elevated  cardiac  biomarkers alone to the more classic definition with other signs of ischemia. 37-39  In a study of 15 133 patients who were >50 years of age and had noncardiac surgery requiring an overnight admission, an isolated peak troponin T value of ≥ 0.02 ng/mL occurred in 11.6% of patients. The 30-day mortality rate in this cohort with elevated troponin T values was 1.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7% to 2.1%). 40

MACE after noncardiac surgery is often associated with prior CAD events. The stability and timing of a recent MI impact the incidence  of  perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality.  An  older study demonstrated very high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with unstable angina. 41 A study using discharge summaries demonstrated that the postoperative MI rate decreased substantially as the length of time from MI to operation increased (0 to 30 days=32.8%; 31 to 60 days=18.7%; 61 to 90 days=8.4%; and 91 to 180 days=5.9%), as did the 30-day mortality rate (0 to 30 days=14.2%; 31 to 60 days=11.5%; 61 to 90 days=10.5%; and 91 to 180 days=9.9%). 42 This risk was modified by the presence and type of coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting  [CABG]  versus  percutaneous  coronary  interventions [PCIs]) that occurred at the time of the MI. 43 Taken  together, the data suggest that ≥ 60 days should elapse after a MI before noncardiac surgery in the absence of a coronary intervention. A

recent MI, defined as having occurred within 6 months of noncardiac surgery, was also found to be an independent risk factor for  perioperative  stroke,  which  was  associated  with  an  8-fold increase in the perioperative mortality rate. 44

A  patient's  age  is  an  important  consideration,  given  that adults  (those ≥ 55  years  of  age)  have  a  growing  prevalence of  cardiovascular  disease,  cerebrovascular  disease,  and  diabetes mellitus, 45  which increase overall risk for MACE when they undergo noncardiac surgery. Among older adult patients (those >65 years of age) undergoing noncardiac surgery, there was a higher reported incidence of acute ischemic stroke than for those ≤ 65 years of age. 46 Age >62 years is also an independent risk factor for perioperative stroke. 44  More postoperative complications, increased length of hospitalization, and inability to return home after hospitalization were also more pronounced among 'frail' (eg, those with impaired cognition and

2.2. Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with clinical heart failure (HF) (active HF symptoms or physical examination findings of peripheral edema, jugular venous distention, rales, third heart sound, or chest x-ray with pulmonary vascular redistribution or pulmonary edema) or a history of HF are at significant risk for perioperative complications, and widely used indices of cardiac risk include HF as an independent prognostic variable. 37,48,49

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The prevalence of HF is increasing steadily, 50 likely because of aging of the population and improved survival with newer cardiovascular therapies. Thus, the number of patients with HF requiring  preoperative  assessment  is  increasing.  The  risk  of developing HF is higher in the elderly and in individuals with advanced cardiac disease, creating the likelihood of clustering of other risk factors and comorbidities when HF is manifest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.2.1. Role of HF in Perioperative Cardiac Risk Indices

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the Original Cardiac Risk Index, 2 of the 9 independent significant  predictors  of  life-threatening  and  fatal  cardiac  complications-namely,  the  presence  of  preoperative  third  heart sound and jugular venous distention-were associated with HF and had the strongest association with perioperative MACE. 48 Subsequent approaches shifted the emphasis to history of HF 37 and defined HF by a combination of signs and symptoms, such as history of HF, pulmonary edema, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea; physical examination showing bilateral rales or third heart  sound  gallop;  and  chest  x-ray  showing  pulmonary  vascular  redistribution. This  definition,  however,  did  not  include important symptoms such as orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion. 16 Despite the differences in definition of HF as a risk variable, changes in demographics, changes in the epidemiology of patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, changes in treatment strategies, and advances in the perioperative area, populationbased studies have demonstrated that HF remains a significant risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality. In a study that used Medicare claims data, the risk-adjusted 30-day mortality and readmission rate in patients undergoing 1 of 13 predefined major noncardiac surgeries was 50% to 100% higher in patients with HF than in an elderly control group without a history of CAD or HF. 51,52 These results suggest that patients with HF who undergo  major  surgical  procedures  have  substantially  higher risks of operative death and hospital readmission than do other patients.  In  a  population-based  data  analysis  of  4  cohorts  of 38 047 consecutive patients, the 30-day postoperative mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with nonischemic HF (9.3%), ischemic HF (9.2%), and atrial fibrillation (AF) (6.4%) than in those with CAD (2.9%). 53  These findings suggest that although  perioperative  risk-prediction  models  place  greater emphasis on CAD than on HF, patients with active HF have a significantly higher risk of postoperative death than do patients with CAD. Furthermore, the stability of a patient with HF plays a significant role. In a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients with stable HF who underwent elective noncardiac surgery between 2003 and 2006, perioperative mortality rates for patients with stable HF were not higher than for the control group without HF, but these patients with stable HF were more likely than patients without HF to have longer hospital stays, require hospital readmission, and have higher long-term mortality rates. 54 However, all patients in this study were seen in a preoperative assessment, consultation, and treatment program; and the population did not include many high-risk patients. These results  suggest  improved  perioperative  outcomes  for  patients with stable HF who are treated according to GDMT.

2.2.2. Risk of HF Based on Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction: Preserved Versus Reduced

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although signs and/or symptoms of decompensated HF confer the highest risk, severely decreased (<30%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) itself is an independent contributor to perioperative outcome and a long-term risk factor for death in patients with HF undergoing elevated-risk noncardiac surgery. 55 Survival after surgery for those with a LVEF ≤ 29% is significantly worse than for those with a LVEF >29%. 56  Studies have reported mixed results for perioperative risk in patients with HF and preserved  LVEF,  however.  In  a  meta-analysis  using individual patient data, patients with HF and preserved LVEF had a lower all-cause mortality rate  than  did  those  with  HF and reduced LVEF (the risk of death did not increase notably until LVEF fell below 40%). 57 However, the absolute mortality rate was still high in patients with HF and preserved LVEF as compared with patients without HF, highlighting  the  importance of presence of HF. There are limited data on perioperative risk stratification related to diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction  with  and  without  systolic  dysfunction  has  been associated with a significantly higher rate of MACE, prolonged length of stay, and higher rates of postoperative HF. 58,59

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.2.3. Risk of Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  symptomatic  HF  is  a  well-established  perioperative cardiovascular risk factor, the effect of asymptomatic left ventricular  (LV)  dysfunction  on  perioperative  outcomes  is unknown. In 1 prospective cohort study on the role of preoperative echocardiography in 1005 consecutive patients undergoing elective vascular surgery at a single center, LV dysfunction (LVEF <50%) was present in 50% of patients, of whom 80% were  asymptomatic. 58 The  30-day  cardiovascular  event  rate was highest in patients with symptomatic HF (49%), followed by those with asymptomatic systolic LV dysfunction (23%), asymptomatic diastolic LV dysfunction (18%), and normal LV function (10%). Further studies are required to determine if the information obtained from the assessment of ventricular function in patients without signs or symptoms adds incremental information that will result in changes in management and outcome such that the appropriateness criteria should be updated. It  should  be  noted  that  the  2011  appropriate  use  criteria  for echocardiography states it is 'inappropriate' to assess ventricular function in patients without signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease in the preoperative setting. 60 For preoperative assessment of LV function, see Section 5.2.

2.2.4. Role of Natriuretic Peptides in Perioperative Risk of HF

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative natriuretic peptide levels independently predict cardiovascular events in the first 30 days after vascular surgery 61-66  and significantly improve the predictive performance of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI). 61  Measurement of biomarkers, especially natriuretic peptides, may be helpful in assessing patients with HF and with diagnosing HF as a postoperative complication in patients at high risk for HF. Further prospective randomized studies are needed to assess the utility of such a strategy (Section 3.1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.3. Cardiomyopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is little information on the preoperative evaluation of patients  with  specific  nonischemic  cardiomyopathies  before noncardiac  surgery.  Preoperative  recommendations  must  be based  on  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  pathophysiology of  the  cardiomyopathy,  assessment  and  management  of  the underlying process, and overall management of the HF.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Restrictive  Cardiomyopathies: Restrictive  cardiomyopathies, such as those associated with cardiac amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and sarcoidosis, pose special hemodynamic and management problems. Cardiac output in these cardiomyopathies with restrictive physiology is both preload and heart rate dependent. Significant reduction of blood volume or filling pressures, bradycardia or tachycardia, and atrial arrhythmias such as AF/atrial  flutter  may  not  be  well  tolerated.  These  patients require a multidisciplinary approach, with optimization of the underlying pathology, volume status, and HF status including medication adjustment targeting primary disease management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy: In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, decreased systemic vascular resistance  (arterial  vasodilators),  volume  loss,  or  reduction in preload or LV filling may increase the degree of dynamic obstruction  and  further  decrease  diastolic  filling  and  cardiac output, with potentially untoward results. Overdiuresis should be avoided, and inotropic agents are usually not used in these patients because of increased LV outflow gradient. Studies have reported mixed results for perioperative risk in patients with hypertrophic  obstructive  cardiomyopathy.  Most  studies  were small, were conducted at a single center, and reflect variations in patient populations, types of surgery, and management. 67-69

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular (RV)  Cardiomyopathy  and/or  Dysplasia: In  1  autopsy  study  examining  a series of 200 cases of sudden death associated with arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy and/or dysplasia, death occurred in 9.5% of cases during the perioperative period. 70 This  emphasizes  the  importance  of  close  perioperative  evaluation  and monitoring of these patients for ventricular arrhythmia. Most of these patients require cardiac electrophysiologist involvement and consideration for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for long-term management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  a  retrospective  analysis  of  1700  forensic  autopsies  of patients  with  sudden,  unexpected  perioperative  death  over 17  years,  pathological  examination  showed  cardiac  lesions in 47 cases, arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy in 18 cases, CAD in 10 cases, cardiomyopathy in 8 cases, structural abnormalities  of  the  His  bundle  in  9  cases,  mitral  valve  prolapse in  1  case,  and  acute  myocarditis  in  1  case,  suggesting  the importance of detailed clinical histories and physical examinations before surgery for detection of these structural cardiac abnormalities. 71

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripartum Cardiomyopathy: Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare cause of dilated cardiomyopathy that occurs in approximately 1 in 1000 deliveries and manifests during the last few months of pregnancy or the first 6 months of the postpartum period. It can result in severe ventricular dysfunction during late puerperium. 72  Prognosis depends on the recovery of the LV contractility and resolution of symptoms within the first 6 months after onset of the disease. The major peripartum concern is to optimize fluid administration and avoid myocardial depression while maintaining stable intraoperative hemodynamics. 73  Although the majority of patients remain stable and recover,  emergency  delivery  may  be  life-saving  for  the mother as well as the infant. Acute and critically ill patients with refractory peripartum cardiomyopathy  may  require mechanical support with an intra-aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous-flow LV assist devices, and/or cardiac transplantation. 74

See the 2014 valvular heart disease CPG for the complete set of recommendations and specific definitions of disease severity 15  and Online Data Supplement 4 for additional information on valvular heart disease.

Class I

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  recommended that patients with clinically suspected  moderate  or  greater  degrees  of  valvular stenosis or regurgitation undergo preoperative echocardiography  if  there  has  been  either  1)  no  prior echocardiography  within  1  year  or  2)  a  significant change  in  clinical  status  or  physical  examination since last evaluation. 60 (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  adults  who  meet  standard  indications  for  valvular  intervention  (replacement  and  repair)  on  the basis of symptoms and severity of stenosis or regurgitation,  valvular  intervention  before  elective  noncardiac surgery is effective in reducing perioperative risk. 15 (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Significant  valvular  heart  disease  increases  cardiac  risk  for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. 37,48 Patients with suspected valvular heart disease should undergo echocardiography to quantify the severity of stenosis or regurgitation, calculate systolic function, and estimate right heart pressures. Evaluation for concurrent CAD is also warranted, with electrocardiography exercise testing, stress echocardiographic or nuclear imaging study, or coronary angiography, as appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emergency noncardiac surgery may occur in the presence of uncorrected significant valvular heart disease. The risk of noncardiac surgery can be minimized by 1) having an accurate diagnosis of the type and severity of valvular heart disease, 2) choosing  an  anesthetic  approach  appropriate  to  the  valvular heart disease, and 3) considering a higher level of perioperative monitoring (eg, arterial  pressure,  pulmonary  artery  pressure,

2.4.1. Aortic Stenosis: Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elevated-risk elective noncardiac surgery with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic  monitoring  is  reasonable  to  perform  in patients  with  asymptomatic  severe  aortic  stenosis (AS). 48,75-84 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the Original Cardiac Risk Index, severe AS was associated with  a  perioperative  mortality  rate  of  13%,  compared  with 1.6% in patients without AS. 48   The  mechanism of MACE in patients with AS likely arises from the anesthetic agents and surgical stress that lead to an unfavorable hemodynamic state. The occurrence of hypotension and tachycardia can result in decreased coronary perfusion pressure, development of arrhythmias or ischemia, myocardial injury, cardiac failure, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With the recent advances in anesthetic and surgical approaches,  the  cardiac  risk  in  patients  with  significant AS undergoing  noncardiac  surgery  has  declined.  In  a  single, tertiary-center study, patients with moderate AS (aortic valve area: 1.0 cm 2 to 1.5 cm 2 ) or severe AS (aortic valve area <1.0 cm 2 )  undergoing  nonemergency  noncardiac  surgery  had  a 30-day mortality rate of 2.1%, compared with 1.0% in propensity score-matched  patients without  AS ( P =0.036). 75 Postoperative MI was more frequent in patients with AS than in patients without AS (3.0% versus 1.1%; P =0.001). Patients with AS had worse primary outcomes (defined as composite of 30-day mortality and postoperative MI) than did patients without  AS  (4.4%  versus  1.7%; P =0.002  for  patients  with moderate AS;  5.7%  versus  2.7%; P =0.02  for  patients  with severe AS). Predictors of 30-day death and postoperative MI in patients with moderate or severe AS include high-risk surgery (odds ratio [OR]: 7.3; 95% CI: 2.6 to 20.6), symptomatic severe AS (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1 to 7.5), coexisting moderate or severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (OR: 9.8; 95% CI: 3.1 to 20.4), and pre-existing CAD (OR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.1 to 6.2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients who meet indications for aortic valve replacement (AVR) before noncardiac surgery but are considered high risk or ineligible for surgical A VR, options include proceeding with noncardiac surgery with invasive hemodynamic monitoring and optimization of loading conditions, percutaneous aortic  balloon  dilation  as  a  bridging  strategy,  and  transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Percutaneous aortic balloon dilation can be performed with acceptable procedural safety, with the mortality rate  being  2%  to  3%  and  the  stroke  rate being  1%  to  2%. 76-78,84 However,  recurrence  and  mortality rates approach 50% by 6 months after the procedure. Singlecenter, small case series from more than 25 years ago reported the  use  of  percutaneous  aortic  balloon  dilation  in  patients with severe AS before noncardiac surgery. 79-81  Although the results were acceptable, there were no comparison groups or long-term  follow-up.  The  PARTNER  (Placement  of  Aortic Transcatheter Valves) RCT demonstrated that TAVR has superior  outcomes  for  patients  who  are  not  eligible  for  surgical AVR (1-year mortality rate: 30.7% for TAVR versus 50.7% for standard therapy) and similar efficacy for patients who are at high risk for surgical A VR (1-year mortality rate: 24.2% for TAVR versus 26.8% for surgical AVR). 82,83  However, there are no data for the efficacy or safety of TA VR for patients with AS who are undergoing noncardiac surgery.

2.4.2. Mitral Stenosis: Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIb

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elevated-risk elective noncardiac surgery using appropriate intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic  monitoring  may  be  reasonable  in  asymptomatic patients with severe mitral stenosis if valve morphology is not favorable for percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy. (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  severe  mitral  stenosis  are  at  increased  risk  for noncardiac surgery and should be managed similarly to patients with AS. The main goals during the perioperative period are to monitor intravascular volume and to avoid tachycardia and hypotension. It is crucial to maintain intravascular volume at a level that ensures adequate forward cardiac output without excessive rises in left atrial pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure that could precipitate acute pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  mitral  stenosis  who  meet  standard  indications for valvular intervention (open mitral commissurotomy or  percutaneous  mitral  balloon  commissurotomy)  should undergo  valvular  intervention before elective  noncardiac surgery. 85  If valve anatomy is not favorable for percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy, or if the noncardiac surgery is an emergency, then noncardiac surgery may be considered with invasive hemodynamic monitoring and optimization of loading conditions. There are no reports of the use of percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy before noncardiac surgery; however, this procedure has excellent outcomes when used during high-risk pregnancies. 86,87

Elevated-risk elective noncardiac surgery with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic  monitoring  is  reasonable  in  adults  with asymptomatic severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and a normal LVEF. (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Left-sided  regurgitant  lesions  convey  increased  cardiac  risk during  noncardiac  surgery  but  are  better  tolerated  than  stenotic  valvular  disease. 88,89 AR  and  MR  are  associated  with LV volume overload. To optimize forward cardiac output during anesthesia and surgery, 1) preload should be maintained because  the  LV  has  increased  size  and  compliance,  and  2) excessive systemic afterload should be avoided so as to augment cardiac output and reduce the regurgitation volume. For patients with severe AR or MR, the LV forward cardiac output is reduced because of the regurgitant volume.

rate than did case-matched controls without AR (9.0% versus 1.8%; P =0.008)  and  a  higher  morbidity  rate  (16.2%  versus 5.4%; P =0.003), including postoperative MI, stroke, pulmonary edema, intubation >24 hours, and major arrhythmia. 88 Predictors of in-hospital death included depressed LVEF (ejection fraction [EF] <55%), renal dysfunction (creatinine >2 mg/dL), high surgical risk, and lack of preoperative cardiac medications. In the absence of trials addressing perioperative management, patients with moderate-to-severe AR and severe AR could be monitored with invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography and could be  admitted  postoperatively  to  an  intensive  care  unit  setting when undergoing surgical procedures with elevated risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  a  single,  tertiary-center  study,  patients  with  moderateto-severe MR and severe MR undergoing nonemergency noncardiac surgery had a 30-day mortality rate similar to that of propensity score-matched controls without MR (1.7% versus 1.1%; P =0.43). 89 Patients  with  MR  had  worse  primary  outcomes (defined as composite of 30-day death and postoperative MI, HF, and stroke) than did patients without MR (22.2% versus 16.4%; P <0.02). Important predictors of postoperative adverse  outcomes  after  noncardiac  surgery  were  EF  <35%, ischemic cause of MR, history of diabetes mellitus, and history of  carotid  endarterectomy.  Patients  with  moderate-to-severe MR and severe MR undergoing noncardiac surgery should be monitored with invasive hemodynamics and echocardiography and admitted postoperatively to an intensive care unit setting when undergoing surgical procedures with elevated risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.5. Arrhythmias and Conduction Disorders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders are common findings in the perioperative period, particularly with increasing age. Although  supraventricular  and  ventricular  arrhythmias  were identified as independent risk factors for perioperative cardiac events in the Original Cardiac Risk Index, 48 subsequent studies indicated a lower level of risk. 37,90,91 The paucity of studies that address surgical risk conferred by arrhythmias limits the ability to provide specific recommendations. General recommendations for assessing and treating arrhythmias can be found in other CPGs. 14,92,93 In  1  study  using  continuous  electrocardiographic monitoring,  asymptomatic  ventricular  arrhythmias,  including couplets  and  nonsustained  ventricular  tachycardia,  were  not associated with an increase in cardiac complications after noncardiac surgery. 94 Nevertheless, the presence of an arrhythmia in the preoperative setting should prompt investigation into underlying cardiopulmonary disease, ongoing myocardial ischemia or MI, drug toxicity, or metabolic derangements, depending on the nature and acuity of the arrhythmia and the patient's history.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AF  is  the  most  common  sustained  tachyarrhythmia;  it  is particularly  common  in  older  patients  who  are  likely  to  be undergoing  surgical  procedures.  Patients  with  a  preoperative history of AF who are clinically stable generally do not require modification of medical management or special evaluation in the perioperative period, other than adjustment of anticoagulation (Section 6.2.7). The potential for perioperative formation of left atrial thrombus in patients with persistent AF may need to be considered if the operation involves physical manipulation of the heart, as in certain thoracic procedures. Ventricular arrhythmias, whether single premature ventricular contractions or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, usually do not require therapy unless they result in hemodynamic compromise or are associated with significant structural heart disease or inherited electrical  disorders.  Although  frequent  ventricular  premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are risk factors for the development of intraoperative and postoperative arrhythmias, they are not associated with an increased risk of nonfatal MI or cardiac death in the perioperative period. 94,95 However, patients  who  develop  sustained  or  nonsustained  ventricular tachycardia during the perioperative period may require referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation, including assessment of their ventricular function and screening for CAD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High-grade cardiac conduction abnormalities, such as complete  atrioventricular  block,  if  unanticipated,  may  increase operative risk and necessitate temporary or permanent transvenous pacing. 96 However, patients with intraventricular conduction delays, even in the presence of a left or right bundle-branch block, and no history of advanced heart block or symptoms, rarely  progress  to  complete  atrioventricular  block  perioperatively. 97 The  presence  of  some  pre-existing  conduction  disorders,  such  as  sinus  node  dysfunction  and  atrioventricular block, requires caution if perioperative beta-blocker therapy is being considered. Isolated bundle-branch block and bifascicular block generally do not contraindicate use of beta blockers.

See Section 6.4 for intraoperative/postoperative management of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).

Before  elective  surgery  in  a  patient  with  a  CIED, the surgical/procedure team and clinician following the  CIED  should  communicate  in  advance  to  plan perioperative  management  of  the  CIED. (Level  of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The presence of a pacemaker or ICD has important implications for preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative patient management. Collectively termed CIEDs, these devices include single-chamber, dual-chamber, and biventricular hardware configurations produced by several different manufacturers, each with  different  software  designs  and  programming  features. Patients with CIEDs invariably have underlying cardiac disease that can involve arrhythmias, such as sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular  block, AF,  and  ventricular  tachycardia;  structural heart disease, such as ischemic or nonischemic cardiomyopathy; and clinical conditions, such as chronic HF or inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Preoperative evaluation of such patients should  therefore  encompass  an  awareness  not  only  of  the patient's  specific  CIED  hardware  and  programming, but also of the underlying cardiac condition for which the device was implanted. In particular, cardiac rhythm and history of ventricular arrhythmias should be reviewed in patients with CIEDs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To  assist  clinicians  with  the  perioperative  evaluation  and management of patients with CIEDs, the HRS and the  American Society of Anesthesiologists jointly developed an expert consensus statement published in July 2011 and endorsed by the ACC and the AHA. 33  Clinicians caring for patients with CIEDs in the perioperative setting should be familiar with that document and the consensus recommendations contained within.

The HRS/American Society of Anesthesiologists expert consensus statement acknowledges that because of the complexity of modern devices and the variety of indications for which they are  implanted,  the  perioperative  management  of  patients  with CIEDs must be individualized, and a single recommendation for all patients with CIEDs is not appropriate. 33  Effective communication between the surgical/procedure team and the clinician following the patient with a CIED in the outpatient setting is the foundation of successful perioperative management and should take place well in advance of elective procedures. The surgical/ procedure team should communicate with the CIED clinician/ team to inform them of the nature of the planned procedure and the type of electromagnetic interference (EMI) (ie, electrocautery) likely to be encountered. The outpatient team should formulate a prescription for the perioperative management of the CIED and communicate it to the surgical/procedure team.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The CIED prescription can usually be made from a review of patient records, provided that patients are evaluated at least annually (for pacemakers) or semiannually (for ICDs). In some circumstances,  patients  will  require  additional  preoperative in-person  evaluation  or  remote  CIED  interrogation.  The  prescription may involve perioperative CIED interrogation or reprogramming (including changing pacing to an asynchronous mode and/or inactivating ICD tachytherapies), application of a magnet over the CIED with or without postoperative CIED interrogation, or use of no perioperative CIED interrogation or intervention. 98,99 Details of individual prescriptions will depend on the nature and location of the operative procedure, likelihood of use of monopolar electrocautery, type of CIED (ie, pacemaker versus ICD), and dependence of the patient on cardiac pacing.

Chronic  pulmonary  vascular  targeted  therapy  (ie, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators, endothelin receptor antagonists,  and  prostanoids)  should  be  continued  unless contraindicated or not tolerated in patients with pulmonary  hypertension  who  are  undergoing  noncardiac surgery. (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless the risks of delay outweigh the potential benefits, preoperative evaluation by a pulmonary hypertension specialist  before  noncardiac  surgery  can  be beneficial for patients with pulmonary hypertension, particularly for those with features of increased perioperative risk. 100 * (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
*Features of increased perioperative risk in patients with pulmonary hypertension include: 1) diagnosis of Group 1 pulmonary hypertension (ie,  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension),  2)  other  forms  of  pulmonary hypertension associated with high pulmonary pressures (pulmonary artery systolic pressures >70 mm Hg) and/or moderate or greater RV dilatation and/or dysfunction and/or pulmonary vascular resistance >3 Wood units, and 3) World Health Organization/New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms attributable to pulmonary hypertension. 101-107

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The evidence on the role of pulmonary hypertension in perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is based on observational data and is predominantly related to Group 1 pulmonary hypertension (ie, pulmonary arterial hypertension). 101-107 However, complication rates are consistently high, with mortality rates of 4% to 26% and morbidity rates, most notably cardiac and/or respiratory failure, of 6% to 42%. 101-106 A variety of factors can occur during the perioperative period that may precipitate worsening hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, or RV function. In addition to the urgency of the surgery and the surgical risk category, risk factors for perioperative adverse events in patients with pulmonary hypertension include the severity of pulmonary hypertension symptoms, the degree of RV dysfunction, and the performance of surgery in a  center  without  expertise  in  pulmonary  hypertension. 101-106 Patients  with  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  due  to  other causes,  particularly  with  features  of  increased  perioperative risk, should undergo a thorough preoperative risk assessment in a center with the necessary medical and anesthetic expertise in pulmonary hypertension, including an assessment of functional capacity,  hemodynamics,  and  echocardiography  that  includes evaluation of RV function. Right heart catheterization can also be  used  preoperatively  to  confirm  the  severity  of  illness  and distinguish  primary  pulmonary  hypertension  from  secondary causes of elevated pulmonary artery pressures, such as left-sided HF. Patients should have optimization of pulmonary hypertension and RV status preoperatively and should receive the necessary perioperative management on a case-by-case basis.

2.7. Adult Congenital Heart Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several case series have indicated that performance of a surgical procedure in patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) carries a greater risk than in the normal population. 108-113 The risk relates to the nature of the underlying ACHD, the surgical procedure, and the urgency of intervention. 108-113  For more information,  readers  are  referred  to  the  specific  recommendations  for perioperative assessment in the ACC/AHA 2008 ACHD CPG. 28 When possible, it is optimal to perform the preoperative evaluation  of  surgery  for  patients  with ACHD  in  a  regional  center specializing  in  congenital  cardiology,  particularly  for  patient populations that appear to be at particularly high risk (eg, those with a prior Fontan procedure, cyanotic ACHD, pulmonary arterial hypertension, clinical HF, or significant dysrhythmia).

1. For patients with a low risk of perioperative MACE, further testing is not recommended  before the planned operation. 34,35 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Different noncardiac operations are associated with different risks  of  MACE.  Operations  for  peripheral  vascular  disease are generally performed among those with the highest perioperative risk. 116  The lowest-risk operations are generally those without significant fluid shifts and stress. Plastic surgery and cataract surgery are associated with a very low risk of MACE. 34 Some operations can have their risk lowered by taking a less invasive approach. For example, open aortic aneurysm repair has a high risk of MACE that is lowered when the procedure is performed endovascularly. 117 The number of different surgical procedures makes assigning a specific risk of a MACE to each procedure difficult. In addition, performing an operation in an emergency situation is understood to increase risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  RCRI  is  a  simple,  validated,  and  accepted  tool  to assess perioperative risk of major cardiac complications (MI, pulmonary edema, ventricular fibrillation or primary cardiac arrest, and complete heart block). 37 It has 6 predictors of risk for major cardiac complications, only 1 of which is based on the procedure-namely, 'Undergoing suprainguinal vascular, intraperitoneal, or intrathoracic surgery.' A patient with 0 or 1 predictor(s) of risk would have a low risk of MACE. Patients with ≥ 2 predictors of risk would have elevated risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two newer tools have been created by the American College of Surgeons, which prospectively collected data on operations performed in more than 525 participating hospitals in the United States. Data on more than 1 million operations have been used to create these risk calculators 114 (www.riskcalculator.facs.org).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The American College of Surgeons NSQIP MICA risk-prediction rule was created in 2011, 115 with a single study-albeit large and multicenter-describing its derivation and validation (http://www.surgicalriskcalculator.com/miorcardiacarrest). This  tool  includes  adjusted  ORs  for  different  surgical  sites, with inguinal hernia as the reference group. Target complications were defined as cardiac arrest (defined as 'chaotic cardiac rhythm requiring initiation of basic or advanced life support') or  MI  (defined  as ≥ 1  of  the  following:  documented  electrocardiographic findings of MI, ST elevation of ≥ 1 mm in >1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
contiguous leads, new left bundle-branch block, new Q-wave in ≥ 2 contiguous leads, or troponin >3 times normal in setting of suspected ischemia). Using these definitions of outcome and chart-based data collection methods, the authors of the risk calculator derived a risk index that was robust in the derivation and  validation  stages  and  appeared  to  outperform  the  RCRI (which was tested in the same dataset) in discriminative power, particularly among patients undergoing vascular surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The American College of Surgeons NSQIP Surgical Risk Calculator  uses  the  specific  current  procedural  terminology code of the procedure being performed to enable procedurespecific  risk  assessment  for  a  diverse  group  of  outcomes. 114 The procedure is defined as being an emergency case or not an  emergency  case.  For  the American  College  of  Surgeons NSQIP, to be an emergency case, the 'principal operative procedure must be performed during the hospital admission for the diagnosis AND the surgeon and/or anesthesiologist must report the case as emergent.' 118 The calculator also includes 21 patient-specific variables (eg, age, sex, body mass index, dyspnea, previous MI, functional status). From this input, it calculates the percentage risk of a MACE, death, and 8 other outcomes. This risk calculator may offer the best estimation of surgery-specific risk of a MACE and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some limitations to the NSQIP-based calculator should be noted: It has not been validated in an external population outside the NSQIP, and the definition of MI includes only ST-segment MIs or a large troponin bump (>3 times normal) that occurred in symptomatic patients. An additional disadvantage is the use of  the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiology  Physical  Status Classification, a common qualitatively derived risk score used by  anesthesiologists.  This  classification  has  poor  inter-rater reliability even among anesthesiologists and may be unfamiliar to clinicians outside that specialty. 119,120  Clinicians would also need to familiarize themselves with the NSQIP definitions of functional status or 'dependence,' concepts that are thought to be important in perioperative risk assessment algorithms but that have not been included in multivariable risk indices to date (for more information on functional status, see Section 4).

as an approach to identify patients at highest risk. 64,121-125  These studies and 2 subsequent meta-analyses suggest that biomarkers  may  provide  incremental  predictive  value. 62,66   However, most studies had significant variation in the time frame in which these biomarkers were obtained, were observational, did not include a control arm, and did not require biomarkers routinely or prospectively. Furthermore, there are no data to suggest that targeting these biomarkers for treatment and intervention will reduce the postoperative risk. In addition, several of these studies were investigations conducted by Poldermans. 121,126-130

4. Approach to Perioperative Cardiac Testing 4.1. Exercise Capacity and Functional Capacity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Functional status is a reliable predictor of perioperative and long-term  cardiac  events.  Patients  with  reduced  functional status  preoperatively  are  at  increased  risk  of  complications. Conversely, those with good functional status preoperatively are at lower risk. Moreover, in highly functional asymptomatic patients, it is often appropriate to proceed with planned surgery without further cardiovascular testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  a  patient  has  not  had  a  recent  exercise  test  before  noncardiac  surgery,  functional  status  can  usually  be  estimated from activities of daily living. 132 Functional capacity is often expressed in terms of metabolic equivalents (METs), where 1 MET is the resting or basal oxygen consumption of a 40-yearold,  70-kg  man.  In  the  perioperative  literature,  functional capacity is classified as excellent (>10 METs), good (7 METs to 10 METs), moderate (4 METs to 6 METs), poor (<4 METs), or  unknown.  Perioperative  cardiac  and  long-term  risks  are increased in patients unable to perform 4 METs of work during daily activities. Examples of activities associated with <4 METs are slow ballroom dancing, golfing with a cart, playing a musical instrument, and walking at approximately 2 mph to 3 mph. Examples of activities associated with >4 METs are climbing a flight of stairs or walking up a hill, walking on level ground at 4 mph, and performing heavy work around the house.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Functional  status  can  also  be  assessed  more  formally  by activity scales, such as the DASI (Duke Activity Status Index) (Table 4) 133 and the Specific Activity Scale. 134  In 600 consecutive  patients  undergoing  noncardiac  surgery,  perioperative myocardial  ischemia  and  cardiovascular  events  were  more common in those with poor functional status (defined as the inability to walk 4 blocks or climb 2 flights of stairs) even after adjustment for other risk factors. 132 The likelihood of a serious complication was inversely related to the number of blocks that could be walked ( P =0.006) or flights of stairs that could be climbed ( P =0.01). Analyses from the American College of Surgeons NSQIP dataset have shown that dependent functional status, based on the need for assistance with activities of daily living  rather  than  on  METs,  is  associated  with  significantly increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. 135,136

The GWC developed an algorithmic approach to perioperative cardiac assessment on the basis of the available evidence and expert opinion, the rationale of which is outlined throughout the CPG. The algorithm incorporates the perspectives of clinicians caring for the patient to provide informed consent and help guide perioperative management to minimize risk. It is also crucial to incorporate the patient's perspective with regard to the assessment of the risk of surgery or alternative therapy and the risk of any GDMT or coronary and valvular interventions before noncardiac surgery. Patients may elect to forgo a surgical intervention if the risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality is extremely high; soliciting this information  from  the  patient  before  surgery  is  a  key  part  of  shared decision making.

Figure 1. Stepwise approach to perioperative cardiac assessment for CAD. Colors correspond to the Classes of Recommendations in Table 1. Step 1: In patients scheduled for surgery with risk factors for or known CAD, determine the urgency of surgery. If an emergency, then determine the clinical risk factors that may influence perioperative management and proceed to surgery with appropriate monitoring and management strategies based on the clinical assessment (see Section 2.1 for more information on CAD). (For patients with symptomatic HF, VHD, or arrhythmias, see Sections 2.2, 2.4, and 2.5 for information on evaluation and management.) Step 2: If the surgery is urgent or elective, determine if the patient has an ACS. If yes, then refer patient for cardiology evaluation and management according to GDMT according to the UA/NSTEMI and STEMI CPGs. 18,20 Step 3: If the patient has risk factors for stable CAD, then estimate the perioperative risk of MACE on the basis of the combined clinical/surgical risk. This estimate can use the American College of Surgeons NSQIP risk calculator (http://www.riskcalculator.facs.org) or incorporate the RCRI 131  with an estimation of surgical risk. For example, a patient undergoing very low-risk surgery (eg, ophthalmologic surgery), even with multiple risk factors, would have a low risk of MACE, whereas a patient undergoing major vascular surgery with few risk factors would have an elevated risk of MACE (Section 3). Step 4: If the patient has a low risk of MACE (<1%), then no further testing is needed, and the patient may proceed to surgery (Section 3). Step 5: If the patient is at elevated risk of MACE, then determine functional capacity with an objective measure or scale such as the DASI. 133  If the patient has moderate, good, or excellent functional capacity ( ≥ 4 METs), then proceed to surgery without further evaluation (Section 4.1). Step 6: If the patient has poor (<4 METs) or unknown functional capacity, then the clinician should consult with the patient and perioperative team to determine whether further testing will impact patient decision making (eg, decision to perform original surgery or willingness to undergo CABG or PCI, depending on the results of the test) or perioperative care. If yes, then pharmacological stress testing is appropriate. In those patients with unknown functional capacity, exercise stress testing may be reasonable to perform. If the stress test is abnormal, consider coronary angiography and revascularization depending on the extent of the abnormal test. The patient can then proceed to surgery with GDMT or consider alternative strategies, such as noninvasive treatment of the indication for surgery (eg, radiation therapy for cancer) or palliation. If the test is normal, proceed to surgery according to GDMT (Section 5.3). Step 7: If testing will not impact decision making or care, then proceed to surgery according to GDMT or consider alternative strategies, such as noninvasive treatment of the indication for surgery (eg, radiation therapy for cancer) or palliation.

1. Routine preoperative resting 12-lead ECG is not useful  for  asymptomatic  patients  undergoing  low-risk surgical procedures. 35,141 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with established coronary heart disease, the resting 12-lead ECG contains prognostic information relating to short-  and  long-term  morbidity  and  mortality.  In  addition, the  preoperative  ECG  may  provide  a  useful  baseline  standard against which to measure changes in the postoperative period.  For  both  reasons,  particularly  the  latter,  the  value of  the  preoperative  12-lead  ECG  is  likely  to  increase  with the  risk  of  the  surgical  procedure,  particularly  for  patients with known coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other significant structural heart disease. 137,138

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  prognostic  significance  of  numerous  electrocardiographic  abnormalities  has  been  identified  in  observational studies, including arrhythmias, 48,142 pathological Q-waves, 37,142 LV  hypertrophy, 139,142 ST  depressions, 137,139,142 QTc  interval prolongation, 138,143 and  bundle-branch  blocks. 140,142   However, there is poor concordance across different observational studies  as  to  which  abnormalities  have  prognostic  significance and which do not; a minority of studies found no prognostic  significance  in  the  preoperative  ECG. 141,144,145 The  implications  of  abnormalities  on  the  preoperative  12-lead  ECG increase with patient age and with risk factors for coronary heart disease. However, a standard age or risk factor cutoff for use of preoperative electrocardiographic testing has not been defined. Likewise, the optimal time interval between obtaining a 12-lead ECG and elective surgery is unknown. General

Routine preoperative evaluation of LV function is not recommended. 146-148 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  relationship  between  measures  of  resting  LV  systolic function (most commonly LVEF) and perioperative events has been evaluated in several studies of subjects before noncardiac surgery. 56,58,146-161  These studies demonstrate an association between reduced LV systolic function and perioperative complications, particularly postoperative HF. The association is  strongest  in  patients  at  high  risk  for  death.  Complication risk is associated with the degree of systolic dysfunction, with the greatest risk seen in patients with an LVEF at rest <35%. A preoperatively  assessed  low  EF  has  a  low  sensitivity  but a  relatively  high  specificity  for  the  prediction  of  perioperative cardiac events. However, it has only modest incremental predictive power over clinical risk factors. The role of echocardiography in the prediction of risk in patients with clinical HF is less well studied. A cohort of patients with a history of HF demonstrated that preoperative LVEF <30% was associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications. 55 Data are sparse on the value of preoperative diastolic function assessment and the risk of cardiac events. 58,59

Routine screening with noninvasive stress testing is not useful for patients at low risk for noncardiac surgery. 165,166 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several studies have examined the role of exercise testing to identify patients at risk for perioperative complications. 162-164,167-170 Almost all of these studies were conducted in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery, because these patients are generally considered to be at the highest risk. 162,164,167-169  Although they were important contributions at the time, the outcomes in most of these studies are not reflective of contemporary perioperative event rates, nor was the patient management consistent with current standards of preventive and perioperative cardiac care. Furthermore, many used stress protocols that are not commonly used today, such as non-Bruce protocol treadmill tests or arm ergometry. However, from the available data, patients able to achieve approximately 7 METs to 10 METs have a low risk of perioperative cardiovascular events, 162,164 and those achieving <4 METs to 5 METs have an increased risk of perioperative cardiovascular events. 163,164 Electrocardiographic changes with exercise are not as predictive. 162-164,169

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The vast majority of data on the impact of inducible myocardial ischemia on perioperative outcomes are based on pharmacological stress testing (Sections 5.5.1-5.5.3), but it seems reasonable that exercise stress echocardiography or radionuclide  myocardial  perfusion  imaging  (MPI)  would  perform similarly to pharmacological stress testing in patients who are able to exercise adequately.

Cardiopulmonary  exercise  testing  has  been  studied  in  different  settings,  including  before  abdominal  aortic  aneurysm surgery 172-174,180 ; major abdominal surgery (including abdominal aortic aneurysm resection) 175-177 ; hepatobiliary surgery 178 ; complex hepatic resection 171 ; lung resection 181 ; and colorectal, bladder, or kidney cancer surgery. 179 These studies varied in patient population, definition of perioperative complications, and what was done with the results of preoperative testing, including decisions about the appropriateness of proceeding with surgery. However, a consistent finding among the studies was that a low anaerobic threshold was predictive of perioperative cardiovascular complications, 171,173,177 postoperative death, 172,174,175 or midterm and late death after surgery. 174,179,180 An  anaerobic  threshold  of  approximately  10  mL  O 2 /kg/ min was proposed as the optimal discrimination point, with a range in these studies of 9.9 mL O 2 /kg/min to 11 mL O 2 / kg/min. Although  exercise  tolerance  can  be  estimated  from instruments  such  as  the  DASI 133 or  the  incremental  shuttle walk test, in 1 study, a significant number of patients with poor performance by these measures had satisfactory peak oxygen consumption  and  anaerobic  threshold  on  cardiopulmonary exercise testing. 182  That particular study was not powered to look at postoperative outcomes.

Class IIa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  reasonable  for  patients  who are at an elevated risk for noncardiac surgery and have poor functional capacity  (<4  METs)  to  undergo  noninvasive  pharmacological stress testing (either dobutamine stress echocardiogram  [DSE]  or  pharmacological  stress MPI)  if  it  will  change  management. 183-187 (Level  of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class III: No Benefit

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Routine screening with noninvasive stress testing is not useful for patients undergoing low-risk noncardiac surgery. 165,166 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacological stress testing with DSE,  dipyridamole/ adenosine/regadenoson MPI with thallium-201, and/or technetium-99m and rubidium-82 can be used in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who cannot perform exercise to detect stress-induced myocardial ischemia and CAD. At the time of GWC deliberations, publications in this area confirmed findings of previous studies rather than providing new insight as to the optimal noninvasive pharmacological preoperative stress testing strategy. †

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the lack of RCTs on the use of preoperative stress testing, a large number of single-site studies using either DSE or MPI have shown consistent findings. These findings can be summarized as follows:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The presence of moderate to large areas of myocardial ischemia is associated with increased risk of perioperative MI and/or death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 A  normal  study  for  perioperative  MI  and/or  cardiac death has a very high negative predictive value.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The presence of an old MI identified on rest imaging is of little predictive value for perioperative MI or cardiac death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Several meta-analyses have shown the clinical utility of pharmacological stress testing in the preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In terms of which pharmacological test to use, there are no RCTs comparing DSE with pharmacological MPI perioperatively. A retrospective meta-analysis comparing MPI (thallium imaging) and stress echocardiography in patients scheduled for  elective  noncardiac  surgery  showed  that  a  moderate  to large  defect  (present  in  14%  of  the  population)  detected  by either  method  predicted  postoperative  cardiac  events.  The authors identified a slight superiority of stress echocardiography  relative  to  nongated  MPI  with  thallium  in  predicting postoperative cardiac events. 204 However, in light of the lack of RCT data, local expertise in performing pharmacological stress testing should be considered in decisions about which pharmacological stress test to use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  recommendations  in  this  CPG  do  not  specifically address the preoperative evaluation of patients for kidney or liver transplantation because the indications for stress testing may reflect both perioperative and long-term outcomes in this population. The reader is directed to the AHA/ACC scientific statement titled 'Cardiac disease evaluation and management among kidney and liver transplantation candidates' for further recommendations. 31

5.5.2. Radionuclide MPI

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The role of MPI in preoperative risk assessment in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery has been evaluated in several studies. ‡ The majority of MPI studies show that moderate to large  reversible  perfusion  defects,  which  reflect  myocardial ischemia, carry the greatest risk of perioperative cardiac death or  MI.  In  general,  an  abnormal  MPI  test  is  associated  with very high sensitivity for detecting patients at risk for perioperative cardiac events. The negative predictive value of a normal MPI study is high for MI or cardiac death, although postoperative cardiac events do occur in this population. 204  Most studies  have  shown that a fixed perfusion defect, which reflects infarcted  myocardium,  has  a  low  positive  predictive  value for perioperative cardiac events. However, patients with fixed defects have shown increased risk for long-term events relative to patients with a normal MPI test, which likely reflects

5.5.3. Dobutamine Stress Echocardiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  role  of  DSE  in  preoperative  risk  assessment  in  patients undergoing noncardiac surgery has been evaluated in several studies. 186,187,207-220 The  definition  of  an  abnormal  stress  echocardiogram in some studies was restricted to the presence of new wall motion abnormalities with stress, indicative of myocardial ischemia, but in others also included the presence of akinetic segments at baseline, indicative of MI. These studies have predominantly evaluated the role of DSE in patients with an increased  perioperative  cardiovascular  risk,  particularly  those undergoing abdominal aortic or peripheral vascular surgery. In many studies, the results of the DSE were available to the managing clinicians and surgeons, which influenced perioperative management, including the preoperative use of diagnostic coronary  angiography  and  coronary  revascularization,  and  which intensified medical management, including beta blockade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall, the data suggest that DSE appears safe and feasible as part of a preoperative assessment. Safety and feasibility have been demonstrated specifically in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, peripheral vascular disease, morbid obesity, and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-populations in which there had previously been safety concerns. 186,187,213,214,220-222 Overall, a positive test result for DSE was reported in the range of 5% to 50%. In these studies, with event rates of 0% to 15%, the ability of a positive test result to predict an event (nonfatal  MI  or  death)  ranged  from  0%  to  37%. The  negative  predictive value is invariably high, typically in the range of 90% to  100%.  In  interpreting  these  values,  one  must  consider  the overall  perioperative  risk  of  the  population  and  the  potential results stress imaging had on patient management. Several large studies reporting the value of DSE in the prediction of cardiac events during noncardiac surgery for which Poldermans was the senior author are not included in the corresponding data supplement table 223-225 ;  however, regardless of whether the evidence includes these studies, conclusions are similar.

5.6. Stress Testing-Special Situations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  most  ambulatory  patients,  exercise  electrocardiographic testing can provide both an estimate of functional capacity and detection of myocardial ischemia through changes in the electrocardiographic and hemodynamic response. In many settings, an exercise stress ECG is combined with either echocardiography or MPI. In the perioperative period, most patients undergo pharmacological stress testing with either MPI or DSE.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients undergoing stress testing with abnormalities on their resting ECG that impair diagnostic interpretation (eg, left bundle-branch  block,  LV  hypertrophy  with  'strain'  pattern, digitalis effect), concomitant stress imaging with echocardiography or MPI may be an appropriate alternative. In patients with left bundle-branch block, exercise MPI has an unacceptably low specificity because of septal perfusion defects that are not related to CAD. For these patients, pharmacological stress MPI, particularly with adenosine, dipyridamole, or regadenoson, is suggested over exercise stress imaging.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with indications for stress testing who are unable to perform adequate exercise, pharmacological stress testing with either DSE or MPI may be appropriate. There are insufficient data to support the use of dobutamine stress magnetic resonance imaging in preoperative risk assessment. 221

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous dipyridamole and adenosine should be avoided in patients with significant heart block, bronchospasm, critical carotid occlusive disease, or a condition that prevents their being  withdrawn  from  theophylline  preparations  or  other adenosine  antagonists;  regadenoson  has  a  more  favorable side-effect  profile  and  appears  safe  for  use  in  patients  with bronchospasm.  Dobutamine  should  be  avoided  in  patients with  serious  arrhythmias  or  severe  hypertension.  All  stress agents should be avoided in unstable patients. In patients in whom  echocardiographic  image  quality  is  inadequate  for wall  motion  assessment,  such  as  those  with  morbid  obesity or severe chronic obstructive lung disease, intravenous echocardiography  contrast 187,222 or  alternative  methods,  such  as MPI, may be appropriate. An echocardiographic stress test is favored if  an  assessment  of  valvular  function  or  pulmonary hypertension is clinically important. In many instances, either exercise stress echocardiography/DSE or MPI may be appropriate, and local expertise may help dictate the choice of test.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At  the  time  of  publication,  evidence  did  not  support  the use of an ambulatory ECG as the only diagnostic test to refer patients for coronary angiography, but it may be appropriate in rare circumstances to direct medical therapy.

1. Routine  preoperative  coronary  angiography  is  not recommended. (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Data are insufficient to recommend the use of coronary angiography in all patients (ie, routine testing), including for those patients undergoing any specific elevated-risk surgery. In general,  indications  for  preoperative  coronary  angiography  are similar  to  those  identified  for  the  nonoperative  setting.  The decreased  risk  of  coronary  computerized  tomography  angiography compared with invasive angiography may encourage its  use  to  determine  preoperatively  the  presence  and  extent of CAD. However, any additive value in decision making of coronary  computed  tomography  angiography  and  calcium scoring is uncertain, given that data are limited and involve patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. 226

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  recommendations  in  this  CPG  do  not  specifically address the preoperative evaluation of patients for kidney or liver transplantation because the indications for angiography may be different.

6.1. Coronary Revascularization Before Noncardiac Surgery: Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class I

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Revascularization before noncardiac surgery is recommended  in  circumstances  in  which  revascularization  is  indicated  according  to  existing  CPGs. 25,26 ( Level of Evidence: C ) (See Table A in Appendix 3 for related recommendations.)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class III: No Benefit

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is not recommended that routine coronary revascularization be performed before noncardiac surgery exclusively to reduce perioperative cardiac events. 116 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients undergoing risk stratification before elective noncardiac  procedures  and  whose  evaluation  recommends  CABG surgery should undergo coronary revascularization before an elevated-risk  surgical  procedure. 227 The  cumulative  mortality  and  morbidity  risks  of  both  the  coronary  revascularization procedure and the noncardiac surgery should be weighed carefully  in  light  of  the  individual  patient's  overall  health, functional status, and prognosis. The indications for preoperative surgical coronary revascularization are identical to those recommended  in  the  2011  CABG  CPG  and  the  2011  PCI CPG and the accumulated data on which those conclusions were  based 25,26 (See  Table A  in Appendix  3  for  the  related recommendations).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The role of preoperative PCI in reducing untoward perioperative cardiac complications is uncertain given the available data.  Performing  PCI  before  noncardiac  surgery  should  be limited  to  1)  patients  with  left  main  disease  whose  comorbidities  preclude  bypass  surgery  without  undue  risk  and  2) patients with unstable CAD who would be appropriate candidates for emergency or urgent revascularization. 25,26 Patients with  ST-elevation  MI  or  non-ST-elevation  acute  coronary syndrome benefit from early invasive management. 26  In such patients, in whom noncardiac surgery is time sensitive despite an  increased  risk  in  the  perioperative  period,  a  strategy  of balloon angioplasty or bare-metal stent (BMS) implantation should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are no prospective RCTs supporting coronary revascularization, either CABG or PCI, before noncardiac surgery to decrease intraoperative and postoperative cardiac events. In the  largest  RCT,  CARP (Coronary Artery Revascularization Prophylaxis), there were no differences in perioperative and long-term  cardiac  outcomes  with  or  without  preoperative coronary revascularization by CABG or PCI in patients with documented CAD, with the exclusion of those with left main disease, a LVEF <20%, and severe AS. 116  A follow-up analysis reported improved outcomes in the subset who underwent CABG  compared  with  those  who  underwent  PCI. 228   In  an additional analysis of the database of patients who underwent coronary  angiography  in  both  the  randomized  and  nonrandomized portion of the CARP trial, only the subset of patients with unprotected left main disease showed a benefit from preoperative coronary artery revascularization. 229  A second RCT also  demonstrated  no  benefit  from  preoperative  testing  and directed coronary revascularization in patients with 1 to 2 risk factors for CAD, 230 but the conduct of the trial was questioned at the time of the GWC's discussions. 9

Class III: Harm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elective  noncardiac  surgery  should  not  be  performed within  30  days  after  BMS  implantation  or  within  12 months  after  DES  implantation  in  patients  in  whom dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) will need to be discontinued perioperatively. 231-237,239 (Level of Evidence: B)

Elective noncardiac surgery should not be performed within 14 days of balloon angioplasty in patients in whom aspirin will need to be discontinued perioperatively. (Level of Evidence: C)

Patients who require both PCI and noncardiac surgery merit special consideration. PCI should not be performed as a prerequisite in patients who need noncardiac surgery unless it is clearly indicated for high-risk coronary anatomy (eg, left main disease), unstable angina, MI, or life-threatening arrhythmias due to active ischemia amenable to PCI. If PCI is necessary, then  the  urgency  of  the  noncardiac  surgery  and  the  risk  of bleeding  and  ischemic  events,  including  stent  thrombosis, associated with the surgery in a patient taking DAPT need to

be considered (see Section 6.2.6 for more information on antiplatelet management). If there is little risk of bleeding or if the noncardiac surgery can be delayed ≥ 12 months, then PCI with DES and prolonged aspirin and P2Y 12 platelet receptor-inhibitor  therapy  is  an  option.  Some  data  suggest  that  in  newergeneration DESs, the risk of stent thrombosis is stabilized by 6 months after DES implantation and that noncardiac surgery after 6 months may be possible without increased risk. 234,238 If the elective noncardiac surgery is likely to occur within 1 to 12 months, then a strategy of BMS and 4 to 6 weeks of aspirin and P2Y 12 platelet receptor-inhibitor therapy with continuation of aspirin perioperatively may be an appropriate option. Although the risk of restenosis is higher with BMS than with DES, restenotic lesions are usually not life threatening, even though they may present as an acute coronary syndrome, and they can usually be dealt with by repeat PCI if necessary. If the noncardiac surgery is time sensitive (within 2 to 6 weeks) or the risk of bleeding is high, then consideration should be given to balloon angioplasty with provisional BMS implantation. If the noncardiac surgery is urgent or an emergency, then the risks of ischemia and bleeding, and the long-term benefit of  coronary  revascularization  must  be  weighed.  If  coronary revascularization  is  absolutely  necessary,  CABG  combined with the noncardiac surgery may be considered.

6.2.1. Perioperative Beta-Blocker Therapy: Recommendations

See  the  ERC  systematic  review  report,  'Perioperative  beta blockade in noncardiac surgery: a systematic review for the 2014  ACC/AHA  guideline  on  perioperative  cardiovascular evaluation and management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery'  for  the  complete  evidence  review  on  perioperative beta-blocker  therapy, 8 and  see  Online  Data  Supplement  19 for more information about beta blockers. The tables in Data Supplement 19 were reproduced directly from the ERC's systematic review for your convenience. These recommendations have been designated with an  SR to emphasize the rigor of support from the ERC's systematic review.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As noted in the Scope of this CPG (Section 1.4), the recommendations  in  Section  6.2.1  are  based  on  a  separately commissioned review of the available evidence, the results of which were used to frame our decision making. Full details are provided in the ERC's systematic review report 8  and data supplements.  However,  3  key  findings  were  powerful  influences on this CPG's recommendations:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The systematic review suggests that preoperative use of beta blockers was associated with a reduction in cardiac events  in  the  studies  examined,  but  few  data  support the effectiveness of preoperative administration of beta blockers to reduce risk of surgical death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consistent  and  clear  associations  exist  between  betablocker  administration  and  adverse  outcomes,  such  as bradycardia and stroke.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
These findings were quite consistent even when the  DECREASE  studies 230,240   in  question  or  POISE (Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation Study) 241 were excluded. Stated alternatively, exclusion of these studies did not substantially affect estimates of risk or benefit.

when longitudinal treatment is provided according to GDMT, such as for MI, is recommended (See Table B in Appendix 3 for applicable recommendations from the 2011 secondary prevention  CPG). 249 Multiple  observational  studies  support  the  benefits of continuing beta blockers in patients who are undergoing surgery and who are on these agents for longitudinal indications. 242-248 However, these studies vary in their robustness in terms of their ability to deal with confounding due to the indications for beta blockade or ability to discern whether the reasons for  discontinuation  are  in  themselves  associated  with  higher risk  (independent of beta-blocker discontinuation), which led to the Level of Evidence B determination. This recommendation is consistent with the Surgical Care Improvement Project National Measures (CARD-2) as of November 2013. 250

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is reasonable for the management of beta blockers after surgery to be guided by clinical circumstances, independent  of  when  the  agent  was  started. 241,248,251 (Level of Evidence: B) SR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This recommendation requires active management of patients on beta blockers during and after surgery. Particular attention should be paid to the need to modify or temporarily discontinue beta blockers as clinical circumstances (eg, hypotension, bradycardia, 252 bleeding) 251 dictate.  Although  clinical  judgment will remain a mainstay of this approach, evidence suggests that implementation of and adherence to local practice guidelines can play a role in achieving this recommendation. 253

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIb

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with intermediate- or high-risk myocardial ischemia noted in preoperative risk stratification tests,  it  may  be  reasonable  to  begin  perioperative beta blockers. 225 (Level of Evidence: C) SR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The risks and benefits of perioperative beta blocker use appear to be favorable in patients who have intermediate- or high-risk myocardial  ischemia  noted  on  preoperative  stress  testing. 225,254 The decision to begin beta blockers should be influenced by whether a patient is at risk for stroke 46,255,256 and whether the patient has other relative contraindications (such as uncompensated HF).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIb

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with 3 or more RCRI risk factors (eg, diabetes mellitus, HF, CAD, renal insufficiency, cerebrovascular accident), it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery. 248 (Level of Evidence: B) SR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Observational data suggest that patients appear to benefit from use of beta blockers in the perioperative setting if they have ≥ 3 RCRI risk factors. In the absence of multiple risk factors, it is unclear whether preoperative administration is safe or effective; again, it is important to gauge the risk related to perioperative stroke or contraindications in choosing to begin beta blockers.

Class IIb

In  patients  with  a  compelling  long-term  indication for  beta-blocker  therapy  but  no  other  RCRI  risk factors, initiating beta blockers in the perioperative

setting as an approach to reduce perioperative risk is of uncertain benefit. 242,248,257 (Level of Evidence: B) SR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although beta blockers improve long-term outcomes when used in patients according to GDMT, it is unclear whether beginning beta  blockers  before  surgery  is  efficacious  or  safe  if  a  longterm indication is not accompanied by additional RCRI criteria. Rather, a preferable approach might be to ensure beta blockers are initiated as soon as feasible after the surgical procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIb

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients in whom beta-blocker therapy is initiated, it  may  be  reasonable  to  begin  perioperative  beta blockers long enough in advance to assess safety and tolerability, preferably more than 1 day before surgery. 241,258-260 (Level of Evidence: B) SR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  may be reasonable to begin beta blockers long enough in advance of the operative date that clinical effectiveness and tolerability can be assessed. 241,258-260

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Beginning beta blockers ≤ 1 day before surgery is at a minimum ineffective and may in fact be harmful. 8,241,248,261 Starting the medication 2 to 7 days before surgery may be preferred, but few data support the need to start beta blockers >30 days beforehand. 258-260 It is important to note that even in studies that included preoperative dose titration as an element of their algorithm, patients' drug doses rarely changed after an initial dose was chosen. 254,262 In addition, the data supporting 'tight' heart rate control is weak, 262 suggesting that clinical assessments for tolerability are a key element of preoperative strategies. 258-260

The GWC specifically recommends against starting beta blockers on the day of surgery in beta-blocker-naïve patients, 241 particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and if there no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

6.2.1.1. Evidence on Efficacy of Beta-Blocker Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial interest in using beta blockers to prevent postoperative cardiac complications was supported by a small number of RCTs and reviews. 225,254,263,264  Perioperative beta blockade was quickly adopted because the potential benefit of perioperative beta blockers was large 265 in the absence of other therapies, initial RCTs did not suggest adverse effects, and the effects of beta blockers in surgical patients were consistent with effects in patients with MI (eg, reducing mortality rate from coronary ischemia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
However,  these  initial  data  were  derived  primarily  from small trials, with minimum power, of highly screened patient populations undergoing specific procedures (eg, vascular surgery)  and  using  agents  (eg,  intravenous  atenolol,  oral  bisoprolol) not widely available in the United States. Limitations of  initial  studies  provided  the  rationale  for  studies  that  followed, 241,266   of  which 3 showed no cardiac outcome or mortality difference between beta-blocker-treated and -untreated patients. 257,267,268 Additional  information  was  provided  by  a meta-analysis of all published studies that suggested potential

harm as well as a lower protective effect 269 ;  a  robust  observational study also suggested an association between use of beta blockers in low-risk patients and higher surgical mortality rate. 242

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Publication of POISE, a multicenter study of adequate size and scope to address sample size, generalizability, and limitations  of  previous  studies,  added  further  complexity  to  the evidence base by suggesting that use of beta blockers reduced risks for cardiac events (eg, ischemia, AF, need for coronary interventions)  but  produced  a  higher  overall  risk-largely related to stroke and higher rate of death resulting from noncardiac complications. 241  However, POISE was criticized for its use of a high dose of long-acting beta blocker and for initiation of the dose immediately before noncardiac surgery. In fact, a lower starting dose was used in the 3 studies that saw both no harm and no benefit. 257,267,270  Moreover, POISE did not include a titration protocol before or after surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The evidence to this point was summarized in a series of meta-analyses suggesting a mixed picture of the safety and efficacy of beta blockers in the perioperative setting. 269,271-273 These evidence summaries were relatively consistent in showing that use of perioperative beta blockers could reduce perioperative cardiac risk but that they had significant deleterious associations with bradycardia, stroke, and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adding further complexity to the perioperative beta-blocker picture, concern was expressed by Erasmus University about the  scientific  integrity  of  studies  led  by  Poldermans 9 ; see Section 1.4 for further discussion. For transparency, we included the nonretracted publications in the text of this document if they were relevant to the topic. However, the nonretracted publications were not used as evidence to support the recommendations and were not included in the corresponding data supplement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
6.2.1.2. Titration of Beta Blockers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are limited trial data on whether or how to titrate beta blockers in the perioperative setting or whether this approach is more efficacious than fixed-dose regimens. Although several studies 254,263 included dose titration to heart rate goal in their protocol, and separate studies suggested that titration is important to achieving appropriate anti-ischemic effects, 274 it appears that many patients in the original trials remained on their starting medication dose at the time of surgery, even if on a research protocol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Studies that titrated beta blockers, many of which are now under question, also tended to begin therapy >1 day before surgery, making it difficult to discern whether dose titration or preoperative timing was more important to producing any potential benefits of beta blockade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  studies  have  evaluated  the  intraclass  differences in beta blockers (according to duration of action and beta-1 selectivity), 261,275-278 but few comparative trials exist at the time of publication, and it is difficult to make broad recommendations on the basis of evidence available at this time. Moreover, some intraclass differences may be influenced more by differences  in  beta-adrenoceptor  type  than  by  the  medication itself. 279 However,  data  from  POISE  suggest  that  initiating long-acting beta blockers on the day of surgery may not be a preferable approach.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
6.2.1.3. Withdrawal of Beta Blockers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although few studies describe risks of withdrawing beta blockers in the perioperative time period, 243,246  longstanding evidence from other settings suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term beta blockers is harmful, 280-282 providing the major rationale for the ACC/AHA Class I recommendation. There are fewer data to describe whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative use of beta blockers, followed by rapid discontinuation, is harmful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
6.2.1.4. Risks and Caveats

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The evidence for perioperative beta blockers-even excluding the DECREASE studies under question and POISE-supports the idea that their use can reduce perioperative cardiac events. However,  this  benefit  is  offset  by  a  higher  relative  risk  for perioperative strokes and uncertain mortality benefit or risk. 242,248,254   Moreover, the time horizon for benefit in some cases may be farther in the future than the time horizon for adverse effects of the drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In practice, the risk-benefit analysis of perioperative beta blockers  should  also  take  into  account  the  frequency  and severity  of  the  events  the  therapy  may  prevent  or  produce. That is, although stroke is a highly morbid condition, it tends to be far less common than MACE. There may be situations in which the risk of perioperative stroke is lower, but the concern for cardiac events is elevated; in these situations, beta blocker use may have benefit, though little direct evidence exists to guide clinical decision making in specific scenarios.

Lipid lowering with statin agents is highly effective for primary  and  secondary  prevention  of  cardiac  events. 288 Data from statin trials are now robust enough to allow the GWC to  directly  answer  the  critical  questions  of  what  works  and in  whom without estimating  cardiovascular  risk. The  effectiveness  of  this  class  of  agents  in  reducing  cardiovascular  events  in  high-risk  patients  has  suggested  that  they  may improve  perioperative  cardiovascular  outcomes. A  placebocontrolled randomized trial followed patients on atorvastatin for 6 months (50 patients on atorvastatin and 50 patients on placebo)  who  were  undergoing  vascular  surgery  and  found a significant decrease in MACE in the treated group. 287  In a Cochrane analysis, pooled results from 3 studies, with a total of 178 participants, were evaluated. 289 In the statin group, 7 of

105 (6.7%) participants died within 30 days of surgery, as did 10 of 73 (13.7%) participants in the control group. However, all deaths occurred in a single study population, and estimates were  therefore  derived  from  only  1  study.  Two  additional RCTs from Poldermans also evaluated the efficacy of fluvastatin  compared  with  placebo  and  demonstrated  a  significant reduction in MACE in patients at high risk, with a trend toward improvement in patients at intermediate risk. 240,290

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most of the data  on  the  impact  of  statin  use  in  the  perioperative period come from observational trials. The largest observational  trial  used  data  from  hospital  administrative databases. 283  Patients who received statins had a lower crude mortality  rate  and  a  lower  mortality  rate  when  propensity matched. An administrative database from 4 Canadian provinces was used to evaluate the relationship between statin use and outcomes in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid disease 284 ; this study found an inverse correlation between statin use and in-hospital mortality, stroke or death, or cardiovascular outcomes. A retrospective cohort of  752  patients  undergoing  intermediate-risk,  noncardiac, nonvascular  surgery  was  evaluated  for  all-cause  mortality rate. 285 Compared  with  nonusers,  patients  on  statin  therapy had a 5-fold reduced risk of 30-day all-cause death. Another observational trial of 577 patients revealed that patients undergoing noncardiac vascular surgery treated with statins had a 57%  lower  chance  of  having  perioperative  MI  or  death  at 2-year follow-up, after controlling for other variables. 286

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  accumulated  evidence  to  date  suggests  a  protective effect  of  perioperative  statin  use  on  cardiac  complications during noncardiac surgery. RCTs are limited in patient numbers and types of noncardiac surgery. The time of initiation of statin therapy and the duration of therapy are often unclear in the observational trials. The mechanism of benefit of statin therapy  prescribed  perioperatively  to  lower  cardiac  events is  unclear and may be related to pleiotropic as well as cholesterol-lowering effects. In patients meeting indications for statin therapy, starting statin therapy perioperatively may also be an opportunity to impact long-term health. 288

Several studies examined the role of alpha-agonists (clonidine and mivazerol) for perioperative cardiac protection. 291,293,294,296

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In a meta-analysis of perioperative alpha-2 agonist administration  through  2008,  comprising  31  trials  enrolling  4578 patients, alpha-2 agonists overall reduced death and myocardial  ischemia. 295 The  most  notable  effects  were  with  vascular surgery. Importantly, sudden discontinuation of long-term alpha-agonist treatment can result in hypertension, headache, agitation, and tremor.

A  2004  prospective, double-blinded, clinical trial on patients with or at risk for CAD investigated whether prophylactic  clonidine  reduced  perioperative  myocardial  ischemia and  long-term  death  in  patients  undergoing  noncardiac  surgery. 297 Patients  were  randomized  to  clonidine  (n=125)  or placebo (n=65). Prophylactic clonidine administered perioperatively  significantly  reduced  myocardial  ischemia  during the  intraoperative  and  postoperative  period  (clonidine:  18 of 125 patients or 14%; placebo: 20 of 65 patients or 31%; P =0.01). Moreover, administration of clonidine had minimal hemodynamic effects and reduced the postoperative mortality rate for up to 2 years (clonidine: 19 of 125 patients or 15%; placebo: 19 of 65 patients or 29%; relative risk: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.89; P =0.035).

POISE-2  enrolled  patients  in  a  large  multicenter,  international,  blinded,  2  ×  2  factorial  RCT  of  acetyl-salicylic acid  and  clonidine. 298 The  primary  objective  was  to  determine  the  impact  of  clonidine  compared  with  placebo  and acetyl-salicylic acid compared with placebo on the 30-day risk of all-cause death or nonfatal MI in patients with or at risk of atherosclerotic disease who were undergoing noncardiac  surgery.  Patients  in  the  POISE-2  trial  were  randomly assigned  to  1  of  4  groups:  acetyl-salicylic  acid  and  clonidine  together,  acetyl-salicylic  acid  and  clonidine  placebo, an acetyl-salicylic acid placebo and clonidine, or an acetylsalicylic  acid  placebo  and  a  clonidine  placebo.  Clonidine did not reduce the rate of death or nonfatal MI. Clonidine did increase the rate of nonfatal cardiac arrest and clinically important hypotension.

6.2.4. Perioperative Calcium Channel Blockers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A 2003 meta-analysis of perioperative calcium channel blockers in noncardiac surgery identified 11 studies involving 1007 patients. 299 Calcium  channel  blockers  significantly  reduced ischemia (relative risk: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.80; P =0.004) and  supraventricular  tachycardia  (relative  risk:  0.52;  95% CI: 0.37 to 0.72; P <0.0001). Calcium channel blockers were associated with trends toward reduced death and MI. In post hoc analyses, calcium channel blockers significantly reduced death/MI (relative risk: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.86; P =0.02). The majority of these benefits were attributable to diltiazem. Dihydropyridines  and  verapamil  did  not  decrease  the  incidence of myocardial ischemia, although verapamil decreased the  incidence  of  supraventricular  tachycardia. A  large-scale trial is needed to define the value of these agents. Of note, calcium blockers with substantial negative inotropic effects, such as diltiazem and verapamil, may precipitate or worsen HF in patients with depressed EF and clinical HF.

ACE inhibitors are among the most prescribed drugs in the United States, but data on their potential risk and benefit in the  perioperative  setting  are  limited  to  observational  analysis.  One  large  retrospective  study  evaluated  79  228  patients (9905 patients on ACE inhibitors [13%] and 66 620 patients not on ACE inhibitors [87%]) who had noncardiac surgery. 300 Among  a  matched,  nested  cohort  in  this  study,  intraoperative ACE inhibitor users had more frequent transient intraoperative  hypotension  but  no  difference  in  other  outcomes. A meta-analysis of available trials similarly demonstrated hypotension in 50% of patients taking ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the day of surgery but no change in important cardiovascular outcomes (ie, death, MI, stroke, kidney failure). 301  One study evaluated the benefits of the addition of aspirin to beta blockers and statins, with or without ACE inhibitors, for postoperative outcome in high-risk consecutive patients undergoing major vascular  surgery. 302 The  combination  of  aspirin,  beta  blockers, and statin therapy was associated with better 30-day and 12-month risk reduction for MI, stroke, and death than any of the 3 medications independently. The addition of an ACE inhibitor to the 3 medications did not demonstrate additional risk-reduction benefits. There is similarly limited evidence on the impact of discontinuing ACE inhibitors before noncardiac surgery. 303,304 In these and other small trials, no harm was demonstrated with holding ACE inhibitors and ARBs before surgery, 303,304 but all studies were underpowered and did not target any particular clinical group. Consequently, there are few data to  direct  clinicians  about  whether  specific  surgery  types  or patient subgroups are most likely to benefit from holding ACE inhibitors in the perioperative time period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although there is similarly sparse evidence to support the degree of harm represented by inappropriate discontinuation of ACE inhibitors after surgery (eg, ACE inhibitors held but not restarted), there is reasonable evidence from nonsurgical settings  to  support  worse  outcomes  in  patients  whose ACE inhibitors are discontinued inappropriately. Maintaining continuity  of ACE inhibitors in the setting of treatment for HF or  hypertension  is  supported  by  CPGs. 16,305 Data  describing harms of ARBs are sparse, but treating such drugs as equivalent to ACE inhibitors is reasonable.

In  patients  who  have  received  coronary  stents  and must undergo surgical procedures that mandate the discontinuation  of  P2Y 12 platelet  receptor-inhibitor therapy, it is recommended that aspirin be continued if  possible and the P2Y 12 platelet receptor-inhibitor be restarted as soon as possible after surgery.

In patients undergoing nonemergency/nonurgent noncardiac  surgery  who  have  not  had  previous coronary stenting, it may be reasonable to continue aspirin when the risk of potential increased cardiac events outweighs the risk of increased bleeding. 298,306 (Level of Evidence: B)

Initiation or continuation of aspirin is not beneficial in  patients  undergoing  elective  noncardiac  noncarotid  surgery  who  have  not  had  previous  coronary stenting 298 (Level of Evidence: B) ,  unless  the  risk  of ischemic events outweighs the risk of surgical bleeding. (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The risk of stent  thrombosis  in  the  perioperative  period  for both BMS and DES is highest in the first 4 to 6 weeks after stent implantation. 231-239,307-309  Discontinuation of DAPT, particularly in this early period, is a strong risk factor for stent thrombosis. 310,311   Should  urgent  or  emergency  noncardiac surgery be required, a decision to continue aspirin or DAPT should  be  individualized,  with  the  risk  weighed  against  the benefits of continuing therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The risk of DES thrombosis during noncardiac surgery more than 4 to 6 weeks after stent implantation is low but is higher than in the absence of surgery, although the relative increased risk varies from study to study. This risk decreases with time and may be at a stable level by 6 months after DES implantation. 234,238  The value of continuing aspirin alone or DAPT to prevent stent thrombosis or other ischemic events during noncardiac surgery is uncertain given the lack of prospective trials. The risk of bleeding is likely higher with DAPT than with aspirin alone or no antiplatelet therapy, but the magnitude of the increase is uncertain. 231,232,307-309,312  As such, use of DAPT or aspirin alone should be individualized on the basis of the considered potential benefits and risks, albeit in the absence of secure data. An algorithm for DAPT use based on expert opinion is suggested in Figure 2. There is no convincing evidence that warfarin, antithrombotics, cangrelor, or glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa agents will reduce the risk of stent thrombosis after discontinuation of oral antiplatelet agents.

The  value  of  aspirin  in  nonstented  patients  in  preventing ischemic complications is uncertain. Observational data suggest  that  preoperative  withdrawal  of  aspirin  increases thrombotic complications 306 ; the PEP (Pulmonary Embolism Prevention) trial, which randomized 13 356 patients undergoing hip surgery to 160 mg aspirin or placebo, did not show benefit  of  aspirin. 313 The  POISE-2  trial  randomized  10 010 patients who were undergoing noncardiac surgery and were at risk for vascular complications to aspirin 200 mg or placebo. Aspirin did not have a protective effect for MACE or death in patients either continuing aspirin or starting aspirin

during the perioperative period. 298  Aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. In the POISE-2 trial, aspirin was stopped at least 3 days (but usually 7 days) preoperatively. Patients within 6 weeks of placement of a BMS or within 1 year of placement of a DES were excluded from the trial, and the number of stented patients outside these time intervals  was  too  small  to  make  firm  conclusions  as  to  the risk-benefit ratio. Additionally, only 23% of the study population  had  known  prior  CAD,  and  the  population  excluded patients  undergoing  carotid  endarterectomy  surgery.  Thus, continuation  may  still  be  reasonable  in  patients  with  highrisk  CAD  or  cerebrovascular  disease,  where  the  risks  of potential increased cardiovascular events outweigh the risks of increased bleeding.

Use of therapeutic or full-dose anticoagulants (as opposed to the  lower-dose  anticoagulation  often  used  for  prevention  of deep venous thrombosis) is generally discouraged because of their harmful effect on the ability to control and contain surgical blood loss.

the antiplatelet agents addressed in Section 6.2.6. Factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors are examples of alternative  anticoagulants  now  available  for  oral  administration. Vitamin  K  antagonists  (warfarin)  are  prescribed  for  stroke prevention in patients with AF, for prevention of thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with prosthetic valves, and in patients requiring deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis  and  treatment.  Factor  Xa  inhibitors  are  prescribed for prevention of stroke in the management of AF. Factor Xa inhibitors are not recommended for long-term anticoagulation of prosthetic valves because of an increased risk of thrombosis when compared with warfarin. The role of anticoagulants other than platelet inhibitors in the secondary prevention of myocardial ischemia or MI has not been elucidated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The risks of bleeding for any surgical procedure must be weighed against the benefit of remaining on anticoagulants on a case-by-case basis. In some instances in which there is minimal to no risk of bleeding, such as cataract surgery or minor dermatologic procedures, it may be reasonable to continue  anticoagulation  perioperatively.  Two  published  CPGs address  the  management  of  perioperative  anticoagulation in  patients  with  prosthetic  valves  and  patients  with AF. 14,15 Although research with newer agents (eg, prothrombin complex  concentrates  for  reversal  of  direct  factor  Xa  inhibitor effect)  is  ongoing,  the  novel  oral  anticoagulant  agents  do not appear to be acutely reversible. Patients with prosthetic valves  taking  vitamin  K  antagonists  may  require  bridging therapy with either unfractionated heparin or low-molecularweight heparin, depending on the location of the prosthetic valve and associated risk factors for thrombotic and thromboembolic events. For patients with a mechanical mitral valve, regardless of the absence of additional risk factors for thromboembolism, or patients  with  an  aortic  valve  and ≥ 1  additional  risk  factor  (such  as AF,  previous  thromboembolism, LV  dysfunction,  hypercoagulable  condition,  or  an  oldergeneration prosthetic aortic valve), bridging anticoagulation may be appropriate when interruption of anticoagulation for perioperative  procedures  is  required  and  control  of  hemostasis is essential. 15 For patients requiring urgent reversal of vitamin  K  antagonists,  vitamin  K  and  fresh  frozen  plasma or the newer prothrombin complex concentrates are options; however, vitamin K is not routinely recommended for reversal because the effect is not immediate and the administration of vitamin K can significantly delay the return to a therapeutic level of anticoagulation once vitamin K antagonists have been restarted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor Xa inhibitors do not have a reversible agent available at this time. For patients with AF and normal renal function undergoing elective procedures during which hemostatic control  is  essential,  such  as  major  surgery,  spine  surgery, and  epidural  catheterization,  discontinuation  of  anticoagulants for ≥ 48 hours is suggested. Monitoring activated partial thromboplastin time for dabigatran and prothrombin time for apixaban and rivaroxaban may be helpful; a level consistent with control levels suggests a low serum concentration of the anticoagulant. 14

There  have  been  no  studies  on  the  benefit  of  anticoagulants on the prevention of perioperative myocardial ischemia or MI.

6.3. Management of Postoperative Arrhythmias and Conduction Disorders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AF and atrial flutter are the most common sustained arrhythmias  that  occur  in  the  postoperative  setting.  However,  clinicians  must  differentiate  between  atrial  flutter,  which  is common in the postoperative setting (especially with underlying structural heart disease), and other supraventricular tachycardias that may respond to vagal maneuvers or nodal agents. The incidence of postoperative AF after noncardiac surgery varies widely in the literature, ranging from 0.37% in 1 large population-based study in noncardiothoracic surgery to 30% after major noncardiac thoracic surgery, such as esophagectomy and pneumonectomy. 314-324  Peak incidence occurs 1 to 3 days postoperatively and is positively correlated with patient age, preoperative heart rate, and male sex. 315,317,322,325  Treatment of postoperative AF is similar to that for other forms of newonset AF, except that the potential benefit of anticoagulation needs to be balanced against the risk of postoperative bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular  rate  control  in  the  acute  setting  is  generally accomplished with beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium  channel  blockers  (ie,  diltiazem  or  verapamil),  with digoxin reserved for patients with systolic HF or with contraindications or inadequate response to other agents. Of note, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers with substantial negative  inotropic  effects,  such  as  diltiazem  or  verapamil, may precipitate or worsen HF in patients with depressed EF or clinical HF. An additional benefit of beta blockers is that, compared  with  diltiazem,  they  may  accelerate  the  conversion  of  postoperative  supraventricular  arrhythmias  to  sinus rhythm. 326,327   Cardioversion  of  minimally  symptomatic  AF/ atrial  flutter  is  generally  not  required until correction of the underlying problems has occurred, which may lead to a return to normal sinus rhythm. Intravenous amiodarone may also be used to aid in restoring or maintaining sinus rhythm if its benefits outweigh the risk of hypotension and other side effects. As with patients outside the perioperative setting, cardioversion of postoperative AF should be performed when hemodynamic compromise is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whereas numerous studies have been performed for prophylaxis  of AF  in  the  setting  of  cardiac  surgery,  comparatively  few  data  exist  in  the  setting  of  noncardiac  surgery. One RCT of 130 patients undergoing lung resection surgery showed that perioperative amiodarone reduced the incidence of  postoperative  AF  and  reduced  length  of  stay  compared with  placebo. 328 However,  the  incidence  of  postoperative AF in the control group (32.3%) was higher than that seen in a large national database (12.6%). 321  Another RCT of 254 patients undergoing lung cancer surgery also showed a significant reduction in postoperative AF with amiodarone but no difference in length of stay or resource utilization. 329,330  An RCT of 80 patients undergoing esophagectomy also showed a reduction in postoperative AF but not in length of stay. 331 Recommendations for prophylaxis and management of postoperative AF after cardiac and thoracic surgery are provided in the 2014 AF CPG. 14

frequently  can  be  terminated  with  vagal  maneuvers  or  with intravenous medications (adenosine or verapamil). Most antiarrhythmic agents (especially beta blockers, calcium channel blockers,  and  class  IC  antiarrhythmic  agents)  can  be  used to  prevent  further  recurrences  in  the  postoperative  setting. Digoxin and calcium channel blockers should be avoided in the setting of pre-excited AF. The choice of individual agent will depend on the nature of the arrhythmia and whether the patient  has  associated  structural  heart  disease.  Recurrent supraventricular  tachycardia  is  generally  well  treated  with catheter ablation therapy. 92

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asymptomatic  premature  ventricular  contractions  generally  do  not  require  perioperative  therapy  or  further  evaluation. Very frequent ventricular ectopy or runs of nonsustained ventricular  tachycardia  may  require  antiarrhythmic  therapy if  they  are  symptomatic  or  result  in  hemodynamic  compromise. 332 Patients  with  new-onset  postoperative  complex ventricular ectopy, particularly polymorphic ventricular tachycardia,  should  be  evaluated  for  myocardial  ischemia, electrolyte abnormalities, or drug effects. Ventricular arrhythmias  may  respond  to  intravenous  beta  blockers,  lidocaine, procainamide, or amiodarone. Electrical cardioversion should be used for sustained supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias that cause hemodynamic compromise. Patients with ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of chronic cardiomyopathy or inherited arrhythmia syndromes despite GDMT should be evaluated for ICD therapy consistent with existing CPGs. 332-334

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradyarrhythmias that occur in the postoperative period are usually sinus bradycardia secondary to some other cause, such as  medication,  electrolyte  or  acid-base  disturbance,  hypoxemia, or ischemia. Pain can also heighten vagal tone, leading to  sinus  bradycardia  and  even  heart  block,  despite  baseline normal conduction. New atrioventricular block after noncardiac surgery is rare. Sleep apnea may manifest as nocturnal bradycardia in the postoperative setting. Acutely, bradycardia may respond to atropine or aminophylline. Persistent symptomatic bradyarrhythmias due to sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular block will respond to temporary transvenous pacing. Indications for permanent pacing are similar to those outside the perioperative setting. 333,335  Management of patients with  pre-existing  pacemakers  or  ICDs  is  focused  on  restoring preoperative settings for those patients who had preoperative reprogramming. It is particularly important to ensure that tachytherapy in patients with ICDs has been restored before discharge from the facility. 336

6.4. Perioperative Management of Patients With CIEDs: Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class I

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  ICDs  who  have  preoperative  reprogramming  to  inactivate tachytherapy should be on cardiac monitoring continuously during the entire period of inactivation, and  external defibrillation  equipment  should  be  readily  available. Systems should be in place to ensure that ICDs are

<!-- PAGE=? -->
reprogrammed to active therapy before discontinuation of cardiac monitoring and discharge from the facility. 336 (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To assist clinicians with the perioperative evaluation and management of patients with pacemakers and ICDs, the HRS and the American Society of Anesthesiologists together developed an expert consensus statement that was published in July 2011 and endorsed by the ACC and the AHA. 33  Clinicians caring for patients with CIEDs in the perioperative setting should be familiar with that document and the consensus recommendations contained within.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A central concern in perioperative management of patients with CIEDs is the potential for interaction between the CIED and EMI, usually produced by monopolar electrocautery. 337  If the procedure involves only bipolar electrocautery or harmonic scalpel  or  does  not  involve  electrocautery,  then  interaction with the CIED is extremely unlikely, unless energy is applied directly to the CIED generator or leads in the operative field. With monopolar electrocautery, the principal concern is that EMI may cause transient inhibition of pacing in pacemakerdependent patients (usually those with complete atrioventricular block) and/or inappropriate triggering of shocks in patients with  ICDs. With  technological  advances  in  CIED  hardware and filtering, the potential for more permanent adverse effects, such as electrical reset, inadvertent reprogramming, or damage to the CIED hardware or lead-tissue interface, has been largely eliminated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  advance  of  elective  surgical  procedures,  a  perioperative  CIED prescription should be developed by the clinician or team that follows the patient in the outpatient setting and communicated  to  the  surgical/procedure  team  (Section  2.6). Depending on the patient's underlying cardiac rhythm, the type of CIED (pacemaker versus ICD), the location of the operative procedure, and the potential for EMI from electrocautery, the CIED prescription may involve reprogramming a pacemaker or ICD to an asynchronous pacing mode (ie, VOO or DOO), reprogramming an ICD to inactivate tachytherapies, applying a magnet over the CIED, or no perioperative intervention. 98,99

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless  of  the  CIED  prescription,  through  advance communication with the CIED follow-up outpatient clinician/ team, the surgical/procedure team should be familiar with the type of CIED (pacemaker versus ICD), its manufacturer, the response of the CIED to magnet application, and the patient's underlying cardiac rhythm. External defibrillation equipment with transcutaneous pacing capability should be readily available  in  the  operating  room  for  patients  with  pacemakers  or ICDs who are having surgical procedures during which EMI or physical disruption to the CIED system could occur. It is reasonable  to  have  a  magnet  available  for  all  patients  with a  CIED who are undergoing a procedure that could involve EMI. All patients with CIEDs should have plethysmographic or arterial pressure monitoring during the procedure, because electrocautery may interfere with electrocardiographic recording and determination of the patient's cardiac rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  final  point  concerns  patients  with  ICDs  who  have tachytherapies  inactivated  preoperatively.  Such  patients  are intrinsically  more  susceptible  to  perioperative  ventricular arrhythmias and should have continuous cardiac monitoring

during  the  entire  period  of  ICD  inactivation,  with  external defibrillation immediately available, if needed. In addition, at least 3 deaths have been reported to have been caused by failure to reactivate ICD tachytherapies in patients who had ICD therapy inactivated preoperatively, and this problem is likely to be underreported. 336 It is therefore imperative that surgical services have systems in place to ensure that inactivated ICDs are reprogrammed to active therapy before discontinuation of cardiac monitoring and discharge from the facility.

See Table 7 for a summary of recommendations for anesthetic consideration and intraoperative management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.1. Choice of Anesthetic Technique and Agent

<!-- PAGE=? -->
See Online Data Supplement 27 for additional information on choice of anesthetic technique and agent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are 4 main classifications of anesthesia: local anesthesia, regional anesthesia (including peripheral nerve blockade and neuraxial blockade), monitored anesthesia care (typically using intravenous sedation with or without local anesthesia), and general anesthesia (which includes volatile-agent anesthesia, total intravenous anesthesia, or a combination of volatile and intravenous anesthesia). The majority of the literature in this  field  focuses  on  1  of  3  areas  with  regard  to  preventing perioperative myocardial adverse cardiac events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.1.1. Neuraxial Versus General Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients for whom neuraxial anesthesia (epidural or spinal anesthesia) is an option as the primary anesthetic or as a supplement to general anesthesia, several factors, such as the type of surgery, patient comorbidities, and patient preferences, are crucial in determining risk versus benefits. A 2011 Cochrane review meta-analysis of 4 studies examining neuraxial anesthesia versus general anesthesia for lower-limb revascularization found an overall 4% MI rate in both groups. 338  In 2001, an RCT of abdominal aortic surgery patients comparing a thoracic epidural/light general anesthesia technique with a general  anesthetic  technique  alone  demonstrated  no  significant difference in myocardial ischemia and MI rates between the groups. 339 Therefore, in patients who are eligible for an intraoperative neuraxial anesthetic, there is no evidence to suggest a cardioprotective benefit from the use or addition of neuraxial anesthesia for intraoperative anesthetic management. The evidence relating to neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia for postoperative pain control is discussed in Section 7.2.

undergoing  noncardiac  surgery,  and  the  choice  is determined by factors other than the prevention of myocardial ischemia and MI. 340,341 (Level of Evidence: A)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several studies have attempted to examine whether there is a myocardial protective benefit of volatile anesthetic use in general anesthesia when compared with total intravenous anesthesia. 342 There is no evidence to suggest a difference in myocardial ischemia/MI  rates  between  the  use  of  volatile  anesthesia  and total intravenous anesthesia in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Although the benefit of using volatile anesthetic agents has been demonstrated in cardiac surgery, a reduction in myocardial ischemia or MI has not been demonstrated in noncardiac surgery. 343-347 A  meta-analysis  of  >6000  patients  undergoing noncardiac surgery failed to demonstrate a difference in MI rates between patients who received volatile anesthesia and patients who received total intravenous anesthesia. 340 However, the event MI rate in the meta-analysis of >79 studies was 0 for both groups. A randomized comparison of volatile anesthetic administration versus  total  intravenous  administration  in  patients  undergoing noncardiac surgery demonstrated no difference in either myocardial ischemia or MI between the 2 groups. 341

7.1.3. Monitored Anesthesia Care Versus General Anesthesia

There  are  no  RCTs  to  suggest  a  preference  for  monitored anesthesia care over general anesthesia for reducing myocardial ischemia and MI.

7.2. Perioperative Pain Management: Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial anesthesia for postoperative pain relief can be effective in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery  to  decrease  the  incidence  of  perioperative MI. 348 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIb

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative epidural analgesia may be considered to  decrease  the  incidence  of  preoperative  cardiac events  in  patients  with  a  hip  fracture. 349 (Level  of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pain management is fundamental to the care of the surgical patient,  and  pain  is  one  of  many  factors  that  can  contribute to  the  development  of  postoperative  myocardial  ischemia and  MI.  Postoperative  pain  is  associated  with  myocardial ischemia;  however,  the  best  practices  for  perioperative  pain management  have  not  been  completely  elucidated. 90,350-352 Most of the literature  focusing  on  perioperative  myocardial events compares epidural analgesia with intravenous analgesia.  Importantly,  the  potential  efficacy  of  epidural  analgesia depends on the local system of care. A 2003 review of a large billing registry comparing epidural analgesia with other forms of analgesia failed to show a reduction in perioperative myocardial  events 353 ;  however,  other  studies,  including  a  metaanalysis of RCTs, concluded that patients receiving epidural analgesia experienced a reduction in postoperative myocardial ischemia and MI. 348,354  An RCT in 2001 examining the use of epidural anesthesia in patients undergoing abdominal surgery found no difference between epidural and intravenous analgesia in the prevention of perioperative MI, although a subgroup analysis  demonstrated  a  reduction  in  MI  in  patients  undergoing  abdominal  aortic  procedures. 354 In  2012,  a  Cochrane review of 15 RCTs comparing epidural analgesia with opioids for patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery reported a decrease in MIs in the patients who received epidural analgesia. 348 There is a paucity of studies on perioperative cardiac events with regard to various methods of pain control in the general surgical population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although the majority of perioperative  MIs  occur  during the  postoperative  period,  1  RCT  examined  the  incidence  of preoperative cardiac events in elderly patients with hip fractures. The 64-patient study concluded that preoperative pain control with epidural analgesia reduced the incidence of preoperative myocardial ischemia and preoperative MI, as well as HF and AF. 349

Prophylactic intravenous nitroglycerin is not effective in reducing myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. 292,355,356 (Level of Evidence: B)

7.4. Intraoperative Monitoring Techniques: Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIa

The  emergency  use  of  perioperative  transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is reasonable in patients with hemodynamic instability undergoing noncardiac surgery to determine the cause of hemodynamic instability when it persists despite attempted corrective therapy, if expertise is readily available.

structures, the pericardial space, and the thoracic aorta. 17,357,358 The use of TEE intraoperatively in a patient undergoing noncardiac surgery is less clear.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  are  limited  data  evaluating  intraoperative  TEE  in  the assessment of regional myocardial function and any association with cardiac outcomes. 359,360 Moreover, the data are insufficient in terms of predictive accuracy or cost-effectiveness to recommend routine TEE monitoring. In contrast, emergency use of perioperative TEE in patients with hemodynamic instability, to determine the cause of an unexplained, severe hemodynamic instability that persists despite attempted corrective therapy, is appropriate where available. 27,29,361-363 CPGs  for  the  appropriate  use  of  TEE  have been developed by the  American Society of  Anesthesiologists, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and the American Society  of  Echocardiography. 17,27,29 Many  anesthesiologists  are experts in TEE; the use of TEE by those with limited or no training should be avoided. 27

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.5. Maintenance of Body Temperature: Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIb

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of normothermia may be reasonable to reduce perioperative cardiac events in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. 364,365 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypothermia has been associated with several perioperative complications,  including  wound  infection,  MACE,  immune dysfunction,  coagulopathy,  increased  blood  loss,  death,  and transfusion requirements. 365-372  However, interest is emerging in  the  therapeutic  benefit  of  hypothermia  in  preservation  of neurological function after head trauma, stroke, and cardiac arrest. Balancing the risks and benefits to determine the appropriate  use  of  hypothermia in the perioperative and inpatient hospital setting is an area of active research.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are 2 conflicting studies on hypothermia in relation to perioperative cardiac events. They were conducted in very different  patient  populations  and  with  different  goals.  In  a  1997 study,  300  patients  with  known cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease were randomized to forced air warmers or ambient temperature. This study demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of a MACE (eg, ischemia, infarction, cardiac arrest) or an electrocardiographic event, particularly ventricular tachycardia, 365 in the ambient-temperature group.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A large multicenter trial published in 2010 randomized 1000 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage to either normothermia or  perioperative  hypothermia to assess the efficacy of hypothermia in brain protection. This large study demonstrated no increased incidence of cardiovascular events either intraoperatively or postoperatively in the hypothermia-treated patients. 364

Use  of  hemodynamic  assist  devices  may  be  considered when urgent or emergency noncardiac surgery is  required  in  the  setting  of  acute  severe  cardiac

dysfunction (ie, acute MI, cardiogenic shock) that cannot be corrected before surgery. (Level of Evidence: C)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rare case reports have noted the use of and complications associated  with  hemodynamic  assist  device  therapy  during  noncardiac  surgery.  There  are  no  published  RCTs,  retrospective reviews, meta-analyses, or case series of >10 patients. Therefore, there is no evidence for the routine use of hemodynamic assist devices in patients at surgical risk, and it is not recommended. That being said, the number of patients chronically supported with  long-term  implantable  devices,  including  left,  right,  or biventricular assist devices or total artificial heart, for advanced HF is steadily increasing. While on mechanical circulatory support, patients may face medical problems requiring emergency or nonemergency noncardiac surgery with varying degrees of risk to the patient and mortality outcomes. Several series have been published reporting outcomes in patients with mechanical circulatory support undergoing noncardiac procedures, with the 30-day mortality rate ranging from 9% to 25%. 373-379

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For perioperative management, a multidisciplinary approach and expert guidance on anticoagulation strategies, pump  flow  control,  hemodynamic  monitoring,  infection, and bleeding prevention strategies are considered important. Specific  recommendations  on  perioperative  management  of these  patients  are  addressed  in  the  International  Society  for Heart and Lung Transplantation CPGs for mechanical circulatory support. 379

7.7. Perioperative Use of Pulmonary Artery Catheters: Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IIb

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The use of pulmonary artery catheterization may be considered when underlying medical conditions that significantly affect hemodynamics (ie, HF, severe valvular disease, combined shock states) cannot be corrected before surgery. (Level of Evidence: C)

Class III: No Benefit

Routine use of pulmonary artery catheterization in patients, even those with elevated risk, is not recommended. 380-382 (Level of Evidence: A)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The theoretical basis for better outcomes with the routine use of  pulmonary  artery  catheterization  in  noncardiac  surgery derives  from  clinicians'  improved  understanding  of  perioperative  hemodynamics.  Unfortunately,  the  clinical  trial  data on  which  recommendations  are  made  are  sparse.  Of  the  3 main  trials,  2  are  underpowered. 380-382 The  largest  trial  randomly  allocated  the  use  of  pulmonary  artery  catheters  in 1994 patients at high surgical risk, defined by an American Society of Anesthesiologists risk score of III or IV. 380 In this trial, there were no differences in mortality or morbidity, save for an increase in pulmonary embolism noted in the pulmonary artery catheter arm. Therefore, routine use of pulmonary artery catheterization in patients at elevated surgical risk does not improve outcomes and is not recommended.

7.8. Perioperative Anemia Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia can contribute to myocardial ischemia, particularly in patients  with  CAD. In patients with CAD who are also anemic,  ischemia  can  be  triggered  by  both  the  lack  of  adequate oxygen delivery to poststenotic myocardium and a demand for increased cardiac output to supply oxygen to other vascular beds throughout the body. Transfusions to treat anemia are not without economic costs and individual health costs, in the form of an increased risk of infectious and noninfectious complications. Transfusion practices vary widely, and much of the literature attempts to address the clinical question of when to transfuse an asymptomatic patient below a preset hemoglobin level and when to transfuse patients experiencing symptoms of ischemia. The 2012 American Association of Blood Banks CPG and a 2011 RCT provide some additional information and guidance to clinicians navigating the complex interplay among anemia, transfusions, and attribution of symptoms to anemia. 21,383

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 2011, a RCT compared 2000 patients with either CAD or known CAD risk factors and a hemoglobin level <10 g/dL after hip fracture surgery who were treated with either a liberal transfusion strategy (hemoglobin <10 g/dL) or a conservative transfusion strategy (hemoglobin <8 g/dL or symptoms of anemia). 383 The endpoints of death and inability to walk at the 60-day follow-up were not found to be significantly different in either the liberal or conservative transfusion group. Additionally, although the study found no difference in MI, unstable angina, or in-hospital death between the 2 groups, it was not sufficiently powered to show a difference in the aforementioned areas if a difference existed. 383

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  2012  American  Association  of  Blood  Banks  CPG, which is based on expert opinion and studies, recommends a restricted transfusion strategy (hemoglobin <7 g/dL to 8 g/dL) in  asymptomatic,  hemodynamically  stable  patients  without CAD. 21  The CPG also recommends adherence to a restrictive transfusion  strategy  in  hospitalized  patients  with  cardiovascular  disease  and  consideration  of  transfusion  for  patients with symptoms (eg, chest pain, orthostasis, congestive HF) or hemoglobin <8 g/dL. 21  In postoperative patients, the recommended maintenance hemoglobin concentration is ≥ 8  g/dL, unless the patient exhibits symptoms. There were no specific recommendations for hemodynamically stable patients with acute coronary syndrome because of the lack of high-quality evidence for either a liberal or a restrictive transfusion strategy in these patients. The consensus of those experts recommended a symptom-guided approach to evaluating a hemoglobin level to determine whether to transfuse a patient with anemia.

Class III: No Benefit

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Routine  postoperative  screening  with  troponin  levels in unselected patients without signs or symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia or MI is not useful for guiding perioperative management. 40,384 (Level of Evidence: B)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Improvements in surgical outcomes and increasing difficulty in accurately  predicting  adverse  cardiovascular  events  and  death in patients before surgery have fostered efforts to improve early detection  of  myocardial  injury  and  MI  to  prevent  more  serious  complications.  Routine  screening  with  troponin  for  cardiac injury has been proposed as a method of early detection to ensure early intervention to avoid more serious complications. Among the studies, elevations of troponin of any level associate directly and consistently with increases in 30-day mortality rates. 40,384,396 In the largest of the studies, the VISION (Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation) trial, 40 troponin elevations predicted vascular and nonvascular mortality rates equally. Type 1 MI (ie, related to ischemia from a primary coronary  event,  such  as  plaque  rupture  or  thrombotic  occlusion)  causes  <5%  of  troponin  elevation  postoperatively 384,396 and therefore constitutes a small minority of the vascular causes of troponin elevation. In a subsequent publication, the authors defined myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery as troponin elevation with or without symptoms of myocardial ischemia. 38 Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery is a novel classification  that  predicted  30-day  mortality  rate  but  diverges  from the  Third  Universal  Definition  of  MI 397 by  combining  type  1 and type 2 events (ie, type 2 is secondary to ischemia from a supply-and-demand  mismatch),  despite  their  different  pathophysiological  origin.  In  a  study  of  2232  consecutive  patients undergoing  noncardiac  surgery,  315  patients  had  elevation  of troponin I, 9.5% had attendant ECG changes suggestive of cardiac ischemia, and 3.2% had typical chest pain, showing that a small minority of troponin elevation results from type 1 MI. 396 Additionally, none of these studies accounts for patients with troponin elevations before surgery, which may be seen in as many as 21% of high-risk patients 398  and may be even more common if high-sensitivity troponin assays are used. Finally, the median time between troponin elevation and death is >7 days after measurement, and none of the studies clarifies the specific cause of death. In the absence of a description of the specific cause of death and evidence for the use of the biomarker to prevent these events, the use of routine postoperative troponin measurement

remains uncertain, even in patients at high risk for perioperative MI. Therefore, routine screening with troponin provides a nonspecific assessment of risk, does not indicate a specific course of therapy, and is not clinically useful outside of the patient with signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia or MI. The value of postoperative troponin surveillance may be clarified after completion of MANAGE (Management of Myocardial Injury After Noncardiac Surgery Trial), which is testing the effects of 2 drugs (dabigatran  and  omeprazole)  that  may  prevent  death,  major cardiovascular  complications,  and  major  upper  gastrointestinal bleeding in patients who have had myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery. 399 Of note, elevation in the MB fraction of creatine kinase may also be used to detect myocardial necrosis and possible MI, although its interpretation in the perioperative period is often complicated by the significant rise in overall creatine kinase seen with noncardiac surgery.

The role of postoperative electrocardiography remains difficult to define. As noted in in previous versions of this CPG, older studies have demonstrated that changes in the ECG, particularly ST-segment  changes,  are  associated  with  increases  in  major cardiac complications-more than 2-fold compared with those without  electrocardiographic  changes. 400 More  recently,  however, it has become clear that electrocardiography may not provide information sufficient for routine use. One study involved 337 vascular surgery patients in whom troponin I levels were collected  within  48  hours  of  surgery  and  12-lead  ECGs  were performed  daily  for  3  postoperative  days. 385 Forty  percent  of the subjects had elevated troponin levels, but ischemic changes on the ECG were noted in 6%. Whereas elevations in troponin predicted death at 1 year, electrocardiographic changes did not. Several large surgical trials have demonstrated the superiority of troponin testing to ECG in identifying patients with types 1 and 2 MI 384,394 and suggest that troponin testing may be a superior initial test in the diagnosis of MI. There are no prospective randomized trials examining the value of adding ECGs to routine postoperative care. In addition, the interpretation of ECGs in the setting of critical illness is only moderately reliable among expert readers. 401  The current use of ECGs may have developed as a method to screen for MI when little else was routinely available. In the absence of clinical trial data, a recommendation for routine postoperative ECGs cannot be made.

9. Future Research Directions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current recommendations for perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and management for noncardiac surgery are based largely on clinical experience and observational studies, with few prospective RCTs. The GWC recommends that future research on perioperative  evaluation  and  management  span  the  spectrum from RCTs to regional and national registries to focus on patient outcomes. Development and participation in registries (such as the American College of Surgeons NSQIP, American Society of Anesthesiologists,  and  NACOR  [National Anesthesia  Clinical Outcomes Registry]) for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery will advance knowledge in the following areas:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1. Surveillance :  How are we doing across different practices? What are the significant gaps in care?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Discovery : What new information can be learned? What new strategies or interventions can improve these gaps in care?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Translation : How can we best apply these strategies or interventions to practice?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dissemination : How can we spread what works?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The US healthcare system must focus on achieving the triple aim of better patient care and experience, better population health, and lower cost per capita over time. The use of perioperative tests and treatments improves patient outcomes only when targeted at specific patient subsets. Implementation of ACC/AHA CPGs for perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and management has been demonstrated to improve patient outcomes and reduce  costs. 402-405 For  example,  routine  perioperative  stress testing in patients at low risk for cardiac events undergoing lowrisk elective noncardiac surgery has no benefit, but it could have harm by exposing the patient to unnecessary treatments, such as  medications  or  revascularization  procedures. Alternatively, the interruption of perioperative medications such as statins and warfarin in situations not supported by evidence/perioperative CPGs can worsen patient outcomes. 406

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnostic  cardiovascular  testing  continues  to  evolve,  with newer  imaging  modalities  being  developed,  such  as  coronary calcium scores, computed tomography angiography, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The value of these modalities in preoperative screening is uncertain and warrants further study.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The use of perioperative beta blockers in beta-blocker-naïve patients undergoing noncardiac surgery remains controversial because  of  uncertainty  about  the  following  issues:  1)  optimal duration for the initiation of beta blockers before elective noncardiac  surgery;  2)  optimal  dosing  and  titration  protocol perioperatively  to  avoid  hemodynamic  instability,  including hypotension and bradycardia; and 3) which elevated-risk patient subsets would benefit the most from initiation of perioperative beta blocker. Although there is sufficient evidence that patients who are receiving long-term beta-blocker therapy should continue beta blockers perioperatively, their use in beta-blockernaïve patients needs additional research to illuminate the benefit (avoidance of MI) versus harm (stroke). RCTs are needed to demonstrate when to start beta-blocker therapy before noncardiac surgery, the optimal type and dose, and titration protocol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  risk-adjusted  mortality  rates  after  noncardiac  surgery have declined significantly in the past decade (relative reductions  of  11% to 19% for major cancer surgery and 36% for abdominal  aortic  aneurysm  repair),  a  development  that  has been attributed to higher volumes, consolidation of high-risk surgery at high-volume hospitals, and implementation of CPGs and  local  risk-reducing  strategies. 407 Research  also  suggests that  additional  factors  at  the  practice,  clinician,  and  patient levels can impact patient outcomes after noncardiac surgery. For bariatric surgery, the technical skill of practicing surgeons assessed by peer ratings varied widely, and greater skill was associated with better patient outcomes. The bottom quartile of surgical skill was associated with higher complication rates than was the top quartile (14.5% versus 5.2%; P <0.001). 408

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  outlined  in  Section  8,  the  evidence  base  for  the  predictive  value  of  biomarkers  in  the  perioperative  period  has grown. However, the utility of this information in influencing

management and outcome is unknown and is currently undergoing investigation. The results of these investigations could lead to changes in recommendations in the future.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To implement the recommendations of the current perioperative  CPGs  effectively,  a  'perioperative  team  approach'  is needed. The perioperative team is intended to engage clinicians with appropriate expertise; enhance communication of the benefits,  risks,  and  alternatives;  and  include  the  patient's  preferences,  values,  and  goals.  Members  of  the  perioperative  team would include the patient and family, surgeon, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, hospitalist, primary care clinician, and additional clinicians (eg, a congenital heart disease specialist) depending on  the  unique  circumstances  of  the  patient.  Shared  decision making aims to take into account the patient's preferences, values, and goals and is useful for treatment decisions where there are  alternatives  with  comparable  outcomes  or  where  patient action is needed, such as medication adherence. Future research will also be needed to understand how information on perioperative risk is incorporated into patient decision making.

The area of each gray square correlates with its contribution toward the pooled summary estimates. Horizontal lines denote 95% CIs. Estimates to the left of the line of unity (i.e., RR: 1) indicate superior clinical outcomes (i.e., fewer nonfatal MIs) with beta blockade (' Favors Beta-Blockers '), whereas estimates to the right of the line of unity indicate superior clinical outcomes with control (' Favors Control '). The blue diamonds represent the pooled estimates for all studies (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59-0.86), as well as the POISE-1 trial (RR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.57-0.86) and the subgroup of other trials (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.47-1.21). Statistical heterogeneity, as measured by the I 2  statistic, was 0% for the overall analysis.

| Class I | 1. Beta-blocker therapy should be used in all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (EF ≤ 40%) with HF or prior MI, unless contraindicated. (Use should be limited to carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol, which have been shown to reduce mortality.) 485-487 | A                 |
|         | 2. Beta-blocker therapy should be started and continued for 3 years in all patients with normal LV function who have had MI or ACS. 488-490                                                                                       | B                 |

Clinical signs of HF including an S3 gallop or JVD were the most significant predictors of postop life-threatening or fatal cardiac complications. In the final analysis, signs of HF carried the highest weight in the original CRI. 10 of the 19 postop cardiac fatalities occurred in the 18 pts at highest risk. |

All were scheduled to have noncardiac surgery estimated to last for at least 1 h and to have postsurgical hospitalization of at least 4 d. | UA, MI in the past 14 d, uninterpretable ECG Q-waves, cardiogenic shock, prescribed alpha agonist, severe hepatic disorders, emergency surgery, pregnant or nursing women or women aged <45 y without adequate contraception | N/A                                  | Results presented relate to the 1,897 pts with known previous CHD. Preplanned subgroup analysis based on tests of heterogeneity. Primary endpoint was the incidence of acute MI or death during the intra- and postop hospitalization period (up to 30 d after surgery). 10.4% decrease in the primary endpoint (MI or death) and a 37% reduction in all-cause death. Secondary endpoints relate to the period of 30 d (follow-up visit) included HF, life-threatening arrhythmias, and UA | Hypotension was defined as a decrease in systolic BP of ≥20% below the baseline figure. In 10.5% (150) of mivazerol group pts and 9.4% (134) of placebo group pts, the infusion had to be stopped prematurely: of these, 62% were because of adverse events, such as hypotension, brady- or tachycardia, cardiac arrest, or organ failure; 19% (of the 62%) had to be withdrawn from the trial | Cardiac deaths: MI endpoint 95% CI: 0.25-0.96 (p=0.037); for all surgeries 95% CI: 0.67-1.18 (p=NS); for vascular surgery 95% CI: 0.45-0.98 (p=0.03) | Overall study negative, positive results presented from CHD pts (not those pts with only risk factors) |
