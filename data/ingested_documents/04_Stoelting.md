ANATOMY OF INTRINSIC CARDIAC PACEMAKERS AND THE CONDUCTION SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  conduction system of the heart is composed of a set of very specialized cells that initiate and conduct electrical signals  through  the  heart  with  precise  coordination  and  great speed. As an electrical impulse moves along the conduction system, a wave of depolarization is propagated throughout the heart, causing progressive contraction of cardiac muscle cells (Figure 4-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  sinoatrial  (SA)  node  is  the  primary  site  for  impulse initiation. Impulses initiated in the SA node are rapidly conducted across the right and le ft atria, causing them to contract. Th e electrical impulse then travels between the fi brous atrioventricular (AV) rings, where it slows down brie fl y at the AV node. Th e impulse then continues down the interventricular septum, branching into right and le ft portions and ending in an even smaller branching network of fi bers  called  the HisPurkinje system.

Right bundle branch

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e SA node is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium, and is richly innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve endings. In 60% of individuals, the arterial blood supply to the SA node comes from the right coronary artery; in the remaining 40%, the blood supply is from the le ft circum fl ex coronary artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e AV rings are the tough fi brous frames that support the delicate tissue of the tricuspid and mitral valves. Th ese rings essentially insulate the conduction tissue of the AV node, thus allowing conduction through the normal pathway while preventing aberrant electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles.  In  addition,  the  AV  node  has  a  long  refractory period to prevent overstimulation of the ventricles in the event of abnormally rapid atrial impulses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  AV  node  is  located  in  the  septal  wall  of  the  right atrium, anterior to the coronary sinus and above the insertion of the septal lea fl et of the tricuspid valve. It is also innervated by both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Th e blood supply to the AV node comes from the right coronary artery in 85% to 90% of the population and from the le ft circum fl ex coronary artery in the remaining 10% to 15%. Th e AV node slows the conduction velocity of the electrical impulse, which allows time for atrial contraction, the so-called atrial kick, to contribute an additional 20% to fi lling of the ventricles in late diastole. A ft er a brief slowing of the electrical impulse at the AV node, the impulse continues down the conduction tract along the bundle of His.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e bundle of His quickly divides into two branches, right and the le ft bundles, within the interventricular septum. Th e right bundle branch (RBB) is a relatively thin bundle of fi bers that courses down the right ventricle and then branches near the right ventricular apex. Because of this late branching, the RBB is more vulnerable to interruption than the le ft bundle branch (LBB), which branches early and widely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e LBB divides into two fascicles: the le ft anterior superior fascicle and the le ft posterior inferior fascicle. Th e le ft and right bundles both receive blood supply from branches of the le ft anterior descending coronary artery. Infarction in the territory of the le ft anterior descending coronary artery can o ft en a ff ect the le ft anterior superior fascicle and the RBB, but rarely the le ft posterior inferior fascicle, because that portion receives additional blood supply from the posterior descending coronary artery. Th is is why disruption of the more robust LBB in the form of a le ft bundle branch block (LBBB) usually indicates more extensive cardiac disease or damage than a right bundle branch block (RBBB). Th e distal branches of the right and le ft bundles interlace into a network of Purkinje fi bers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY OF THE CONDUCTION SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On a cellular level, impulses are conducted through the heart by a process of progressive depolarization. In the resting state, the inside of a cardiac cell is negative relative to the outside. Cardiac  muscle  cells  have  a  resting  membrane  potential  of -80 to -90 mV. Th e resting gradient is maintained by membrane-bound  sodium-potassium-adenosine  triphosphatase (Na + ,K + -ATPase) that concentrates potassium intracellularly and  extrudes  sodium  extracellularly. Th e  membrane  potential  increases  when  the  sodium  and  calcium  channels  open in response to shi ft s in the charge on neighboring cell membranes. At the point at which the membrane potential reaches +20 mV, an action potential (or depolarization) occurs. A ft er depolarization, cells are refractory to subsequent  action potentials for a period of time corresponding to phase 4 of the depolarization potential (Figure 4-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrocardiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  essential  monitor  for  diagnosis  of  cardiac  conduction abnormalities and rhythm disturbances is the electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG is a tracing made by a machine that uses electrodes on the skin to amplify the movement of electrical potentials through the heart. Th e direction of the electrical signal relative to a ground electrode determines the direction of the de fl ection seen on the ECG. Positive signals are represented by de fl ections above the isoelectric line and negative signals are represented as de fl ections below the isoelectric line.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e type and con fi guration of the de fl ections determine the type of rhythm. Th e normal ECG tracing, called sinus rhythm, is made up of three parts: the P wave (atrial depolarization), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarization), and the T wave (ventricular repolarization). Th e time between atrial depolarization and the initiation of ventricular depolarization is the PR interval. Th e  normal reference range for the PR interval is 0.12 to 0.20 seconds. Th e QRS complex corresponds to the wave of depolarization as it emerges from the AV node and moves downward to depolarize the right and le ft ventricles. Th e QRS is normally 0.05 to 0.10 seconds in duration. Abnormal intraventricular conduction is suggested by a QRS complex  that  exceeds  0.12  seconds. Th e  segment  between  the end of the S wave (end of ventricular depolarization) and the beginning of the T wave is the ST segment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ST  segment  represents  the  time  between  ventricular depolarization and the start of ventricular repolarization. It is normally isoelectric but can be elevated to 1 mm in the

FIGURE 4-2 Transmembrane action potential occurring in an automatic cardiac cell and the relationship of this action potential to events depicted on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Phase 4 is characterized by spontaneous depolarization from the resting membrane potential ( -90 mV) until the threshold potential ( broken line ) is reached. Depolarization (phase 0) occurs when the threshold potential is reached and corresponds to the QRS complex on the ECG. Phases 1 through 3 represent repolarization, with phase 3 corresponding to the T wave on the ECG. The effective refractory period (ERP) is the time during which cardiac impulses cannot be conducted, regardless of the intensity of the stimulus. During the relative refractory period (RRP), a strong stimulus can initiate an action potential. The action potential developed in a contractile cardiac cell differs from that occurring in an automatic cardiac cell in that phase 4 is not characterized by spontaneous depolarization.

absence of any cardiac abnormality. However, it is never normal for the ST segment to be depressed. Th e T-wave de fl ection should be in the same direction as the QRS complex and should not exceed 5 mm in amplitude in standard leads or 10 mm in precordial  leads.  Normal  values  for  the  QT  interval should be corrected for the heart rate (QTc) because the QT interval varies inversely with heart rate. A normal QTc is less than 0.47 seconds. As a general rule, the QT interval is less than one half of the preceding R-R interval.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac rhythms that show abnormalities in rate, interval length, or conduction path are referred to as dysrhythmias. Dysrhythmias are usually classi fi ed according to heart rate and the site of the abnormality. Th e clinical signi fi cance of these abnormalities for the anesthesiologist depends on the e ff ect they have on vital signs  and  the  potential  for  deterioration  into  life-threatening rhythms. In healthy adults, a wide variation in heart rate can be tolerated, because normal compensatory mechanisms serve to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure. In patients with cardiac disease, however, dysrhythmias and conduction disturbances  can  overwhelm  normal  compensatory  processes  and result in hemodynamic instability, cardiac and other end-organ ischemia, congestive heart failure, and even death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MECHANISMS OF TACHYDYSRHYTHMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A cardiac rhythm higher than 100 beats per minute is considered a tachydysrhythmia. Tachydysrhythmias can result from three mechanisms: (1) increased automaticity in normal conduction tissue or in an ectopic focus, (2) reentry of electrical potentials through abnormal pathways, and (3) triggering of abnormal cardiac potentials due to a ft erdepolarizations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Automaticity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fastest pacemaker in the heart is normally the SA node. Th e SA node spontaneously discharges at a rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Other pacemakers can be accelerated and overdrive  the  SA  node  as  a  result  of  disease  states  or  iatrogenic  in fl uences  such  as  mechanical  or  drug  stimulation.  A sustained rhythm resulting from accelerated fi ring of a pacemaker  other  than  the  SA  node  is  called  an ectopic  rhythm. Clinically, dysrhythmias resulting from an ectopic focus o ft en have a gradual onset and termination. Cardiac dysrhythmias caused by enhanced automaticity result from repetitive fi ring of a focus other than the sinus node.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal automaticity is not con fi ned to secondary pacemakers within the conduction system. Almost any cell in the heart may exhibit automaticity under certain circumstances. Th e automaticity of cardiac tissue changes when the slope of phase 4 depolarization shi ft s or the resting membrane potential  changes.  Sympathetic  stimulation  causes  an  increase  in heart  rate  by  increasing  the  slope  of  phase  4  of  the  action potential and by decreasing the resting membrane potential. Conversely, parasympathetic stimulation results in a decrease in the slope of phase 4 depolarization and an increase in resting membrane potential to slow the heart rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reentry Pathways

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reentry pathways account for most premature beats and tachydysrhythmias. Reentry or triggered dysrhythmias require two pathways over which cardiac impulses can be conducted at different velocities (Figure 4-3). Extra pathways called accessory tracts can exist around the AV node and can conduct impulses bypassing  the  AV  node  and  normal  infranodal  conduction tract. Th ese accessory tracts are usually remnants of tissue le ft from the embryologic formation of the heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally, passage through the AV node is the slowest portion  of  the  conduction  system.  In  a  reentry  circuit,  there  is anterograde (forward) conduction over the slower normal conduction pathway and retrograde (backward) conduction over a

faster accessory pathway. Pharmacologic or physiologic events may alter the balance between conduction velocities and refractory periods of the dual pathways, resulting in the initiation or termination  of  reentrant  dysrhythmias.  Reentrant  dysrhythmias tend to be paroxysmal with abrupt onset and termination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Triggering by Afterdepolarizations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft erdepolarizations  are  oscillations  in  membrane  potential that  occur  during  or  a ft er  repolarization.  Normally,  these membrane  oscillations  dissipate. However,  under  special circumstances  they  can  trigger  a  complete  depolarization. Once  triggered,  the  process  may  continue  and  result  in  a self-  sustaining  dysrhythmia.  Triggered  dysrhythmias  associated  with early a ft erdepolarizations  are  enhanced  by  slow heart rates and are treated by accelerating the heart rate with positive chronotropic drugs or pacing. Conversely, triggered dysrhythmias associated with delayed a ft erdepolarizations are enhanced by fast heart rates and can be suppressed with drugs that lower the heart rate.

Occasionally an ECG will show a sinus rhythm that appears irregular. Th is normal variant is called sinus dysrhythmia.

Inspiration  accelerates  the  heart  rate  and expiration  slows  it  down.  It  is  a  normal  variant  and  carries no risk of deterioration into a more dangerous rhythm. Sinus

Sinus Tachycardia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinus tachycardia occurs at a heart rate of 100 to 160 beats per minute. Th e ECG during sinus tachycardia shows a   normal P wave before every QRS complex. Th e PR interval is normal unless a co-existing conduction block exists.   Typically, it  is  a  nonparoxysmal increase in heart rate that speeds up and  slows  down  gradually.  Sinus  tachycardia  is  caused  by acceleration of SA node discharge secondary to sympathetic stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinus tachycardia without manifestations of hemodynamic instability is not life-threatening. It can occur as part of the normal physiologic response to stimuli such as fear or pain or as a pharmacologic response to medications or substances such as atropine or ca ff eine.  Since  it  does  increase  myocardial oxygen demand, it can contribute to myocardial ischemia and  congestive  heart  failure  in  susceptible  patients.  Sinus tachycardia  can  also  occur  as  a  compensatory  mechanism in the setting of signi fi cant heart disease such as congestive heart  failure  or  myocardial  infarction  (Table  4-1).  In  these circumstances,  the  increased  heart  rate  is  usually  a  physiologic e ff ort to increase cardiac output. Sinus tachycardia is the most common supraventricular dysrhythmia associated with acute myocardial infarction, occurring in 30% to 40% of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 4 ABNORMALITIES OF CARDIAC CONDUCTION AND CARDIAC RHYTHM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
77

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of sinus tachycardia is directed toward correcting any underlying causes of increased sympathetic stimulation. Sinus  tachycardia  in  patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease, diastolic dysfunction, or congestive heart failure can lead to signi fi cant clinical deterioration because of the increased oxygen  demand,  increased  wall  stress,  and  inability  to  increase myocardial perfusion in many of these patients. Many causes of sinus tachycardia such as hypovolemia are clinically obvious, but some of the most serious causes, such as infection, hypoxia,  myocardial  ischemia,  and  congestive  heart  failure, may be less apparent. If a speci fi c cause of sinus tachycardia can be determined, it should be treated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of  vagolytic  drugs,  such  as  pancuronium,  can aid  in  management  of  sinus  tachycardia  intraoperatively. Although sinus tachycardia is generally well tolerated in young healthy patients, supplemental oxygen should be administered to increase oxygen supply in response to the increased oxygen demand. If a patient is not hypovolemic, intravenous administration of a β -blocker may be employed to lower the heart rate and decrease myocardial oxygen demand.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Caution  must  be  exercised  in  the  use  of β -blockers  in patients  susceptible  to  bronchospasm. β -Blocker-mediated decreases  in  heart  rate  can  cause  an  abrupt  and  dangerous decrease in blood pressure in patients with impaired cardiac function. Such patients may be unable to increase their stroke volume to compensate for the reduction in heart rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Premature Atrial Beats

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Premature atrial contractions (PACs) arise from ectopic foci in the atria. PACs are recognized on the ECG by the presence of early, abnormally shaped P waves. Th e PR interval is variable. Most o ft en the duration and con fi guration of the corresponding QRS complex is normal, because activation of the ventricles occurs through the normal conduction pathway. Aberrant conduction of atrial impulses can occur, resulting in a QRS complex that is widened and may mimic that associated with a premature ventricular contraction (PVC). PACs, unlike PVCs, are not followed by a compensatory pause. Th e occurrence of PACs is not a risk factor for progression to a life-threatening dysrhythmia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typical symptoms of PACs include an awareness of a " fl uttering" or a "heavy" heart beat. Precipitating factors include excessive  ca ff eine,  emotional  stress,  alcohol,  nicotine,  recreational drugs, and hyperthyroidism. PACs are common in patients of all ages with and without heart disease. Th ey o ft en occur at rest and become less frequent with exercise. Th ey are more common in patients with chronic lung disease, ischemic heart disease, and digitalis toxicity. PACs are the second most common dysrhythmia associated with acute myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of precipitating drugs or toxins can reduce the incidence of PACs. Underlying predisposing conditions should be treated. PACs are usually hemodynamically insigni fi cant and do not require acute therapy unless they are associated with initiation of a tachydysrhythmia. In this situation treatment is directed at controlling or converting the tachydysrhythmia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management of the patient with PACs should include  avoidance  of  excessive  sympathetic  stimulation  and drugs  that  might  induce  PACs.  Pharmacologic  treatment  is required  only  if  the  PACs  trigger  secondary  dysrhythmias. PACs can usually be suppressed with calcium channel blockers  or β -blockers. Th e  secondary  dysrhythmias  triggered  by PACs are treated with drugs or maneuvers that improve heart rate control and/or convert the dysrhythmia to sinus rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supraventricular Tachycardia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supraventricular  tachycardia  (SVT)  is  a  tachydysrhythmia (average heart rate of 160 to 180 beats per minute) initiated and sustained by tissue at or above the AV node. Unlike sinus tachycardia,  SVT  is  usually  paroxysmal  and  may  begin  and end very abruptly. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is  the  most  common  type  of  SVT  and  accounts  for  50%  of diagnosed SVTs. AVNRT is most commonly due to a reentry circuit in which there is anterograde conduction over the slower AV nodal pathway and retrograde conduction over a faster accessory pathway. Other mechanisms for SVT include enhanced automaticity of secondary pacemaker cells and triggered impulse initiation by a ft erdepolarizations. Atrial fi brillation and atrial fl utter are SVTs, but their electrophysiology and treatment are distinctly di ff erent from those of other forms of SVT, so they are discussed separately.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common  symptoms  during  an  episode  of  SVT  include light-headedness,  dizziness,  fatigue,  chest  discomfort,  and dyspnea.  Fi ft een  percent  of  patients  with  SVT  experience overt syncope. SVT occurs most o ft en in the absence of structural  heart  disease  in  younger  individuals  and  occurs  three times  more  o ft en  in  women  than  in  men.  Polyuria  can  be associated with SVT or any atrial tachycardia that causes AV dyssynchrony. Th e  polyuria is caused by increased secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide. Th is happens because atrial pressures increase from contraction of the atria against closed AV valves and atrial stretch receptors are activated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the patient is in hemodynamically stable condition, the initial treatment of SVT can consist of vagal maneuvers such as carotid  sinus  massage  or  Valsalva's  maneuver.  Termination by a vagal maneuver suggests reentry as the causative mechanism. If conservative treatment is not e ff ective, pharmacologic treatment directed at blocking AV nodal conduction is indicated. Clinical factors guide the choice of drug treatment, but adenosine, calcium channel blockers, and β -blockers are commonly used to terminate SVT (Figure 4-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenosine has a unique advantage over other intravenous drugs used to treat SVT because it has a very rapid onset (15 to 30 seconds) and very brief duration of action (10 seconds). Most  AVNRT  episodes  can  be  terminated  by  a  single  dose

Conversely, patients taking theophylline may require higher dosages of adenosine to produce a therapeutic e ff ect because of competition with adenosine for receptor sites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous  administration  of  calcium  channel-blocking drugs such as verapamil and diltiazem is also useful for terminating  SVT. Th ese  drugs  o ff er  the  advantage  of  a  longer duration  of  action  than  adenosine.  However,  side  e ff ects, including peripheral vasodilation and negative inotropy, can contribute to an undesirable degree of hypotension. Intravenous β -blockers can also be used to control or convert SVT. Intravenous  digoxin  is  not  clinically  useful  in  acute  control of SVT because digoxin has a delayed peak e ff ect and a narrow therapeutic window. Electrical cardioversion is indicated for  SVT  unresponsive  to  drug  therapy  or  SVT  associated with hemodynamic instability. Long-term medical treatment of  patients  with  repeated  episodes  of  SVT  includes  calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and/or β -blockers. Radiofrequency catheter ablation may also be used to treat patients with recurrent or recalcitrant AVNRT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  for  a  patient  with  SVT  should focus on avoiding factors known to produce ectopy, such as increased sympathetic tone, electrolyte imbalances, and acidbase disturbances. Because SVT is usually paroxysmal, monitoring of vital signs to detect any progression to hemodynamic instability and verbal reassurance (if the patient is awake) is usually all that is needed until an episode of SVT terminates. One should evaluate and treat any potential aggravating factors  and  anticipate  the  need  for  antidysrhythmics  and/or cardioversion.

Th is rhythm is frequently confused with atrial fi brillation, but unlike atrial fi brillation, the rate is not excessively rapid (Figure 4-5). Th e atrial rhythm is usually between 100 and 180 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAT  is  most  commonly  seen  in  patients  experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic lung disease. It can also be associated with methylxanthine toxicity (theophylline and caffeine), congestive heart failure, sepsis, and metabolic or electrolyte abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAT usually responds to treatment of the underlying pulmonary decompensation with bronchodilators and supplemental oxygen. An improvement in arterial oxygenation tends to decrease the activity of the ectopic foci that cause MAT. Pharmacologic treatment of MAT has limited success and is considered secondary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium sulfate 2 g IV over 1 hour followed by 1 to 2 g IV per hour by infusion has shown some success in decreasing atrial ectopy and converting MAT to sinus rhythm. Verapamil 5 to 10 mg IV over 5 to 10 minutes slows the ventricular rate and will convert to sinus rhythm in some patients. Likewise, β -blockers  such  as  esmolol  or  metoprolol  can  decrease  the ventricular rate but at the risk of worsening the situation by provoking bronchospasm in susceptible patients. Th eophylline use can exacerbate this condition. Cardioversion has no e ff ect on the multiple sites of ectopy that produce this dysrhythmia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In summary, patients with MAT who must undergo urgent surgery bene fi t from optimization of their pulmonary function and arterial oxygenation. Avoidance of medications or procedures that could worsen the pulmonary status and avoidance of hypoxemia are the mainstays of anesthetic management.

Atrial Flutter

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fl utter is characterized by an organized atrial rhythm with an atrial rate of 250 to 350 beats per minute with varying  degrees  of  AV  block. Th e  rapid  P  waves  create  a  sawtooth appearance on ECG and are called fl utter waves. Th e fl utter waves are particularly noticeable in leads II, III, aVF, and V1. Th e fl utter waves are not separated by an isoelectric baseline. Th e ventricular rate may be regular or irregular depending on the rate of conduction. Most commonly, patients have 2:1 AV conduction so, for example, an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute with 2:1 conduction results in a ventricular rate of 150 beats per minute. Characteristically, the  ventricular  rate  is  about  150  beats  per  minute.  Atrial fl utter frequently occurs in association with other dysrhythmias such as atrial fi brillation or atrial tachycardia. Reciprocating deterioration of atrial fl utter into atrial fi brillation and then reversion of atrial fi brillation into atrial fl utter is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fl utter is usually associated with structural heart disease.  It  occurs  in  approximately  30%  of  patients  with  atrial

fi brillation  and  may  be  associated  with  more  intense  symptoms than atrial fi brillation because of the more rapid ventricular response. About 60% of patients experience atrial fl utter in association with an acute exacerbation of a chronic condition such as pulmonary disease, acute myocardial infarction, ethanol intoxication, or thyrotoxicosis, or a ft er cardiothoracic surgery. In many instances treatment of the underlying disease process restores sinus rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  atrial fl utter  is  hemodynamically  signi fi cant,  the  treatment is cardioversion. O ft en less  than  50  J  (monophasic)  is adequate to convert the rhythm to sinus. In a patient in hemodynamically  stable  condition,  overdrive  pacing  using  transesophageal or atrial electrodes can be used for conversion to sinus  rhythm. Patients with atrial fl utter  lasting  longer  than 48 hours should receive anticoagulant therapy and should be evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography for the presence of an atrial thrombus before any attempt at cardioversion is made.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic  control  of  the  ventricular  response  and conversion to sinus rhythm can be challenging in patients with  atrial fl utter.  Ventricular  rate  control  should  be  the initial  goal  of  therapy. Th is  is  done  to  prevent  deterioration in AV conduction from 2:1 to 1:1, which represents a doubling  of  the  heart  rate.  Such  an  increase  in  heart  rate can  cause  severe  hemodynamic  instability.  If  there  is  1:1 conduction  with  a  ventricular  rate  of  300  beats  per  minute  or  faster,  reentry  is  the  most  likely  mechanism  and procainamide  administration  should  be  considered.  More commonly,  intravenous  drug  therapy  for  ventricular  rate control includes amiodarone, diltiazem, and verapamil. All of these drugs are helpful in controlling the ventricular rate, but none of these agents is likely to convert atrial fl utter to sinus rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If atrial fl utter occurs before induction of anesthesia, surgery should be postponed if possible until control of the dysrhythmia has been achieved. Management of atrial fl utter occurring during anesthesia or surgery depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient. If the atrial fl utter is hemodynamically signi fi cant,  treatment  requires  cardioversion.  Synchronized cardioversion starting at 50 J (monophasic) is indicated. Pharmacologic  control  of  the  ventricular  response  with  intravenous amiodarone, diltiazem, or verapamil may be attempted if  vital  signs  are  stable. Th e  choice  of  pharmacologic  agent depends on the co-existing medical conditions of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial Fibrillation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation occurs when multiple areas of the atria continuously depolarize and contract in a disorganized manner. Th ere  is  no  coordinated  depolarization  or  contraction,  only a quivering of the atrial walls. Th e dysrhythmia is characterized on the ECG by chaotic atrial activity with no discernible P waves (see Figure 4-5). Atrial fi brillation may be triggered by other atrial tachycardias and commonly occurs in association with atrial fl utter. Rapid, disordered atrial activation and irregular electrical input to the AV node result in sporadic AV nodal  conduction  and  irregularly  irregular  ventricular  contraction. Ventricular response rates as high as 180 beats per minute can occur in patients with normal AV node function. Extremely rapid ventricular responses in excess of 180 beats per minute can be seen in patients with accessory AV nodal bypass tracts. In this situation, the QRS complex is o ft en wide, and the ECG can resemble ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation  can  be  a  sustained  or  an  episodic  dysrhythmia.  Predisposing  conditions  include  rheumatic  heart disease (especially mitral valve disease), hypertension, hyperthyroidism, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease,  alcohol  intake  (holiday  heart  syndrome), pericarditis, pulmonary embolus, and atrial septal defect. In some  instances,  treating  the  underlying  disorder  eliminates the  atrial fi brillation.  Increased  le ft atrial  size  and  mass  are positive predictors for atrial fi brillation. Atrial fi brillation may be identi fi ed on physical examination or ECG in a patient with no associated symptoms. However, most patients are symptomatic. Symptoms may be vague, such as generalized weakness  and  fatigue,  or  prominent,  such  as  palpitations,  angina pectoris, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation  is  the  most  common  sustained  cardiac dysrhythmia in the general population, a ff ecting 2.2 million people in the United States. Th e incidence of atrial fi brillation increases with age: it is present in 1% of individuals younger than 60 years of age, increases to 5% in those 70 to 75 years, and exceeds 10% in those older than 80 years. Th e most common underlying cardiovascular diseases associated with atrial fi brillation are systemic hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus are independent risk factors for the development of atrial fi brillation. Long-term atrial fi brillation increases an individual's risk of heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Loss  of  coordinated  atrial  contraction  promotes  stasis  of blood within the le ft atrium and can lead to the formation of atrial thrombi. Atrial thrombi and the potential for thromboembolic stroke are the most serious clinical dangers of atrial fi brillation.  Patients  with  atrial  thrombus  are  usually  treated with anticoagulants. Th e prophylactic regimen chosen for each patient is determined by risk strati fi cation for thromboembolism based on age and concomitant heart disease. In the acute setting, intravenous heparin is most commonly administered. For long-term anticoagulation therapy, warfarin is most o ft en used. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist, with a narrow therapeutic window that necessitates frequent monitoring of clinical e ff ect (international normalized ratio). It also interacts with numerous foods and medications. An alternative to warfarin emerged  in  2010  with  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration (FDA) approval of the fi rst new oral anticoagulant to become available in 50 years. Dabigatran (Pradaxa) is now available for

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the prevention of stroke and systemic embolization in patients with atrial fi brillation. Dabigatran is a thrombin inhibitor with a half-life of 12 to 17 hours. Th ere is no speci fi c antidote for dabigatran e ff ects. However, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or packed red blood cells and surgical intervention to control bleeding  are  supportive  therapies  recommended  for  severe hemorrhage associated with dabigatran therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A large proportion of patients with new-onset atrial fi brillation  experience  spontaneous  conversion  to  sinus  rhythm within  24  to  48  hours. Th erapy  goals  for  new-onset  atrial fi brillation  include  ventricular  rate  control  and  electrical  or pharmacologic cardioversion. Control of ventricular response is typically achieved with drugs that slow AV nodal conduction. Th e  most  commonly  used  drugs  for  this  purpose  are β -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. β -Blockers are  useful  in  the  prevention  of  recurrent  atrial fi brillation, provide good heart rate control, and reduce symptoms during subsequent episodes of atrial fi brillation. Potential side e ff ects of β -blocker therapy are hypotension and bronchospasm. Calcium channel-blocking drugs such as diltiazem and verapamil can rapidly reduce the ventricular rate during atrial fi brillation. Th ese drugs have negative inotropic e ff ects and must be used with caution in patients prone to heart failure. Digoxin can be useful to control ventricular rate but is not e ff ective for conversion of atrial fi brillation to sinus rhythm. In the acute setting  of  rapid  atrial fi brillation,  the  usefulness  of  digoxin is limited due to the fact that its peak therapeutic e ff ects are delayed  by  several  hours.  Side  e ff ects  associated  with  digitalis therapy are dose related and most commonly include AV block and ventricular ectopy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic cardioversion is most e ff ective  if  initiated within 7 days of the onset of atrial fi brillation. Several drugs are e ffi cacious in converting atrial fi brillation to sinus rhythm, including  amiodarone,  propafenone,  ibutilide,  and  sotalol. Th e preferred drug for patients with signi fi cant heart disease, including ischemic heart disease, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, le ft ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure, is amiodarone. Th e e ffi cacy of intravenous amiodarone in producing chemical cardioversion ranges from 34% to 69% for a bolus dose and 55% to 95% when the bolus is followed by a continuous drug infusion. Amiodarone also suppresses atrial ectopy and recurrence of atrial fi brillation and improves the success rate of electrical cardioversion. Adverse e ff ects of short-term amiodarone administration include bradycardia, hypotension, and phlebitis at the site of administration. Potential long-term side e ff ects include visual disturbances, thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary toxicity, and skin discoloration. Electrical cardioversion is the most e ff ective method for converting atrial fi brillation to normal sinus rhythm and is indicated in patients with co-existing symptoms of heart failure, angina pectoris, or hemodynamic instability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  new-onset atrial fi brillation  occurs  before  induction  of anesthesia, surgery should be postponed if possible until ventricular rate control or conversion to sinus rhythm has been achieved.  Intraoperative  management  of  atrial fi brillation depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient. If the atrial fi brillation  is  hemodynamically  signi fi cant,  the  treatment is cardioversion. Synchronized cardioversion at 100 to 200 J (biphasic) is indicated. If vital signs are stable, the primary goal should be rate control with a β -blocker or calcium channel blocker if there are no clinical contraindications. Th e drug of choice for rate control in a patient with a known or suspected  electrical  accessory  pathway  and  preexcitation  is procainamide  or  amiodarone.  Pharmacologic  conversion  to sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone may be attempted if vital signs allow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation is the most common postoperative tachydysrhythmia and frequently occurs early in the postoperative period ( fi rst 2 to 4 days), especially in elderly patients following cardiothoracic surgery. Patients with chronic atrial fi brillation should continue to receive their antidysrhythmic drugs perioperatively with close attention to serum magnesium and potassium levels, particularly if the patient is taking digoxin. Careful  coordination  with  the  primary  care  team  is  needed to manage the transition on and o ff of  intravenous and oral anticoagulation.

Ventricular Ectopy (Premature Ventricular Beats)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular premature beats arise from single (unifocal) or multiple (multifocal) foci located below the AV node. Characteristic ECG fi ndings include a premature and wide QRS complex, no preceding P wave, ST segment and T-wave de fl ection opposite  to  the  QRS de fl ection, and a compensatory pause before the next sinus beat. PVCs can be benign and self-limiting or progressive and detrimental. Th e vulnerable period of the ECG complex (corresponding to the relative refractory period of the cardiac action potential) occurs at approximately the middle third of the T wave. PVCs that occur during this time may initiate repetitive beats that can deteriorate into a sustained rhythm such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fi brillation. Th is clinical situation is known as the R-on-T phenomenon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular ectopy can occur as short episodes with spontaneous termination or as a sustained period of bigeminy or trigeminy. Th e  occurrence  of  more  than  three  consecutive PVCs is considered ventricular  tachycardia. Th e  most  common symptoms associated with ventricular ectopy are palpitations, near syncope, and syncope. Th e volume of blood ejected during a PVC is smaller than that ejected during a sinus beat because of lack of the atrial contribution to ventricular fi lling during diastole (loss of "atrial kick"). Th ere is a compensatory pause a ft er a PVC before the P wave of the next sinus beat. Th e stroke volume of the sinus beat following the compensatory pause is larger than normal.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
exercise may be an indication of underlying heart disease. Th e prognostic signi fi cance of ventricular ectopy depends on the presence and severity of co-existing structural heart disease. Th e  incidence of PVCs in a healthy population ranges from 0.5% in those younger than 20 years to 2.2% in those older than 50 years. In the absence of structural heart disease, asymptomatic ventricular ectopy is benign with no demonstrable risk of sudden death even in the presence of ventricular tachycardia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  occurrence  of  six  or  more  PVCs  per  minute  and repetitive  or  multifocal  forms  of  ventricular  ectopy,  even  if asymptomatic, indicate an increased risk of developing a lifethreatening ventricular tachydysrhythmia. Th e most common pathologic conditions associated with this type of dysrhythmia are arterial hypoxemia, myocardial ischemia or infarction, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, QT interval prolongation, digitalis toxicity, and electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Excessive ca ff eine, alcohol, and cocaine use can also cause PVCs (Table 4-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular premature beats should be treated when they are frequent, are polymorphic, occur in runs of three or more, or exhibit the R-on-T phenomenon, because these characteristics  are  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  progression  to  ventricular  tachycardia  and  ventricular fi brillation. Primary steps in the treatment of ventricular premature beats include elimination or correction of the underlying cause, discontinuation of prodysrhythmic drugs or drugs that prolong the QT interval, and elimination of any iatrogenic mechanical irritation of the heart such as from intracardiac catheters. A de fi brillator should be immediately available in case clinical deterioration into a life-threatening dysrhythmia occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With  the  exception  of β -blockers,  currently  available antidysrhythmic drugs have not been shown in randomized clinical trials to be e ff ective in the primary long-term management of ventricular dysrhythmias. Many antidysrhythmic drugs have prodysrhythmic e ff ects and/or prolong the QT  interval.  In  fact,  prolongation  of  depolarization  (QT interval) can precipitate and increase the propensity for dysrhythmias. Amiodarone, lidocaine, and other antidysrhythmics are not indicated unless PVCs progress to ventricular tachycardia or are frequent enough to cause hemodynamic instability.  Drug  therapy  is  not  e ff ective  in  suppression  of ventricular dysrhythmias caused by mechanical irritation of the heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During administration of an anesthetic, if a patient exhibits six or more PVCs per minute and repetitive or multifocal forms of ventricular ectopy, there is an increased risk of development  of  a  life-threatening  dysrhythmia. Th e  immediate availability of a de fi brillator should be con fi rmed. Th e di ff erential  diagnosis  of  possible  causes  of  PVCs  includes  acidosis, electrolyte imbalance, use of prodysrhythmic drugs, and mechanical irritation such as from cardiac surgery or intracardiac or intrathoracic catheters. Treatment should be aimed at  elimination  of  as  many  of  these  causative  factors  as  possible. Amiodarone, lidocaine, and other antidysrhythmics are indicated only if the PVCs progress to ventricular tachycardia or are frequent enough to cause hemodynamic instability.

SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

Ventricular  dysrhythmias  occur  in  70%  to  80%  of  persons older than age 60 and are o ft en asymptomatic. Th e prognosis depends on the presence or absence of structural heart disease.  In  the  perioperative  environment,  mechanical  ventilation,  drug  therapy,  insertion  of  central  catheters,  and  other interventions  can  be  iatrogenic  causes  of  ventricular  dysrhythmias. Th e risk of sudden death in patients with structurally  normal  hearts  experiencing  ventricular  dysrhythmias  is low. However, treatment with a β -blocker or calcium channel blocker can suppress the dysrhythmia and alleviate symptoms. Catheter ablation or implantation of a cardioverter or de fi brillator are options for treatment of drug-refractory ventricular tachycardia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular  tachycardia  (also  called monomorphic  ventricular tachycardia ) is present when three or more consecutive ventricular premature beats occur at a heart rate of more than 120 beats per minute (usually 150 to 200 beats per minute).  Ventricular  tachycardia  can  occur  as  a  nonsustained, paroxysmal rhythm or as a sustained  rhythm. Th e  rhythm is  regular  with  wide  QRS  complexes  and  no  discernible  P waves (Figure 4-6). SVT can sometimes be di ffi cult  to  distinguish  from  ventricular  tachycardia,  especially  if  there  is aberrant conduction or if the patient has an RBBB or LBBB. Ventricular tachycardia is common a ft er an acute myocardial infarction and in the presence of in fl ammatory or infectious diseases  of  the  heart.  Digitalis  toxicity  may  also  appear  as ventricular tachycardia.

On  occasion,  it  may  be  impossible  to  di ff erentiate  monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from SVT based on clinical symptoms, vital signs, or ECG fi ndings. Patients with symptomatic or unstable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or SVT should undergo cardioversion immediately. Cardioversion can begin at an output of 100 J (monophasic) and increase in increments of 50 to 100 J as necessary. If vital signs are stable  but  the  ventricular  tachycardia is persistent or recurrent a ft er  cardioversion,  then  administration  of  amiodarone  150 mg over 10 minutes is recommended. Th is may be repeated as needed to a maximum total dose of 2.2 g in 24 hours. Recommended alternative drugs include procainamide, sotalol, and lidocaine.  Pulseless  ventricular  tachycardia  or  polymorphic ventricular tachycardia under any circumstances requires initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and immediate de fi brillation using 360 J (monophasic).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  occurrence  of  paroxysmal  nonsustained  ventricular  tachycardia  during  anesthesia  should  prompt  an  investigation into potential causes. A plan to improve reversible factors should be implemented. At any point, episodic ventricular tachycardia can progress to stable ventricular tachycardia  or  deteriorate  into  unstable  ventricular  tachycardia, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fi brillation. Th e  occurrence  of  sustained  ventricular  tachycardia  with or  without  a  pulse  demands  immediate  action.  In  addition to electrical therapy and drug treatment, endotracheal intubation  and  evaluation  and  correction  of  acid-base  and electrolyte  disturbances  should  be  undertaken  as  clinically appropriate.

Ventricular Fibrillation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular fi brillation  is  the  most  common  cause  of  sudden  cardiac  death.  Most  victims  have  underlying  ischemic heart disease. In patients with acute coronary ischemia, those receiving β -blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,  and  statins  have  ventricular  tachycardia  or  ventricular fi brillation  less  o ft en  than  those  not  receiving  these  drugs. Ventricular tachycardia o ft en precedes the onset of ventricular fi brillation. Th e  gold  standard  for  long-term  treatment of recurrent episodic ventricular tachycardia  or fi brillation  is  implantation  of  a  permanent  automatic  pacemakercardioverter-de fi brillator with adjuvant drug therapy as a second-line treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular fi brillation  is  a  rapid,  grossly  irregular  ventricular rhythm with marked variability in QRS cycle length, morphology, and amplitude (see Figure 4-6). Th is  rhythm is incompatible  with  life  because  there  is  no  associated  stroke volume  or  cardiac  output.  A  pulse  or  blood  pressure never accompanies  ventricular fi brillation.  If  a  patient  with  presumed ventricular fi brillation is awake or responsive, the ECG must be reevaluated before treatment decisions are made.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular fi brillation  during  anesthesia  is  a  critical  event. CPR  must  be  initiated  immediately.  Electrical  de fi brillation is the only e ff ective method to convert ventricular fi brillation to a rhythm capable of generating a cardiac output. De fi brillation  involves  delivery  of  an  electrical  current  through  the heart to depolarize all myocardial cells at once. Ideally, a single pacemaker focus will then restore myocardial synchrony. Th is treatment  should  be  instituted  as  soon  as  possible,  because

<!-- PAGE=? -->
84

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cardiac output, coronary blood fl ow, and cerebral blood fl ow are  extremely  low  during  ventricular fi brillation,  even  with ideally  performed external cardiac compressions. Th e  single most important factor a ff ecting survival in patients experiencing ventricular fi brillation is time to de fi brillation. Survival is best if de fi brillation occurs within 3 to 5 minutes of cardiac arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  ventricular fi brillation  is  refractory  to  electrical treatment, administration of epinephrine 1 mg IV or vasopressin  40  units  IV  may  improve  the  response  to  electrical de fi brillation.  Adjunctive  therapy  with  amiodarone,  lidocaine,  or,  in  the  case  of  TdP ,  magnesium  may  be  indicated. Standardized  advanced  cardiac  life  support  (ACLS)  algorithms (Figure 4-7) should be followed for electrical, pharmacologic, and adjunctive therapy.

In  any  pulseless  arrest,  contributing  factors  should  be sought and treated. Th e di ff erential diagnosis includes hypoxia, hypovolemia, acidosis, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia,  hypothermia,  drug  or  environmental  toxins, cardiac  tamponade,  tension  pneumothorax,  coronary  ischemia, pulmonary embolus, and hemorrhage.

Th e normal conduction system of the heart from atria to ventricles  is  a  single  conduction  pathway through the AV node and His-Purkinje system. Some patients have alternate (accessory) conduction pathways that function as electrically active muscle bridges bypassing the normal conduction pathway and creating a potential avenue for reentrant tachycardias. Th ese accessory pathways are congenital and most likely represent remnants of fetal AV muscular connections le ft by incomplete development of the annulus fi brosus.

SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  Wol ff -Parkinson-White  (WPW)  syndrome  was fi rst described  in  1930,  the  understanding  of  WPW  syndrome and reentrant tachycardias has improved enormously. WPW syndrome occurs in 1% of the general population. It is more common in patients with Ebstein's malformation of the tricuspid  valve,  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  and  transposition of the great vessels. Th ere is a bimodal age distribution in initial symptoms, with the fi rst peak in early childhood, then a  second  in  young  adulthood.  Paroxysmal  palpitations  with or  without  dizziness,  syncope,  dyspnea,  or  angina  pectoris are  common  during  the  tachydysrhythmias  associated  with this syndrome. Th e initial manifestation of WPW syndrome occurs during pregnancy in some women. Other patients have the fi rst  manifestation  of  WPW  syndrome  during  the  perioperative  period. Th e  incidence  of  sudden  cardiac  death  in patients with WPW syndrome is 0.15% to 0.39% per patientyear, but it is very unusual for sudden death to be the initial manifestation of WPW syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of WPW syndrome is reserved for conditions characterized  by  both  preexcitation  and  tachydysrhythmia. Ventricular preexcitation causes an earlier than normal de fl ection of the QRS complex called a delta wave. Delta waves can mimic the Q waves of a myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AVNRT is  the  most  common  tachydysrhythmia  seen  in patients with WPW syndrome. It accounts for 95% of the dysrhythmias  seen  with  this  syndrome. Th is  tachydysrhythmia is  usually  triggered  by  a  PAC.  AVNRT is classi fi ed as either orthodromic (narrow QRS complex) or antidromic (wide QRS complex). Orthodromic AVNRT is much more common (90% of 95% of cases) and has a narrow QRS complex because the cardiac  impulse  is  conducted  from  the  atrium  through  the normal AV node-His-Purkinje system. Th ese impulses return from the ventricle to the atrium using the accessory pathway. Treatment  of  orthodromic  AVNRT  in  conscious  patients  in stable condition should begin with vagal maneuvers such as carotid sinus massage or Valsalva's maneuver. If vagal maneuvers  are  unsuccessful,  adenosine,  verapamil, β -blockers,  or amiodarone may be used as clinically appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the less common antidromic form of AVNRT, the cardiac impulse is conducted from the atrium to the ventricle through the accessory pathway and returns from the ventricles to the atria  via  the  normal  AV  node. Th e  wide  QRS complex seen in  antidromic  AVNRT  makes  it  di ffi cult  to  distinguish  this dysrhythmia from ventricular tachycardia on ECG. Treatment of antidromic AVNRT is intended to block conduction of the cardiac impulse along the accessory pathway. Drugs that slow AV  nodal  conduction,  such  as  adenosine,  calcium  channel blockers, β -blockers, lidocaine, and digoxin, may increase conduction along the accessory pathway and are contraindicated. Facilitation  of  conduction  over  the  accessory  pathway  may produce a marked increase in ventricular rate. Treatment of antidromic AVNRT in patients with stable vital signs includes intravenous  administration  of  procainamide  10  mg/kg  IV infused at a rate not to exceed 50 mg/min. Procainamide slows conduction of cardiac impulses along the accessory pathway and may slow the ventricular response rate and terminate the wide-complex  tachydysrhythmia.  Electrical  cardioversion  is indicated if the ventricular response cannot be controlled by drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation and atrial fl utter are uncommon in WPW syndrome but are potentially lethal because they can result in very rapid ventricular response rates and deteriorate into ventricular fi brillation. Th e mechanism responsible is anterograde conduction from the atria to the ventricles through the accessory  pathway. Th ere  is  no  mechanism  along  the  accessory pathway to slow the conduction speed. Th e result is extremely rapid ventricular rates that o ft en degenerate into ventricular fi brillation and death. Atrial fi brillation in the setting of WPW syndrome  can  be  treated  with  intravenous  procainamide. Verapamil  and  digoxin  are contraindicated in  this  situation because  they  may  actually  accelerate  conduction  through the accessory pathway, making the situation worse. Electrical cardioversion  is  preferred  in  the  presence  of  hemodynamic

instability.  Long-term  management  of  tachydysrhythmias in  patients  with  WPW  syndrome  usually  involves  radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway. Th e procedure is curative in 95% of patients and has a low complication rate. Antidysrhythmic drugs may be used as adjuvant therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with known WPW syndrome coming for surgery should  continue  to  receive  their  antidysrhythmic  medications. Th e goal during management of anesthesia is to avoid any event (e.g., increased sympathetic nervous system activity due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia) or drug (digoxin, verapamil) that could enhance anterograde conduction of cardiac impulses through an accessory pathway. Appropriate antidysrhythmic  drugs  and  equipment  for  electrical  cardioversionde fi brillation must be immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROLONGED QT SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
By de fi nition, a patient with long QT syndrome (LQTS) has a prolongation of the QTc exceeding 460 milliseconds. Th e prolongation of repolarization in LQTS results in a dispersion of refractory periods throughout the myocardium. Th is  abnormality in repolarization allows a ft erdepolarizations to trigger PVCs. Under certain circumstances, the triggered PVCs initiate a ventricular reentry rhythm manifesting as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also known as torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP  is  electrocardiographically  characterized  by  a  "twisting of the peaks" or rotation around the ECG baseline. In other words, there is a constantly changing cycle length, axis, and morphology  of  the  QRS  complexes  around  the  isoelectric baseline during TdP (see Figure 4-6). Th is dysrhythmia may be repetitive, episodic, or sustained and may degenerate into ventricular fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typically, women have longer QT intervals than men. Th is di ff erence is more pronounced at slower heart rates. Th e incidence of congenital and acquired prolonged QT syndromes is  higher  in  women.  Not  surprisingly,  the  incidence  of  TdP is  also  higher  in  women. Th e  strongest predictor of the risk of syncope or sudden death in patients with congenital prolonged QT syndrome is a QTc exceeding 500 milliseconds.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  two  types  of  LQTS:  congenital  and  acquired. Acquired  iatrogenic  LQTS  is  far  more  common  than  the inherited forms of LQTS. Acquired LQTS may be caused by many  prescription  medications  such  as  antibiotics,  antidysrhythmics, antidepressants, and antiemetics. Data suggest that TdP occurs in 1% to 10% of patients receiving QT-prolonging  antidysrhythmic  drugs.  However,  the  incidence  of  TdP is  much  lower  in  patients  receiving  noncardiovascular  QTprolonging drugs. LQTS can be associated with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, severe malnutrition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and intracranial catastrophes such as subarachnoid hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are several genetic syndromes that manifest a long QT interval. Th e  two  most  common are  the  Romano-Ward and  Timothy  syndromes. Th ese  are  inherited  as  autosomal dominant  disorders  and  usually  present  as  syncope  in  late childhood. Manifestations can occur as early as the fi rst year of life or as late as the sixth decade. A rarer autosomal recessive  form  of  prolonged  QT  syndrome,  called Jervell  and Lange-Nielsen  syndrome, is  associated  with  congenital  deafness. Syncope is the hallmark symptom of the inherited forms of prolonged QT syndrome. Th ese syncopal events are commonly associated with stress, emotion, exercise, or other situations that lead to increased sympathetic stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of LQTS includes correction of electrolyte abnormalities, particularly those of magnesium or potassium. Any drugs associated with QT prolongation should be discontinued. Cardiac pacing is a treatment option in LQTS, because TdP is o ft en preceded by bradycardia. Programming a pacemaker to pace at a higher backup rate than usual can prevent the bradycardia that precedes TdP and abort the dysrhythmia. Pacing  is  usually  employed  in  combination  with β -blocker therapy. Studies have shown a considerable reduction in cardiac events and mortality in congenital LQTS patients treated with β -blocker  therapy  (from  50%  to  <5%  over  a  10-year period). In recent years, implantable cardioverter-de fi brillators (ICDs) with pacing capability have emerged as the lifesaving therapy for patients with recurrent symptoms and recalcitrant TdP despite ventricular suppression therapy with β -blockers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A preoperative ECG to rule out LQTS is useful in a patient with a history of unexplained syncope or a family history of sudden death. Th e choice of anesthetic drugs deserves special attention in the case of LQTS, since many common anesthetic drugs  cause  some  prolongation  of  the  QTc.  Iso fl urane  and sevo fl urane  have  been  shown  to  prolong  the  QTc  in  otherwise healthy children and adults. Currently, however, there is insu ffi cient information to favor one volatile anesthetic over another. Droperidol and other antiemetic drugs also increase the  QT  interval.  Events  known  to  prolong  the  QT  interval should  be  avoided,  such  as  abrupt  increases  in  sympathetic stimulation associated with preoperative anxiety and noxious stimulation intraoperatively, acute hypokalemia due to iatrogenic  hyperventilation,  and  administration  of  drugs  known to prolong the QTc. Consideration may be given to establishing β -blockade before induction in patients believed to be at particular risk. A de fi brillator should be available, because the likelihood of perioperative ventricular fi brillation is increased.

MECHANISMS OF BRADYDYSRHYTHMIAS

Sinus Bradycardia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia is de fi ned as a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute (Table 4-3). Trained athletes o ft en exhibit resting bradycardia, as may normal individuals during sleep. However, an inability to increase the heart rate adequately during exercise, bradycardia associated with symptoms (such as syncope,

Chapter 4 ABNORMALITIES OF CARDIAC CONDUCTION AND CARDIAC RHYTHM

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 4-3 ■ Perioperative causes of sinus bradycardia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
dizziness, and chest pain), or a heart rate of less than 40 beats per minute in the absence of physical conditioning or sleep is  considered  abnormal.  Bradydysrhythmias  are  most  commonly caused by SA node dysfunction or dysfunction in the conduction system below the SA node.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysfunction of the SA node, also referred to as sick sinus syndrome, is a common cause of bradycardia. Sick sinus syndrome  with  symptomatic  bradycardia  is  the  most  common reason for insertion of a permanent cardiac pacemaker. Th e prevalence of sinus node dysfunction may be as high as 1 in 600 patients older than 65 years of age. Many patients with sick sinus syndrome are asymptomatic; others experience syncope or palpitations. Episodes of SVT may punctuate periods of bradycardia, which accounts for another common name for sinus node dysfunction: tachycardia-bradycardia (tachy-brady) syndrome. In patients with ischemic heart disease, periods of bradycardia may contribute to the development of congestive heart failure, whereas periods of tachycardia can contribute to the development of hypertension and angina pectoris. Th e rate of progression to second- or third-degree AV heart block in patients with sick sinus syndrome is approximately 1% to 5% per year.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ECG during sinus bradycardia demonstrates a regular rhythm with a normal-appearing P wave before each QRS complex and a heart rate of 60 beats per minute or less. Th e SA node usually fi res between 60 and 100 times per minute and overdrives other potential pacemakers in the heart. However, if the SA node does not fi re, other slower pacemaker cells may take over primary pacemaker function. Th ere is normally a pause in electrical activity before a secondary slower pacemaker begins to fi re. Each group of potential pacemaker cells has an intrinsic rate. Cells near the AV node, so called junctional pacemakers, fi re at 40 to 60 beats per minute. Ventricular cells below the AV node can act as an ectopic pacemaker but fi re at a very slow rate in the range of 30 to 45 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In asymptomatic patients with sinus bradycardia, no treatment  is  required.  However,  these  patients  should  be monitored for worsening bradycardia or hemodynamic deterioration. In mildly symptomatic patients, any potential contributing factors such as excess vagal tone or drugs should be eliminated. In severely symptomatic patients-that is, those with  chest  pain  or  syncope-immediate  transcutaneous  or transvenous pacing is indicated. Atropine 0.5 mg IV every 3  to  5  minutes  (to  a  maximum  of  3  mg)  may  be  given  to increase heart rate but should not delay initiation of pacing. It should be noted that small doses of atropine (<0.5 mg IV) can  cause  a  further slowing of  the  heart  rate.  In  the  event that cardiac pacing is delayed or pacing capabilities are limited, an epinephrine or dopamine infusion may be titrated to response while cardiac pacing is awaited. If atropine is ineffective, glucagon may be useful if the bradycardia is due to β -blocker  or  calcium  channel  blocker  overdose.  Glucagon stimulates  glucagon-speci fi c  receptors  on  the  myocardium that increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and increase myocardial contractility, heart rate, and AV conduction. Suggested dosing of glucagon is 50 to 70 mcg/kg (3 to 5 mg in a 70-kg patient) every 3 to 5 minutes until clinical response is achieved or a total dose of 10 mg is reached. To  maintain  clinical  e ff ect,  this  should  be  followed  with  a continuous infusion at 2 to 10 mg/hr.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia during neuraxial blockade can occur in patients of any age and any American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class, whether or not they are sedated. Th e  incidence of profound bradycardia and cardiac arrest  during  neuraxial  anesthesia  is  approximately  1.5  per 10,000 cases. By contrast, cardiac arrest during general anesthesia occurs at a rate of 5.5 per 10,000 cases. Bradycardia or asystole  may  develop  suddenly  (within  seconds  or  minutes) in a patient with a previously normal or even increased heart rate, or the heart rate slowing may be progressive. Bradycardia can occur at any time during neuraxial blockade but most o ft en occurs approximately an hour a ft er anesthetic administration. Th e risk of bradycardia and asystole may persist into the  postoperative  period  even  a ft er  the  sensory  and  motor blockade has diminished. Oxygen saturation is usually normal before the onset of bradycardia. Approximately half of patients who experience arrest during neuraxial anesthesia complain of shortness of breath, nausea, restlessness, light-headedness, or tingling of the fi ngers and manifest deterioration in mental status before arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  exact  mechanism  responsible  for  bradycardia  and asystole during spinal and epidural anesthesia is not known. One  proposed  mechanism  is  termed  the Bezold-Jarisch response. Th is is  a  paradoxical  re fl ex-induced  bradycardia  resulting  from  decreased  venous  return  and  activation of  vagal  re fl ex  arcs  mediated  by  baroreceptors  and  stretch receptors.  Another  possible  mechanism  is  the  unopposed parasympathetic  nervous  system  activity  that  results  from the  anesthetic-induced  sympathectomy.  Blockade  of  cardiac accelerator fi bers originating from thoracic sympathetic

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ganglia (T1 to T4) may alter the balance of autonomic nervous system input to the heart and lead to relatively unopposed  parasympathetic  in fl uences  on  the  SA  node  and  AV node, which slows the heart rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradydysrhythmias associated with spinal or epidural  anesthesia  should  be  treated  aggressively.  Bradycardia can  occur  despite  prophylactic  therapy  with  atropine  and/ or  intravenous fl uids.  Recalcitrant  bradycardia  necessitates transcutaneous  or  transvenous  pacing.  Secondary  factors such as hypovolemia, opioid administration, sedation, hypercarbia,  concurrent  medical  illnesses,  and  long-term  use  of medications  that  slow  the  heart  rate  can  contribute  to  the development of bradycardia. In the clinical setting of severe bradycardia, preparation should be made for management of asystole, which is treated with CPR. Pharmacologic management should follow  ACLS  protocols  and  include  treatment with atropine, epinephrine, and/or vasopressin as appropriate (Figure 4-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Junctional Rhythm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Junctional or nodal rhythm is due to the activity of a cardiac pacemaker in the tissues surrounding the AV node. Junctional pacemakers  usually  have  an  intrinsic  rate  of  40  to  60  beats per minute. Th e impulse initiated by a junctional pacemaker travels to the ventricles along the normal conduction pathway but can also be conducted retrograde into the atria. Th e site of the junctional pacemaker determines whether the P wave precedes the QRS complex (with a shortened PR interval), follows the QRS complex, or is buried within the QRS complex and is not visible. Th e diagnosis of junctional rhythm may be an incidental fi nding on ECG. Junctional rhythm can be suspected if on physical examination the jugular venous pulsation shows cannon a waves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the junctional rhythm has an accelerated rate, it is called a junctional  tachycardia or accelerated nodal  (junctional)

rhythm. Junctional tachycardia is a narrow-complex tachycardia at a rate usually lower than 120 beats per minute. Junctional rhythms can cause AV dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, and in some circumstances rapid ventricular rates. Th is  can result  in  symptoms  such  as  fatigue,  generalized  weakness, angina  pectoris,  impaired  cardiac  output,  congestive  heart failure, pulmonary edema, and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Junctional  rhythm  can  occur  in  association  with  many  different  disorders.  It  is  o ft en  an  escape  rhythm  because  of depressed sinus node function, SA block, or delayed conduction in the AV node. Junctional tachycardia can result from increased automaticity of junctional tissues in the setting of digitalis toxicity or cardiac ischemia. Junctional rhythm that occurs in association with myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, or digitalis toxicity should be managed by treating the underlying disorder. Junctional rhythms are not uncommon during general anesthesia using halogenated anesthetic vapors and, in this setting, require no treatment. Even in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, junctional rhythms are usually considered  benign  and  require  no  treatment.  However,  in  certain patients the loss of AV synchrony during a junctional rhythm will result in myocardial ischemia, heart failure, or hypotension. Atropine at a dose of 0.5 mg can be used to accelerate the heart rate if a slow junctional rhythm becomes hemodynamically signi fi cant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONDUCTION DISTURBANCES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conduction disturbances are usually classi fi ed by the site and degree of blockade. An intact cardiac conduction system normally ensures conduction of each sinus impulse from the atria to the ventricles. Abnormalities of the conduction system can disrupt this process and lead to heart block. Assessing the site of the conduction abnormality and the risk of progression to complete heart block are core issues in treating a patient with heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  variety  of  acute  and  chronic  conditions  can  cause  or contribute  to  heart  block. Th ese  include  acute  myocardial infarction (especially in the distribution of the right coronary artery),  digitalis  toxicity,  excessive β -blockade  or  calcium channel blockade, myocarditis, rheumatic fever, mononucleosis, Lyme disease, and in fi ltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis and amyloidosis.

First-Degree Atrioventricular Heart Block

SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
First-degree AV block is de fi ned as a PR interval of longer than 0.2 seconds. Each P wave is conducted and has a corresponding QRS complex of normal duration. Th ere is a delay in the passage of the cardiac impulse through the AV node. First-degree AV block is o ft en a result of minor degenerative changes in the cardiac conduction system that accompany normal aging. Other causes include myocardial ischemia (involving the blood supply to the AV node), inferior wall myocardial infarction, drugs a ff ecting AV node conduction (digitalis and amiodarone), and processes that enhance parasympathetic nervous system activity and vagal tone. First-degree AV block can be found in patients with and without structural heart disease. Patients with fi rst-degree AV block are usually asymptomatic and appear to have no significant increase in mortality compared with matched controls. Th e Framingham Heart Study followed long-term outcomes of individuals with fi rst-degree heart block, and the results suggested an increased risk of atrial fi brillation in this population.

PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management of the patient with fi rst-degree heart block  should  be  aimed  at  avoiding  any  clinical  situation  or drug that increases vagal tone or slows AV conduction. Atropine administration can speed conduction of cardiac impulses through the AV node. However, in patients with signi fi cant heart disease, the increase in heart rate produced by atropine may contribute to myocardial ischemia. In patients with risk factors  such  as  coronary  ischemia  and  systemic  infection, these clinical conditions should be treated and medically optimized before surgery. Digoxin levels should be checked before surgery, and serum potassium should be maintained at normal levels in patients receiving digoxin.

Second-Degree Atrioventricular Heart Block

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Second-degree  AV  block  can  be  suspected  when  a  P  wave is  present  without  a  corresponding  QRS  complex.  Seconddegree  AV  heart  block  can  be  categorized  as  Mobitz  type  I (Wenckebach) block or Mobitz type II block. Mobitz type I block shows progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a beat is entirely blocked (dropped beat) followed by a repeat of this sequence. In contrast, Mobitz type II block is characterized  by  sudden  and  complete  interruption  of  conduction (dropped QRS) without PR prolongation. Mobitz type II block is usually associated with permanent damage to the conduction system and may progress to third-degree block, especially in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) block demonstrates progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a beat is dropped. Th is type of block is o ft en transient and asymptomatic. It is thought to  occur  because  each  successive  depolarization  produces  a prolongation  of  the  refractory  period  of  the  AV  node. Th is process continues until an atrial impulse reaches the AV node during its absolute refractory period and conduction of that impulse is blocked completely. A pause allows the AV node to recover and then the process resumes. Th e prognosis for Mobitz type I block is good, since reliable secondary pacemakers in the AV node usually take over pacing duties and maintain adequate cardiac output. Mobitz type I block does not require treatment unless the decreased ventricular rate results in signs of hypoperfusion. Symptomatic patients may be treated with atropine as needed. If atropine is unsuccessful, pacing may be indicated. Mobitz type I block can be a result of myocardial

ischemia or infarction, myocardial fi brosis or calci fi cation, or in fi ltrative  or  in fl ammatory  diseases  of  the  myocardium,  or can occur a ft er cardiothoracic surgery. It can also be associated with the use of certain drugs such as calcium channel blockers, β -blockers, digoxin, and sympatholytic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mobitz type II block is a complete interruption in the conduction of a cardiac impulse, usually at a point below the AV node in the bundle of His or in a bundle branch. Mobitz type II  block  is  usually symptomatic, with  palpitations  and  near syncope being common complaints. Mobitz type II block has a  less  favorable  prognosis  because  there  is  a  substantial  risk of progression to third-degree AV block. Reliable secondary pacemakers are not present in Mobitz type II block or in thirddegree heart block, because these disorders are associated with serious disease involving the infranodal conduction system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapeutic  decisions  for  patients  with  second-degree  heart block depend on the ventricular response and the symptoms of the patient. Th e heart rate in Mobitz type I block is usually good and rarely does it progress to third-degree heart block. In the presence of an acceptable ventricular rate and an adequate cardiac output, no treatment is needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mobitz type II block has a high rate of progression to thirddegree heart block and can manifest as a slow escape rhythm insu ffi cient to sustain an acceptable cardiac output. Placement of a cardiac pacemaker is necessary under these circumstances. Treatment for Mobitz type II block includes transcutaneous or transvenous cardiac pacing. Atropine is unlikely to improve bradycardia caused by Mobitz type II block.

Bundle Branch Blocks

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conduction disturbances at various levels of the His-Purkinje system are called bundle branch blocks or intraventricular conduction defects. Bundle branch blocks can be chronic or intermittent. Intraventricular conduction disturbances are usually associated with signi fi cant structural heart disease, especially dilated cardiomyopathies. Th ey are a marker of poor prognosis, both in terms of heart failure and increased mortality.

RIGHT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RBBB is present in approximately 1% of hospitalized adult patients. It does not always imply cardiac disease and is o ft en of no clinical signi fi cance. In patients without structural heart disease, RBBB is more common than LBBB. However, RBBB can be associated with structural heart disease such as atrial septal defect, valvular heart disease, and ischemic heart disease. Th e intraventricular conduction delay resulting from RBBB is seldom symptomatic and rarely progresses to advanced AV block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RBBB is due to a disruption of the cardiac impulse as it travels over the RBB. It is recognized on the ECG by a widened QRS complex (>0.1 second in duration) and an rSR ′ con fi guration in leads V 1 and V 2 . Th ere is also a deep S wave in leads I and V6 . Bifascicular heart block is present when RBBB exists in combination with block of either the le ft anterior or le ft posterior fascicle of the LBB. RBBB in association with le ft anterior hemiblock  is  more  common  than  RBBB  with  le ft posterior hemiblock. Th is is because anatomically the posterior fascicle usually has a dual blood supply, whereas the anterior fascicle does not. Indications of RBBB with le ft anterior hemiblock are present on approximately 1% of all adult ECGs. Th e combination of RBBB and le ft posterior hemiblock is infrequent, and each year approximately 1% to 2% of patients with this form of block show progression to third-degree heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute treatment of RBBB or RBBB with le ft anterior hemiblock consists of observation and elimination of drugs or clinical factors known to contribute to conduction disturbances. Pacing capability should be available in the event of progression to complete heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  theoretical  concern  in  patients  with  bifascicular  heart block is that perioperative events (changes in blood pressure, arterial oxygenation, serum electrolyte concentrations) might compromise impulse conduction in the remaining fascicle and lead to third-degree heart block. Th ere is no evidence, however,  that  surgery  performed  with  general  or  regional  anesthesia predisposes patients with preexisting bifascicular heart block to the development of third-degree heart block. Prophylactic placement of a cardiac pacemaker is not necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LEFT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LBBB is recognized on the ECG as a QRS complex of longer than 0.12 seconds in duration and the absence of Q waves in leads I and V 6 . Abnormal conduction of impulses through the fascicles of the LBB can be characterized as unifascicularthat is,  a  hemiblock-or as complete. Block of the le ft anterior  fascicle  is  the  most  common  hemiblock.  Le ft posterior hemiblock is uncommon because the posterior fascicle of the LBB is larger and better perfused than the anterior fascicle. Although hemiblock is a form of intraventricular heart block, the duration of the QRS complex is normal or only minimally prolonged when a hemiblock is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LBBB, in contrast to RBBB, has more ominous clinical implications.  LBBB  is  o ft en  associated  with  ischemic  heart  disease, hypertension,  and  valvular  heart  disease.  Patients  with  isolated LBBB rarely show progression to advanced AV block. Th e appearance of LBBB has been observed during anesthesia, particularly during hypertensive or tachycardic episodes, and may be a sign of myocardial ischemia. It is very di ffi cult to diagnose a myocardial infarction by ECG in the presence of LBBB, because ST-segment and T-wave changes (repolarization abnormalities) are already present as part of the bundle branch block pattern. An SVT can be mistaken for ventricular tachycardia in a patient with LBBB because the QRS complexes are characteristically wide.

cardiomyopathy.  Treatment  of  these  contributing  disorders can  decrease  the  incidence  of  LBBB  in  susceptible  patients. Isolated LBBB is o ft en asymptomatic, and some patients have LBBB only a ft er a critical heart rate is reached.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  LBBB  has  special  implications  if  insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter is planned. Th ird-degree heart  block  can  occur  if  the  central  catheter  induces  RBBB in a patient with preexisting LBBB. RBBB (usually transient) occurs  during  insertion  of  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter  in approximately 2% to 5% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Third-Degree Atrioventricular Heart Block

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ird-degree heart block, also known as complete heart block, is  the  complete  interruption  of  AV  conduction. Th ere  is  no conduction of cardiac impulses from the atria to the ventricles. Continued activity of the ventricles is due to impulses from an ectopic pacemaker distal to the site of the conduction block. If  the  conduction  block  is  near  the  AV  node,  the  heart  rate is usually 45 to 55 beats per minute and the QRS complex is narrow.  When  the  conduction  block  is  below  the  AV  node (infranodal), the heart rate is usually 30 to 40 beats per minute and the QRS complex is wide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  with  isolated  chronic  RBBB,  the  progression to complete AV block is rare. Patients with bifascicular block (RBBB and le ft anterior or posterior fascicular block) or complete  LBBB have a 6% incidence of progression to complete heart block. In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, the development  of  new  bifascicular  block  plus fi rst-degree  AV block is associated with a very high risk (40%) of progression to  complete heart block. Approximately 8% of patients with acute  inferior  wall  myocardial  infarction  develop  complete heart block. It is usually transient, although it may last for several  days. Th ese  patients  should  undergo  temporary  cardiac pacing.  ECG  evidence  of  alternating  bundle  branch  blocks, even if asymptomatic, is a sign of advanced conduction system disease and an indication for permanent pacing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e onset of third-degree AV block may be signaled by an episode of vertigo or syncope. Other symptoms include weakness and dyspnea. A syncopal episode caused by third-degree heart block is called a Stokes-Adams attack. Congestive heart failure can occur from the decreased cardiac output and bradycardia that accompanies third-degree AV block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common cause of third-degree AV block in adults is fi brotic degeneration of the distal cardiac conduction system associated  with  aging  (Lenègre's  disease).  Degenerative  and calci fi c changes in more proximal conduction tissue adjacent to the mitral valve annulus can also interrupt cardiac conduction (Lev's disease).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Caution must be exercised when administering antidysrhythmic drugs to patients with third-degree AV block before pacemaker placement, because the drugs may suppress the ectopic ventricular pacemaker that is responsible for maintaining the heart rate. Treatment of third-degree AV block during anesthesia consists of transcutaneous or transvenous cardiac pacing.  If  the  block  persists,  placement  of  a  permanent  cardiac pacemaker is indicated. Preoperative placement of a transvenous pacemaker or the availability of transcutaneous cardiac pacing is  necessary  before  an  anesthetic  is  administered  for insertion  of  a  permanent  cardiac  pacemaker.  Isoproterenol may be needed to maintain an acceptable heart rate and act as  a  "chemical  pacemaker"  until  a  permanent  pacemaker  is implanted and functional.

TREATMENT OF CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antidysrhythmic Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antidysrhythmic drugs are administered when correction of identi fi able  precipitating  events  is  not  su ffi cient  to  suppress dysrhythmias. Th ese  drugs  act  by  altering  various  electrophysiologic  characteristics  of  myocardial  cells. Th e  majority of antidysrhythmia drugs work by one of three mechanisms: (1) suppressing automaticity in pacemaker cells by decreasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, (2) prolonging the e ff ective refractory period to eliminate reentry circuits, or (3) facilitating impulse conduction along normal conduction pathways to prevent conduction over a reentrant pathway. ECG changes, such as an increased PR interval or a prolonged QRS duration, are  relatively  common  side  e ff ects  of  antidysrhythmic  drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal  physiologic  parameters  should  be  corrected before  initiating  antidysrhythmic  drug  therapy  or  inserting a cardiac pacemaker. Establishment of physiologic acid-base values, normalization of serum electrolyte concentrations, and stabilization of autonomic nervous system activity are important  and  maximize  the  possibility  of  reestablishing  normal sinus rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ADENOSINE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenosine is formed by serial dephosphorylation of adenosine  triphosphate.  It  is  an α -agonist  and  the  drug  of  choice for  pharmacologic  termination  of  hemodynamically  stable AVNRT. Sixty percent of patients respond at a dose of 6 mg, and an additional 32% of patients respond at a dose of 12 mg. Its  therapeutic  e ff ect  is  short,  lasting  approximately  10  seconds. Th is  extremely short half-life results from rapid active transport of the drug into red blood cells and endothelial cells, where it is metabolized. To be e ff ective, adenosine should be injected rapidly and fl ushed quickly through the intravenous tubing with saline.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common side e ff ects of adenosine include facial fl ushing, dyspnea, and chest pressure. Generally, these e ff ects are transient, lasting less than 60 seconds. Less common side e ff ects include nausea, light-headedness, headache, sweating, palpitations, hypotension, and blurred vision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
adenosine.  On  the  other  hand,  dipyridamole  pretreatment increases  the  potency  of  adenosine.  Carbamazepine  also potentiates  the  action  of  adenosine.  Patients  with  a  heart transplant require only one third to one fift h the usual dose of  adenosine  because  the  transplanted  heart  is  denervated. Administration  of  adenosine  is  contraindicated  in  patients with sick sinus syndrome and second- or third-degree heart block unless the patient has a functioning cardiac pacemaker.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ATROPINE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atropine  sulfate  is  a  vagolytic  drug  that  is  a  competitive antagonist at muscarinic cholinergic receptor sites. It is used to  increase  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure.  Potential  adverse side  e ff ects  of  atropine  administration  include  tachycardia, sedation  (especially  in  the  elderly),  urinary  retention,  and increased  intraocular  pressure  in  patients  with  closed-angle glaucoma. Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  atropine  is  detrimental to the treatment of asystolic arrest or pulseless electrical activity.  However,  evidence  does  not  support  any  clinical  bene fi t from atropine use in these situations. Th erefore,  it  has  been removed  from  ACLS  recommendations  for  pharmacologic treatment of asystole and pulseless electrical activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atropine is  recommended in the treatment of symptomatic  bradycardia  as  a  temporizing  measure  while  awaiting initiation of transcutaneous or transvenous pacing. Th e  recommended dose is 0.5 mg IV every 3 to 5 minutes as needed to a maximum total dose of 3 mg. Doses of less than 0.5 mg in  adults  can  worsen  bradycardia.  Heart  rate  e ff ects  appear within seconds of administration and last 15 to 30 minutes. Atropine is not e ff ective in patients who have undergone cardiac transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AMIODARONE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amiodarone  is  an  antidysrhythmic  structurally  similar  to thyroxine  and  procainamide.  It  acts  on  sodium,  potassium, and  calcium  channels  to  produce α -  and β -blocking  e ff ects that  result  in  prolongation  of  the  refractory  period  in  myocardial cells. Amiodarone is useful in controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial fi brillation. It is also indicated for treatment of ventricular fi brillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia unresponsive to de fi brillation, CPR, and vasopressors. In this situation, amiodarone improves the likelihood of successful  de fi brillation.  Amiodarone  is  metabolized  in  the liver and slows the metabolism and increases the blood levels of other drugs metabolized by the liver, such as warfarin, digoxin,  diltiazem,  quinidine,  procainamide,  disopyramide, mexiletine, and propafenone. Th e dose recommended for cardiac arrest unresponsive to CPR, de fi brillation, and vasopressor therapy is an initial dose of 300 mg IV . It can be followed by a second dose of 150 mg IV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -ADRENERGIC BLOCKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers  ameliorate  the  e ff ects  of  circulating  catecholamines and decrease heart rate and blood pressure. Th ese cardioprotective e ff ects are particularly important in patients  with  acute  coronary  syndromes. β -Blockers  are indicated in patients with preserved le ft ventricular function who  require  ventricular  rate  control  in  atrial fi brillation, atrial fl utter, and narrow-complex tachycardias originating at or above the AV node.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Side e ff ects of β -blockade include bradycardia, AV conduction delays, and hypotension. Contraindications to β -blocker therapy include second- or third-degree heart block, hypotension, severe congestive heart failure, and reactive airway disease. β -Blockers should not be used in the treatment of atrial fi brillation  or  atrial fl utter  associated with WPW syndrome, since  they  may  contribute  to  clinical  deterioration  in  this situation by decreasing conduction through the AV node and speeding conduction through the accessory bypass tract.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Verapamil and diltiazem are calcium channel blockers. Verapamil inhibits the in fl ux of extracellular calcium across myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. It inhibits vascular smooth muscle contraction and causes marked vasodilation in coronary and other peripheral vascular beds.. Verapamil slows conduction and increases refractoriness of the AV node and is useful in controlling ventricular rate in patients with  atrial  tachydysrhythmias  and  in  terminating  reentrant dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Verapamil is indicated for the treatment of narrow-complex tachycardia (SVT) in patients in whom vagal maneuvers and adenosine therapy have failed. It is also indicated for ventricular rate control with atrial fl utter or atrial fi brillation. It is contraindicated in patients with an accessory bypass tract, such  as  those  with  WPW  syndrome,  since  it  can  accelerate conduction through the accessory tract and thereby increase the ventricular rate to dangerously high levels. Calcium channel blockers have negative inotropic properties and should be avoided in patients with le ft ventricular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Verapamil can prolong the PR interval and is not e ff ective in treating tachycardias originating below the AV node. Th e initial dose of verapamil is typically 2.5 to 5 mg IV over 2 minutes. Th is can be repeated if needed to a maximum total dose of 0.15 mg/kg. Hemodynamic e ff ects peak in 5 minutes and persist for 20 to 30 minutes. If calcium channel blockers are administered to patients already receiving β -blockers, additive e ff ects can result in iatrogenic second- or third-degree heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diltiazem has a similar mechanism of action and similar clinical indications as verapamil. However, diltiazem has less negative inotropic e ff ect and causes less peripheral vasodilation than verapamil. Th e degree of AV node inhibition is similar  for  both  drugs. Th e  recommended dose for diltiazem is 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes. Th is can be repeated if needed. Successful dysrhythmia treatment can be followed by a maintenance infusion at 5 to 15 mg/hr.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIGOXIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that was approved by the FDA in 1952 and has been used since that time for the treatment of congestive heart failure and atrial fi brillation. Digoxin inhibits

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the myocardial cell membrane Na + ,K + -ATPase pump. Useful pharmacologic  e ff ects  of  digoxin  include  positive  inotropy, slowing of conduction through the AV node, and lengthening of the refractory period of the AV node.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e inotropic e ff ects of digoxin are due to an increase in intracellular  calcium  that  allows  for  greater  activation  of contractile  proteins.  In  addition  to  having  positive  inotropic e ff ects, digoxin also increases phase 4 depolarization and shortens the action potential. Th is decreases conduction velocity through the AV node and prolongs the AV nodal refractory period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Digoxin  is  e ff ective  in  controlling  the  ventricular  rate  in atrial fi brillation, although it does not convert atrial fi brillation to sinus rhythm. Onset of therapeutic e ff ects a ft er intravenous administration of digoxin occurs in 5 to 30 minutes, with the peak e ff ect at 2 to 6 hours a ft er injection. Digoxin has a low therapeutic/toxic ratio (therapeutic index), especially in the presence of hypokalemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High  serum  digoxin  levels  can  cause  a  variety  of  symptoms and signs, including life-threatening dysrhythmias. Coexisting disease states that can contribute to digoxin toxicity include hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, and renal dysfunction. A digoxin-speci fi c antibody is available for treatment of severe digitalis toxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DOPAMINE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dopamine  is  a  catecholamine  precursor  to  norepinephrine and epinephrine present in nerve terminals and the adrenal medulla. It has direct dose-related e ff ects on α , β , and dopaminergic receptors. At low doses (3 to 5 mcg/kg/min), dopamine increases renal, mesenteric, coronary, and cerebral blood fl ow through the activation of dopaminergic receptors. At moderate doses (5 to 7 mcg/kg/min), β e ff ects predominate, producing increased heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. At high doses (>10 mcg/kg/min), α receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction and a reduction in renal blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dopamine is a second-line drug for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to atropine. Like atropine, it should be considered a temporizing measure while awaiting initiation of transcutaneous or transvenous pacing. Th e dose recommended in this situation is 2 to 10 mcg/kg/min titrated to heart rate response. Caution must be exercised if infusion is through a peripheral intravenous line, because skin necrosis can result from extravasation at the injection site.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EPINEPHRINE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epinephrine  is  a  catecholamine  produced  by  the  adrenal medulla.  Epinephrine  is  a  potent  mast  cell  stabilizer  and bronchodilator and is useful in the treatment of severe bronchospasm and anaphylactic reactions. It is also a potent vasopressor that is useful during CPR. Its clinical e ff ects vary with dosage. Increased contractility and heart rate occur at all dosages,  but  the  e ff ect  on  systemic  vascular  resistance  is  dose dependant. At low dosages (10 to 150 mcg/kg/min) the systemic vascular resistance may decrease or stay the same, but at high dosages (>150 mcg/kg/min) the systemic vascular resistance increases. Th e α e ff ects of epinephrine can be bene fi cial during CPR to increase coronary and cerebral perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epinephrine is indicated in the treatment of cardiac arrest because of its α -adrenergic vasoconstrictor properties. Studies have shown a higher likelihood of return to spontaneous circulation in patients treated with epinephrine than in those not  given  epinephrine  during  cardiac  arrest  from  sustained ventricular fi brillation, pulseless electrical activity, or asystole.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e suggested dose is 1 mg IV every 3 to 5 minutes during adult cardiac arrest. Occasionally, larger doses may be needed to treat cardiac arrest resulting from β -blocker or calcium channel  blocker  overdose.  Epinephrine  should  be  given  through central venous catheters if at all possible, because extravasation from a peripheral intravenous line can cause tissue necrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  the  intravenous  route,  epinephrine  can  be administered by the intratracheal route. Th e dose for intratracheal use is 2 to 2.5 mg diluted in 5 to 10 mL of sterile water (which  provides  better  drug  absorption  than  saline).  Other drugs  that  may  be  given  intratracheally  include  lidocaine, atropine, naloxone, and vasopressin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epinephrine  is  a  second-line  drug  in  the  treatment  of symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to atropine. Th e recommended dosage is an infusion of 2 to 10 mcg/min titrated to heart rate response. Like atropine, it should be considered a temporizing measure while awaiting initiation of transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ISOPROTERENOL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Isoproterenol  is  a  potent  bronchodilator  and  sympathomimetic structurally similar to epinephrine. Functionally, it has potent β 1 - and β 2 -agonist actions but lacks any α -adrenergic properties. Th e actions of isoproterenol are mediated intracellularly  by  cAMP.  Stimulation  of β 1 receptors  produces positive inotropic and chronotropic e ff ects. Characteristically isoproterenol administration causes the systolic blood pressure to increase and the diastolic blood pressure to decrease. Th is  is  attributed  to  drug-induced  peripheral  vasodilation. Th is  vasodilatory  e ff ect  does  increase  coronary  blood fl ow, but  the  increased  oxygen  demand  resulting  from  a  higher heart  rate  outweighs  the  potential  bene fi t  of  any  increase in  myocardial  blood fl ow.  Isoproterenol  increases  myocardial  excitability  and  automaticity,  which  potentially  favors dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Isoproterenol  is  a  second-line  drug  in  the  treatment  of symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to atropine. Th e recommended dosage is 2 to 10 mcg/min by continuous infusion titrated to heart rate e ff ect.  Because of its  direct  action on β receptors,  isoproterenol  is  useful  to  treat  symptomatic bradycardia in heart transplant recipients. An initial intravenous dosage of 1 mcg/min is titrated slowly upward until the desired e ff ect is achieved.

LIDOCAINE

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anesthetic commonly employed in regional anesthetic nerve blockade.  However,  the  same  sodium  channel-blocking e ff ects  that  make  it  a  good  local  anesthetic  make  it  a  useful antidysrhythmic drug when administered intravenously. Lidocaine  may  be  used  in  the  treatment  of  cardiac  arrest associated with ventricular fi brillation or pulseless ventricular  tachycardia  if  amiodarone  is  not  available. Th e  recommended dose is 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg IV. If ventricular fi brillation or  pulseless  ventricular  tachycardia  persists,  half  this  dose can be repeated at 5- to 10-minute intervals to a maximum total  dose  of  3  mg/kg. Th erapeutic  doses  of  lidocaine  have minimal negative inotropic e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lidocaine  is  rapidly  redistributed  out  of  the  plasma  and myocardium,  so  multiple  loading  doses  may  be  needed  to achieve therapeutic blood levels. Clinical duration of action is 15 to 30 minutes a ft er a loading dose. To sustain therapeutic e ff ect, lidocaine must be administered by continuous infusion (1  to  4  mg/min).  When  administered  in  combination  with other antidysrhythmic drugs, lidocaine can cause some myocardial depression or sinus node dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During lidocaine  therapy,  monitoring  of  mental  status  is desirable, because the fi rst signs of toxicity are usually central nervous system symptoms such as tinnitus, drowsiness, dysarthria, or confusion. At higher blood levels, signs of central nervous system depression such as sedation and respiratory depression predominate and may be accompanied by seizures. Lidocaine undergoes extensive fi rst-pass hepatic metabolism, so  clinical  conditions  that  result  in  decreased  hepatic  blood fl ow, such as general anesthesia, congestive heart failure, liver disease, and advanced age, can result in higher than normal blood levels. Certain drugs such as cimetidine can also cause an increase in the plasma concentration of lidocaine.

MAGNESIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium functions in the body as a cofactor in the control of  sodium and potassium transport. With regard to its antidysrhythmic properties, there are a few observational studies supporting the use of magnesium in the termination of TdP ventricular tachycardia associated  with  QT  prolongation. However, there is no evidence that magnesium is e ff ective in treating ventricular tachycardia associated with a normal QT interval.  In  ventricular fi brillation  or  pulseless  ventricular tachycardia associated with TdP , magnesium can be given in a dose of 1 to 2 g over 5 minutes. If a pulse is present with the torsade, then the same dose can be administered, but more slowly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROCAINAMIDE

Procainamide is an antidysrhythmic drug that slows conduction, decreases automaticity, and increases the refractoriness of myocardial cells. It can be used in patients with preserved ventricular function to treat the following conditions: ventricular tachycardia with a pulse, atrial fl utter or fi brillation, atrial fi brillation in WPW syndrome, and SVT resistant to adenosine and vagal maneuvers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Procainamide can be administered at a rate  of  50  mg/ min  IV  until  the  dysrhythmia  is  suppressed,  significant hypotension occurs, or the QRS complex is prolonged by 50%.  The  duration  of  action  after  a  bolus  dose  is  2  to  4 hours. Procainamide must be used with caution in patients with QT prolongation and in combination with other drugs that  prolong  the  QT  interval.  To  maintain  therapeutic effect,  procainamide  can  be  given  as  a  maintenance  infusion at a rate of 1 to 4 mg/min. Dosage should be reduced in renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SOTALOL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sotalol is a nonselective β -blocker. It prolongs the duration of the action potential and increases the refractoriness of cardiac cells. Sotalol can be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia  and  atrial fi brillation  or  atrial fl utter  in  patients  with WPW syndrome. Th e  dose is  1.5  mg/kg IV over 5 minutes. Potential  side  e ff ects  include  bradycardia,  hypotension,  and QT prolongation.

VASOPRESSIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasopressin is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that works independently  of α -  or β -adrenergic  mechanisms.  It  is  an endogenous  antidiuretic  hormone  that  in  high  concentrations produces direct peripheral vasoconstriction by activating  smooth  muscle  vasopressin  (V 1 )  receptors.  Currently, epinephrine and vasopressin are recommended interchangeably to treat cardiac arrest. If vasopressin is chosen, the dose is 40 units IV . Vasopressin may replace the fi rst or second dose of epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest. Vasopressin therapy may be useful in maintaining systemic vascular resistance in patients who have severe sepsis or acidosis or have undergone  cardiopulmonary  bypass  when  other  drug  treatments have failed.

TWENTY-PERCENT LIPID EMULSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infusion  of  lipid  emulsion  has  been  shown  to  increase  the survival  of  rats  and  mice  following  bupivacaine  overdose. Th e fi rst reported case of its use in an adult human to successfully  treat  a  bupivacaine-related  cardiac  arrest  was  in 2006. Since then, with accumulation of more data and experience,  "lipid  rescue"  had  become  a  widely  accepted  treatment. More study and experience are needed to standardize optimal dosing. However, the suggested initial dose is 1 mL/ kg over 1 minute while chest compressions and related ACLS maneuvers are continued. Th e dose can be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mL/kg. A ft er conversion to sinus rhythm, a maintenance infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min is suggested until hemodynamic recovery occurs. Th is therapy has been used successfully in resuscitation of patients experiencing cardiac arrest resulting from local anesthetics other than bupivacaine.

Transcutaneous Pacing

Th e fi rst external pacemaker was developed in the early 1950s by Boston cardiologist Paul M. Zoll. Although it represented a  huge  technologic  advance  for  modern  science,  the  device

<!-- PAGE=? -->
was impractical for long-term use because of the high current required, the skin irritation caused by the delivery pads, and signi fi cant patient discomfort during pacing. Th ese limitations of transcutaneous pacing are still valid for the current generation of transcutaneous pacers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  transcutaneous  pacing  is  needed,  the  chest  and  back electrodes should be placed over areas of lower skeletal muscle  mass,  and  low-density  constant-current  impulses  should be delivered. Th is improves the likelihood of e ff ective cardiac stimulation and minimizes painful skeletal muscle or cutaneous stimulation. Despite its drawbacks, transcutaneous pacing is  an  e ff ective  temporizing  measure  to  treat  bradydysrhythmias until a transvenous pacemaker can be placed or a more permanent mode of cardiac pacing can be implemented.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrical Cardioversion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrical cardioversion is  the  delivery  of  an  electrical  discharge synchronized to the R wave of the ECG. Th e purpose of cardioversion is to recoordinate the electrical pathways of the heart by delivering a single dominant burst of electricity on the R wave of the ECG. Th e electrical discharge or "shock" is transmitted through two chest electrodes con fi gured as handheld paddles or adhesive pads on the chest in the anterior and apical positions or in the anterior and posterior positions. Th e shock is coordinated with the R wave on the ECG so that the stimulus is not delivered during the relative refractory period of  the  ventricle-that  is,  during  the  T  wave-to  prevent  the R-on-T phenomenon and its associated ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synchronized cardioversion is used to treat acute unstable supraventricular tachycardias (such as SVT, atrial fl utter, and atrial fi brillation) and to convert chronic stable rate-controlled atrial fl utter or atrial fi brillation to sinus rhythm. Cardioversion  can  also  be  used  to  treat  monomorphic  ventricular tachycardia  with  a  pulse  present.  Of  note,  digitalis-induced dysrhythmias  are  refractory  to  cardioversion,  and  attempts at  cardioversion in this situation could trigger more serious ventricular dysrhythmias. Digitalis-induced dysrhythmias should be treated by correction of acid-base status and electrolyte abnormalities, and administration of digitalis-binding antibody if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with atrial fi brillation, cardioversion carries the risk of systemic embolization. Th erefore, it is recommended that elective cardioversion be preceded  by anticoagulation if the dysrhythmia has been present for longer than 48 hours. Before elective cardioversion, patients fast for at least 6 hours and electrolyte imbalances are corrected. Normally, elective cardioversion is performed under intravenous sedation-amnesia or very brief general anesthesia with standard monitoring.  Propofol  and  short-acting  benzodiazepines  are commonly used for this procedure. Antidysrhythmic drugs, advanced  airway  equipment,  and  emergency  cardiac  pacing-de fi brillation  devices  should  be  immediately  available, because  ventricular  ectopy  or  bradycardia  can  occur  a ft er cardioversion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Defibrillation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In contrast to cardioversion, electrical de fi brillation is used to correct dysrhythmias when it is not possible or reasonable to synchronize the electrical current to the ECG because there is no R wave (no de fi ned QRS complexes) or the patient is pulseless. Th e position of the paddles or pads is the same as for cardioversion. De fi brillation-cardioversion electrodes should not be placed directly over pacemakers or ICD pulse generators. Delivery of a high current near a pacemaker or ICD can cause the  device  to  malfunction  and  can  block  and/or  divert  the current path and result in suboptimal current delivery to the myocardium. In addition, all permanently implanted cardiac devices should be evaluated a ft er de fi brillation or cardioversion to ensure proper function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maximizing the success of de fi brillation involves decreasing  thoracic  impedance,  positioning  the  electrodes  properly, and selecting proper electrode size. When transthoracic impedance is too high, an energy shock will not achieve de fi -brillation. De fi brillation electrodes come in several sizes, and as a rule of thumb, it is best to use the largest pads available that  can fi t  on  the  chest  and  not  overlap.  To  reduce  impedance, conductive gels should always be used with de fi brillation paddles.  Self-adhesive  de fi brillation  pads  have  an  integrated conductive surface that reduces impedance. In some patients, electrode contact with the skin can be suboptimal and leave gaps or air pockets between the de fi brillator paddles and the skin. Th e  air  interface  increases  impedance and can be very dangerous, because the electrical charge can ignite in an oxygen-rich environment. Routine use of self-adhesive de fi brillation pads or gel pads with paddles and attention to elimination of air pockets at the interface can minimize the risk of current arcing and fi re. At times, particularly in an excessively hairy patient, the pad area may need to be shaved to achieve good electrode contact. In addition to the impedance caused by the chest wall (the skin and fat overlying the bone), the electrical current encounters some increase in impedance from air spaces within the lung tissue in the current path. Th e de fi brillator current is therefore ideally delivered when the lungs are de fl ated, that is, during exhalation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Modern de fi brillators are classi fi ed according to the type of waveform delivered and may be monophasic or biphasic. Th e fi rst-generation de fi brillators were monophasic. Most modern de fi brillators are biphasic devices. Neither type of de fi brillator has been shown to be more successful in terminating pulseless rhythms or improving survival. A current dose of 360 J is indicated for transthoracic de fi brillation using a monophasic de fi brillator. Biphasic de fi brillators deliver lower currents (120 to 200 J) than monophasic devices. Th e optimal energy dose delivered  by  a  biphasic  de fi brillator  is  not  standardized;  the manufacturer of each device has dose suggestions speci fi c to its equipment. In the absence of a recommended dose, 200 J should be used. Th e single most important factor determining survival a ft er cardiac arrest due to ventricular fi brillation is the time between arrest and the fi rst de fi brillation attempt. In witnessed cardiac arrest  due  to  ventricular fi brillation,  patients

Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  radiofrequency  catheter  ablation,  an  intracardiac  electrode catheter inserted percutaneously under local anesthesia through  a  large  vein  (femoral,  subclavian,  internal  jugular, or cephalic) is used to produce small, well-demarcated areas of thermal injury that destroy the myocardial tissue responsible for initiation or maintenance of dysrhythmias. Cardiac dysrhythmias  amenable  to  radiofrequency  catheter  ablation include  reentrant  supraventricular  dysrhythmias  and  some ventricular dysrhythmias. Radiofrequency catheter ablation is usually considered a ft er pharmacologic therapy has failed or has not been tolerated by the patient. Th e procedure is usually performed under conscious sedation with routine monitoring.

Permanently Implanted Cardiac Pacemakers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst  successful  human  cardiac  pacemaker  implantation in the United States was performed in Bu ff alo, New York, by Dr. William Chardack in 1960. Permanent cardiac pacing was originally  designed  for  the  management  of  Stokes-Adams (syncopal) attacks in patients with complete heart block. Currently, the most common indication for permanent pacemaker insertion  is  sinus  node  dysfunction  (sick  sinus  syndrome). Cardiac pacing is the only long-term treatment for symptomatic bradycardia regardless of cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  past  decade,  there  have  been  great  advances  in  the durability, reliability, and complexity of cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs). However, the basic components of an arti fi cial cardiac pacemaker have not changed in over 50 years. Th ese devices are made up of a pulse generator capable of producing  electrical  impulses,  one  or  more  sensing  and  pacing electrodes located in the right atrium and right ventricle, and a battery power source. Electrical impulses originating in the pulse generator  are  transmitted  through  specialized  leads  to  excite endocardial cells and produce a propagating wave of depolarization in the myocardium. Th e pulse generator is powered by a small lithium-iodide battery. Th e lithium-iodide batteries used in pulse generators can last up to 10 years, but battery depletion requires surgical replacement of the entire pulse generator. Th e pulse generator for endocardial leads is usually implanted in a subcutaneous pocket below the clavicle. Th e generator for epicardial leads is o ft en implanted in the abdominal wall.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  implanted  cardiac  devices  are  designed  to  detect  and respond to low-amplitude electrical  signals.  Extraneous  signals  produced  by  external  electrical  or  magnetic fi elds  can in fl uence the function of CIEDs and are known as electromagnetic interference (EMI). Even with vast improvements in EMI shielding of CIEDs, the potential for microwaves, electrocautery,  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  to  produce  inhibition of  ventricular  pacing is  still  clinically  relevant. Th ere  are  no known CIED concerns involving exposure to plain radiography,  ultrasonography, fl uoroscopy,  or  mammography.  Many arti fi cial  cardiac  pacemakers  are  designed  to  convert  to  an asynchronous mode rather than be completely inhibited when an external electrical fi eld is encountered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e endocardial leads can be unipolar or bipolar. In a unipolar pacing system there is one electrode that is an active lead.  Current fl ows from the negative pole (active  lead)  to stimulate  the  heart,  then  returns  to  the  positive  pole  (the casing  of  the  pulse  generator). Th e  current  returns  to  the positive pole by traveling through myocardium to complete the circuit. Th is  separation between the positive and negative poles leads to the unipolar system's susceptibility to EMI (Figure 4-9). In a bipolar lead system, there are two separate electrodes  (positive  and  negative)  in  the  same  chamber  in very close proximity to each other, so the distance the current travels to complete the circuit is very small, and hence there is very little chance that extraneous signals will intrude into or a ff ect the lead circuit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMI can be any strong external electrical or magnetic force in close proximity to a CIED. EMI signals enter device circuits primarily through the leads. Unipolar systems are more prone to EMI because there is a larger separation between the positive and negative poles. Other factors in fl uencing the susceptibility of a device to EMI include fi eld strength, patient body mass, and the proximity and orientation of the device to the EMI fi eld. Potential e ff ects of EMI depend on the pacing mode and the lead involved, but range from cessation of pacing to inappropriate  triggering  of  pacemaker  activity.  Improved shielding of pacemakers and use of mostly bipolar lead systems has eliminated many problems related to EMI.

Asynchronous Pacing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asynchronous pacing is the simplest form of pacing. It can be  AOO, VOO, or DOO. In this mode, the lead(s) fi re  at  a fi xed rate regardless of the patient's underlying rhythm. Th is pacing mode can be used safely in patients with no intrinsic ventricular activity because there is no risk of the R-on-T phenomenon. Asynchronous pacing may compete with a patient's intrinsic rhythm, and the continuous pacing activity decreases battery life and necessitates more frequent battery and pulse generator replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Single-Chamber Pacing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e choice of pacing mode depends on the primary indication  for  the  arti fi cial  pacemaker.  Single-chamber  pacemakers can be atrial or ventricular. If the patient has SA node disease and no evidence of disease in the AV node or bundle of His, an atrial pacemaker (AAI) can be placed. Use of atrial pacing modes requires a functioning AV node, and then AAI pacing can  maintain  AV  synchrony.  However,  it  has  been  estimated that approximately 8% of patient with SA node dysfunction will progress to AV node dysfunction within 3 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Individuals experiencing episodes of symptomatic bradycardia caused by SA node or AV node disease may bene fi t from placement of a single-chamber ventricular (VVI) pacemaker. Th is  mode of pacing senses the native R wave, and if it is present, pacemaker discharge is inhibited (Figure 4-10). It is o ft en used in patients with complete heart block with chronic atrial fl utter or fi brillation, and in patients with long ventricular pauses. A factor to consider in the patient with a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker is the potential for pacemaker syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pacemaker syndrome is a constellation of symptoms caused by  the  loss  of  AV  synchrony.  Symptoms  include  syncope, weakness, lethargy, cough, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,  hypotension,  and  pulmonary  edema.  DDD  pacing minimizes the incidence of pacemaker syndrome and can be used to alleviate symptoms of pacemaker syndrome by restoring AV synchrony.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dual-Chamber Pacing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Technical advances in cardiac pacing have included the creation of dual-chamber devices, rate-response algorithms, and implantable cardioverter-de fi brillators with pacing capability. Th ese advances have expanded the indications for cardiac pacing  beyond  symptomatic  bradycardia  to  include  neurogenic syncope, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and cardiac resynchronization therapy for congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disease of the AV node or His bundle, or ongoing drug treatment to slow AV nodal conduction, requires a dual-  chamber (DDD or DDI) system. Disorders such as neurocardiogenic syncope (resulting from carotid sinus hypersensitivity), vasovagal syncope, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can also be successfully treated with dual-chamber pacemakers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dual-chamber pacing is also known as physiologic pacing because  it  maintains  AV  synchrony. Th is  improves  cardiac output  by  maintaining  the  contribution  of  atrial  systole  to ventricular fi lling.  AV  synchrony  also  maintains  appropriate valve closure timing, which reduces the risk of signi fi cant mitral and/or tricuspid insu ffi ciency. Several studies suggest that patients receiving dual-chamber pacing have a decreased risk of atrial fi brillation and heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac resynchronization therapy using biatrial or biventricular pacing is being employed in patients with electromechanical  asynchrony  and  intraventricular  conduction  block. Th e criteria for cardiac resynchronization therapy include the presence of drug-refractory heart failure (symptoms at rest or with  minimal  exertion),  le ft ventricular  ejection  fraction  of less than 35%, le ft ventricular dilation, and prolongation of the QRS complex to more than 130 milliseconds.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DDD Pacing. Dual-chamber  pacemakers  have  two  leads, one  placed  in  the  right  atrium  and  one  located  in  the  right ventricle.  DDD  pacing  is  based  on  electrical  feedback  from the leads in the atrium and ventricle. If a native atrial signal is  sensed, the atrial pacemaker output is inhibited, and if no intrinsic atrial signal is sensed, the pacemaker output is triggered. Likewise, if intrinsic ventricular activity is sensed at the end of a programmable AV interval, the intrinsic ventricular activity inhibits pacemaker output. If intrinsic ventricular activity is not sensed, the pacemaker triggers a spike (Figure 4-11). Th e DDD pacing mode permits the pacemaker to respond to increases in sinus node discharge rate, such as during exercise.

Programming the dual-chamber leads to have an adjustable AV interval provides an important bene fi t in maintaining AV synchrony over a wide range of heart rates. Loss of AV synchrony has many deleterious e ff ects, including reducing cardiac output by 20% to 30% or more, increasing atrial pressure resulting  from  contraction  of  the  atria  against  closed  mitral and tricuspid valves, and activation of baroreceptors that may induce re fl ex peripheral vasodilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DDI  Pacing. In  the  DDI  pacing  mode,  there  is  sensing in both the atrium and ventricle, but the only response to a sensed event is inhibition (inhibited pacing of the atrium and ventricle). DDI pacing is useful when there are frequent atrial tachydysrhythmias that might be inappropriately tracked by a DDD pacemaker and result in rapid ventricular rates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RATE-ADAPTIVE PACEMAKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  sinus  node  disease,  AV  node  disease,  or  lower conduction system disease whose heart rates do not respond to increases in metabolic demands should be considered candidates for  rate-adaptive pacing systems. In the late 1990s pacemaker technology expanded to include the capability of matching the pacing rate to activity levels. Th is is called rate-adaptive pacing and is considered for patients who do not have an appropriate heart rate response to exercise (chronotropic incompetence) . Th is syndrome can be caused by drug treatment with negative chronotropic drugs such as β -blockers or calcium channel blockers or by pathologic processes such as sick sinus syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally, AV synchrony contributes more to cardiac output at rest and at low levels of exercise, whereas rate adaptation (i.e.,  a  higher  heart  rate)  is  more  important  at  higher  levels of  exercise.  Sensors  within  rate-adaptive  pacemakers  detect changes in movement (using a piezoelectric crystal) or minute ventilation (by transthoracic impedance) as physical or physiologic  signs  of  exercise.  In  response,  the  device  makes  rate adjustments to mimic the response of a normal sinus node.

A  functioning  cardiac  pacemaker  should be  in  place  or  transcutaneous  cardiac  pacing  available  before administration of anesthetic drugs. Drugs such as atropine and isoproterenol  should  be  available  should  a  decrease  in  heart rate compromise hemodynamics before the new pacemaker is functional.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of complications related to pacemaker insertion is approximately 5%. An arti fi cial cardiac pacemaker can be inserted intravenously using endocardial leads or via a subcostal incision or median sternotomy (a ft er cardiac surgery) using epicardial or myocardial leads. Early complications are o ft en associated with the venous access and/or surgical access necessary to  place  the  leads.  Perioperative  complications  include  pneumothorax,  hemothorax,  and  air  embolism.  Pneumothoraces are o ft en small and asymptomatic. However, tension pneumothorax should always be considered if hypotension or pulseless electrical  activity  develops  during  or  immediately  a ft er  pacemaker placement. Hemothorax can result from trauma to the great vessels or other vascular structures. Arterial cannulation must be immediately recognized and treated with manual compression or arterial repair. Arterial damage can be minimized by placing a small guidewire under fl uoroscopic guidance before placing the much larger introducer sheath. Variable amounts of air can be introduced into the low-pressure venous system during the procedure. Small amounts are generally well tolerated, but larger air embolism can result in respiratory distress, oxygen desaturation, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.

IMPLANTED CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATORS AND CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ICD system consists of a pulse generator and leads for dysrhythmia detection and current delivery. In addition to internal de fi brillation, an ICD can deliver antitachycardia or antibradycardia pacing and synchronized cardioversion. Detailed diagnostic data concerning intracardiac electrograms and event markers are stored in the memory of the device and can be retrieved for analysis. Th e pulse generator is a small computer powered by a lithium battery that is sealed within a titanium case. Th e transvenous leads consist of pacing and sensing electrodes and one or two de fi brillation coils. Th e de fi brillation circuit is completed by the titanium case of the pulse generator, which acts as a de fi brillation electrode. Th e pulse generator is usually implanted into a  subcutaneous pocket. Th e  position  of  the  pulse  generator  is important  because  the  position  a ff ects  the  de fi brillation  wave front. Th e le ft pectoral region is the ideal location for the pulse generator. Right-sided implantation can result in a signi fi cantly higher de fi brillation threshold. ICDs employ electrical de fi brillation as the sole method for treatment of ventricular fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ICD  uses  a  specialized  lead  in  the  right  ventricle  that senses ventricular depolarization. It ampli fi es, fi lters, and recti fi es the signal and then compares it with the programmed sensing thresholds and the R-R interval algorithms. If the device detects ventricular fi brillation, the capacitor charges, a secondary algorithm is ful fi lled by signal analysis to con fi rm the rhythm, and then the shock is delivered. Th is secondary con fi rmatory process prevents  inappropriate  shocks  in  response  to  self-terminating events or spurious signals. Th e process takes approximately 10 to 15 seconds from dysrhythmia detection to shock delivery. During this time, the patient may experience presyncope or syncope.

A de fi brillator coding system exists similar to the one used for  pacemakers. Th e fi rst  letter  is  the  chamber  shocked  ( O, none; A, atrium; V, ventricle; D, dual). Th e second letter indicates the antitachycardia pacing chamber ( O, none; A, atrium; V, ventricle; D, dual). Th e third position indicates the tachycardia detection mechanism ( E, electrogram; H, hemodynamic). Th e fourth position denotes the antibradycardia pacing chamber ( O, none; A, atrium; V, ventricle; D, dual).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Implantable ICDs were approved by the FDA in 1985. Currently there are over 1.5 million Americans living with a pacemaker and over 500,000 living with an ICD. Th e indications for the implantation of an ICD have changed dramatically over the past few years. An increase in ICD implantation occurred a ft er clinical trials showed a survival bene fi t  for ICDs placement  compared  with  antidysrhythmic  drug  therapy  in  survivors of cardiac arrest not caused by transient or reversible factors  such  as  acute  myocardial  infarction,  use  of  prodysrhythmic drugs, or electrolyte disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another turning point in the use of ICDs came when multiple clinical trials showed that using cardiac resynchronization  therapy  decreased  heart  failure  events  and  mortality  in appropriately selected patients. Th e goal of cardiac resynchronization therapy, also called biventricular pacing, is to use multisite pacing to improve electromechanical synchrony. In the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, ventricular electrical  dyssynchrony  progresses  to  mechanical  dyssynchrony as the le ft ventricular contraction becomes increasingly ineffi cient. Th is can be further worsened by a prolongation of AV conduction, which leads to AV dyssynchrony and a decrease in the atrial contribution to le ft ventricular fi lling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  uses  three  pacing  leads: right atrial,  right  ventricular,  and  a  coronary  sinus  lead  (or  an additional atrial or ventricular lead depending on the sites of dysfunction). By adjusting the timing of each lead, AV synchrony is optimized. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is now a mainstay of  treatment  in  patients  who  have  le ft ventricular  dysfunction (ejection fraction of ≤ 35%), QRS prolongation ( ≥ 120 milliseconds), and moderate to severe heart failure symptoms (New Y ork Heart Association functional class III or IV) while receiving optimal medical therapy. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without a de fi brillator component has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in these patients.

Approximately half of patients receiving an ICD will have an adverse event related to the device within the fi rst year a ft er implantation. Lead-related problems such as failure to sense or  pace,  inappropriate  therapy,  and  dislodgment  remain  the most common problems. One of the most devastating complications  is  infection  associated  with  the  ICD  components. Th e  estimated  infection  rate  is  approximately  0.6%,  which

is  similar  to  the  infection  rate  associated  with  pacemaker implantation.  Device-related  infection  requires  explantation of the entire ICD system.

Preparation  for  the  care  of  a  patient  for  ICD  placement  is the same as that for pacemaker insertion. Some of these procedures  are  done  under  general  anesthesia  because  of  the increased risks associated with repeated de fi brillation during threshold testing. Th e nature and severity of the patient's coexisting medical conditions dictate the extent of monitoring and the necessary clinical preparations.

SURGERY IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIAC IMPLANTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of any type of CIED-whether an arti fi cial cardiac  pacemaker  or  ICD-for  any  indication-whether  pacing,  cardioversion, de fi brillation,  or  resynchronization-in a patient  scheduled  for  surgery  unrelated  to  the  device  introduces special considerations for preoperative evaluation and subsequent management of anesthesia to ensure patient safety and  preservation  of  proper  device  placement  and  function. Th ese CIED recommendations apply to all forms of anesthetic care, from conscious sedation and monitored anesthesia care to regional and general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potential  adverse  outcomes  associated  with  perioperative CIED-related issues include hypotension, tachydysrhythmias or  bradydysrythmias,  myocardial  damage,  myocardial  ischemia or infarction, device malfunction, delay or cancellation of  surgery, readmission to a health care facility for management of device malfunction, extended hospital stay, increased patient and hospital costs, and avoidable increased consumption of hospital resources.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A patient with a preexisting CIED coming for surgery has at least one of three underlying cardiac problems: sustained or  intermittent  bradydysrhythmia,  tachydysrhythmia,  or heart failure. Regardless of the indication for the device, any patient with a CIED requiring anesthetic care must undergo a  detailed  systematic  preoperative  evaluation.  Although treatment decisions are made based on the clinical scenario, the preoperative evaluation of a patient with a CIED should include  determination  of  the  type  of  device  present,  identi fi cation of the clinical indication for the device, appraisal of  the  patient's  degree  of  dependence  on  the  device  (for patients requiring pacing for bradycardia), and assessment of device function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  determining  whether  the  patient  has  a  CIED,  patient history  and  physical  examination,  medical  records,  chest radiographs, and ECGs or a rhythm strip can o ft en aid in confi rming the presence of a device and establishing the type of device, clinical indication, and in some instances the patient's level of dependence. Strong evidence indicating that a patient is  CIED dependent includes a history of bradycardia symptoms, a history of AV node ablation, and little or no spontaneous ventricular activity on ECG, that is, the majority of beats are paced on ECG. A preoperative history of presyncope, or syncope in a patient with a pacemaker could re fl ect pacemaker dysfunction. Th e rate of discharge of an atrial or ventricular asynchronous ( fi xed-rate)  cardiac  pacemaker  (usually  70  to 72 beats per minute) is a useful indicator of pulse generator function. A 10% decrease in heart rate from the initial heart rate setting may re fl ect battery depletion. An irregular heart rate could indicate competition of the pulse generator with the patient's intrinsic heart rate or failure of the pulse generator to sense R waves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  best  way to determine CIED function preoperatively is  CIED  interrogation  by  a  quali fi ed  consultant.  However, in  the  event  that  this  is  not  possible,  clinical  evidence  such as pacing spikes present on the ECG that successfully create paced beats may su ffi ce. Th e ECG is not a diagnostic aid if the intrinsic heart rate is greater than the preset pacemaker rate. In such cases, proper function of a ventricular synchronous or  sequential  arti fi cial  cardiac  pacemaker  is  best  con fi rmed by electronic evaluation. Beyond the routine indications for antibradycardia pacing or antitachycardia de fi brillation, many pacemaker-de fi brillators are implanted for resynchronization therapy to treat heart failure. Th is has made management decisions increasingly complex, so early involvement of a quali fi ed consultant is desirable. Ideally, perioperative assessment and planning for the patient with a CIED should be coordinated with a cardiologist and the pacemaker representative for that speci fi c device.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is estimated that in the population of patients with CIEDs 50%  have  coronary  artery  disease,  20%  have  hypertension, and 10% have diabetes. Achieving good clinical outcomes in CIED patients requires evaluation and optimal treatment of co-existing diseases in addition to management of the issues directly involving the CIED. Th ere are several major areas of concern that must be addressed regarding the CIED to ensure safety during the administration of anesthesia. Is EMI likely to occur during the surgery? Does the CIED need to be reprogrammed? Are temporary pacing equipment and a de fi brillator immediately available?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  patient-speci fi c  issues  concerning  CIEDs, adverse  outcomes  related  to  the  functionality  of  the  device are also important to consider. Th ese include the potential for damage to the pulse generator or leads (circuitry), damage to the tissue around the device (burns, thermal changes e ff ecting impedance), failure of the device to pace or de fi brillate, inappropriate  pacing  or  de fi brillation,  and  inadvertent  electrical reset to backup pacing modes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common CIED-related problem encountered in the perioperative period is interference with device function resulting  from  EMI. Th e  most  common  e ff ects  of  EMI  are

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 4 ABNORMALITIES OF CARDIAC CONDUCTION AND CARDIAC RHYTHM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
101

<!-- PAGE=? -->
inhibition of pacing and resetting of the device to asynchronous pacing. EMI can cause more serious problems, however, such as inappropriate de fi brillation or complete device failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ree  procedures  that  have  been  reported  to  have  some association with EMI-induced dysfunction in CIEDs are electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation, and MRI. Choice of anesthetic  technique  is  not  thought  to  in fl uence  CIED  function directly, but physiologic changes (acid-base, electrolytes) and hemodynamic shi ft s (heart rate, heart rhythm, hypertension, coronary ischemia) can induce changes in CIED function and adversely a ff ect patient outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  literature  suggests  reprogramming  the  CIED  to  an asynchronous mode before surgery if the patient is pacemaker dependent. However, there are no controlled studies examining the clinical e ff ect of reprogramming a pacemaker to asynchronous mode under these circumstances. Any inadvertent exposure to a source of electric current or magnetic fi eld can cause  damage  to  the  pulse  generator,  the  leads,  or  the  tissue  surrounding any part of the device. Improved shielding of  cardiac  pacemakers  has  reduced  the  problems  associated with EMI from electrocautery, but the use of monopolar electrocautery remains the principal concern intraoperatively in patients with CIEDs. Th ere are reports suggesting that CIED reprogramming  may  be  bene fi cial  if  electrocautery  will  be used, but this point is controversial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use  of  "coagulation"  settings  in  monopolar  electrocautery  causes  more  EMI  problems  than  use  of  "cutting"  settings.  It  is  bene fi cial  to  keep  the  electrocautery  current  as low as possible and to apply electrocautery in short bursts, especially  if  current  is  being  applied  in  close  proximity  to the pulse generator. Th e recommendation is to avoid using cautery in the area of the pulse generator and leads if that is possible. Th e cautery device generating the EMI fi eld need not actually touch the patient to adversely e ff ect the CIED. Use  of  bipolar  electrocautery  or  the  ultrasonic  Harmonic scalpel is associated with lower rates of EMI e ff ects on the pulse generator and leads. Th e current return pad (grounding pad) should be placed so that the current path does not cross the chest or CIED system. Th e grounding electrode for electrocautery  should  be  as  far  as  possible  from  the  pulse generator to minimize detection of the cautery current by the pulse generator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application  of  a  magnet  to  a  pacemaker  o ft en  results  in asynchronous pacemaker function at a fi xed  rate.  Although asynchronous  pacing  can  maintain  a  reliable  heart  rate  in pacemaker-dependent  patients,  for  some  patients  the  asynchronous  rate  may  be  excessive  and  contribute  to  hypertension, coronary ischemia, or congestive heart failure. Asynchronous pacing carries the risk of producing the R-on-T phenomenon. If a magnet is used, it must remain in place to maintain the asynchronous mode of pacing. Removal of the magnet results  in  reversion  to  the  baseline  device  program. Th e magnet-induced rate varies by manufacturer and can be altered by programming.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application of a magnet to a cardioverter-de fi brillator rarely alters  the  antibradycardia  pacing  capabilities,  but  most  o ft en

TABLE 4-4 ■ Factors that can alter the depolarization threshold of cardiac pacemakers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
suspends antitachycardia therapy (de fi brillation). It is di ffi cult to accurately assess the e ff ect of a magnet on a cardioverterde fi brillator CIED without electronic interrogation. Some ICDs have no magnet response; others can be permanently disabled by magnet exposure. Recommendations for patients with ICDs who undergo a procedure with a high risk of EMI include suspending the antitachycardia functions-that is, turning o ff the de fi brillator-and electronically adjusting the pacing modes as appropriate in pacemaker-dependent individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e choice of drugs for anesthesia is not altered by the presence of a properly functioning CIED, nor is there any evidence that anesthetic drugs alter the stimulation threshold of CIEDs. Nevertheless, it is prudent to avoid events such as hyperventilation that can acutely change the serum potassium concentration (Table  4-4).  Conceivably,  succinylcholine  could  increase  the stimulation threshold because of the associated acute increase in serum potassium concentration. Succinylcholine could also inhibit a normally functioning cardiac pacemaker by causing contraction of skeletal muscle groups (myopotentials) that the pulse generator could interpret as intrinsic R waves. Clinical experience suggests that succinylcholine is usually a safe drug to use in patients with arti fi cial cardiac pacemakers and that, if myopotential inhibition does occur, it is generally transient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring of the patient with a CIED should always follow the ASA standards and should include continuous ECG monitoring and continuous monitoring of a peripheral pulse. Th is can be done with a pulse oximeter, manual palpation of a pulse, auscultation of heart sounds, or intraarterial catheterization. Veri fi cation of the presence of a pulse is necessary to con fi rm continued cardiac activity in the event of disruption of the ECG signal by EMI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No special laboratory testing or radiographs are needed for CIED patients unless otherwise clinically indicated. At times

<!-- PAGE=? -->
102

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
a chest radiograph can be useful to evaluate the location and external condition of pacemaker electrodes. If the patient is known to have a biventricular pacemaker, a chest radiograph to con fi rm the position of the coronary sinus lead is helpful when insertion of a central line or pulmonary artery catheter is  planned. Th ere  have  been  reports  of  coronary  sinus  and endocardial lead dislodgement in association with these procedures. Th e danger of lead dislodgment is minimal a month or longer a ft er lead implantation. Epicardial leads are not at risk  in  this  situation. Th e  presence  of  a temporary transvenous  cardiac  pacemaker  creates  a  situation  in  which  there is  a  direct  connection  between  an  external  electrical  source and the endocardium. Th is  could  introduce the risk of ventricular fi brillation resulting from microshock. Th ere are case reports of inappropriately high pacing rates in CIEDs containing active minute ventilation sensors for rate-adaptive pacing caused by EMI from a cardiac monitor. Th e consensus is that all rate-adaptive modes should be turned o ff preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MRI scanning of patients with CIEDs is controversial and is generally regarded as contraindicated. However, 50% to 75% of  patients  with  cardiac  devices  will  likely  need  to  undergo MRI at some point in their lifetimes, so this is becoming an important concern. Th ere  is  insu ffi cient  evidence  at  present to standardize management of the patient with a CIED needing MRI scanning. If MRI must be performed, care should be coordinated  among  the  ordering  physician,  radiologist,  and pacemaker specialist or cardiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of EMI associated with radiofrequency ablation includes keeping the radiofrequency current path, which runs from the electrode tip to the current return pad, as far away from the pulse generator as possible. Some suggest keeping the ablation electrode at least 5 cm away from the pacer leads.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations  for patients undergoing lithotripsy include keeping the focus of the lithotripsy beam away from the pulse generator. It has been suggested that there may be some bene fi t to disabling atrial pacing if the lithotripsy system triggers on the R wave, but there is no clinical evidence to support this practice at this time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is insu ffi cient evidence to standardize care for CIED patients needing radiation therapy. Th e recommendation currently is to keep the device out of the radiation fi eld. In some patients  this  will  require  pulse  generator  relocation.  Most manufacturers  recommend  veri fi cation  of  appropriate  pulse generator  function  at  the  completion  of  radiation  therapy. Potential  CIED  problems  from  radiation  therapy  include pacemaker failure and "runaway" pacemaker. Runaway pacemaker is the sudden rapid and erratic pacing that can occur in the event of multiple internal component malfunctions. Most modern pacemakers limit the upper rate of pacing to 210 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No clinical studies have reported EMI or permanent CIED malfunction  in  association  with  electroconvulsive  therapy, but care should be coordinated with a cardiologist. Th e device should be interrogated and the antitachycardia functions suspended. Because electroconvulsive therapy can be associated with considerable swings in blood pressure and heart rate, a backup external de fi brillator and temporary pacing capability should be immediately available. Th e myopotentials produced during seizures may inhibit pacemaker activity. In pacemakerdependent patients, programming to asynchronous mode is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other  potential  sources  of  EMI  during  anesthetic  care include current from peripheral nerve stimulators or evoked potential monitors, large tidal volumes, shivering, and medication-induced muscle fasciculations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If emergency de fi brillation is necessary in a patient with a CIED (permanent cardiac pacemaker or ICD that is turned o ff ), an e ff ort should be made to keep the de fi brillation current away from the pulse generator and lead system. Th is can be  facilitated  by  placing  the  electrode  pads  in  an  anteriorposterior position. It is suggested that, if the situation allows, before performing de fi brillation or cardioversion in a patient with an ICD in a magnet-disabled treatment mode, all sources of EMI be eliminated and the magnet be removed to reactivate the antitachycardia capabilities of the device. Th e patient can then be observed for appropriate CIED function. Th e primary goal is care  of  the  patient,  of  course,  with  care  of  the CIED being secondary, but in most circumstances the two are not mutually exclusive. An acute increase in pacing threshold and loss of capture may follow external de fi brillation. If this occurs, transcutaneous cardiac pacing or temporary transvenous pacing may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  management  of  the  patient  with  a  CIED consists  of  interrogating  the  device  and  restoring  appropriate  baseline  settings,  including  antitachycardia  therapy  in patients with ICDs. Th is  should be done as soon as possible a ft er the procedure, either in the postanesthesia care unit or the intensive care unit. Th ere have been no reports of permanently reprogrammed CIEDs attributed to EMI. Nevertheless, cardiac rate and rhythm should be monitored throughout the immediately postoperative period, including during transport from the anesthetizing location to the recovery area. Backup cardioversion-de fi brillation and pacing equipment should be immediately  available.  Postoperative  CIED  checks  may  not be needed if surgery did not include use of EMI-generating devices,  no  electronic  preoperative  device  reprogramming was done, no blood transfusions were administered, and no intraoperative problems were identi fi ed that related to CIED function.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cardiac dysrhythmias are classi fi ed according to heart rate and the site of origin of the abnormality. Conduction disturbances are classi fi ed by site and degree of blockade. Th e clinical signi fi cance of these abnormalities depends on their e ff ect on vital signs (hemodynamic instability, cardiac and end-organ ischemia, congestive heart failure) and/or their potential for deterioration into life-threatening rhythms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 4 ABNORMALITIES OF CARDIAC CONDUCTION AND CARDIAC RHYTHM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
103

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Tachydysrhythmias  can  result  from  three  mechanisms: (1)  increased  automaticity  in  normal  conduction  tissue or in an ectopic focus, (2) reentry of electrical potentials through abnormal pathways, and (3) triggering of abnormal cardiac potentials due to a ft erdepolarizations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Atrial fi brillation  is  the  most  common  sustained  cardiac dysrhythmia in the general population (0.4% to 1% incidence),  a ff ecting  2.2  million  people  in  the  United  States. Rapid, disordered atrial activation and irregular electrical input  to  the  AV  node  results  in  sporadic  AV  nodal  conduction and irregular ventricular contraction. Ventricular response rates as high as 180 beats per minute can occur in patients with normal AV node function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Bradycardia during neuraxial blockade can occur in patients of any age, any ASA physical status class, and any degree of sedation. Th e incidence of profound bradycardia and cardiac arrest during neuraxial anesthesia is approximately 1.5 per 10,000 cases. By contrast, cardiac arrest during general anesthesia occurs at a rate of 5.5 per 10,000 cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Ventricular fi brillation is a rapid, grossly irregular ventricular rhythm with marked variability in QRS cycle length, morphology, and amplitude. Th is rhythm is incompatible with life because there is no associated stroke volume or cardiac output. A pulse or blood pressure never accompanies ventricular fi brillation. Electrical de fi brillation is the only e ff ective  method to convert ventricular fi brillation to a rhythm capable of generating a cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Antidysrhythmic drugs work by one of three mechanisms: (1) suppressing automaticity in cardiac pacemaker cells by decreasing  the  slope  of  phase  4  depolarization,  (2)  prolonging the e ff ective refractory period to eliminate reentry circuits, and (3) facilitating impulse conduction along the normal conduction pathway to prevent conduction over a reentrant pathway. ECG changes, such as a prolonged PR interval or a prolonged QRS duration, are relatively common side e ff ects of antidysrhythmic drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Mobitz  type  I  (Wenckebach)  block  is  distinguished  by progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a beat is dropped. A pause allows the AV node to recover and then the  process  resumes.  In  contrast,  Mobitz  type  II  block  is characterized by sudden and complete interruption of conduction without PR prolongation. Mobitz type II block is usually associated with permanent damage to the conduction system and may progress to third-degree block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th ird-degree  heart  block  (complete  heart  block)  is  characterized  by  complete  absence  of  conduction  of  cardiac impulses from the atria to the ventricles. Continued activity of the ventricles is related to impulse generation from an ectopic focus distal to the site of block. If the conduction block is near the AV node, the heart rate is usually 45 to 55 beats per minute and the QRS complex has a normal width. If the conduction block is below the AV node (infranodal), the heart rate is usually 30 to 40 beats per minute and the QRS complex is wide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  ICD  system  consists  of  a  pulse  generator  and  leads for dysrhythmia detection and current delivery. In

<!-- PAGE=? -->
addition to internal de fi brillation, an ICD can deliver antitachycardia or antibradycardia pacing and synchronized cardioversion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ All  CIEDs  are  designed  to  detect  and  respond  to  lowamplitude electrical signals. Extraneous signals produced by external electrical or magnetic fi elds can in fl uence the function of CIEDs. Strong electromagnetic fi elds, such as occur  in  electrocautery,  MRI,  and  radiofrequency  ablation,  pose  the  highest  risk  of  interference  with  CIED function.
