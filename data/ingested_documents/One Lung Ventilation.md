Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One-lung ventilation is a major component  of  anaesthesiologic  management for  thoracic  surgery  and  is  achieved either  by  endobronchial  placement  of  a double-lumen tube or through utilisation of  a  bronchus  blocker. The  indications for one-lung ventilation not only include lung surgery but also other surgical interventions  involving  thoracic  structures or less common patient-specific factors. Double-lumen tubes and bronchus blockers  constitute  the  technical  basis  of lung  separation.  The  anaesthesiologist must  have  proven  knowledge  of  the tracheobronchial  anatomy  including  the segmental  bronchi;  routine  use  of  flexible  fibreoptic  bronchoscopy  is  equally essential.  This  review  article  provides fundamental recommendations with respect to everyday clinical routine.

Introduction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaesthesia  for  thoracic  surgery  is characterised by the requirement for specialised  knowledge,  techniques and competency in airway management, one-lung ventilation and the handling  of  cardiopulmonary  comorbidities. The  high  rate  of  postoperative  pulmonary  complications reinforces those prerequisites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This  manuscript  aspires  to  present  methods,  provide  practical  assistance  and illustrate specific recommendations aimed at ensuring patient safety.

One-Lung Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung separation utilising one-lung or independent lung ventilation is indicated for  most  cases  of thoracic  surgery, but also for surgery on thoracic structures (e.g.,  the  oesophagus,  aorta  or  spine). Lung separation optimises surgical conditions  by  providing  for  unilateral complete  atelectasis. In  less  common cases,  separation  is  indicated  to  avoid aspiration of infectious material or blood from one lung to the other, or to enable adequate ventilation of the contralateral lung  in  the  presence  of  large  bronchopleural fistula (Tabl. 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The pathophysiology  of  gas  exchange during  OLV is  determined  in  the  same way as during normal bilateral ventilation by the proximity of blood and gaseous components  required  for  diffusion.  An efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide  is  dependent  on  the  regional ratio  of  ventilation  to  perfusion  (V/Q ratio).  A  large  spectrum  of  principally 'alveoli  related'  V/Q  conditions  exists at the extremes of the V/Q ratio, i.e., for dead space ventilation (approx. 2 ml/kg; V/Q ratio = ∞ ) and shunt (V/Q ratio = 0).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Which form of airway management is recommended and indicated for lung separation and OLV?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Modern  double-lumen  tubes  (DLT) permit selective collapse of one lung and ventilation of the other. Separation  can  also  be  achieved  using  a bronchus blocker or Univent TM  tube.

The asymmetry of the tracheobronchial anatomy  is  reflected  in  the  design  of right-sided  and  left-sided  DLT. The  DLT is forked and has both a bronchial and a tracheal lumen, with the latter opening distal to the tracheal cuff (Fig. 1). These tubes are offered by various companies in sizes 26 Fr, 28 Fr, 32 Fr, 35 Fr, 37 Fr, 39 Fr and 41 Fr (Fr = outer diameter in 'French'; Tab. 2). The left-sided DLT is the most commonly used (Fig. 1, left), whilst  the right-sided  DLT incorporates an additional opening slot which permits for  ventilation  of  the  right  upper  lobe

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(Fig. 1, right). Placing the right-sided DLT is more difficult and use is reserved for special  indications  such  as  resections close  to  the  hilum.  With  regard  to correct positioning, the right-sided DLT is characterised by a reduced safety pro  file when compared directly to the leftsided  DLT.  The DLT  is  also  available with  an  optical  sensor  or  integrated camera, which aims to make for easier positioning and  provide continuous visual monitoring of the correct position (Fig. 2, centre). The same model utilises a type of valve mechanism for achieving

separation and atelectasis without clam  ping  (Fig.  2,  right). Double-lumen tracheostomy  tubes are  also  available for use in patients who have previously undergone tracheostomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Verification  of  the  correct  position using flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy is strictly required. Renewed verification  must  take  place  following positioning of the patient (Fig. 3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  those  cases  where  the  patient  re  quires  post-operative  ventilation,  it  is recommended that the DLT ist not be left in  situ,  but  that  the  patient  is  instead reintubated with a standard single lumen tube.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  bronchus  blocker  may  be  passed through or next to an endotracheal tube and permits selective isolation of a main or  lobar  bronchus.  4  different  models are  available  (Fig.  4  and  Tab.  1):  the Arndt  blocker,  Cohen  blocker,  Uniblocker and EZ-blocker . These differ  in their materials, placement and lumina.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indications  for  lung  separation using a  DLT  or  bronchus  blocker  are  summarised  in Table  1. The  following  general considerations are relevant when choosing specific airway devices:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Is the intervention intrathoracic or extrathoracic?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Which sections of the respiratory tract, and especially which proximal (tracheal or bronchial) sections may be involved in the intervention?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If lung surgery is being performed, is it to be peripheral or central?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Is surgery being undertaken on the left or the right hemithorax?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
What is the patient's size?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Which relevant comorbidities does the patient suffer from?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Have appropriate (functional pulmonary) evaluation and diagnostics (e.g., spirometry, stair-climbing test, spiroergometry, perfusion scintigraphic imaging) been performed and are the results complete?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Is the airway difficult?

With  regard  to  DLT  and  bronchus blockers there is no evidence for superiority of one or the other device when  used  for  lung  separation  for thoracic surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Criteria examined when comparing the devices were

<!-- PAGE=? -->
time required for and ease of placement,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
rate of dislocation,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
quality of atelectasis,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
extent of airway trauma and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cost.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In many places, the DLT is considered to be the gold standard. In particular, dislocation during resections in close prox- imity to the bronchus, repeat transitions from atelectasis  to  ventilation  to  aid  in the identification of parenchymal fistulae and secretion retention in patients with pulmonary disease are more easily and rapidly managed with a DLT. The utility of  bronchus  blockers  as  an  alternative has, however, been demonstrated, even if  these  devices  are  not  routinely  used due to their high cost.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The indications  for  bronchus  blockers are predominantly patient related. They are:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
children under the age of 8 years [1]

<!-- PAGE=? -->
emergencies, patients who are intubated, have undergone tracheostomy or are at risk of aspiration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
patients with a difficult airway

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Absolute and relative indications for the use of a right-sided DLT are:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
left-sided pneumonectomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
left-sided single-lung transplantation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
left-sided endobronchial pathologies (e.g., tumours, compression, rupture)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
left-sided upper lobe sleeve resection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  OLV  cannot  be  established  due to failure  of  the  lung  to  collapse, the following steps should be undertaken:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
fibreoptic verification of the position and repositioning of the DLT or bronchus blocker if required

<!-- PAGE=? -->
endobronchial suctioning of air and secretions from the non-ventilated lung

<!-- PAGE=? -->
if necessary, leaving suction in situ until pneumothorax has been established to avoid passive aspiration of nitrogenous ambient air and persistent expansion of the lung.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Which pathophysiologic changes take place during OLV?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Outline

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The risk of impaired gas exchange with an  increased  incidence  of  hypoxaemia during OLV has reached a level of below 5% [4].  Optimisation  of  the  methods of lung separation (e.g., fibreoptic verification  of  correct  positioning,  design of  DLTs,  modified  ventilation  strategies etc.) and a better understanding of the pathophysiology  of  OLV  have  contributed to a declining incidence.

Conditions  and  factors  influencing gas exchange during  thoracic  surgery  and OLV are:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
intraoperative lateral position of the patient and gravity [5,6]

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(partial) opening of the thoracic cavity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the side from which surgical access is gained (right-sided surgery) [7 ,8]

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ventilation of the dependent lung

<!-- PAGE=? -->
general anaesthesia with mechanical ventilation and paralysis [9]

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction [10]

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The efficacy of normal gas exchange is substantially impaired by OLV. The partial  pressure of oxygen paO2 for an FiO2 of  1.0  decreases  from  over  400  mmHg to around 100  -  150 mmHg once OLV is established. This  decrease  is  caused  by an  intrapulmonary  shunt  in  the  non-ventilated (main effect) and a V/Q mismatch with  shunting in  the  ventilated  lung. Due to complete atelectasis (ventilation =  0),  any  blood  flow  to  the  non-ventilated lung is rated as a shunt, albeit that the  fraction  of  cardiac  output  to  that lung  is  reduced  from  50%  to  approx. 25% with a degree of individual variability.  That  reduction  is  mainly  caused by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction together  with  the  effects  of  gravity  and any impairments to perfusion caused by pathologies (e.g., tumours) [10]. Further factors  influencing  blood  flow  and  with that  shunting  are  surgical  manipulation and pharmacologic  substances.  The aforementioned  physiological  changes lead to an increase in perfusion of  the ventilated  lung  (approx.  75%  of  cardiac output)  whilst  the  pulmonary  arterial pressure  remains  unchanged. The V/Q ratio,  however,  is  significantly  heterogenic with some areas showing low V/Q ratios  and  shunting.  Lateral  position, anaesthesia,  an  elevated  diaphragm  and the  weight  of  mediastinal  organs  all reduce the functional  residual  capacity (FRC) of the lungs, leading to an inclination  to  develop dystelectasis and atelectasis but  also  to overdistention of lung segments. The risk of atelectasis increases with higher FiO2. Other factors such  as  PEEP,  recruitment  manoeuvres, pre-existing pulmonary disease and ventilator  settings  all  also  influence  the V/Q ratio [11].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
What is the pathophysiologic mechanism behind hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxic  pulmonary  vasoconstriction  is a regional (pulmonary) change in blood flow in smaller sections of the pulmonary arterial vascular bed aimed at optimising the V/Q ratio and reducing shunt by up to 40% [10,12,13]. The change is primarily triggered by a low alveolar pO2 whilst low  mixed  venous  pO2  is  a  secondary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
mechanism  [10].  Systemic  vasodilators (e.g., volatile anaesthetics) exert an un  favourable influence on hypoxic pulmonary  vasoconstriction,  which  in  turn  is enhanced by vasoconstrictors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
How is respiratory gas exchange affected during OLV? [13]

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A good number of factors and variables promote  hypoxaemia  during  OLV.  Patients  suffering  from  relevant  pulmonary pathology of the ventilated lung, such as

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pleural effusion,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pneumonia,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
interstitial lung disease,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
oedema,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
bronchospasm or

<!-- PAGE=? -->
other restrictive changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
are  at  an  increased  risk  of  hypoxaemia during OLV. Right-sided surgical pulmonary  interventions,  high  cardiac  output and partial  respiratory  failure  are  further predictors  of  hypoxaemia.  Conversely, overdistention caused by intrinsic PEEP puts  patients  with  chronic  obstructive lung disease at a lesser risk during OLV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Which anaesthesiologic measures are helpful during OLV?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General considerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative acute lung injury (ALI) following lung surgery has been de- scribed  to  occur  at  a  rate  of  4.3% and is associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality when compared with ALI following abdominal surgery [14].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaesthesiologic  management  during OLV should be based on strategies which both  include lung  protective  ventilation (e.g.,  avoidance  of  volutrauma  and  ba  rotrauma)  and  aim  to optimise  oxygenation. The  following  passages,  Fig.  5 and Table 4 depict individual aspects in detail and summarise them.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  hypoxaemia  occurs  during  OLV,  a structured  algorithm  -  which  starts  by considering  and  excluding  the  most common causes - should be triggered:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage 1:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
fibreoptic verification of the position of the DLT or bronchus blocker and correction if required

<!-- PAGE=? -->
bronchial toilet

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FiO2 of 1.0

<!-- PAGE=? -->
recruitment manoeuvre on the ventilated lung

<!-- PAGE=? -->
increase PEEP on ventilated lung

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage 2:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
apply CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) to non-ventilated lung

<!-- PAGE=? -->
establish ventilation of both lungs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
reduce blood flow in pulmonary artery by surgical means

<!-- PAGE=? -->
jet ventilation of non-ventilated lung.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Implementation  of  the  individual  steps is contingent on the severity of hypoxaemia, dynamics of the situation, and the individual patient's state. Establishing ventilation of both lungs (following communication  with  the  surgeon) is the fastest concept for restoring normal oxygenation, but interrupts surgery. Fibreoptic  verification  of  the  position of  the  DLT is  mandatory,  as  is toilet bronchoscopy of  the  ventilated  lung. When  correctly  performed  (e.g.,  3  -  5 seconds  of  an  inspiratory  pressure  of 25  -  35 cmH2O), and whilst any resulting haemodynamic  impairment  is  treated, recruitment  manoeuvres are helpful [15].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the risk of resorption atelectasis due to the wash-out effect on nitrogen, an  Fi O2  of  0.8  to  1.0  provides  a  high level of patient safety. FiO2 can typically be reduced to 0.5 once OLV has been established  and  conditions  are  stable. Hyperoxaemia  leads  to  formation  of oxygen radicals and is disadvantageous.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Applying  CPAP to  the  non-ventilated lung has lost its clinical significance as the associated distension of the lung hampers  surgical  interventions  -  especially during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) - and could compromise the surgical outcome. Administration of pure  oxygen  following  discreet  recruitment via a CPAP system utilising a low pressure  (3  -  8  cmH2O)  provides  highly effective  oxygenation.  However,  in  the context  of  open surgical  decortication of  the  lung for  pleural  empyema  or  in combination with pleurectomy, applying CPAP to the non-ventilated lung remains a mainstay, not only improving oxygenation  in  patients  already  suffering  from poor gas exchange, but also aiding the surgeon in distinguishing between lung tissue, the pleura or pleural fibrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the  level  of  PEEP  selected  is  too  high, however,  perfusion  is  redirected  to  the non-ventilated lung, increasing the shunt and  impairing  oxygenation.  Optimum PEEP needs to be determined by titration on  the  basis  of  individual  compliance of the respiratory system. As a rule, patients benefit from a PEEP >  5 cmH2O to approximately  12  cmH2O  during  OLV, especially in the presence of pre-existing restrictive  pulmonary disease or obesity. Patients  suffering  from  significant  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  however, require lower levels of PEEP; the level of auto-PEEP  should  be  detected  to  allow for complete expiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combining  low  levels  of  PEEP  (<  5 cmH2O) with low tidal volumes (< 5 ml/kg) predisposes to poor aeration and development of atelectasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tidal volume

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  tidal  volume  of  5 - 6  ml/kg  body weight during OLV, corresponding with the  recommendations  for  lung-protective ventilation, generally  results in suf  ficient  ventilation  and  oxygenation [16].  It  is  perfectly  feasible  to  practice permissive  hypercapnia for  a  certain length of time during OLV. There are no explicit recommendations with regard to  threshold  values  for  pH  or  paCO2 during permissive hypercapnia.  The strategy  should  be  avoided  in  patients requiring  catecholamines  or  suffering from pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory rate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  respiratory  rate  and  ratio  of  inspiratory to expiratory time (I:E ratio) both also influence ventilation. High respiratory rates with a short expiratory phase entail a risk of dynamic hyperinflation, i.e.,  incomplete expiration through one lumen of the DLT. Patients suffering from obstructive  pathology  or  undergoing left-sided ventilation via a left-sided DLT are at an increased risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mode of ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When selecting a ventilator  mode  for OLV, it is important to remember that volume-controlled ventilation  (VCV) entails  a  pre-selected  volume  being applied  at  a  constant  flow.  Conversely, pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) involves  a  pre-selected  pressure  being applied  with  a  decelerating  flow  and variable tidal volumes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is no evidence to suggest that VCV is superior to PCV. It has been shown,  however,  that  oxygenation was  better  using  PCV  during  OLV [17].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advanced measures

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Simple clamping of the pulmonary artery (or  its  divisions)  by  the  surgeon  reduces blood flow and with that shunting. Alternative methods, such as high-frequency jet  ventilation  or  insufflation  of  pure oxygen via  a  catheter  passed  through the  lumen  of  the  DLT  have  effects  and disadvantages  comparable  to  use  of  a CPAP system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conclusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  aim  of  one-lung  ventilation  necessitated  by  thoracic  surgery  is  not  only to provide for lung separation by means of  advanced  airway  management,  but also to prevent hypoxaemic events and ventilator-induced  lung  injury.  Knowledge of lung-protective ventilation and its  surrogate  parameters  tidal  volume, FiO2, PEEP and respiratory rate helps expand the appreciation of the pathophysiology  of  OLV. Anaesthesiologists  must master  routine  algorithms  used  in  the management of hypoxaemic situations.
