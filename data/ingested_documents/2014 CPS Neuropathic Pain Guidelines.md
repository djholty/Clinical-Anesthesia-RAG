DE  Moulin,  A  Boulanger,  Aj  Clark,  et  al.  Pharmacological management  of  chronic  neuropathic  pain:  Revised  consensus statement  from  the  Canadian  Pain  Society.  Pain  Res  Manag 2014;19(6):328-335.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BACKgROuND: Neuropathic pain (NeP), redefined as pain caused by a lesion  or  a  disease  of  the  somatosensory  system,  is  a  disabling  condition that affects approximately two million Canadians.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBjECTIVE: To  review  the  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and systematic reviews related to the pharmacological management of NeP to develop a revised evidence-based consensus statement on its management. METHODS: RCTs,  systematic  reviews  and  existing  guidelines  on  the pharmacological management of NeP were evaluated at a consensus meeting  in  May  2012  and  updated  until  September  2013.  Medications  were recommended in the consensus statement if their analgesic efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically sound RCT (class I or class II) showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant control group. Recommendations for treatment were based on the degree of evidence of analgesic efficacy, safety and ease of use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESulTS: Analgesic  agents  recommended  for  first-line  treatments  are gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin  noradrenaline  reuptake  inhibitors.  Tramadol  and  controlledrelease opioid analgesics are recommended as second-line treatments for moderate to severe pain. Cannabinoids are now recommended as third-line treatments.  Recommended  fourth-line  treatments  include  methadone, anticonvulsants  with  lesser  evidence  of  efficacy  (eg,  lamotrigine,  lacosamide), tapentadol and botulinum toxin. There is support for some analgesic combinations in selected NeP conditions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONCluSIONS: These guidelines provide an updated, stepwise approach to the pharmacological management of NeP. Treatment should be individualized for each patient based on efficacy, side-effect profile and drug accessibility, including cost. Additional studies are required to examine head-to-head comparisons among analgesics, combinations of analgesics, long-term outcomes and treatment of pediatric, geriatric and central NeP .

N europathic pain  (NeP)  has  been  redefined  as  pain  caused  by a lesion or a disease of the somatosensory system, and may be generated by either the peripheral or central nervous system, or both (1). Pain may be a manifestation of nerve injury, but there are few predictors to indicate which patients will develop this complication. For  example,  50%  of  diabetic  patients  develop  neuropathy  during the course of their illness, but only approximately 15% report actual dysesthesias or pain (2). Similarly, breast surgery with transection of the intercostal brachial nerve results in NeP in up to 50% of patients (3). Previous prevalence estimates indicated that 2% to 3% of the population in the developed world experience NeP (4,5). However,

la prise en charge pharmacologique de la douleur neuropathique chronique : une déclaration de consensus révisée de la Société canadienne de la douleur

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HISTORIQuE : La douleur neuropathique (DNe), redéfinie comme une douleur causée par une lésion ou une maladie du système somatosensoriel, est un trouble invalidant dont sont affligés environ deux millions de Canadiens. Examiner  les  essais  aléatoires  et  contrôlés  (EAC)  et  les analyses  systématiques  liées  à  la  prise  en  charge  pharmacologique  de  la DNe pour préparer une déclaration de consensus révisée, fondée sur des

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBjECTIF  : faits probants, à l'égard de sa prise en charge.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MÉTHODOlOgIE : Les  EAC,  les  analyses  systématiques  et  les  lignes directrices  sur  la  prise  en  charge  pharmacologique  de  la  DNe  ont  été évaluées lors d'une réunion de consensus en mai 2012, puis mises à jour en septembre 2013. Les médicaments étaient recommandés dans le document de consensus si leur efficacité analgésique était soutenue par au moins une EAC solide sur le plan méthodologique (classe I ou II), qui démontrait des avantages marqués par rapport à un placebo ou à un autre groupe témoin pertinent.  Les  recommandations  thérapeutiques  reposaient  sur  la  qualité des preuves d'efficacité analgésique, d'innocuité et de facilité d'utilisation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RÉSulTATS : Les  analgésiques recommandés pour le traitement de première intention sont les gabapentinoïdes (gabapentine et prégabaline), les antidépresseurs tricycliques et les inhibiteurs spécifiques du recaptage de la sérotonine et de la noradrénaline. Le tramadol et les opioïdes à libération contrôlée sont recommandés en deuxième intention pour la douleur modérée à grave. Les cannabinoïdes sont désormais recommandés en troisième intention,  tandis  que  la  méthadone,  les  anticonvulsivants  dont  l'efficacité  est moins attestée (p. ex., lamotrigine, lacosamide), le tapentadol et la toxine botulique sont recommandés en quatrième intention. Certaines polythérapies analgésiques sont acceptées pour traiter des troubles de DNe particuliers. CONCluSIONS : Ces lignes directrices fournissent une démarche mise à jour et graduelle pour la prise en charge pharmacologique de la DNe. Le traitement devrait être personnalisé en fonction de chaque patient, compte tenu  de  l'efficacité,  du  profil  d'effets  secondaires  et  de  l'accessibilité  du médicament, y compris son coût. D'autres études s'imposent pour faire des comparaisons  directes  entre  analgésiques  et  examiner  des  combinaisons d'analgésiques,  les  résultats  à  long  terme  et  le  traitement  de  la  DNe  en pédiatrie, de la DNe en gériatrie et de la DNe centrale.

newer  studies  using  population-based  questionnaires  estimate  a higher  rate  of  4%  to  8%  (6,7),  which  suggest  that  approximately two  million  Canadians  experience  this  disabling  condition.  Even more striking is that the prevalence of NeP is likely to increase for a  number  of  reasons.  The  population  is  aging,  and  a  pandemic  of obesity is occurring in the developed world. These factors are largely responsible for increasing rates of postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy (8,9). In addition, survival rates are increasing among cancer patients, and many of the medical and surgical interventions used in the treatment of cancer (including chemotherapy) can cause NeP (10).

CPS consensus statement: Management of NeP

<!-- PAGE=? -->
METHODS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 2007, the Canadian Pain Society (CPS) produced the first guidelines on pharmacological management of NeP tailored to the clinical practices of Canadian health professionals including analgesic agents specifically available in Canada (11). A consensus meeting was held in Whistler, British Columbia under the direction of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the CPS in May 2012 to update these guidelines, given the plethora of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published  since  2007  (Appendix  A).  There  is  also  recent  evidence from  community-based  studies  that  management  of  NeP ,  including postherpetic neuralgia, is not consistent with evidence-based recommendations  (12).  Funding  for  this  consensus  meeting  was  provided by  the  Neuropathic  Pain  Special  Interest  Group  of  the  CPS.  This involved  a  multidisciplinary  group  of  individuals  with  research  and clinical  expertise  relevant  to  the  pathophysiology  and  management  of  NeP.  This  group  met  to  review  the  randomized  controlled trials  (RCTs) and systematic reviews related to the pharmacological management of NeP to develop a revised evidence-based consensus statement on the management of NeP (13). Subsequent literature was reviewed by the group until September 2013.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systematic searches on Medline and Cochrane databases were conducted to identify recent systematic reviews, meta-analyses and treatment  recommendations, guidelines and/or consensus statements published since the first 2007 CPS consensus statement. Other selected publications and references were also considered. Medications could be recommended in the consensus statement if their analgesic efficacy was supported  by  at  least  one  methodologically  sound  RCT  (class  I  or class II) showing significant benefit relative to placebo or another relevant  control  group.  Trials  were  excluded  if  they  represented  uncontrolled studies, had sample sizes of <10 patients or studied cancer NeP except  for  well-defined  postsurgical  pain  syndromes  (eg,  postmastectomy pain syndrome) and chemotherapy-induced NeP. Trials were also excluded  if  they  studied  trigeminal  or  glossopharyngeal  neuralgia because these conditions have their own specific medical and surgical treatments (14). The initial draft of the present manuscript was prepared by the first author and subsequent revisions were based on feedback from the other authors until consensus was achieved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The current guidelines are based on quality of evidence of analgesic  efficacy,  side-effect  profiles  and  ease  of  use.  Medications  were considered to be first line if there was high-quality evidence of efficacy (at least one class I study or two consistent class II studies - level of recommendation grade B or better) (15); positive results in at least two  NeP  models  (16);  and  if  they  were  considered  to  be  straightforward  and  of  sufficient  tolerability  to  prescribe  and  monitor. Medications were considered to be second or third line if there was high-quality  evidence  of  efficacy,  but  the  medication  required  more specialized  follow-up  and  monitoring.  Fourth-line  treatments  had  at least one positive RCT, but require further study. A limitation of this algorithmic classification is that grading of tolerability and ease of use was based solely on consensus opinion of the authors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Target users for these guidelines are physicians, nurse practitioners and other allied health care individuals involved in the management of NeP. These guidelines have been endorsed by the Canadian Pain Coalition,  an  advocacy  group  for  patients  living  with  chronic  pain. The published guidelines will be disseminated through various websites, including the CPS website, and reprints will be made available to undergraduate and postgraduate trainees, and practicing health care workers attending continuing medical education events. They will be updated periodically by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the CPS.

ClINICAl CHARACTERISTICS AND DIFFERENTIAl DIAgNOSES OF NeP

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The clinical features of NeP can be divided into spontaneous pain and stimulus-evoked  pain.  Spontaneous  pain  is  commonly  described  as burning or intense tightness with superimposed shooting or lancinating pain. Stimulus-evoked pain includes allodynia, defined as painful sensations in response to a normally nonpainful stimulus, and hyperalgesia, defined as increased pain sensitivity in response to a normally painful stimulus. Superimposed autonomic features, such as alterations in  temperature,  colour  and  sweating  as  well  as  the  development  of trophic changes, suggest a diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome (17).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The differential diagnosis of NeP is extensive and includes central and  peripheral  causes.  Examples  of  central  NeP  include  poststroke pain ('thalamic pain syndrome'), pain related to multiple sclerosis and pain  due  to  spinal  cord  injury.  Common  causes  of  peripheral  NeP include  painful  diabetic  neuropathy,  postherpetic  neuralgia  and  surgically  induced  NeP ,  following  thoracotomy,  amputation,  breast  surgery and back surgery sometimes associated with nerve root fibrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The diagnosis of NeP is based primarily on the patient's history and physical examination. Postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy are typically easy to diagnose when there is a history of shingles and  diabetes  mellitus,  respectively.  However,  pain  radiating  into  an extremity can be either referred myofascial pain or NeP , and these can be much more challenging to diagnose. Simple questionnaires based on sensory  descriptors  and  sensory  examination  have  been  developed  to differentiate  between  somatic  pain  and  NeP .  Instruments  such  as  the Douleur  Neuropathique  4 and  the  Leeds  Assessment  of  Neuropathic Symptoms  and  Signs  have  been  shown  to  be  valid  and  reliable  discriminators of NeP (18,19). In addition, the presence of true weakness (sometimes difficult to differentiate from pain-related or antalgic weakness), reduced or absent reflexes, allodynia and hyperalgesia all favour a diagnosis of NeP. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are sometimes useful to provide more objective evidence of nerve injury, although electromyography study results are often normal in small-fibre neuropathies. Guidelines are available to determine the diagnostic certainty of NeP (possible, probable or definite) based on history, sensory signs, neurophysiological testing and neuroimaging (1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
gENERAl CONSIDERATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because NeP can be severe and unrelenting, it is important to recognize and treat comorbidities such as anxiety and depression. It is also important to recognize secondary treatment goals such as improving sleep,  ability  to  function  and  overall  quality  of  life.  However,  treatment goals must be realistic. Caregivers should validate the patient's pain to gain their trust and should set realistic treatment goals. This is typically  straightforward  from  the  caregiver's  point  of  view  because most NeP states are based on well-defined injuries to the nervous system. The primary goal in most cases is to make the pain 'bearable' or 'tolerable' - not to eliminate the pain. Such goal setting can make a considerable difference in patient satisfaction when pharmacological treatments are instituted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Due to the lack of head-to-head trials to guide treatment choices, one approach to estimate the relative efficacy of analgesic agents in RCTs is to use the number needed to treat (NNT) - the number of patients  that  need  to  be  treated  with  a  certain  drug  to  provide  one additional patient with at least 50% pain relief relative to the comparator group. The NNT is used to estimate treatment efficacy, recognizing  that  there  are  limitations  to  this  methodology  including variability in RCTs (eg, crossover versus parallel design) and the shortterm nature of most RCTs. Another approach to estimate efficacy is to determine  the  effect  size  -  defined  as  the  mean  difference  between active  agent  and  placebo  divided  by  the  SD.  The  effect  size  can  be classified as small (<0.5), medium (0.5 to <0.8) or large ( ≥ 0.8) (20).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appendix A summarizes the results of a systematic search of systematic  reviews,  meta-analyses  and  treatment  recommendations, guidelines and/or consensus statements published since the first 2007 CPS consensus statement. These results were reviewed and approved by two coauthors (DEM and IG) and provide the basis for the consensus statement presented here.

FIRST-lINE ANAlgESICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two classes of medications are recommended for first-line treatment in the management of NeP - anticonvulsants and certain antidepressants.

Anticonvulsants

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The gabapentinoids, gabapentin and pregabalin, bind to presynaptic voltage-gated  calcium  channels  in  the  dorsal  horn,  reducing  the release  of  excitatory  neurotransmitters  such  as  glutamate  and  substance P (21). These agents have been studied in large clinical trials, although mainly in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Gabapentin has shown efficacy in three trials involving painful diabetic neuropathy and two trials involving postherpetic neuralgia (22); however, four RCTs involving gabapentin have been negative, including a trial of gabapentin in chemotherapyinduced  painful  neuropathy  (23-26).  The  combined  NNTs  for gabapentin  in  the  management  of  painful  polyneuropathy  and  postherpetic neuralgia were 6.4 and 4.3, respectively (27).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregabalin is an analogue of gabapentin, with the same mechanism of action, but it manifests linear pharmacokinetics and has higher affinity for the presynaptic calcium channel. Four studies have shown that pregabalin provides significant pain relief and improved quality of life in painful  diabetic  neuropathy  (28)  and  an  additional  four  trials  have shown efficacy in postherpetic neuralgia (22). The combined NNTs for pregabalin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia were 4.5 and 4.2, respectively (27). Pregabalin has also been studied in chronic central NeP following spinal cord injury, with evidence of significant pain relief (29,30). However, a study investigating  pregabalin  in  the  treatment  of  NeP  associated  with  chronic lumbosacral  radiculopathy  was  negative  (31),  as  was  a  recent  trial involving refractory painful diabetic neuropathy (32). A study investigating  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  pregabalin  in  patients  with  central poststroke pain showed no significant improvement in the primary end point  of  pain  intensity;  however,  there  were  some  improvements  in secondary end points including sleep and anxiety (33).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carbamazepine remains the drug of first choice for tic douloureux (idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia), but otherwise is not recommended for the management of NeP (14). Anecdotally, it may also be useful in the management of glossopharyngeal neuralgia (14).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antidepressant agents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been shown to provide significant pain relief in various NeP conditions in many clinical trials, although the sample sizes have tended to be relatively small and most of these trials have used a crossover design (34). The combined NNTs for  TCAs  in  the  management  of  painful  diabetic  neuropathy  and postherpetic neuralgia were 2.1 and 2.8, respectively (27).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), duloxetine and venlafaxine, have mainly been studied in painful diabetic neuropathy. Duloxetine has demonstrated significant pain relief relative to placebo in three RCTs (28), with a combined NNT of 5.0 (27). A  recent  study  investigating  duloxetine  in  the  management  of chemotherapy-induced  painful  peripheral  neuropathy  showed  a  significant reduction in pain intensity relative to placebo, with a moderate effect size of 0.51 (35). However, duloxetine has also been studied in patients with central NeP due to spinal cord injury or stroke, and the results of this trial were negative (36).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venlafaxine has shown efficacy in trials involving painful diabetic neuropathy (37) and mixed painful polyneuropathy (38) at doses of 150  mg  to  225  mg  daily.  However,  the  latter  trial,  comparing  venlafaxine with imipramine, showed a higher proportion of responders in the  venlafaxine  group.  Another  trial  investigating  venlafaxine  plus gabapentin in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy showed significant pain relief relative to placebo plus gabapentin (39).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SECOND-lINE ANAlgESICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two opioid-type medications are recommended for second-line treatment in the management of NeP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tramadol

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tramadol is a weak opioid agonist and mimics some of the properties of the TCAs in that it inhibits reuptake of noradrenalin and serotonin (40). Tramadol has shown significant benefit in three RCT s investigating painful diabetic neuropathy and mixed NeP syndromes, and has an overall NNT of 4.9 (27). T ramadol leads to less constipation and nausea than other weak opioid analgesics, such as codeine (41), but is more expensive in Canada. Tramadol should be used with caution in conjunction with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) because of increased risk of confusion and serotonin syndrome, especially among elderly patients (42).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioid analgesics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A recent meta-analysis of opioids for chronic noncancer pain included 16 randomized trials for chronic NeP (43). Most of these trials investigated  painful  diabetic  neuropathy  and  postherpetic  neuralgia;  however, other trials focused on postamputation pain, sciatica and spinal cord injury pain. The authors found that opioids were more effective than placebo, with a moderate effect size (0.56) for pain. There was a small effect size (0.24) in favour of opioids for function in 13 of these RCTs. The combined NNT for opioids in the management of painful polyneuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia was 2.6 (27).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THIRD-lINE ANAlgESICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One class of medication is recommended for third-line treatment in the management of NeP - cannabinoids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cannabinoids

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The cannabinoids are analgesic agents with increasing evidence of efficacy in central NeP states, with a combined NNT of 3.4 (27). Dronabinol produced modest analgesia in a trial investigating central pain in multiple sclerosis (44). A 50/50 mixture of tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol in  the  form  of  an  oral  mucosal  spray  provided  significant  benefit  in another  trial  investigating  central  pain  in  multiple  sclerosis  (45).  A recent systematic review of clinical trials investigating cannabinoids in chronic pain determined that, since 2006, there have been seven highquality (class I and II) studies investigating NeP , and all of these studies except  one  were  positive  (46).  Four  of  these  studies  involved  smoked cannabis  for  the  management  of  HIV  neuropathy  (two  studies),  posttraumatic or postsurgical NeP , and combined central and peripheral NeP states.  T wo  trials  involved  the  cannabinoid  oral  mucosal  spray  in  the management of multiple peripheral NeP states with allodynia and painful diabetic  neuropathy.  The  single  negative  trial  compared  the  synthetic cannabinoid  nabilone  with  dihydrocodeine  in  peripheral  NeP  conditions, and found that dihydrocodeine was superior to nabilone. A more recent trial found that nabilone was effective in relieving symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy, and also improved disturbed sleep and overall quality of life using an enriched enrollment withdrawal design (47).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FOuRTH-lINE ANAlgESICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  classes  of  medications  can  be  considered  to  be  fourth-line treatments for NeP - SSRIs, other anticonvulsants, methadone, topical lidocaine and miscellaneous agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SSRIs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SSRIs appear to have a weak analgesic effect in the management of NeP. Citalopram (48), paroxetine (49) and escitalopram (50) have been found to be efficacious in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy and painful polyneuropathy independent of their antidepressant effects, but fluoxetine has not (51). However, the combined NNT for all four studies was 6.8 (27). SSRIs used primarily for depression may inhibit the metabolism of TCAs and may increase the risk for serotonin syndrome (52).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other anticonvulsants

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lamotrigine has been studied in a variety  of  peripheral  and  central NeP conditions, with variable results. Four studies investigating painful diabetic neuropathy, two studies investigating mixed NeP and single studies investigating chemotherapy-induced NeP and spinal cord injury  pain  were  negative.  Positive  trials  investigating  HIV-related neuropathy,  trigeminal  neuralgia  and  central  poststroke  pain  were reported; however, the sample sizes tended to be small, with significant dropout rates (53).

CPS consensus statement: Management of NeP

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lacosamide  is  an  anticonvulsant  agent  with  sodium  channelblocking properties. Lacosamide has been studied in five RCTs investigating painful diabetic neuropathy. There was modest benefit in each trial, with an NNT in the range of 10 to 12. Lacosamide, therefore, has limited efficacy in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy (54).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Topiramate and valproic acid have produced mixed results in NeP trials (27).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methadone

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methadone is a synthetic opioid analgesic that may be useful in the management of  NeP  related  to  its N -methyl-D-aspartate  antagonist properties  (55).  T wo  small  RCTs  demonstrated  benefit  from  methadone in chronic NeP (56,57) and survey data suggested efficacy in mixed NeP conditions (58). Methadone has excellent oral bioavailability and a duration of action of at least 8 h with repetitive dosing. It has an elimination half-life of 24 h to 36 h, which requires close observation during the titration phase. There are no high-quality RCTs to support the use of methadone in the management of NeP, although guidelines  for  the  use  of  methadone  in  the  management  of  chronic pain are available (59). An RCT comparing methadone with other oral opioids is urgently needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Topical lidocaine

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Topical lidocaine, as a sodium channel blocker, may be useful in the management of NeP. Systemic side effects are extremely rare as a result of negligible blood levels (60). Topical lidocaine is most practical for patients with localized peripheral NeP , such as postherpetic neuralgia, and remains a second-line agent for this condition based on three positive  RCTs  investigating  lidocaine  patch  5%  in  the  management  of postherpetic neuralgia (27). However, recent trials of lidocaine cream or  patch  5%  failed  to  provide  benefit  in  patients  with  postsurgical peripheral nerve injury (61) or in mixed NeP (62). Therefore, there are  conflicting  results  among  placebo-controlled  trials  investigating topical lidocaine for NeP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Miscellaneous agents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tapentadol is a novel analgesic that has recently become available in Canada. It is  pharmacologically similar to  tramadol  in  that  it  has  a dual mechanism of action, but has higher affinity for the mu opioid receptor and has only noradrenergic activity as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor.  Tapentadol  is  approximately  one-fifth  as  potent  as  oxycodone and has shown efficacy in the management of painful diabetic neuropathy, with greater tolerability (63).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Topical  capsaicin  may  have  utility  in  the  management  of  localized NeP such as postherpetic neuralgia. Following application to the skin,  capsaicin  initially  causes  enhanced  sensitivity  of  nociceptors, followed  by  persistent  desensitization  after  repeated  application  of low-concentration  (<1%)  capsaicin  or  a  single  application  of  highconcentration (8%) capsaicin. Several older studies involving small sample  sizes  indicate  that  low-concentration  capsaicin  provides minimal benefit relative to placebo creams (64). On the other hand, high-concentration capsaicin has recently been studied in four trials investigating postherpetic neuralgia and two trials investigating painful  HIV neuropathy using 0.04% topical capsaicin as the control to maintain  blinding.  All  of  these  studies  showed  significant  benefit relative to the control for up to 12 weeks after a single application. The NNT for the postherpetic neuralgia studies was in the range of eight to 10 and, for the HIV-neuropathy studies, was approximately 6.2  (65).  High-concentration  capsaicin  requires  preapplication  of local anesthetic because of the intense burning sensation it produces. This agent is quite expensive and only available in Canada through compassionate release from Health Canada.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Botulinum  toxin  has  been  studied  in  two  RCTs  involving  NeP. Both studies were positive, with significant reduction in pain intensity for 12 to 14 weeks, but these studies were likely underpowered due to small  sample  sizes.  A  crossover  trial  involving  patients  with  painful diabetic  neuropathy  included  only  18  patients  (66)  and  a  parallel design trial involving patients with focal painful neuropathies included

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combination pharmacotherapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combining ≥ 2  analgesic  agents  in  the  management  of  NeP  is  an attractive option because combination pharmacotherapy may improve analgesic efficacy and has the potential to reduce the overall side effect profile if synergistic effects allow for dose reductions of combined drugs (68). A recent Cochrane review of combination pharmacotherapy for the treatment of NeP in adults identified 21 eligible studies (69). The majority of these studies evaluated the combination of an opioid with gabapentin, pregabalin or a TCA, the combination of gabapentin and nortriptyline, and various topical medications. Meta-analysis was possible  for  only  one  combination  -  gabapentin  plus  opioid  versus gabapentin alone. The meta-analysis demonstrated modest superiority of gabapentin plus opioid versus gabapentin alone, although the combination produced significantly more dropouts due to accentuated side effects related to combination treatments. A recent RCT comparing a combination of standard doses of duloxetine (60 mg daily) and pregabalin  (300  mg  daily)  with  high-dose  monotherapy  (duloxetine 120mg daily or pregabalin 600 mg daily) found no significant difference in 24 h average pain, although side effects were comparable (70). Available studies do not support a recommendation of any one specific drug combination for NeP, although these studies do provide a rationale for combination pharmacotherapy.

STEPWISE PHARMACOlOgICAl MANAgEMENT OF NeP

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Figure 1 provides an updated algorithm for the pharmacological management of NeP, and Table 1 provides dosing guidelines for selected agents.  Nonpharmacological  interventions,  including  physiotherapy, exercise programs and psychological treatment modalities, are essential to enhance outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Relative to the previous guidelines for management of NeP published in 2007 (9), duloxetine has been upgraded from a second-line to a first-line agent based on recent evidence of efficacy in the management of chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy (35) in addition to previously established efficacy in painful diabetic neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TCAs,  gabapentinoids  and  SNRIs  are,  therefore,  now  all  considered  to  be  first-line  agents  in  the  management  of  chronic  NeP . TCAs have the advantage of low cost and once-daily dosing, but can produce drowsiness and significant anticholinergic side effects, including  dry  mouth,  constipation  and  urinary  retention,  and  are,  thus, poorly tolerated in the elderly. Secondary amine TCAs (nortriptyline

and desipramine) are better tolerated than tertiary amine TCAs (amitriptyline  and  imipramine)  with  comparable  analgesic  efficacy  (71). Cardiac toxicity is also a risk factor with TCAs, which are relatively contraindicated in patients with a history of arrhythmia (72).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gabapentin and pregabalin appear to be similar in their mechanisms of action and side-effect profiles, and allow for more rapid titration than antidepressant agents. Pregabalin carries the advantage of twice-daily dosing and linear pharmacokinetics relative to gabapentin. Gabapentinoids in general have few drug interactions, but are dependent  on  renal  excretion  and,  therefore,  require  dosage  reductions  in patients with renal insufficiency (72).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If a TCA fails or is contraindicated, the use of a gabapentinoid or an SNRI, such as duloxetine, should be considered. If one of the latter agents provides only partial pain relief, it is reasonable to add the other agent  because  there  is  evidence  that  combination  pharmacotherapy can be helpful (68).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When first-line medications fail or provide inadequate pain relief, tramadol or a conventional opioid analgesic may be useful as a secondline treatment. It is also reasonable to consider a short-acting opioid, such as codeine or oxycodone (sometimes combined with acetaminophen),  for  breakthrough  pain  during  titration  of  a  first-line  agent  if needed  for  severe  pain.  Controlled-release  opioid  analgesics  are  considered to be second-line agents in the management of NeP because of their extensive side-effect profile and the risk of opioid misuse, abuse and  addiction  leading  to  cautionary  prescribing  and  monitoring.  A recent meta-analysis of 62 RCTs found that the most common adverse effects associated with opioids were nausea (28%), constipation (25%), drowsiness (24%), dizziness (18%) and vomiting (15%) (43). Although tolerance may occur to several of these side effects, there is very little tolerance to constipation and almost all patients placed on a controlledrelease opioid analgesic require a bowel regimen with continued monitoring of bowel function. Potential long-term complications of opioid

<!-- PAGE=? -->
analgesia include opioid-induced hyperalgesia (73) and opioid-induced endocrinopathy  (74,75).  Endocrine  effects  manifest  as  hypogonadism and increased risk for osteopenia. Monitoring for risk for opioid addiction is also challenging. A review suggested that aberrant drug-related behaviours  and  illicit  drug  use  occurred  in  10%  to  15%  of  patients receiving chronic opioid therapy (76). Canadian guidelines for the safe and effective use of opioids for chronic noncancer pain, including monitoring for addiction, are strongly recommended (77).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The cannabinoids have now advanced to third-line agents in the management of chronic NeP based on increasing evidence of efficacy in multiple  pain  models  including  HIV  neuropathy,  post-traumatic  and postsurgical  NeP ,  painful  diabetic  neuropathy  and  spinal  cord  injury pain (46,47). However, the cannabinoids also require close monitoring, are contraindicated in patients with a history of psychosis and most of these agents, including the oral mucosal spray, are expensive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fourth-line agents in the management of NeP include methadone, tapentadol and anticonvulsants, with lesser evidence of efficacy such as lacosamide, lamotrigine and topiramate. Topical lidocaine has been relegated to fourth-line status because of conflicting evidence of efficacy except in the management of postherpetic neuralgia, for which it remains a second-line option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is more challenging to provide a stepwise systematic approach to the management of central NeP because of the relative paucity of highquality studies and conflicting evidence of efficacy. For instance, lamotrigine was found to be useful in the management of central poststroke pain, but not for spinal cord injury pain (53). Similarly, pregabalin has been found to be efficacious in the management of spinal cord injury pain (29,30), but not in central poststroke pain (33). However, it is reasonable to consider the gabapentinoids and cannabinoids as first-line agents for the management of spinal cord injury pain (78), and TCAs (79) and lamotrigine (53) in the management of central poststroke pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INVASIVE TECHNIQuES IN THE MANAgEMENT OF NeP

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although interventional techniques for NeP management are beyond the  scope  of  the  present  consensus  statement,  they  are  usually  considered  when  standard  pharmacological  treatments  fail  and  psychological  screening  shows  emotional  stability.  Intravenous  lidocaine infusions are generally safe, but evidence of efficacy is limited to one to two  weeks  postinfusion  (80).  T wo  recent  comprehensive  reviews  of interventional management of NeP concluded that weak recommendations could be made for epidural steroid injections for radiculopathy, and spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (81,82).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SuMMARY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The present updated consensus statement provides a stepwise pharmacological approach to the management of NeP. Gabapentinoids, TCAs and SNRIs represent first-line treatments for NeP either individually or in combination. When these agents fail, conventional opioid analgesics and tramadol provide important avenues of treatment, bearing in mind their associated risks and adverse effect profiles. Cannabinoids are now considered to be third-line agents based on recent evidence of efficacy, but also require judicious prescribing practices. Novel treatment approaches are required to improve our management of NeP and further  studies  are  necessary  to  examine  head-to-head  comparisons among  analgesics,  combinations  of  analgesics,  long-term  outcomes and treatments of pediatric, geriatric and central NeP.
