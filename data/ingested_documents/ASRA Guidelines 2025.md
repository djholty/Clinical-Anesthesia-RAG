ABSTRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemorrhagic complications associated with regional anesthesia are extremely rare. The fifth edition of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine's Evidence-  Based Guidelines on regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy reviews the published evidence since 2018 and provides guidance to help avoid this potentially catastrophic complication.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The fifth edition of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine's Evidence-  Based Guidelines on regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy uses similar methodology as previous editions but is reorganized and significantly condensed. Therefore, the clinicians are encouraged to review the earlier texts for more detailed descriptions of methods, clinical trials, case series and pharmacology. It is impossible to perform large, randomized controlled trials evaluating a complication this rare; therefore, where the evidence is limited, the authors continue to maintain an 'antihemorrhagic' approach focused on patient safety and have proposed conservative times for the interruption of therapy prior to neural blockade. In previous versions, the anticoagulant doses were described as prophylactic and therapeutic. In this version, we will be using 'low dose' and 'high dose,' which will allow us to be consistent with other published guidelines and more accurately describe the dose in the setting of specific patient characteristics and indications. For example, the same 'high' dose may be used in one patient as a treatment for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and in another patient as prophylaxis for recurrent DVT. Due to the increasing ability to obtain drug-  specific assays, we have included suggestions for when ordering these tests may be helpful and guide practice. Like previous editions, at the end of each recommendation the authors have clearly noted how the recommendation has changed from previous editions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemorrhagic  complications  may  occur  after  any neuraxial (spinal or epidural) or peripheral/plexus regional anesthetic technique. However, when the bleeding  occurs  within  fixed,  non-  compressible, and/or concealed sites, such as the spinal canal or psoas compartment, the result may be catastrophic. 1 The  development  and  evolving  status  of  standards  for  the  prevention  of  perioperative  venous thromboembolism (VTE), as well as the introduction of increasingly more potent antithrombotic medications, resulted in concerns regarding the heightened risk of neuraxial bleeding after neuraxial and deep plexus  or  deep  peripheral  blocks.  In  response  to these  ongoing  patient  safety  issues,  the  American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA  PM)  has  published  four  previous  sets  of evidence-  based  recommendations for the management of regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy. The 1998 and 2003 editions focused on neuraxial blocks and anticoagulants  in surgical patients, 2-7 while  the 2010 publication 8 also addressed, for the first time, the  risk  of  significant  bleeding  in  patients  undergoing plexus and peripheral techniques. The fourth edition, published in 2018, 9 included a comprehensive review of the management of thromboprophylaxis  in  the  parturient  and  also  acknowledged the need  for  separate  recommendations  for  patients undergoing  interventional  pain  procedures  while receiving  antithrombotic  therapy.  Portions  of  the material  presented  here  in  the  fifth  edition  were included in the 1998, 2003, 2010, and 2018 ASRA PM  Consensus  Documents. 2-9 The  fifth  edition uses similar methods but is significantly condensed from previous versions, and therefore the clinician is encouraged to review the earlier texts for more detailed descriptions of methods, clinical trials, case series and pharmacology.

In previous versions of the guidelines, the anticoagulant  doses  were  described  as  prophylactic and therapeutic.  In  this  version,  we  will  be  using 'low dose' and 'high dose,' which will allow us to be consistent  with  other  published  guidelines  and more accurately describe the dose in the setting of specific patient characteristics and indications. For example,  an  identical  'high'  dose  of  a  direct  oral anticoagulant (DOAC) is therapeutic in one patient and prophylactic in another patient depending on the  individual  patient's  characteristics  and  indications for the DOAC (table 1).

and practice. These recommendations are intended for use by anesthesiologists and other physicians and healthcare providers performing neuraxial and deep plexus/peripheral regional anesthetic/analgesic blockade. However, these recommendations may also serve as a resource for other healthcare providers involved in  the  management  of  patients  who  have  undergone  or  will undergo similar procedures (eg, myelography, lumbar puncture).

METHODS AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once again, ASRA PM has convened a panel with international (AP  and  EV)  and  multidisciplinary  representation,  including experts in thrombophilia (RM) and obstetric anesthesia (LL). In order to avoid conflicting recommendations, we have compared the current ASRA PM recommendations with those of the Society for  Obstetric  Anesthesia  and  Perinatology  (SOAP),  National Partnership  for  Maternal  Safety, 10 the  European  Society  of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC), and the European Society of Regional Anaesthesia (ESRA). 11 Based on their expertize, authors were assigned to review and update certain sections of these guidelines. The authors performed a literature search using MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed and specific keywords for each topic and updated the 2018 recommendations if there was new evidence. There were no limitations  on  language  or  types  of  articles  considered,  given  the rarity  of  neuraxial  hematoma and the primary keywords used were determined by the authors based on their assigned topic or medication. The updated recommendations are clearly denoted

within the document as 'new recommendations.' All authors met several times to review the recommendations, discuss concerns, and ultimately reached a consensus based on the limited existing evidence and published guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the past, for each of the antithrombotic agents, ASRA PM has  recommended  that  clinicians  follow  the  Food  and  Drug Administration (FDA)-  approved dosing and American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) management guidelines. However, over time,  ACCP  recommendations  for  the  perioperative  management  of  antithrombotic  therapy  have  become  increasingly more  'antithrombotic'-with  shorter  time  intervals  between discontinuation and procedures and earlier reinstitution of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy. In some cases, the recommended time interval between the last dose of drug and surgery is  shorter  than  the  FDA-  approved  labeling.  For  example,  the ACCP  recommends  that  ticagrelor  be  discontinued  3-5  days prior to non-  cardiac surgery. 12 However, labeling states, 'when possible, interrupt therapy for 5  days prior to surgery that has a major risk of bleeding.' Conversely, ASRA PM recommendations remain more 'antihemorrhagic,' and more pharmacologically based, with the intent to have near-  complete resolution of the  antithrombotic effect  at  the  time  of  regional  blockade  for high-  risk (neuraxial and deep plexus/peripheral) procedures. As a result, there are several instances where the ACCP and ASRA PM recommendations  differ  (eg,  antiplatelet  medications  and apixaban). These will be discussed in detail within the respective sections. It is important to recognize that the intent of these guidelines  is  to  prevent  hemorrhagic  complications  and  are therefore conservative compared with guidelines developed to prevent thrombosis.

STRENGTH AND GRADE OF RECOMMENDATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The suggestions and recommendations presented are based on a thorough evaluation of the available information for this very rare outcome. In order to clearly delineate the recommendation changes in this edition, we used the same evidence classification that had been used in previous editions, which does not precisely follow  the  new  Grading  of  Recommendations,  Assessment, Development, and Evaluations recommendations. This will be updated in the next edition. The level of evidence classification combines an objective description of the types of studies and/ or  expert  consensus  supporting  the  recommendation.  Unfortunately,  with  a  complication  as  rare  as  neuraxial  hematoma, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-  analyses, the highest (I) level of evidence, are not available. Numerous observational and epidemiological series level of evidence (II) have documented the conditions for safe performance of neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia  in  the  anticoagulated  patient.  However,  high-  quality evidence may come from well-  done observational series yielding very large risk reduction and depending on the risk reduction, recommendations  from  these  sources  may  be  categorized  as level  of  evidence I or II. Recommendations derived from case reports  or  expert  opinion  is  based  on  a  level  of  evidence  III. Often, recommendations involving the anesthetic management of new antithrombotic agents (where data involving safety and/ or risk are sparse) are based on the pharmacology of hemostasisaltering drugs, risk of surgical bleeding, and expert opinionlevel of evidence III.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The strength of recommendation also indicates the strength of  the  guideline  and  the  degree  of  consensus  agreement.  For example, grade A represents general agreement in the efficacy, grade  B  notes  conflicting  evidence  or  opinion  on  the  usefulness, and grade C suggests that the procedure may not be useful

(possibly harmful). In the case of regional anesthesia and anticoagulation, a grade A recommendation would allow safe performance in patients who benefit from the technique, while grade C may represent performance of the technique in a patient at unacceptably  high  risk  for  bleeding  (eg,  epidural  analgesia  in the patient receiving twice-  daily low molecular weight heparin (LMWH))  or  withholding  the  technique  from  a  patient  who would likely benefit from its performance (eg, thoracic epidural analgesia following thoracotomy with thromboprophylaxis using twice-  daily low-  dose unfractionated heparin (UFH)). The phrase 'we  recommend'  is  used  for  strong  recommendations  (grades IA, IB, and IC) and 'we suggest' for weaker recommendations (grades IIA, IIB, and IIC). In cases where the evidence is scant (such  as  with  the  new  oral  anticoagulants),  the  authors  maintained an 'antihemorrhagic' approach focused on patient safety and proposed conservative (ie, longer) times for interruption of therapy prior to neural blockade. These will likely be revised as additional information regarding blood levels and anticoagulant effect is presented.

CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VTE is an important healthcare problem and a significant source of  morbidity  and  mortality.  Nearly  all  hospitalized  patients have at least one risk factor for thromboembolism and approximately 40% have three or more risk factors (table 2). 13 Consequently, the majority of hospitalized patients are candidates for thromboprophylaxis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  2012,  the  ACCP  published  guidelines  for  VTE  prophylaxis for medical, surgical, and orthopedic surgical patients. 14-16 Recent updates published in 2016 and 2021 provide no additional  guidance  on  this  topic. 17  18 The  agent,  dosing  regimen, and duration of thromboprophylaxis is based on identification of risk factors, both individual (eg, age, gender, history of thromboembolism) and group-  specific (eg, primary reason for hospitalization, surgery, medical illness) (table 3). 13 16 Depending on the  risks  of  thromboembolism  and  bleeding,  thromboprophylaxis  may  be  achieved  with  intermittent  compression  devices, with  medications,  or  a  combination  of  both. 15  16 Since  an

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hospital-  acquired VTE is defined as VTE occurring from the time of admission until 3 months following hospital dismissal. 19-21 Hospital-  acquired VTE after discharge accounts for nearly half of all thromboembolic events occurring in our communities. 20 A  number  of  societies  have  adopted  and  published  guideline recommendations  for  VTE  prevention  for  patients  hospitalized with medical or surgical indications. 14-16 21-24 Adoption of thromboprophylaxis has been less than adequate for this otherwise preventable disease. 21

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  logical  approach  to  VTE  prophylaxis  begins  with  individualized  risk  assessment.  Several  well-  validated  risk  assessment  tools  are  available  for  individualized  patient-  specific guidance including both medical and surgical indications. For patient's hospitalized with a medical condition, the PADUA 25 and  IMPROVE 26   risk  tools  provide  a  well-  validated  framework for assessing which patients will most benefit from VTE prophylaxis (table 2). Recently, fibrin D-  dimer has been added to the IMPROVE tool (so-  called IMPROVEDD score), further refining  risk  assessment. 27 Thereafter,  a  bleeding  risk  assessment can be performed using the IMPROVE bleeding tool, 28 which helps to determine which patient should receive pharmacological VTE versus mechanical DVT prophylaxis. Patients at increased risk for thrombosis (PADUA score ≥4) with low bleeding risk (IMPROVE score <7) should be given pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. The minority of patients (<10% of those  hospitalized)  with  high  bleeding  risk  (IMPROVE  score ≥7) should receive mechanical prophylaxis alone. 28 In general, combining pharmacological and mechanical DVT prophylaxis among critically ill patient has not been shown to add benefit. 29 Conversely, for trauma patients, combined use of pharmacological  and  mechanical  VTE  prophylaxis  appears  to  reduce DVT  and  symptomatic  pulmonary  embolism  (PE). 30 The agent, dosing, regimen, and duration of thrombophophylaxis is  based on identification of risk factors, both individual (eg, age, gender, history of thromboembolism) and group specific (eg, primary reason for hospitalization, surgery, medical illness) (table 3). 13 16

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Similar  risk  assessment  tools  are  available  for  the  surgical patient  population.  The  Caprini  and  Rogers  tools  assign  risk based on a number of surgery-  specific and other clinical variables. 31  32 The  Caprini  risk  calculator  has  been  validated  for a  number  of  specific  surgical  indications. 33-37 In  addition  to providing risk categorization from low to very high, this easy to implement tool provides guidance for both type and duration of prophylaxis delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  cancer  pose  a  unique  and  challenging  set  of clinical  variables,  whereas  these  patients  are  both  at  risk  of VTE as well as major bleeding. 38 The risk of VTE depends on tumor type, stage,  duration,  and  is  treatment  specific.  Several risk assessment tools have been developed for VTE prophylaxis among ambulatory patients with cancer. The Khorana score is a  popular  and  well-  validated  example. 39 This  score  considers cancer  type,  prechemotherapy  hemoglobin,  body  mass  index, leukocyte, and platelet counts to determine the risk of acute VTE over the ensuing 2.5 months. Following the publication of two RCTs of DOACs, guideline recommendations include consideration of outpatient VTE prophylaxis among high-  risk patients (Khorana score ≥2). 40-43 For  patients  with  cancer  undergoing surgery or hospitalized for medical indications, inpatient VTE prophylaxis is guideline endorsed.

Perioperative anticoagulant management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
More  than  6  million  Americans  are  managed  with  chronic anticoagulation therapy for treatment of primary or secondary prevention of thromboembolism in the context of atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valve prosthesis, or VTE. 44 45 Of these, approximately  20%  will  undergo  an  invasive  procedure  each year, for which decision-  making regarding anticoagulant interruption  will  be  required  of  their  healthcare  team. 46  47 More than  34  million  Americans  have  an  indication  for  antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin or a thienopyridine for the indications of coronary heart disease, prior stroke, or peripheral artery disease (PAD). 45 Like anticoagulants, perioperative management of antiplatelet agents also require thoughtful decision-  making.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Goals of management include a strategy to minimize periprocedural  thrombosis,  bleeding,  mortality,  inconvenience,  and economic burden. Formal guidelines have been provided by the ACCP in 2012, with a recent update in 2022. 12 48 The periprocedural  period  has  been  defined  as  beginning  1  week  prior  to the  procedure  and  ending  4  weeks  following  the  procedure. This  5-  week  interval  encompasses  the  time  frame  when  most thrombotic  and  hemorrhagic  complications  relative  to  this encounter  occur. 49 In  preparation  for  the  invasive  procedure, the oral anticoagulant is often discontinued for several days to allow for adequate hemostasis during the proposed procedure. A strategy of periprocedural 'bridging' leverages the short-  acting pharmacology  of  LMWH  to  shorten  the  time  of  anticoagulant  interruption,  thereby  reducing  the  risk  of  periprocedural thromboembolism. Over the nearly two decades since concept inception, much has been learned which has led to a temporized enthusiasm for bridging heparin therapy. 50 While risks of thromboembolism have not always been improved, rates of perioperative bleeding have increased. 51 Balancing the risk of bleeding and clotting during this 5-  week interval can be challenging and requires a judicious approach.

INCIDENCE, RISK FACTORS, AND NEUROLOGICAL OUTCOME OF NEURAXIAL HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial hematoma, defined as symptomatic bleeding within the spinal neuraxis, is a rare and potentially catastrophic complication of spinal or epidural placement. The actual incidence of neurological  dysfunction  resulting  from  hemorrhagic  complications associated with central neuraxial blockade is unknown; traditional  estimates  prior  to  the  implementation  of  routine perioperative  thromboprophylaxis  were  approximated  to  be <1 in 150 000 epidural and <1 in 220 000 spinal anesthetics. 3 However, case series and epidemiological surveys suggest that the  risk  has  increased 3  52  53 and  may  be  as  high  as  1:3000  in certain patient populations, such as elderly women undergoing total knee replacement under epidural anesthesia. 3 52

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is impossible to conclusively determine risk factors for the development  of  neuraxial  hematoma  in  patients  undergoing spinal  or  epidural  anesthesia  solely  through  a  review  of  case series,  which  represent  only  patients  with  the  complication and do not define those who underwent uneventful neuraxial analgesia.  However,  large  inclusive  surveys  that  evaluate  the frequencies  of  complications  (including  neuraxial  hematoma), as  well  as  identify  subgroups of patients with higher or lower risk, enhance our ability to risk stratify. Moen et al investigated serious neurological complications among 1  260  000 spinal and 450 000 epidural blocks performed in Sweden over a 10-  year period. 52 T wenty-  four of the 33 spinal hematomas occurred in the  last  5  years  of  the  decade  surveyed.  Among  the  33  spinal hematomas,  24  occurred  in  females;  25  were  associated  with an  epidural  technique.  A  coagulopathy  (existing  or  acquired) was present in 11 patients; two of these patients were parturients  with  hemolysis,  elevated  liver  enzymes,  and  low  platelets syndrome. Pathology of the spine was present in six patients. The presenting complaint was typically lower extremity weakness, rather than radicular back pain. Only five of 33 patients recovered neurologically (due to delay in the diagnosis/intervention). These demographics, risk factors, and outcomes confirm those of previous series. 53 Importantly, the methodology allowed for calculation of frequency of spinal hematoma among patient populations. For example, the risk associated with epidural analgesia in women undergoing childbirth was significantly less (one in 200 000) than that in elderly women undergoing knee arthroplasty (one in 3600, p<0.0001). Likewise, women undergoing hip fracture surgery under spinal anesthesia had an increased risk of spinal hematoma (one in 22 000) compared with all patients undergoing spinal anesthesia (one in 480 000).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  relatively  hypercoagulable  state  of  pregnancy  may  be protective and offers one possible reason for the lower rate of neuraxial  hematomas in the obstetric  population.  The  normal anatomic  changes  that  occur  in  the  aging  spine  may  provide another  explanation  for  the  differing  incidence.  Both  Moen et al and Pöpping et al cited osteoporotic deformities as likely contributing to the risk of symptomatic vertebral canal bleeding after epidural blockade in elderly women. 52 54

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall, these series suggest that the risk of clinically significant bleeding varies with age, associated abnormalities of the spinal cord or vertebral column, the presence of an underlying coagulopathy, difficulty during needle placement, and an indwelling neuraxial  catheter  during  continued  anticoagulation  (particularly with standard heparin or LMWH), perhaps in an additive versus synergistic multifactorial manner. They also consistently demonstrate the need for prompt diagnosis and intervention.

PHARMACOLOGICAL-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As previously mentioned, recommendations involving the anesthetic management of new antithrombotic agents are once again based on the pharmacology of hemostasis-  altering drugs, using  the  ESAIC/ESRA  methodology 11 as  was  done  with  the previous fourth edition. 9 In contrast to the fourth edition, 9 the terms 'low' and 'high' doses will be used instead of the terms 'prophylactic'  and  'therapeutic.'  Depending  on  the  indication, a  'prophylactic  dose'  may  actually  be  what  is  also  considered a  'therapeutic  dose.'  For  example,  the  same  'high'  dose  may be used in one patient as a treatment for DVT and in another patient as prophylaxis for recurrent DVT. Also, the presence of reduced kidney function, a low body weight, advanced age, and/ or the concomitant use of drugs such as permeability glycoprotein inhibitors such as ciclosporin, dronedarone, erythromycin, or  ketoconazole  may  also  cause  a  'prophylactic'  dose  to  be  a 'high' dose. When calculating the timing of discontinuation of an anticoagulant, the pharmacokinetics for healthy populations were  used  (eg,  compared  with  those  at  the  extremes  of  age, weight, and with compromised renal function). For the patient on a low (previously 'thromboprophylactic') dose, a time interval of twice t 1/2 was required. A high (previously 'therapeutic') dose necessitates a time interval of five times t 1/2 for performance of neuraxial or deep plexus blocks. Likewise, the t 1/2 for  patients with renal insufficiency would be used to determine the timing of the last dose. Finally, the timing of the first dose after block or catheter removal is also based on the pharmacology of the

DIRECT ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Currently,  the  medications  known  as  DOACs  consist  of  the oral direct Xa antagonists (DXA) apixaban (Eliquis), edoxaban (Savaysa), and rivaroxaban (Xarelto). Dabigatran (Pradaxa) is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI). They have similar indications (table 1) and are generally prescribed to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non-  valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), for  treatment  of  DVT  and  PE,  to  reduce  the  risk  of recurrence of DVT or PE, and the prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE in patients undergoing knee and/or hip replacement surgery. Rivaroxaban may also be used in the prophylaxis of VTE in acutely ill medical patients, while only rivaroxaban has the indication to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and/or to reduce the  risk  of  major  thrombotic  vascular  events  in  patients  with PAD. Depending on individual patient characteristics and indications, the same 'high' dose of a DOAC is considered therapeutic when used in a patient for the treatment of DVT and inversely as prophylactic when used in another patient for the prevention of recurrent DVT. Therefore, a table showing the 'low' and 'high' doses of the various DOACs and their indications are shown in table 1. Betrixaban was taken off the market in the USA in April 2020 and therefore will not be discussed. Finally, as the pharmacology of apixaban, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran was extensively discussed in the previous fourth edition of the ASRA PM anticoagulation guidelines on regional anesthesia in the patient receiving antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy, 9 it will not be repeated in the present update, but a summary of the pharmacokinetics can be found in table 4.

The anticoagulant effect of DXAs can be reliably measured using drug-  specific, calibrated anti-  X activity (aXa) assays. 57-60 A  non-  detectable  anticoagulant  effect  is  defined  as  a  drugspecific threshold plasma level <30 ng/mL. 57 59 If drug-  specific calibrated aXa assays are not available, a clinically relevant DXA effect can be ruled out by the use of UFH-  calibrated or LMWHcalibrated chromogenic aXa assays. 58 61 In these cases, an aXa activity of 0.1 IU/mL or less is considered to be an undetectable anticoagulant effect. 57-60 Chromogenic drug-  specific calibrated aXa assays are very sensitive to the presence of DXA, especially at  therapeutic  plasma  levels,  but  do  not  allow  assessment  of plasma  levels  lower  than  or  around  30  ng/mL.  Using  sample dilution  and  an  appropriate  calibrated  assay  may  overcome this. 60 62

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anticoagulant effect of a DTI (ie, dabigatran) can be monitored using the thrombin time (TT). The TT is highly sensitive to dabigatran, and a normal TT predicts the absence of dabigatran or the presence of low plasma concentrations. 57 However, due to this high sensitivity, dabigatran plasma levels lower than or close to 30 ng/mL may cause the TT to still be significantly prolonged. 63 Hence,  a  prolonged  TT  is  not  necessarily  linked to  a  high  dabigatran  level,  which  makes  the  TT  not  suited  to correctly  quantify  low  dabigatran  plasma  levels. 64 In  contrast, the diluted TT (dTT) overcomes the high sensitivity of the TT and has a linear dose response-  relationship with clotting times inversely  proportional  to  the  dabigatran  plasma  levels. 60  65-67 Recent  studies  and  guidelines  have  defined  an  undetectable

anticoagulant effect with a dTT-  specific threshold value of <30 ng/mL. 57 59

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The availability of these tests throughout the USA and the rest of the world is presently unreliable. We provide recommendations and threshold values with the hope that these tests become more routine and the results more immediate. The use of routine coagulation tests such as the prothrombin time (PT) or the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should not be used to assess the degree of anticoagulation produced by the DOACs, as there is a large variability in the sensitivity of the reagent used in the different tests. 60 63 68

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At  the  time  of  submission,  there  are  no  RCTs  specifically studying the correlation between low and high doses of DOACs and the occurrence of neuraxial block-  related subarachnoid or epidural hematoma in patients. In addition, most of the published cases  of  neuraxial  hematomas  associated  with  a  DOAC  were either  spontaneous  or  traumatic  in  origin  and  involved  apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban. 9 69-75 Only a limited number of these case reports were associated with a neuraxial block, 9 76 77 and  involved  potentially  confounding  risk  factors  such  as  the concomitant use of other antithrombotic drugs (eg, enoxaparin and/or  warfarin),  the  removal  of  the  epidural  catheter  after  a shorter  time  interval  than  recommended  by  the  manufacturer or resuming therapeutic (high) dose dabigatran 24 hours after the neuraxial intervention. In the previous guidelines, the pharmacokinetic properties (table 4) and expert opinion were key elements  to  recommend  therapy-  free  time  intervals  to  enable the safe performance of a neuraxial or deep plexus intervention in patients treated with a DOAC. A neuraxial anesthetic intervention is considered a high bleeding risk procedure as bleeding would have important consequences not so much in terms of blood loss, but mainly in terms of a neurological deficit caused by bleeding into a confined space. 78 79 It is therefore recommended that a complete return of normal hemostasis is required before any neuraxial or deep plexus/peripheral block is performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In healthy patients (young and old) treated with a low-  dose DOAC, twice the half-  life (T 1/2 ) (correlating to when only 25% of the drug is remaining in circulation) was used to determine therapy-  free  time  intervals  after  the  last  ingestion, 80 while  in patients treated with a high dose, five times the T 1/2 (correlating to when only 6.2% to 3.1% of the drug remains in circulation) was recommended. 81 The same principle was applied to patients with renal insufficiency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Still,  the  use  of  the  T 1/2 carries  the  inherent  risk  of  (inter) individual  variability,  which  becomes  more  important  when high doses are used. In these cases, the use of customized clotting tests to determine any residual anticoagulant activity may be  a  valuable  addition  or  alternative  to  the  T 1/2 -  based  calculations.  As  already  mentioned  and  although  never  clinically validated, 58  59 most  experts  and  international  anesthesiology societies  consider  a  DOAC  plasma  level  <30  ng/mL  as  a  safe hemostatic  threshold 82-84 to  avoid  bleeding.  Recent  prospective  data  have  become  available  on  the  residual  anticoagulant effect following a standardized preoperative interruption of high doses of DOACs. In a substudy of a prospective cohort study of adults (creatinine clearance (CrCl) >50  mL/min), aged ≥18 years, with NVAF who were taking dabigatran, 110 mg or 150 mg  two  times  per  day,  and  required  treatment  interruption for  an  elective  surgery/procedure,  Douketis et  al reported  the residual anticoagulant effect in 59 dabigatran-  treated patients. 85 If  the  planned  procedure  had  a  high  bleeding  risk  (including a neuraxial intervention), the last dose was to be taken 3 days (minimum  60-72 hours  from  last  dose)  preprocedure. 78 No detectable  anticoagulant  effect  (ie,  a  plasma  level  <20  ng/mL)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
measured by the dTT was found in 95.5% of the patients at the time of the procedure. In 2017, Godier et al studied 422 patients (CrCl >50 mL/min) treated with a high dose of apixaban, rivaroxaban,  or  dabigatran,  and  found  that  a  49-72  hours  preprocedural discontinuation of these DOACs resulted in apixaban, rivaroxaban,  and  dabigatran  plasma  levels  >30  ng/mL  in  only 5% of the patients. 59 These results supported guidelines that the dabigatran-  free time interval before a procedure should also be based on renal function. In the presence of a CrCl of 30-50  mL/ min 4-5 days would be needed to ensure a minimal anticoagulant effect in patients receiving dabigatran undergoing a high bleeding risk procedure. Finally, the recent large international, multicenter The Perioperative Anticoagulation Use for Surgery Evaluation  (PAUSE)  trial  reported  the  residual  DOAC  plasma levels after high doses of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, in 3007 patients with NVAF, immediately prior to an invasive procedure. 57 Patients in this trial were separated in three cohorts depending on the specific DOAC used (apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban). Patients were included if the indication for anticoagulation was atrial fibrillation, their age was >18 years, they were taking one of three DOACs, and were scheduled for an elective  invasive  procedure.  Exclusion  criteria  included  severe renal  impairment  (CrCl  <25  mL/min  for  apixaban  or  <30 mL/min for dabigatran or rivaroxaban). The mean CHA2DS2 Vascular score was approximately 3.5 and nearly 20% of subjects had a history of stroke or TIA. Approximately one-  third of each group underwent a high bleeding risk procedure, whereas twothirds underwent low bleeding risk procedures. All DOACs had been omitted for 2 days (last dose taken 3 days or 60-68  hours prior) before a high bleeding-  risk procedure (apixaban, rivaroxaban if CrCl ≥30  mL/min, and dabigatran if CrCl ≥50  mL/min), and 4 days (ie, last dose taken 5 days prior, dabigatran if CrCl 30-50 mL/min).  Overall,  30-  day  major  bleeding  rates  ranged from 0.9% to 1.85%. Major bleeding rates were higher for high bleeding  risk  procedures  (0.88%-2.90%)  compared  with  low bleeding  risk  procedures  (0.59%-1.27%).  The  30-  day  arterial thromboembolic event rates were low between 0.16% and 0.6% after a mean apixaban-  free time interval of 63.8  hours, residual aXa plasma levels  were  <30  ng/mL  in  93.1%  of  the  patients. A mean rivaroxaban-  free  time  interval  of  72  hours  resulted  in residual aXa plasma levels <30  ng/mL in 85.3% of the patients. The  residual anticoagulant  plasma  levels  were  <30 ng/mL (measured by the dTT) in 98.9% for all dabigatran patients after 63.2  hours (cohort with CrCl ≥50  mL/min) or after 110.2  hours (cohort with CrCl <50 mL/min). 57 No spinal hematomas were reported in the 230 patients (7.6 %) that had a neuraxial block. Similar data for edoxaban are lacking, and therefore the recommendations are based on the pharmacokinetic profile and expert opinion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The FDA-  approved labeling of apixaban and edoxaban states that the (prolonged) use of indwelling neuraxial catheters may increase the risk of a spinal or epidural bleeding. 86-88 Moreover, all manufacturers emphasize the risk of a neuraxial bleed associated with the removal of a neuraxial catheter. 86-90 If a DOAC were  to  be  inadvertently  administered  in  the  presence  of  an indwelling neuraxial catheter, a therapy-  free interval identical to the ones recommended prior to a neuraxial intervention should be observed, or the absence of any residual anticoagulant activity should be documented using an appropriate hemostatic assay.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  most  recent  guidelines  on  VTE  prophylaxis  from  the ACCP, 12 and  the  ESAIC, 55  56 were  helpful  to  recommend  the timing to resume a DOAC treatment after a neuraxial intervention (ie, the removal of the neuraxial catheter). VTE prophylaxis (ie, low dose) should be resumed/started 6  hours postoperatively,

while therapeutic anticoagulation should be restarted ≥24  hours postoperatively. 55 56 In 2007, Rosencher et al recommended that the next/first postoperative dose of an antithrombotic agent to be administered ≥6  hours (ie, 8  hours (the time needed for an initial platelet plug to solidify) minus T max (the onset time of a drug, which is 2-3  hours for the DOACs)) after surgery. 80 Both the ACCP and European  Heart  Rhythm  Association  (EHRA)  recommend  that the postoperative resumption of DOAC therapy, irrespective of the dose used, be delayed for 24 hours after a procedure with a low/moderate bleeding risk, and for 48-72  hours after a procedure with high bleeding risk, and only to be administered when adequate surgical hemostasis has been accomplished. 12 79 In  the interim, a prophylactic/low-  dose anticoagulant, such as LMWH or UFH, can be considered in patients at high thrombotic risk. 12 79 91

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Finally, the manufacturers recommend that in case of a traumatic neuraxial puncture the administration of the next dose of apixaban and rivaroxaban should be delayed for 48 hours and 24 hours, respectively. 86 88 89 There is no such recommendation for dabigatran and edoxaban. 87 90

REVERSAL OF THE DIRECT ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) is a recombinant protein that is indicated in patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban, where reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-  threatening or uncontrolled  bleeding. 92-94 A  multicenter,  prospective,  openlabel, single-  group study evaluated 67 patients who had an acute major bleed within 18 hours after the administration of apixaban or rivaroxaban. Andexanet alfa substantially reduced apixaban and rivaroxaban with effective hemostasis occurring in 79% of the patients and reducing aXa activity by 92% for both DXAs, at 15-30 min from the end of bolus administration. 95 A full study report  followed  in  2019  including  227  and  90  patients  with intracranial or gastrointestinal bleeding, respectively. 96 In  both the apixaban and rivaroxaban cohorts, the median aXa activity decreased by 92% after the andexanet alfa bolus. Although excellent or good hemostasis was found in 82% of the patients, there was no significant relationship between hemostatic efficacy and a reduction in aXa activity. Hence, it remains unclear whether the remaining plasma levels of aXa activity after andexanet alfa administration are predictive of the risk of a neuraxial bleeding. The Annexa-  4 trial reported similar results: in apixaban-  treated and  rivaroxaban-  treated  patients,  andexanet  alfa  reduced  the median aXa activity by 93.8% and 92.6%, respectively. 97 Finally, in  a  prospective  single-  arm  cohort  study  of  36  patients  with acute  major  bleeding  while  treated  with  edoxaban,  andexanet alfa  significantly  decreased  aXa  activity,  but  to  a  lesser  extent (median 68.9%) than in apixaban-  treated or rivaroxaban-  treated patients. 98 Whether or not the remaining plasma levels of aXa activity after andexanet alfa administration are predictive of the risk  of  a  neuraxial  bleeding  still  remains  unclear.  In  addition, current commercial aXa assays are unsuitable for measuring the remaining factor Xa activity following administration of andexanet alfa. 94 Finally, re-  elevation or incomplete reversal of anticoagulant activity may occur because of andexanet alfa's short terminal half-  life (ie, 5-7  hours) and its ability to displace DXAs from the extravascular to the intravascular compartment. 93

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A US FDA approval, under accelerated approval regulations pending further investigations, followed in 2018. 99 Andexanet alfa is approved to reverse the anticoagulant effect of apixaban and  rivaroxaban,  when  reversal  of  anticoagulation  is  needed due to life-  threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Andexanet alfa is  not  approved  for  reversal  of  anticoagulation  prior  to  emergency surgery/procedures or neuraxial interventions. There are no contraindications to its use. However, a black box warning was included mentioning the association of andexanet alfa with serious and life-  threatening adverse events, including: (1) arterial  and  venous  thromboembolic  events;  (2)  ischemic  events, including myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke; (3) cardiac arrest, and (4) sudden death. 94 The warning recommends monitoring  for  thromboembolic  events  and  symptoms/signs  that precede cardiac arrest and to initiate anticoagulation when medically  appropriate  and  to  provide  treatment  as  needed.  Other warnings include the re-  elevation or the incomplete reversal of the aXa activity and the inhibition of the anticoagulant effect of UFH by andexanet alfa. The most common adverse reactions in  healthy  or  bleeding  subjects  receiving  andexanet  alfa  were infusion-  related reactions (≥3%) or urinary tract infections and pneumonia (≥5%), respectively. 94

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  case  of  life-  threatening  or  uncontrolled  bleeding,  the recommended  dosing  consists  of  an  initial  intravenous  bolus dose of 400 mg (low dose) or 800 mg (high dose). Because of andexanet alfa's short half-  life and the ability to displace DXAs from  the  extravascular  to  the  intravascular  compartment,  it must be followed by a 120 min intravenous infusion of 480 mg (low dose) or 960 mg (high dose), respectively. 94 The choice of the low-  dose versus the high-  dose regimen of andexanet alfa is determined based on the specific DXA ingested, the dose of the DXA, and time since the patient's last dose of the DXA.

Idarucizumab (Praxbind) is a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment. In October 2015, idarucizumab was approved by the FDA to be used in adult patients treated with dabigatran, when rapid reversal of its anticoagulant effects is required in situations of  emergency surgery/urgent procedures or life-  threatening  or uncontrolled  bleeding. 100 This  decision  was  mainly  based  on a  clinical  trial  in  patients  with  bleeding  or  requiring  urgent surgery that demonstrated the complete reversal of the anticoagulant  effect  of  dabigatran  and  decreased  dabigatran  plasma levels below the lower detection threshold of 20 ng/mL within 30  min. 101 Although  there  are  no  contraindications  to  the  use of  idarucizumab,  it  is  not  FDA-  approved  for  the  reversal  of dabigatran prior to neuraxial interventions. Also, there are no controlled  investigations  on  the  use  of  reversal  agents  specifically  aimed  at  neuraxial  anesthetic  techniques.  Still,  a  French Working  Group  on  Perioperative  Haemostasis  recommended the use of idarucizumab to restore normal hemostasis prior to an urgent diagnostic lumbar puncture, in a context of infectious cerebral  disease  or  a  spinal  anesthetic,  in  patients  in  whom  a general  anesthetic  is  best  avoided. 102 Indeed,  two  recent  case reports describe the successful use of idarucizumab in an emergency lumbar puncture for the possible diagnosis of infectious central nervous disease. 103 104

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  increased  thromboembolic  risk  is  possible  in  patients having  an  underlying  disease  predisposing  them  to  thromboembolic  events  when  exposed  to  idarucizumab.  This  risk  can be reduced by resuming the anticoagulant treatment as soon as medically appropriate. Other possible adverse reactions/complications related to the use of idarucizumab include: (1) the re-  elevation of coagulation parameters; (2) hypersensitivity reactions, and (3) serious adverse reactions (ie, hypoglycemia, hypophosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, an increase in uric acid, and acute liver  failure  with  breakdown  of  excretory  and  synthetic  function) including a fatal outcome in patients with the condition of hereditary fructose intolerance due to the sorbitol excipient. 100

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The recommended dose in case of emergency surgery/urgent procedures or life-  threatening  or  uncontrolled  bleeding  is  5  g via  an  intravenous  infusion/injection. 100 There  is  limited  data to support administration of an additional 5  g of idarucizumab, but if reappearance of clinically relevant bleeding together with elevated coagulation parameters is observed after administration of 5  g idarucizumab, administration of an additional 5  g dose of idarucizumab may be considered.

The use of procoagulant agents such as prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) or activated prothrombin complex concentrates  (aPCC) may be an option if specific antidotes for the reversal of the DOACs are not available or are too costly. 12 79 However, all  procoagulant agents carry the inherent risk of a prothrombotic  effect,  and  thus  their  use  must  be  carefully  considered.

A  number  of  observational  studies  (some  retrospective)  have shown the efficacy of PPC or aPCC in DOAC-  treated patients who were actively bleeding, 105-109 although  studies  in  patients with intracranial hemorrhage report mixed results. 110 111 There are no data evaluating the use of PCC or aPCC for reversal in patients treated with DOACs and planned for a neuraxial intervention.  Therefore,  the  availability  of  specific  antidotes  such as andexanet alfa or idarucizumab does not imply that DOAC treatment should be reversed for the sole purpose of a regional anesthetic technique. If surgery can be postponed allowing spontaneous recovery of normal hemostasis, discontinuation of the antithrombotic drug is the preferred strategy. If waiting is not an option and reversal is needed for the safe conduct of the surgery itself, regional anesthetic techniques may be considered after full dabigatran reversal by idarucizumab.

INTRAVENOUS AND SUBCUTANEOUS UNFRACTIONATED HEPARIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacology of unfractionated heparin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  major  anticoagulant  effect  of  heparin  is  due  to  a  unique pentasaccharide  that  binds  to  antithrombin  (AT)  with  high affinity  and  is  present  in  approximately  one-  third  of  heparin molecules. Binding of this heparin pentasaccharide to AT accelerates its  ability  to  inactivate  thrombin  (factor  IIa),  factor  Xa, and factor IXa. Anticoagulant activities of UFH depend on both the number of heparin molecules with the pentasaccharide chain and  the  size  of  the  molecules  containing  the  pentasaccharide sequence. Larger molecular weight heparins will catalyze inhibition of both factor IIa and Xa. Smaller molecular weight heparins will catalyze inhibition of only factor Xa. 112 113 Intravenous injection  results  in  immediate  anticoagulant  activity,  whereas subcutaneous injection results in a 1-2  hour delay. The anticoagulant effect of heparin is both dose-  dependent and molecular size-  dependent  and  is  not  linear  but  increases  disproportionately with increasing doses. For example, the biologic half-  life of heparin increases from 30  min after 25 units/kg intravenous to 60  min with 100 units/kg intravenous, and to 150  min with a bolus of 400 units/kg intravenous. 113 114

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  given  in  high  doses  (therapeutic),  the  anticoagulant effect of heparin is typically monitored with the aPTT. However, this  test  does  not  directly  measure  heparin  and  is  affected  by physiological and  analytic variables. Anti-  Xa testing offers improvements over aPTT testing for accurate measurement of heparin levels. Clinical data from the last 10-20 years suggest that aXa monitoring may offer a more predictable dose-  response curve,  and  require  fewer  blood  samples  and  dosage  adjustments. 115 The activated clotting time (ACT) is typically used to monitor higher doses given during cardiopulmonary bypass and other interventional procedures requiring anticoagulation with heparin such as interventional radiology procedures. Adequate therapeutic effect (in patients with VTE or unstable angina) is achieved with a prolongation of the aPTT to between 1.5 and 2.5 times the baseline value, 112 heparin level of 0.2-0.4  U/mL, or aXa level of 0.3-0.7  U/mL. 116

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration  of  low-  dose  (5000  U)  subcutaneous  heparin for  prophylaxis  of  DVT  does  not  significantly  prolong  the aPTT in the majority of patients and is typically not monitored. However, it can result in unpredictable (10-  fold variability) and therapeutic  blood  concentrations  of  heparin  in  some  patients (non-  pregnant,  surgical,  and  medical  patients)  within  2  hours after administration. 117 There is also a subset of patients who will develop heparin-  induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) after being on heparin for >5 days, resulting in a decreased platelet count. 114 For this reason, patients receiving intravenous or subcutaneous UFH for >4 days should have a platelet count assessed prior to neuraxial  block  or  catheter  removal.  While  the  typical  onset of  HIT  occurs  within  5-14  days  following  heparin  initiation, patients with a recent heparin exposure within the past 30 days may develop rapid-  onset HIT on heparin re-  exposure. 118-120 This phenomenon has been explained by already present circulating heparin platelet factor 4 antibodies. In contrast, delayed-  onset HIT may occur days to weeks after hospital dismissal. 121 122 For these  patients,  symptomatic  venous  thrombotic  complications bring  the  patient  to  clinical  attention.  Thrombocytopenia,  on re-  presentation, may be mild to moderate. Importantly, heparin re-  exposure may worsen clinical outcomes. As such, awareness of both rapid-  onset and delayed-  onset HIT may prevent adverse therapeutic outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One of the advantages of heparin anticoagulation is that its effect  may  be  rapidly  reversed  with  protamine.  Each  mg  of protamine can neutralize 100 units of heparin. Neutralization of subcutaneously administered heparin may require a prolonged infusion  of  protamine  due  to  the  continued  absorption. 114 However,  the  potential  risks  of  thrombosis  following  protamine administration have to be weighed against the benefits of a  neuraxial  anesthetic.  A  careful  balance  of  risks  and  benefits needs  to  be  considered  including  the  option  of  performing  a general anesthetic.

Risk factors for neuraxial hematoma in the heparinized patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal or epidural needle insertion in the presence of sustained therapeutic  anticoagulation  with  heparin  is  associated  with increased risk. Much of our information about this association comes from a report of 342 patients who deliberately received systemic  therapeutic  heparin  after  lumbar  puncture. 123 Three factors  associated  with  the  increased  risk  of  hematoma  were identified: <60  min time interval between the administration of heparin and lumbar puncture, traumatic needle placement, and concomitant use of aspirin. These risk factors have been verified in subsequent large reviews of case reports of hematomas associated with neuraxial procedures in the presence of UFH. 124-126

Intravenous unfractionated heparin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  heparinization  typically  involves  injection of 5000-10 000 units of heparin intravenously  during  the  operative  period,  particularly  in  the  setting  of  vascular  surgery  to prevent coagulation during cross-  clamping of arterial vessels. 113 Neuraxial  anesthetic  techniques  may  be  considered  for  these patients,  but  the  increased  risk  of  neuraxial  hematoma,  as demonstrated  by  case  series,  epidemiological  surveys,  and  the ASA Closed Claims database needs to be considered. 52 53 127 128 Maintaining a minimum 1-  hour interval between needle placement and heparinization, as well as avoiding other hemostasisaltering medications, decreases the risk of significant bleeding.

bloody tap or a traumatic regional block was an associated factor in  approximately 50% of spinal hematomas. 53 Although some investigators  have  recommended  cancellation  of  the  surgical procedures if these events occur, 126 there are no clinical data to support this recommendation. 129 130 Direct communication with the surgeon and a specific risk-  benefit decision about proceeding in each case is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heparinization may be continued into or initiated in the postoperative period. However, the removal of a neuraxial catheter in the presence of heparin therapy increases the risk of hematoma formation. In a series by Vandermeulen et al , half of the spinal  hematomas  associated  with  intravenous  heparinization were detected at the time of catheter removal. 53 Since the latest version of the ASRA guidelines, 9 one additional case report of postoperative epidural hematoma on a patient on intravenous heparin has been published. 9 131 This patient suffered a perioperative  myocardial  infarction  and  pump  failure  requiring  full anticoagulation with intravenous heparin and concomitant antiplatelet therapy. An epidural hematoma ensued after the surgeon removed the epidural catheter under full heparin anticoagulation and concomitant thrombocytopenia. The risk of hematoma resulting from catheter removal has led to the recommendation that  in  patients  who  have  undergone  systemic  heparinization, the heparin should be discontinued for 4-6  hours and the coagulation status assessed prior to neuraxial catheter manipulation or removal. 8

Heparinization during cardiopulmonary bypass

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  the  publication  of  the  initial  ASRA  guidelines  in  1998, 5 there have been continued discussions regarding the relative risk and benefit of neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia in the patient undergoing  heparinization  for  cardiopulmonary  bypass. 132-136 Unfortunately,  while  there  is  improved  analgesia,  pulmonary function, and decreased cardiac arrhythmias, there is no reduction in hospital stay, myocardial infarction, or mortality. To date, there is a single case of spinal hematoma following the full heparinization associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. 137 However, these series involve small numbers of patients. Using a mathematical analysis of the probability of predicting a rare event and based on the total of 4583 epidural and 10  840 spinal anesthetics reported without complications, Ho et al estimated the risk of hematoma to be approximately 1:1528 for epidural and 1:3610 for spinal technique. 138 Thus, this analgesic technique remains controversial in that the risk appears too great for the perceived benefits. Neuraxial anesthetics are therefore not recommended in the setting of high-  dose anticoagulation and cardiopulmonary bypass.

Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low-  dose subcutaneous UFH is commonly used for prophylaxis against  development  of  VTE  following  major  organ  surgery including general surgery, colorectal surgery, gynecology, obstetrics,  and  urology. 139 Administration  of  5000  units  of  heparin subcutaneously two or three times daily has been used extensively  and  is  effective  for  prophylaxis  against  DVT.  There  is often  no  detectable  change  in  standard  coagulation  tests,  as measured by the aPTT, aXa level, or heparin level. However, approximately 15% of patients may develop measurable changes in  coagulation,  with  the  aPTT  rarely  exceeding  1.5  times  the normal  level  and  normalizing  within  4-6  hours  after  administration. 117 There is a smaller subset (2%-4%) of non-  pregnant patients who may become therapeutically anticoagulated during subcutaneous heparin therapy. 5

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The widespread use of subcutaneous heparin and the paucity of complications suggest that there is little risk of spinal hematoma associated with this therapy. There are 10 published series totaling  over  12  000  patients  who  have  received  this  therapy without  complications.  Three  recent  series,  with  a  combined total of over 7000 patients who received epidural analgesia in the presence of 5000 units of heparin three times a day, reported no spinal hematomas. 140-142 There are only five case reports of neuraxial  hematomas:  four  epidural, 53  143 and  one  spinal, 144 during neuraxial block with the use of subcutaneous heparin. The latest case report published since the last iteration of the guidelines 5 described an epidural hematoma shortly after removal of an epidural catheter in a non-  pregnant patient on 5000 IU of heparin,  administered  subcutaneously,  two  times  per  day.  The latest guidelines appeared to have been followed, but the patient had the additional risk factors of being treated with aspirin 325 mg once per day until 1 week preoperatively and of having a difficult epidural insertion with three attempts required. 143

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The safety of high-  dose subcutaneous UFH (doses >5000 units or total daily dose >15  000 units) remains controversial due to the marked variability in patient response to these dosing regimens. Specifically,  because  the  anticoagulant  effect  of  heparin is  non-  linear,  and  increases  disproportionately  with  increasing doses, administration of >5000 units will increase the intensity and duration of the anticoagulant effect. 113 For example, in one study involving obstetrical patients, six of 11 women receiving high-  dose  subcutaneous  UFH  still  had  an  elevated  aPTT  12 hours  after  their  last  dose. 145 Timing  of  assessment  of  coagulation  status  for  residual  heparin  effect  is  based  on  dose  and frequency of dosing. For example, for individual heparin dose of 7500-10 000 U two times per day or a daily dose of ≤20  000 U, it  is  suggested  neuraxial  block  occur  12  hours  after  subcutaneous  heparin  administration and assessment  of  coagulation status with a normal aPTT. Likewise, for individual heparin dose >10 000 U subcutaneously per dose, or >20 000 U total daily dose, it is suggested neuraxial block occurs 24 hours after subcutaneous  heparin  administration and assessment  of  coagulation status with a normal aPTT. 8

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current recommendations are consistent with recent trends of perioperative thromboprophylaxis, which recommend dosing regimens  that  minimize  residual  anticoagulant  at  the  time  of surgery as well as allow for a delay in initiation of postoperative thromboprophylaxis until hemostasis is confirmed. 15 16 48 146 These  recommendations  are  based  on  the  pharmacology  of  a subcutaneous 5000-  unit dose of UFH, which results in an onset of anticoagulant effect 1  hour after administration that persists for 4-6  hours. 113 147

The safety of indwelling neuraxial catheters in patients receiving doses >5000 U at  a  time  or >15 000 U of  UFH  daily  has not been established. We suggest that the risk and benefits be assessed on an individual basis and that techniques to facilitate detection of new/progressive neurological deficits (eg, enhanced neurological monitoring occur and neuraxial solutions to minimize sensory and motor block) be applied (grade IIC)

Pharmacology, monitoring, and reversal of the anticoagulant effect of LMWH

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  biochemical  and  pharmacological  properties  of  LMWH differ from those of UFH. 148-152 Most relevant are the lack of monitoring required (except with high-  dose therapeutic applications), prolonged half-  life, and inability to reverse with protamine. The aXa levels peak 3-5 hours after administration. The elimination half-  life of LMWH is approximately 5 hours after subcutaneous  injection  in  patients  with  normal  renal  function and is dose independent. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the anticoagulant effect is exaggerated and the elimination half-  life may be prolonged up to 16 hours. 148

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anticoagulant effect of LMWH is most readily assessed by  the  aXa  activity.  Because  of  reduced  protamine  binding to  LMWH  fractions,  only  the  anti-  IIa  activity  of  LMWH  is completely  reversed;  the  aXa  activity  is  not  fully  neutralized. Both  anti-  IIa  and  aXa  activity  may  return  up  to  3  hours  after protamine reversal. 148 The aXa level above which is associated with  significant  bleeding  risk  remains  unknown.  An  aXa  level of  ≤0.1 IU/mL  is  considered  an  undetectable  anticoagulant effect. 57-60

Management of neuraxial block or deep plexus/peripheral block in the patient receiving LMWH

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 1993, enoxaparin was the first LMWH to be introduced for general use in the USA. In the first 5 years of use, over 40 spinal hematomas were reported through the MedWatch system. 3 The risk of spinal hematoma was estimated to be approximately one in 3000 continuous epidural anesthetics compared with one in 40 000  spinal  anesthetics. 153 The  frequency  was  attributed  to twice-  daily dosing (compared with once-  daily dosing as administered in Europe) in the presence of an indwelling neuraxial catheter. However, 20 years later in Sweden, Moen et al 52 reported a 1:3600 frequency of spinal hematomas among women undergoing total knee replacement (with once-  daily LMWH), which is strikingly similar to the frequency associated with twice-  daily administered LMWH calculated by Horlocker and Wedel. 3

specific risk factors have been proposed. 3 4 52 In summary, age and gender appear to be significant patient factors, perhaps due to less vertebral canal compliance (smaller volume need to produce critical ischemic pressure) and/or drug effect (exaggerated response to LMWH, renal insufficiency). Finally, the additive, if not synergistic  effect  of  multiple  hemostasis-  altering  medications  cannot be overstated and may elevate the risk of hematoma in once-  daily LMWH dosing to that of twice-  daily dosing. 52

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low versus high dosing regimens

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low-  dose LMWH  regimens  administered for prophylaxis include enoxaparin 40  mg/day, enoxaparin 30  mg every 12  hours, dalteparin 5000 IU daily. The target aXa level for prophylaxis (measured 4 hours after a dose) is regarded to be 0.2-0.5  IU/mL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High-  dose  LMWH  regimens  for  treatment  of  VTE  or bridging therapy involves administering a much higher dose that  is  typically  weight  based,  such  as  enoxaparin  1  mg/kg every  12  hours,  enoxaparin  1.5  mg/kg  daily,  dalteparin  120 IU/kg every 12 hours, dalteparin 200 IU/kg daily, or tinzaparin 175  IU/kg  daily.  It  is  advisable  to  maintain  peak  aXa  levels between 0.5 U/mL and 1 U/mL (measured 3-4 hours after the LMWH dose). With high-  dose LMWH, it is recommended that the last dose should occur at least 24 hours preoperatively and the last dose should be halved in patients with moderate (CrCl 30-49 mL/min)  to  severe  (CrCl  <30 mL/min)  renal  insufficiency to avoid an exaggerated or prolonged response. 12 154

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  small  quality  improvement  publication  involving  19 patients  found  that  almost  60%  of  patients  taking  highdose enoxaparin still have higher than expected aXa levels a  minimum  of  24  hours  after  the  last  dose.  They  also suggested  that  patients  with  lower  CrCl  and  increased  age may  be  at  particular  risk. 155 A  more  recent  retrospective study  reported  18%  of  patients  had  aXa  levels  >2 IU/mL 24  hours  after  the  last  administration  of  their  high-  dose regimen. 156 Finally,  a  2023  prospective  observational  trial of 103 patients concluded that the time from the last highdose administration until the aXa level fell below 0.2 IU/mL was 31.5 hours. 157 Interestingly, unlike their previous quality improvement study, this trial found no correlation between age, renal function, weight, or sex for those taking high-  dose enoxaparin  despite  similar  methodology.  In  addition,  34% of patients failed to accurately follow the instructions with regard to timing of administration. 157

<!-- PAGE=? -->
These  observational  studies  indicate  that  a  significant number of patients will have detectable aXa levels (>0.1 IU/ mL)  and  some  may  have  levels  in  the  prophylactic  and possibly therapeutic ranges. It is difficult to know whether this correlates with an increased risk of neuraxial hematoma. North American recommendations have drawn on the extensive  European  experience  in  the  development  of  practice guidelines for the management of patients undergoing spinal and  epidural  blocks  while  receiving  perioperative  LMWH. The ESAIC/European Society of Anesthesiology (ESA) recommend that with either low-  dose or high-  dose LMWH, the time interval be doubled between last dose of LMWH or the dose halved in the presence of severe renal insufficiency (CrCl  <30 mL/min). 11 Although  we  recommend  against routine testing,  assessment  of  residual  aXa  activity  may  be considered  in  patients  who  are  elderly,  morbidly  obese, 158 or  patients  with  severe  renal  insufficiency,  noting  that  the acceptable  level  of  residual  aXa  level  for  performance  of neuraxial block remains undetermined and therefore a level ≤0.1 IU/mL is suggested.

ANTIPLATELET MEDICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Due to the ubiquitous nature of atherosclerotic arterial occlusive disease in the USA, the number of patients receiving longterm  antiplatelet  therapy  numbers  in  the  tens  of  millions. 159 The  recent  ACCP  guideline  on  periprocedural  antithrombotic  management  offers  recommendations  for  antiplatelet therapy. 12 Antiplatelet  agents  include  aspirin,  non-  steroidal anti-  inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), thienopyridine derivatives/ platelet adenosine diphosphate (ADP) antagonists (ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel), platelet glycoprotein (GP)  IIb/IIIa receptor  antagonists  (abciximab,  eptifibatide,  and  tirofiban), platelet  P2Y12  receptor  antagonists  (ticagrelor),  and  platelet phosphodiesterase  IIIA  inhibitors  (cilostazol).  It  is  important to note the pharmacological differences among the drugs with antiplatelet effects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NSAIDs  inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase and prevent the synthesis  of  thromboxane  A2.  Platelets  from  patients  who have  been  taking  these  medications  have  normal  platelet adherence  to  subendothelium  and  normal  primary  hemostatic  plug  formation.  Depending  on  the  dose  administered, aspirin (and other NSAIDs) may produce opposing effects on the  hemostatic  mechanism.  For  example,  platelet  cyclooxygenase is inhibited by low-  dose aspirin (60-325 mg/day) while larger  doses  (1.5-2  g/day)  will  also  inhibit  the  production  of prostacyclin  (a  potent  vasodilator  and  platelet  aggregation inhibitor)  by  vascular  endothelial  cells  and  thus  result  in  a paradoxical  thrombogenic  effect. 160  161 As  a  result,  low-  dose aspirin (81-325 mg/day) is theoretically a greater risk factor for bleeding than higher doses. There is consensus that the optimal dose of aspirin for prevention of myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular death lies within the narrow range of 75-160 mg/ day. 162

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet function is affected for the life of the platelet following aspirin ingestion; other  non-  steroidal  analgesics  (naproxen, piroxicam,  ibuprofen)  produce  a  short-  term defect,  which normalizes  within  3  days. 163 Celecoxib  (Celebrex)  is  an  antiinflammatory agent that primarily inhibits cyclooxygenase-  2, an inducible enzyme which is not expressed in platelets, and thus does not cause platelet dysfunction. 164

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thienopyridines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The antiplatelet effect of the thienopyridine derivatives, clopidogrel (Plavix) and prasugrel (Efient) results from inhibition of ADP-  induced  platelet  aggregation.  The  two  are  prodrugs  that must undergo metabolic activation through the hepatic CYP450 system to generate the active metabolites that inhibit the platelet P2Y12 receptor. 162 Thienopyridine derivatives demonstrate both time-  dependent and dose-  dependent effects. For example, steady state is achieved within 7 days for clopidogrel with doses of 75 mg/day. However, steady state levels of clopidogrel are reached within 2-15  hours with 300-600  mg loading doses. 165 166

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No prospective studies have evaluated perioperative management of clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor in patients undergoing non-  cardiac surgery.  Retrospective  studies  suggest  an increased  risk  of  bleeding  with  clopidogrel  continued  perioperatively. 12 Labeling  of  the  thienopyridine  derivatives  recommends  that  if  a  patient  is  to  undergo  an  elective  procedure and an antiplatelet effect is not desired, therapy with clopidogrel  should  be  interrupted  'for  5  days  prior  to  surgery' 167 and prasugrel discontinued 'at least 7  days prior to any surgery.' 168 Based on expert opinion (recommendation made with 'very low certainty of evidence'), the ACCP recommends 5  days for clopidogrel  and  7  days  for  prasugrel. 12 However,  these  time  intervals  are  not  sufficient  to  have  a  return  to  baseline  activity  in all patients. In a pharmacological study of recovery of platelet function following discontinuation of prasugrel and clopidogrel (there  was  no  clinical  assessment  of  postoperative  bleeding), in the prasugrel group, ≥50% of patients returned to baseline reactivity by day 6, ≥75% by day 7, and ≥90% by day 9; in the  clopidogrel  group,  ≥50% of patients returned to baseline reactivity  by  day  3,  ≥75%  by  day  5,  and  ≥90%  by  day  6. 169 Thus, while the majority of patients returned to baseline platelet reactivity after 5 and 7  days of clopidogrel and prasugrel discontinuation, respectively, patients in both groups displayed residual effects beyond these intervals and 'a longer time interval, such as 7  days for clopidogrel and 9  days for prasugrel may be desirable to further mitigate any potential bleeding risk.' 169 Based on European labeling, the ESAIC/ERSA recommends 5-7 days for clopidogrel and 7  days for prasugrel. 11

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  it  is  possible  to  assess  residual  antiplatelet  effect using assays of platelet function (eg, PFA II, P2Y12 assay), only a normalized value would be useful; an acceptable level of residual antiplatelet effect remains undetermined.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ticagrelor

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ticagrelor (Brilinta) represents a new class of non-  thienopyridine platelet inhibitors designed to address the limitations of current oral antiplatelet drugs. Ticagrelor completely reversibly inhibits ADP-  induced  platelet  activation,  unlike  the  thienopyridines. Ticagrelor  also  acts  directly  on  the  P2Y12  receptor  and  does not require cytochrome P450 biotransformation. After a loading dose,  an  antiplatelet  effect  is  observed  within  30  min,  while maximum effect is achieved within 2  hours. After discontinuation,  platelet  function  recovers  70%  in  3  days  and  to  baseline in 5  days. 170-172 Labeling recommends to 'interrupt therapy with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Based on expert opinion (recommendation made with 'very low certainty of evidence'), the ACCP 12 recommends that ticagrelor  be  discontinued  3-5  days  prior  to  surgery,  while  the ESAIC/ESRA based on European labeling recommends a 5-  day interval. 11

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cangrelor

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cangrelor  (Kengreal)  is  a  direct  and  reversible  intravenous P2Y12  inhibitor.  The  dosage  of  the  drug  is  30  μg/kg  bolus followed by a 4 μg/kg/min infusion. Its antiplatelet effect is seen within  2  min  of  administration  and  inhibits  platelet  aggregation by 95%-100%. Its plasma half-  life is 3-6  min and platelet recovery is rapid; 80% and 90% of the samples recover in 60 and 90 min, respectively. 174

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients given cangrelor for percutaneous cardiac intervention are usually continued on one of the oral P2Y12 inhibitors. Both clopidogrel and prasugrel will not work while cangrelor is being infused as their metabolite cannot bind to the receptor, while it is being occupied by cangrelor. Ticagrelor, on the other hand, has a binding site separate from cangrelor. For these reasons, clopidogrel and prasugrel should be given immediately after discontinuation of cangrelor, while ticagrelor can be given during or immediately after the infusion. 175

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  oral  P2Y12  inhibitors  are  discontinued  for  5-10  days before  surgery.  Cangrelor  can  therefore  be  used  as  a  bridge therapy  in  these  situations.  It  is  possible  that  perioperative anesthesiologists will encounter this scenario more often in the future. In these cases, a 3-  hour interval minimum, and preferably longer should be observed. ACCP and ESAIC/ESRA did not include recommendations for cangrelor because the medication is rarely administered to patients undergoing regional anesthesia/ surgery. 11 12

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet  GP  IIb/IIIa  receptor  antagonists,  including  abciximab (Reopro), eptifibatide (Integrilin), and tirofiban (Aggrastat),  inhibit  platelet  aggregation  by  interfering  with platelet-  fibrinogen and platelet-  von Willebrand factor binding. The majority of clinical trials involving the GP IIb/IIIa antagonists have evaluated their use in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome,  and  thus  the  GP  IIb/IIIa  antagonists  are  typically administered in combination with aspirin and heparin. Contraindications include a history of surgery within 4-6 weeks. 176 Time  to  normal  platelet  aggregation  following  discontinuation  of  therapy  ranges  from  8  hours  (eptifibatide,  tirofiban) to 24-48 hours (abciximab). 162 Thrombocytopenia is a known side effect. 162 ACCP and ESAIC/ESRA did not include recommendations for platelet GP IIb/IIIa because these medications are rarely administered to patients undergoing regional anesthesia/surgery. 11 12

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cilostazol

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cilostazol  produces  a  selective  inhibition  of  phosphodiesterase  (PDE)  IIIA  resulting  in  a  weak,  reversible  inhibition of platelet aggregation. Cilostazol is used in peripheral arterial  vascular  disease  because  of  its  vasodilatory  properties (vascular  muscle  also  contains  PDE  IIIA).  It  has  a  half-  life of 11 hours, which is prolonged in patients with severe renal impairment. 162 The terminal half-  life and the active metabolite  is  21  hours.  There  are  limited  data  on  perioperative administration  of  cilostazol.  However,  a  single  case  report of  spinal  hematoma  following  epidural  catheter  removal in  the  presence  of  cilostazol  therapy  has  been  reported. 177 ACCP and  ESAIC/ESRA  did  not  include  recommendations for cilostazol because the medication is rarely administered to patients undergoing regional anesthesia/surgery. 11 12

Neuraxial hematoma in patients receiving antiplatelet medications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several large studies have demonstrated the relative safety of central neural blockade in combination with NSAID therapy, although the total number of patients in this combined series is only 4714. 7 If low-  dose aspirin creates the greatest impact on  platelet  function,  patients  receiving  60-325 mg  aspirin would theoretically represent the greatest risk of significant bleeding.  However,  this  is  not  noted  in  the  literature. 178 An exception to this are patients  undergoing  invasive  pain procedures. 179-181

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No  series  involving  the  performance  of  neuraxial  blockade in the presence of thienopyridine derivatives or platelet GP IIb/ IIIa receptor antagonists has been performed. Although the data are  inconsistent,  increased  perioperative  bleeding  in  patients undergoing cardiac and vascular surgery after receiving thienopyridines and GP IIb/IIIa antagonists has been noted. 48 182 183 In general, the cardiac surgical 183 and interventional radiology literature recommend that elective surgery be delayed 24-48  hours following  abciximab  and  4-8  hours  following  eptifibatide  or tirofiban. 184 Surgery  performed  within  12  hours  of  abciximab administration  would  most  likely  necessitate  a  platelet  transfusion.  There have been three spinal hematomas attributed to neuraxial techniques and thienopyridines, including one patient undergoing a series of epidural steroid injections. 185-187

Combination of antiplatelet medications with anticoagulants and thrombolytics

NSAIDs alone do not significantly increase the risk of spinal hematoma. However, combination therapy with UFH, LMWH, oral  anticoagulants,  and  thrombolytics  have  been demonstrated  to  increase  the  frequency  of  spontaneous hemorrhagic complications, bleeding at puncture sites, and spinal hematoma. 3 52 117 123

Neuraxial and deep plexus/peripheral catheters should not be maintained  with  prasugrel  due  to  the  rapid  onset.

PARENTERAL DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS Argatroban, bivalirudin, and desirudin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recombinant  hirudin  derivatives,  including  bivalirudin  (Angiomax), and desirudin (Revasc), inhibit both free and clot-  bound thrombin.  Argatroban  (Acova),  an  L-  arginine  derivative,  has  a similar mechanism of action. These medications are indicated for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis in patients with HIT and as an adjunct to angioplasty procedures. 188 189 Desirudin is approved for prevention of VTE/PE following hip replacement. 190 The anticoagulant effect of thrombin inhibitors is monitored by the aPTT, and is present for 1-3  hours after intravenous administration. Hemorrhagic complications, particularly when combined with thrombolytic or antiplatelet agents, may be life threatening. There is no 'antidote'; therefore, the antithrombin effect cannot be reversed pharmacologically. Although there are no case reports of spinal hematoma related to neuraxial anesthesia among patients

Fondaparinux

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fondaparinux (Arixtra), an injectable synthetic pentasaccharide approved for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic events in acutely ill patients (including those affected by COVID-  19), patients with cancer, or patients undergoing surgery (dose 2.5 mg) as well as the treatment of acute DVT and PE (dose 5-10 mg).  The  FDA  released  fondaparinux  with  a  black  box warning about neuraxial anesthesia like that of the LMWHs and heparinoids.  Fondaparinux  produces  its  antithrombotic  effect through factor Xa inhibition and is used when patients are intolerant  to  LMWH.  Advantages  of  fondaparinux  include:  100% bioavailability subcutaneously, instant onset of action, long halflife, and direct renal excretion. 191 This drug is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30  mL/min) and in patients weighing <50 kg. It should be used with caution in patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30-50  mL/min). The plasma half-  life of fondaparinux is 17-21  hours (17  hours in healthy, young patients and 21  hours in healthy, elderly patients), allowing for single daily dosing, with the first low (prophylactic) dose  administered  6-8  hours  postoperatively. 192 The  half-  life in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl 30-50  mL/ min) was found to be 29 hours, and 72 hours in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/min). Routine coagulation tests such as PT and aPTT are relatively insensitive measures of  fondaparinux  and  are  unsuitable  for  monitoring.  The  aXa activity can be measured by aXa assay using the appropriate calibrator  (fondaparinux).  It  is  important  to  note  that  protamine would not be an effective reversal strategy. There is a paucity of prospective data and the studies that are published included such strict parameters that it is difficult to use them to develop recommendations.  One  spinal  hematoma  was  reported  in  the initial dose-  ranging study, at a dose that was determined to be twice  that  required  for  thromboprophylaxis. 192  193 A  series  of 1631 patients undergoing continuous neuraxial or deep peripheral  block  reported  no  serious  hemorrhagic  complications. However, the  catheters  were  removed  36  hours  after  the  last dose of fondaparinux and subsequent dosing was delayed for 12 hours after catheter removal. 194

FIBRINOLYTIC AND THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY Pharmacology of fibrinolytics/thrombolytics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The fibrinolytic system dissolves intravascular clots as a result of the action of plasmin. Plasmin is produced by the cleavage of a single peptide bond of the inactive precursor, plasminogen. The resulting  compound is  a  non-  specific  protease  capable  of dissolving  fibrin  clots  and  other  plasma  proteins,  including several coagulation factors. Exogenous plasminogen activators, such  as  streptokinase  and  urokinase,  dissolve  thrombus  and affect  circulating  plasminogen  as  well.  Pharmacological  t-  PA formulations (Alteplase, Tenecteplase) are more fibrin-  selective and have less effect on circulating plasminogen. Clot lysis leads to  elevation  of  fibrin  degradation  products,  which  themselves have an anticoagulant antithrombotic effect by inhibiting platelet

aggregation.  Given  the  nature  of  the  underlying  thrombotic medical conditions being treated, patients who receive fibrinolytic therapy frequently receive intravenous heparin to maintain an aPTT of 1.5-2 times normal. Often an antiplatelet agent such as aspirin or clopidogrel is also added. While the plasma half-  life of  thrombolytic  drugs  is  only  hours,  it  may  take  days  for  the thrombolytic effect to resolve. Fibrinogen and plasminogen are maximally depressed at 5 hours after thrombolytic therapy and remain significantly depressed at 27 hours. 195 Importantly, original contraindications to thrombolytic therapy included surgery or puncture of non-  compressible vessels within 10 days. 196

MANAGEMENT OF NEURAXIAL BLOCK OR DEEP PLEXUS/ PERIPHERAL BLOCK IN THE PATIENT RECEIVING THROMBOLYTIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  receiving  fibrinolytic/thrombolytic  medications  are  at risk of serious hemorrhagic events, particularly those who have undergone an invasive procedure. Recommendations are based on the profound effect on hemostasis, the use of concomitant heparin  and/or  antiplatelet  agents  (which  further  increase  the risk  of  bleeding),  and  the  potential  for spontaneous neuraxial bleeding with these medications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients scheduled  to  receive  thrombolytic  therapy,  we recommend that the patient be queried, and the medical record reviewed  for  a  recent  history  of  lumbar  puncture,  spinal  or epidural anesthesia, or epidural steroid injection to allow appropriate  monitoring.  Guidelines  detailing  original  contraindications for thrombolytic drugs suggest avoidance of these drugs for 10 days following  puncture  of  non-  compressible  vessels (grade IA)

VITAMIN K ANTAGONISTS (WARFARIN) Warfarin pharmacology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Warfarin exerts its anticoagulant effect by interfering with the synthesis of the vitamin K-  dependent clotting factors VII, IX, X, and II (thrombin). The effects of warfarin are dependent on clotting factor half-  lives and the anticoagulant effect is not apparent until there is a significant amount of biologically inactive clotting factors 216 (table  5).  Clinical  experience  with  patients  who  are congenitally deficient in factors II, IX, or X suggests that a factor activity level of 40% for each factor is adequate for normal or near-  normal  hemostasis. 217 Bleeding  may  occur  if  the  level  of any clotting factor is decreased to 20%-40% of baseline. The international normalized ratio (INR) is most sensitive to clotting factors VII and X 218 and is slightly prolonged when factor VII is reduced to approximately 55% of baseline. An INR of 1.5 is associated with a factor VII activity of 40%. 218 For this reason, INRs of 1.4 or less in patients who have not been on warfarin are not at increased risk for spinal bleeding. 8 During the first few days of therapy, the PT reflects primarily a reduction of factor VII,  the  half-  life  of  which  is  approximately  6  hours  (table  5). Discontinuation of warfarin requires normalization of the INR to ensure adequate activities of all the clotting factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical use of warfarin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  measured  response  to  anticoagulant  therapy  at  the  initiation  of  treatment  varies  significantly.  Some  of  the  variability may be attributed to age, female sex, pre-  existing medical conditions (low patient weight, liver, cardiac, and renal disease), race, genetic  polymorphisms,  and  drug  interactions  that  are  associated with an enhanced response to warfarin and/or a lower dose requirement for maintenance anticoagulation. 8 216 219 220 It  has been documented that warfarin dose is inversely related to age and strongly associated with gender, with women being more susceptible. 221 In  addition,  patients  with  renal  insufficiency may have an increased response to warfarin. 222 There are many drugs that interact with warfarin and potentiate the anticoagulant effect, including concomitant administration of antiplatelet medications, heparin, and LMWH. 216 223 224

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients taking warfarin, the first step in decision making is to establish the anticipated risk of bleeding with the proposed procedure  and  to  determine  whether  the  procedure  can  be performed without antithrombotic interruption. 166 For low-  tomoderate bleeding risk surgeries where the anticipated 30-  day risk of major bleed is <2%, strategies for periprocedural anticoagulation management can include a shorter interruption period with prompt re-  initiation.  For  high-  risk  procedures  where  the anticipated 30-  day bleeding risk exceeds 2%, a judicious strategy of anticoagulation interruption is necessary to ensure adequate hemostasis. The second decision-  making step is to establish the indication(s) for anticoagulant therapy including an assessment

of  the  patient-  specific  thromboembolism  risk.  Risk  stratification can be assessed as 'low,' 'intermediate,' or 'high' based on a  number of  clinical  variables  (table  3).  The  ACCP  guidelines  recommend against heparin bridging for patients at lowto-  moderate thromboembolic risk. For patients at high risk of thromboembolism  defined  as  a  risk  of  arterial  thrombosis  of >10% per year or VTE risk exceeding 10% per month, bridging therapy may be used. The general approach to periprocedural warfarin  management  is  to  first  choose  a  surgical  date  and then discontinue warfarin 5 days prior to this anticipated date. For  those  patients  at  high  risk  of  thromboembolism,  LMWH (enoxaparin  1  mg/kg  two  times  per  day)  is  initiated  once  the PT INR has fallen below the lower end of the target range. It is important to ensure that the CrCl (≥30  mL/min) and platelet counts (≥100×10 9 /L) are satisfactory if using LMWH. Alternatively, intravenous UFH can be used for the patient with severe kidney disease. The last dose of LMWH is given in the morning on the day preceding the day of the procedure. For patients at low-  to-  moderate risk of thromboembolism, no heparin bridging is indicated preprocedure or postprocedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  mechanical  heart  valves  receiving  warfarin therapy  scheduled  for  an  invasive  procedure  first  require  an assessment  of  the  bleeding  risk  of  the  proposed  procedure. 225 The  American  Heart  Association/American  College  of  Cardiology  guidelines  recommend  continued  anticoagulant  therapy for those procedures associated with a low risk of bleeding or where bleeding would be inconsequential. For higher bleeding risk  procedures,  patients  with  a  bileaflet  mechanical  aortic valve prosthesis and no other risk factors, the risk of thromboembolism  is  sufficiently  low  such  that  bridging  anticoagulant therapy can be avoided. For patients with a mechanical aortic valve prosthesis and associated thromboembolic risk factors, an older generation mechanical aortic valve prosthesis, or a mitral mechanical heart valve prosthesis, bridging therapy with LMWH is reasonable when the warfarin has been stopped and the INR is subtherapeutic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients receiving warfarin therapy for the indication of VTE, bridging LMWH can be considered if the thrombotic event occurred within 3  months of the anticipated procedure, if there is active cancer, or if the patient has a documented severe thrombophilia. 226 Apart from these variables, warfarin can simply be stopped 5 days prior to the procedure and restarted after the procedure.  Appropriate  DVT prophylaxis is  warranted  during the  periprocedural  time  interval  prior  to  therapeutic  warfarin resumption.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When there is an elevated INR without major bleeding, the warfarin  can  be  reversed  with  oral  vitamin  K.  Intravenous vitamin K can be administered when there is active bleeding. 216 When there is life-  threatening bleeding, recombinant activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa), three-  factor PCC which contain factors II, IX, and X, or four-  factor PCC, containing factors II, VII, IX, and X, can be given. Activated rFVIIa and PCCs are better than FFP in reversing warfarin 227 ; PCC is better than rFVIIa 228 ; and four-  factor PCC appears to be more effective than three-  factor PCC. 216 229 230

Neuraxial techniques in relation to the INR and in the chronically anticoagulated patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial injections and removal of epidural catheters appear to  be  safe  when  done  within  24  hours  after  warfarin  is  initiated. This was documented by Parvizi et  al , 231 who noted the absence of spinal hematoma in over 12 000 patients in whom they removed the epidural catheters within 24-48  hours of initiation of warfarin therapy. The safety of removing epidural catheters was also documented by other investigators. 222 232 No spinal hematoma occurred after removal of catheters 12-14  hours after warfarin therapy, even in the patients with INRs of 1.5-1.9. The mean (±SD) factor VII levels 12 hours after warfarin initiation were noted to be normal in the patients with INRs ≤1.4 and acceptable in the patients with INRs of 1.5-1.9. 233 Another group of  investigators  showed  no  spinal  hematoma  in  4365  patients when epidural catheters were removed while on warfarin; the mean duration of warfarin treatment was 2.1±0.6  days and the INRs at the  time  of  removal  was  1.9±0.4  (range  1.5-7.1). 232 In this study, no other anticoagulant was given except NSAIDs and the patients were closely monitored. A closer look at this study showed that most catheters (4090 patients) were removed on postoperative day (POD) 2 (day of surgery is POD 0); 140 were removed on POD 3. While it does not appear to increase risk to remove epidural catheters 12-24  hours after warfarin was initiated, the risk of removing epidural catheters at 48 hours is not guaranteed to be lower. This is because adequate activity of clotting factor VII is not certain, and activities of factors IX and X are starting to decline.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Warfarin should be discontinued for at least 5 days and the INR should be measured and normalized (per local laboratory) prior  to  performance  of  a  neuraxial  block.  This  is  consistent with  ESAIC/ESRA  guidelines.  Recommendations  are  based  on warfarin pharmacology, the clinical relevance of vitamin K coagulation factor levels/deficiencies, case series, and the case reports of spinal hematoma among these patients. Websites are available to assist clinicians with warfarin dosing. 234

HERBAL MEDICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  is  a  widespread  use  of  herbal  medications  in  surgical patients. Most patients do not volunteer information regarding herbal medication use and obtaining such a history may be difficult. 235-237 Morbidity and mortality associated with herbal use may be more likely in the perioperative period because of the polypharmacy  and  physiological  alterations  that  occur.  Such complications include bleeding from garlic, ginkgo, and ginseng, and  potential  interaction  between  ginseng-  warfarin  (table  6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There have been case reports of spontaneous neuraxial bleeding following ingestion of garlic 238 and gingko biloba. 239-242

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the widespread use of herbal medications, there are few controlled clinical trials of the efficacy (or adverse effects) and few outcome studies of the effects of herbal medications on surgical patients; a prospective study including over 600 patients found no differences in surgical outcomes, including bleeding, in  patients  reporting  recent  herbal  therapy. 243 However, while overall  there  does  not  appear  to  be  a  clinically  significant increase  in  surgical  bleeding  or  spinal  hematoma  in  patients receiving herbal medications, data on the combination of herbal therapy  with  other  forms  of  anticoagulation  are  lacking.  The concurrent  use  of  other  medications  affecting  clotting  mechanisms, such as oral anticoagulants or heparin, may increase the risk of bleeding complications in these patients. Thus, it is often recommended that these medications be discontinued in anticipation of surgery, but there is no reason for cancellation of the procedure if patients have not done so. 244

ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY IN PREGNANCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VTE is one of the most common causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, especially in high-  resource countries. 245 246 Some of the risk factors that increase the incidence of thrombosis in pregnant and postpartum people include a personal history of VTE,  thrombophilia,  prolonged  immobilization,  and  cesarean delivery. 247 248 The 6-  week period following delivery is associated with a higher rate of thrombosis and PE than pregnancy itself. 249  250 For  this  reason,  pharmacological  thromboprophylaxis for pregnant people at high risk for VTE is often recommended, particularly in the postpartum period. 248

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists (ACOG), California Quality Maternal Care Collaborative, American  Society  of  Hematology,  and  ACCP  have  each  published obstetric  thromboembolism  guidance  that  has  increased  the likelihood that pregnant people requesting analgesia or needing urgent cesarean delivery will have recently received an anticoagulant which can potentially restrict their analgesic and anesthetic options. It is therefore critical that proactive, multidisciplinary planning takes place, incorporating the relative risks and benefits of neuraxial and general anesthesia to determine appropriate anticoagulant dosing and cessation times.

Pregnancy  is  a  hypercoagulable  state  in  which  platelet  aggregation  is  enhanced,  several  coagulation  factor  levels  rise,  and protein C and S levels are decreased. 251 Physiological  changes during pregnancy include an increased volume of distribution, clearance,  bioavailability,  and  metabolism  of  many  drugs. 252 Available data from studies examining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of UFH suggest that, compared with nonpregnant people, aPTT response and duration of action of UFH in  pregnancy  may  be  decreased. 253  254 Similarly,  for  LMWH,

Neuraxial hematoma in the obstetric patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  incidence  of  neuraxial  hematoma  after  spinal  or  epidural blockade  in  the  obstetric  population  is  difficult  to  determine, although it is widely reported that these patients have a significantly lower incidence of this complication than older populations. 52  Moen et al 52 reported two spinal hematomas in obstetric patients with apparent coagulopathy (incidence 1:200 000); one after a subarachnoid block and one following the removal of an epidural catheter. This incidence was significantly lower than the incidence  of  1:3600  in  elderly  females  undergoing  total  knee arthroplasty. Bateman et al 257 confirmed the substantially lower risk  of  neuraxial  hematoma  in  obstetric  patients  documenting seven epidural hematomas among 142 287 patients undergoing epidural  anesthesia/analgesia  (1:20  326)  and  none  in  obstetric patients. These findings are particularly notable since bloody taps, a reputed risk factor for neuraxial hematoma, are more common in the obstetric than in the general surgical population. 258

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A systematic review of English language publications (19522016) revealed no cases of neuraxial hematoma due to neuraxial anesthesia and  low  dose  (thromboprophylaxis)  in obstetric patients , although the denominator (total number of cases) was unknown. 259 The two patients that developed a hematoma had confounding issues: one had relevant symptoms before receiving the  anticoagulant  and  the  other  developed  symptoms  after high-  dose (therapeutic) anticoagulation for a PE. A subsequent publication reported the development of a neuraxial hematoma after spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery when a larger dose of LMWH was administered post partum, earlier than the time interval recommended by ASRA guidelines. 260 Potential explanations for the lower incidence of neuraxial hematoma in obstetric compared  with  older,  orthopedic  patients  include  the  hypercoagulable  state  and  a  more  compliant  epidural  space,  unimpeded  by  osteoporotic  deformities,  which  can  accommodate larger volumes of blood before symptomatic neural compression occurs. 52 54

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial and general anesthesia in the obstetric patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia are particularly vital to the care  of  the  obstetric  patient.  For  labor,  neuraxial  analgesia provides superior pain relief to other modalities. Neuraxial labor analgesia also provides an in situ neuraxial catheter that can be converted to an anesthetic for cesarean delivery, and decreases circulating catecholamine levels which may be particularly beneficial  for  patients  with  pre-  eclampsia  or  other  comorbidities. Although the risk of death from neuraxial versus general anesthesia for cesarean delivery is not statistically different, avoidable  (non-  emergent)  general  anesthesia  is  associated  with  an increased odds of severe overall complications (aOR 2.9; 95% CI  1.6  to  5.2)  and  severe  anesthetic  complications  (aOR  1.6; 95% CI 1.4 to 1.9). 261 These include surgical site infection, postoperative VTE, and hemorrhage (box 1).

Peripartum management of the obstetric patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  peripartum  management  of  the  obstetric  patient  that receives  anticoagulant  medications  presents  a  significant  clinical  challenge. 10  262 ACOG  and  the  SOAP  recommendations support every labor unit having a protocol for when anticoagulants  should  be  stopped,  and  if  short-  term  strategies  such  as converting to UFH, due to its shorter half-  life, in anticipation of delivery should be considered. 262 In the event of unforeseen labor or urgent cesarean delivery, the choice of analgesia and/ or anesthesia should balance the risks of general anesthesia and benefits  of  neuraxial  anesthesia  given  the  anticoagulant,  dose, time of administration, and pertinent laboratory values. The plan for reinitiating anticoagulation post partum must also incorporate the anesthetic management and hemostasis after delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF NEURAXIAL BLOCK IN THE ANTICOAGULATED PARTURIENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the limited pharmacological data on antithrombotic agents in pregnancy and in the absence of a large series of neuraxial techniques  in  the  pregnant  population  receiving  prophylaxis or  treatment  for  venous  thromboembolism,  we  suggest  that the recommendations included in this document be applied to parturients (grade IIC)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Remarks: there is no change to this recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
However, in circumstances involving select high-  risk parturients receiving VTE prophylaxis, and requiring urgent interventions for maternal or fetal indications, the risk of general anesthesia may  be  greater  than  neuraxial  anesthesia,  and  exceptions/ modifications  of  these  recommendations  may  be  appropriate (grade IIC)

Remarks: there is no change to this recommendation.

nature  of  bleeding  into  a  fixed  and  non-  compressible  space, the associated risk following plexus and peripheral techniques remains undefined. The fear of bleeding, specifically in a deep, non-  compressible  site  can  deter  providers  from  performing peripheral  nerve  blockade,  even  in  patients  who  would  likely benefit. Unfortunately, there continues to be a lack of investigations  examining  the  frequency  and  severity  of  hemorrhagic complications following plexus or peripheral blockade in anticoagulated  patients.  In  addition,  there  continues  to  be  case reports of significant morbidity related to hematomas following peripheral  nerve  blockade  in  coagulopathic  patients. 263-267 All published  cases  of  clinically  significant  bleeding/bruising  after plexus or peripheral techniques in patients with normal hemostasis  were  published  in  the  previous  edition. 263-266  268-281 A recent  practice  advisory  published  by  the  Regional  Anesthesia and Acute Pain Section of the Canadian Anesthesiologists Society sought to stratify the bleeding risk into 'low risk,' 'intermediate risk,' or 'high risk' for peripheral nerve blocks and interfascial plane blocks. 282 Hemorrhagic complications following the deep plexus/deep peripheral techniques (including but not limited to those  listed  as  high  risk,  eg,  stellate  ganglion,  infraclavicular, lumbar sympathetic, lumbar plexus, and paravertebral), particularly in the presence of antithrombotic therapy, are often serious and a source of major patient morbidity. 282 These cases continue to suggest that significant blood loss, rather than neural deficits, may be the most serious complication.

MANAGEMENT OF DEEP PLEXUS/PERIPHERAL BLOCK IN THE ANTICOAGULATED PATIENT

For patients undergoing deep plexus or deep peripheral block, we recommend that guidelines for neuraxial block be similarly applied (grade IC)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Remarks: there is no change in this recommendation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients undergoing other plexus or peripheral techniques, we  suggest  performance,  catheter  maintenance,  and  catheter removal be based on site compressibility, vascularity, and consequences of bleeding, should it occur (grade IIC)

RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE ESAIC/ESRA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The previous European Society of Anaesthesiology guidelines on 'regional anesthesia and antithrombotic agents' were published in  2010. 280 In  the  same  year,  ASRA  also  published  its  third edition of similar guidelines. 8 The fourth edition of the ASRA guidelines in 2018 were the result of a collaboration with ESA to construct a single set of guidelines. 9 As a result, the differences were only minimal. The most recent European guidelines were a collaborative effort of both the ESAIC and the ESRA and were published in February 2022. 11

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the resulting recommendations, the wording 'prophylactic' or 'therapeutic' doses was replaced by 'low' and 'high' for the DOACs, the LMHWs, UFH, fondaparinux, and aspirin, as both the dose used and the indication, along with the presence of risk factors, influence the pharmacokinetics in the individual patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  present  ESAIC/ESRA  guidelines  now  recommend  a complete  resolution  of  the  VKA  effect  (similar  to  the  ASRA recommendation) and a return of the INR to the normal range of  the  local  laboratory  (eg,  ≤1.1).  The  low-  dose  DOAC-  free time intervals were based on the half-  lives of the drugs in the presence  of  mild/moderate  renal  insufficiency  (CrCl  ≥30  mL/

<!-- PAGE=? -->
min)  and/or  advanced  age  but  were  prolonged  in  the  case  of severe  renal  insufficiency  (CrCl  15-29  mL/min)  for  edoxaban and  rivaroxaban.  A  high-  dose  DOAC-  free  time  interval  of  72 hours was recommended for all DOACs, while laboratory testing was recommended in the presence an impaired kidney function (DXA's CrCl <30 mL/min; dabigatran CrCl <50 mL/min). The time intervals to resume DOAC treatment after removal of the neuraxial  catheter  now  consider  the  planned  DOAC  dose.  In contrast, the management of patients receiving low-  dose UFH, low-  dose  LMWH,  low-  dose  fondaparinux,  and  antiplatelet therapy  have  remained  quite  similar  to  the  ASRA  guidelines. Therapy-  free time intervals are recommended in the presence of high-  dose UFH and LMWH treatment, but so is the use of target laboratory values, especially in the presence of a CrCl <30  mL/ min.  Like  ASRA,  superficial  nerve  blocks  can  be  performed without  any  therapy-  free  time  interval  and  irrespective  of  the dose of the antithrombotic drug used. In contrast, deep nerve blocks  should  be  performed  according  to  the  more  stringent recommendations for neuraxial procedures. Finally, in obstetric patients  requiring  a  neuraxial  block  for  delivery  or  cesarean section, the same recommendations as those advocated for the non-  pregnant population should be followed. However, a deviation from the current guidelines may be considered in selected cases (eg, a parturient with high thrombotic risk who requires an unplanned or urgent fetal or maternal intervention, in whom the risk of general anesthesia outweighs the risk of a neuraxial technique), following a multidisciplinary discussion and a careful risk-  benefit analysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UNPLANNED ANTICOAGULATION DURING NEURAXIAL ANALGESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occasionally, patients require emergent antithrombotic therapy (vascular graft thrombosis, acute coronary syndrome/myocardial infarction), or a breakdown in communication results in unanticipated anticoagulation in the presence of indwelling epidural catheters. It is critical that the acute pain medicine service be aware of alterations in the degree and timing of anticoagulation. Increasing centralization and computerization make it possible for hospital pharmacy  services  to  assist  with  patient  management.  Since all  medication  orders  are  filled  by  pharmacists  using  a  central computer,  patients  who  receive  an  epidural  infusion  are  identified  within the pharmacy database. Any subsequent order for an antithrombotic agent is flagged as a drug 'interaction' during entry, and the pharmacist receives an alert notice to contact the pain service. The pain service is then able to consult in a multidisciplinary manner with other services involved in the patient's care. The timing of catheter removal will be based on the ongoing risk of thromboembolism, the need for continued antithrombotic therapy,  and  the  potential  for  neuraxial  bleeding  during  catheter  maintenance  and  removal.  This  'pharmacy  failsafe'  allows the anesthesia acute pain service to participate proactively in the timing  of  catheter  removal  and  subsequent  anticoagulation,  as well as closely monitor the patient's neurological status. 281

SUMMARY

Practice  guidelines  or  recommendations  summarize  evidencebased  reviews.  However,  the  rarity  of  spinal  hematoma  defies  a prospective-  randomized study, and there is no current laboratory model. As a  result,  these consensus statements represent  the  collective experience of recognized experts in the field of neuraxial anesthesia and anticoagulation. They are based on case reports, clinical series, pharmacology, hematology, and risk factors for surgical bleeding with appropriate grading of the level of evidence and strength of the

recommendations. An understanding of the complexity of this issue is  essential  to  patient  management  and  this  consensus  statement cannot be applied universally to the complex scenarios that may confront clinicians. Rather, the decision to perform spinal, epidural, or deep plexus/peripheral anesthesia/analgesia, as well as the timing of catheter removal in a patient receiving antithrombotic therapy, should be made on an individual basis. This decision should weigh the small, though definite, risk of neuraxial hematoma against the benefits of regional anesthesia for the specific patient, as well as the risks of withholding these benefits. Alternative anesthetic and analgesic techniques exist for patients whose risk of regional anesthesia exceeds the expected benefit. The patient's coagulation status should be optimized at the time of spinal or epidural needle/catheter placement, and the level of anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during the period of epidural catheterization. Indwelling neuraxial catheters should not be removed in the presence of therapeutic anticoagulation, as this appears to significantly increase the risk  of  spinal  hematoma. Identification of risk factors and establishment of guidelines will not completely eliminate the complication of spinal hematoma. 283 In  the  series  by  V andermeulen et al , although 87% of patients had a hemostatic abnormality or difficulty with needle puncture, 13% had no identifiable risk factor. 53 Vigilance in monitoring is critical to allow early evaluation of neurological dysfunction and prompt intervention. Protocols must be in place for urgent MRI and hematoma evacuation, if there is a change in neurological status. W e must focus on the prevention of neuraxial hematoma and on rapid diagnosis and treatment to optimize neurological outcomes. Anesthesiologists need to further weigh the risks and benefits in settings where imaging and surgical decompression are not options. Documentation of the risks, benefits, and alternatives is also recommended.
