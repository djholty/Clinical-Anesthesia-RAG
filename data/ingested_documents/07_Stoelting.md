Although  the  etiology  of  pericardial  diseases  is  diverse,  the resulting  clinical  and  pathologic  manifestations  are  similar. Th e  three  most  frequent  responses  to  pericardial  injury  are characterized  as  acute  pericarditis,  pericardial  e ff usion,  and constrictive  pericarditis.  Cardiac  tamponade  may  present whenever pericardial fl uid accumulates under pressure. Management of anesthesia in patients with pericardial disease is facilitated by an understanding of the alterations in cardiovascular function produced by pericardial disease.

ACUTE PERICARDITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Viral infection is o ft en presumed to be the cause of acute pericarditis when it occurs as a primary illness (Table 7-1). Most cases of acute pericarditis follow a transient and uncomplicated

clinical course, and thus this entity is o ft en termed acute benign pericarditis. Acute  benign  pericarditis  is  unaccompanied  by either a substantial pericardial e ff usion or cardiac tamponade and rarely progresses to constrictive pericarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis  can  also  occur  a ft er  myocardial  infarction.  It most commonly appears 1 to 3 days following a transmural myocardial infarction as a result of the interaction between the healing necrotic myocardium and the pericardium. Dressler's syndrome is a delayed form of acute pericarditis that may follow acute myocardial infarction. It can occur weeks to months a ft er the initial myocardial event. It is thought that Dressler's syndrome is the result of an autoimmune process that is initiated by the entry of necrotic myocardium into the circulation, where  it  acts  as  an  antigen.  Acute  pericarditis  occurs  more commonly in adult men 20 to 50 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e clinical diagnosis of acute pericarditis is based on the presence of chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, and changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Th e chest pain is typically acute in onset and is described as a severe pain localized over the anterior  chest. Th is  pain  typically  worsens  with  inspiration, which helps to distinguish it from pain caused by myocardial ischemia. Patients o ft en report relief when changing position from  being  supine  to  sitting  forward.  Low-grade  fever  and sinus tachycardia are also common. Auscultation of the chest o ft en reveals a friction rub, especially when the symptoms are acute. Th ese  high-pitched  scratchy  sounds  occur  when  volumes in the heart undergo the most dramatic changes, such as  during  early  ventricular fi lling  and  ventricular  ejection. Pericardial friction rubs are related to the cardiac cycle; this makes it  possible  to  di ff erentiate  these  sounds  from  pleural rubs, which are related to inspiration.

In fl ammation of  the  super fi cial  myocardium  is  the  most likely  explanation  for  the  di ff use  changes  seen  on  the  ECG. Classically, the ECG changes associated with acute pericarditis evolve through four stages. Stage I is characterized by di ff use ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression. In stage II, the ST and PR segments normalize. Stage III shows widespread

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
T-wave inversions. And stage IV is characterized by normalization of the T waves. Th e early ST elevations are usually present in all leads, but in post-myocardial infarction pericarditis, the changes may be more localized. Th e  di ff use distribution and  the  absence  of  reciprocal  ST-segment  depressions  distinguish these changes from the ECG changes of myocardial infarction.  Depression  of  the  PR  segment  seen  on  the  ECG re fl ects super fi cial  injury  of  the  atrial  myocardium and may be the earliest sign of acute pericarditis. ECG changes are seen in  90%  of  patients  with  acute  pericarditis.  However,  a  clear evolution of ECG changes through the four stages described earlier is noted in only approximately 60% of all patients with acute pericarditis. Patients with uremic pericarditis frequently do not have these typical ECG abnormalities of pericarditis. Acute pericarditis in the absence of an associated pericardial e ff usion does not alter cardiac function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Salicylates or other nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory  drugs may be useful for decreasing pericardial in fl ammation. Aspirin  is  most  commonly  prescribed,  although  ketorolac  has also  been  used  successfully.  Symptomatic  relief  of  the  pain of  acute  pericarditis  can  also  be  provided  by  oral  analgesics such as codeine. In some settings, relief may be achieved with the use of colchicine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also relieve the symptoms of acute pericarditis. However, their use early in the course of acute pericarditis is associated with an increased incidence of relapse a ft er discontinuation of the drug. Th erefore, steroid therapy is usually reserved for cases that do not respond to conventional therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Relapsing Pericarditis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute pericarditis resulting from any cause may follow a recurrent or chronic relapsing course. Relapsing pericarditis has two clinical  presentations:  incessant  and  intermittent. Incessant pericarditis is diagnosed in patients in whom discontinuation of  or  attempts  to  wean  from  antiin fl ammatory drugs nearly always result in a relapse within a period of 6 weeks or less. Intermittent pericarditis occurs in patients who have symptomfree intervals of longer than 6 weeks without drug treatment. In many patients, the symptoms of relapsing pericarditis include weakness, fatigue, and headache, and are associated with chest discomfort. Although relapsing pericarditis is uncomfortable, it is rarely life threatening. Treatment may include the standard therapies for acute pericarditis and/or corticosteroids (prednisone) or immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis after Cardiac Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postcardiotomy  syndrome  presents  primarily  as  acute  pericarditis. Th e  cause  of  this  syndrome  may  be  infective  or autoimmune, and it may follow blunt or penetrating trauma, hemopericardium,  or  epicardial pacemaker  implantation. Most  commonly,  it  is  seen  in  patients  undergoing  cardiac surgery  in  which  pericardiotomy  was  performed. Th e  incidence  of  postcardiotomy  syndrome  associated  with  cardiac surgery is between 10% and 40%. It is more common in pediatric patients. Th e risk is lower a ft er cardiac transplantation, presumably because of the immunosuppressed state. Cardiac tamponade  is  a  rare  complication  of  postcardiotomy  syndrome, with an incidence ranging from 0.1% to 6%. Th e treatment of postcardiotomy syndrome is similar to that of other forms of acute pericarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION AND CARDIAC TAMPONADE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericardial fl uid may accumulate in the pericardial sac with virtually any form of pericardial disease. Th e pathophysiologic e ff ects of a pericardial e ff usion re fl ect whether or not the fl uid is under pressure. Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pressure of the fl uid in the pericardial space impairs cardiac fi lling. Common causes of atraumatic and traumatic pericardial e ff usion are listed in Table 7-1. In up to 20% of cases, the cause of the pericardial e ff usion is unknown. Neoplastic pericardial e ff usion is a common cause of cardiac tamponade in nonsurgical patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericardial fl uid may be classi fi ed as transudative or exudative.  Serosanguineous  (exudative) fl uid  is  typically  seen when  the  pericardial  disease  is  due  to  cancer,  tuberculosis, or  radiation  exposure.  Serosanguineous  pericardial  e ff usion also occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease. Traumatic injury  usually  presents  as  hemopericardium.  Perforation  of the heart and subsequent cardiac tamponade may also result from insertion of central venous catheters or pacemaker wires.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e signs and symptoms of a pericardial e ff usion depend on its  size  and  duration  (acute  versus  chronic). Th e  pericardial space  normally  holds  15  to  50  mL  of  pericardial fl uid. Th is fl uid is an ultra fi ltrate of plasma that comes from the visceral pericardium. Native pericardial fl uid lubricates the heart and

FIGURE 7-1 Pericardial pressure-volume curves are shown in which the intrapericardial volume increases slowly or rapidly over time. On the left, rapidly increasing pericardial fluid quickly exceeds the limit of pericardial stretch, which causes a steep increase in pericardial pressure. On the right, a slower rate of pericardial filling takes longer to exceed the limit of pericardial stretch because there is more time for the pericardium to stretch and for compensatory mechanisms to become activated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
facilitates  normal  cardiac  motion  within  the  pericardial  sac. Acute changes in pericardial volume as small as 100 mL may result  in  increased  intrapericardial  pressure  and  development of cardiac tamponade. Conversely, large volumes can be accommodated if the pericardial e ff usion develops gradually. In this context, the pressure-volume relationship is altered, and cardiac tamponade may not develop because the pericardium stretches to accommodate the volume of the e ff usion (Figure 7-1). Th e development of a chronic pericardial e ff usion in this setting can result in e ff usion volumes in excess of 2 L. If the pressure in the pericardium remains low, large e ff usions can be  tolerated  without  signi fi cant  signs  and  symptoms.  However, as pericardial pressure increases, the right atrial pressure increases in parallel, so that the right atrial pressure becomes an accurate re fl ection of the intrapericardial pressure. At this point, signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade may develop.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIAC TAMPONADE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac tamponade presents as a spectrum of hemodynamic abnormalities of varying severity, rather than as an all-or-none phenomenon. Symptoms of large pericardial e ff usions re fl ect compression  of  adjacent  anatomic  structures,  speci fi cally the esophagus, trachea, and lung. In this situation, common symptoms include anorexia, dyspnea, cough, and chest pain. Symptoms such as  dysphagia,  hiccups,  and  hoarseness  may indicate higher pressure on the adjacent tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two important  physical  signs  of  cardiac  tamponade  and constrictive pericarditis were described by Dr. Adolf Kussmaul in 1873. Kussmaul's sign is distention of the jugular veins during inspiration. Pulsus paradoxus was described by Kussmaul as  "a  pulse  simultaneously  slight  and  irregular,  disappearing during inspiration and returning on expiration." Th e modern de fi nition of pulsus paradoxus is a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration (Figure 7-2). Th is hemodynamic change re fl ects selective impairment of  diastolic fi lling  of  the  le ft ventricle.  Pulsus  paradoxus  is observed in approximately 75% of patients with acute cardiac

tamponade, but in only about 30% of patients with chronic pericardial  e ff usion.  Kussmaul's  sign  and  pulsus  paradoxus both re fl ect dyssynchrony or opposing responses of the right and  le ft ventricles  to fi lling  during  the  respiratory  cycle. Another term for this occurrence is ventricular discordance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Beck's triad consists of distant heart sounds, increased jugular venous pressure, and hypotension. Beck's triad is observed in one third of patients with acute cardiac tamponade. Another triad consisting of quiet heart sounds, increased central venous pressure,  and  ascites  has  been  described  in  patients  with chronic  pericardial  e ff usion.  More  commonly,  symptomatic patients with chronic pericardial e ff usion exhibit sinus tachycardia, jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema. Ewart's sign, in which there is an area of bronchial breath  sounds  and  dullness  to  percussion,  is  an  uncommon sign of pericardial e ff usion. It is caused by compression of the le ft lower  lobe  by  the  pericardial  e ff usion. When this sign is present, it is observed at the inferior angle of the le ft scapula.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depending on the  severity  of  cardiac  tamponade,  systemic blood pressure may be decreased or maintained in the normal range. Central venous pressure is almost always increased. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system re fl ects an attempt to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure by tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is maintained as long as central venous pressure exceeds right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. A progressive increase in intrapericardial pressure, however, eventually results in equalization of right atrial pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Ultimately, the increased intrapericardial pressure leads to impaired diastolic fi lling of the heart, decreased stroke volume, and hypotension (Table 7-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac tamponade may be the cause of low cardiac output syndrome during the early postoperative period a ft er cardiac surgery. Cardiac tamponade may occur as a complication of various invasive procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and intensive care unit. Acute cardiac tamponade may also be due to hemopericardium caused by aortic dissection, penetrating cardiac trauma, or acute myocardial infarction.

FIGURE 7-2 Cyclical systolic pressure variation during tidal breathing is normal. In the presence of cardiac tamponade, the arterial blood pressure decreases more than 10 mm Hg ( a → b ) from exhalation ( Exhal ) to inhalation ( Inhal ) as a reflection of a concomitant decrease in left ventricular stroke volume. This contrasts with the opposite response observed during inspiration in the absence of cardiac tamponade, which accounts for its designation as a paradoxical pulse (pulsus paradoxus).

LOCULATED PERICARDIAL EFFUSIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Loculated pericardial e ff usion may selectively compress one or more cardiac chambers producing a localized cardiac tamponade. Th is localization is most frequently observed a ft er cardiac surgery,  when  blood  accumulates  behind  the  sternum  and selectively  compresses  the  right  ventricle  and  right  atrium. A similar response may be seen following anterior chest wall trauma.  Transesophageal  echocardiography  is  superior  to transthoracic echocardiography for demonstrating a localized pericardial e ff usion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography is the most accurate and practical method for  diagnosing  pericardial  e ff usion  and  cardiac  tamponade. Because of this,  echocardiography  ful fi lls  the  class  I  recommendations by the 2003 Task Force of the American Society of Echocardiography, American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association for the evaluation of all patients with  suspected  pericardial  disease.  Echocardiography  can detect pericardial e ff usions of as little as 20 mL. Th e measurement of the echo-free space between the heart and pericardium  allows  easy  assessment  of  e ff usion  size  and  may  also provide information about the cause of the e ff usion. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also useful in detecting both pericardial e ff usion and pericardial thickening. Th e ECG may demonstrate low voltage in the presence of a large e ff usion. Chest radiography o ft en shows a characteristic "water bottle heart." However, this is a nonspeci fi c  sign  for  pericardial  e ff usion.  Pericardiocentesis  may  be useful for diagnosing metastatic disease or infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography, although de fi nitive for diagnosing pericardial e ff usion, cannot always con fi rm the presence of cardiac tamponade. However, a fi nding of early diastolic inward wall motion of the right atrium or right ventricle ("collapse"), re fl ecting similar intracavitary and intrapericardial pressure, is  suggestive  of  the  presence  of  cardiac  tamponade.  Echocardiography  can  also  demonstrate  ventricular  discordance. Pulsed wave Doppler examination of peak mitral and tricuspid in fl ow velocities will show a decrease in mitral fl ow and an increase in tricuspid fl ow during inspiration if tamponade is present. Ventricular septal deviation toward the le ft can also be seen during inspiration. With cardiac tamponade, the pressures within the cardiac chambers will eventually equilibrate. Clinically, this can be con fi rmed by right-sided heart catheterization. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (both estimates of le ft atrial pressure and le ft ventricular end-diastolic pressure), right atrial pressure, and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure will be nearly equal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mild  cardiac  tamponade  can  be  managed  conservatively  in some patients. However, removal of fl uid is required for de fi nitive treatment and should be performed when central venous

<!-- PAGE=? -->
148

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pressure  is  increased.  Pericardial fl uid  may  be  removed  by pericardiocentesis  or  by  surgical  techniques,  which  include subxiphoid  pericardiostomy,  thoracoscopic  pericardiostomy, and  thoracotomy  with  pericardiostomy.  Removal  of  even a  small  amount of pericardial fl uid can result in a dramatic decrease in intrapericardial pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Temporizing measures likely to help maintain stroke volume until  de fi nitive  treatment  of  cardiac  tamponade can be instituted include expanding intravascular volume, administering catecholamines to increase myocardial contractility,  and  correcting metabolic acidosis. Expansion of intravascular fl uid volume can be achieved by infusion of either colloid or crystalloid solution.  However,  improvement  in  hemodynamic  function may be limited, and pericardiocentesis should not be delayed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous intravenous infusion of a catecholamine such as isoproterenol may be an e ff ective temporizing measure for increasing  myocardial  contractility  and  heart  rate.  Atropine may be necessary  to  treat  the  bradycardia  that  results  from vagal  re fl exes  evoked by the increased intrapericardial pressure.  Dopamine infusion, which increases systemic vascular resistance, can also be employed to treat cardiac tamponade. As  with  intravascular fl uid  replacement,  pericardiocentesis should never be delayed in deference to drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Correction  of  metabolic  acidosis  is  essential  when  considering the management of a cardiac tamponade. Metabolic acidosis resulting from low cardiac output should be treated to correct the myocardial depression seen with severe acidosis and to improve the inotropic e ff ects of catecholamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthesia  and  positive  pressure  ventilation  in  the presence of a hemodynamically signi fi cant cardiac tamponade can  result  in life-threatening  hypotension. Th is  hypotension may  be  due  to  anesthesia-induced  peripheral  vasodilation, direct  myocardial  depression,  or  decreased  venous  return caused by the increased intrathoracic pressure associated with positive  pressure  ventilation.  Pericardiocentesis performed under local anesthesia is o ft en preferred for the initial management of hypotensive patients with cardiac tamponade. A ft er the hemodynamic status is improved by percutaneous pericardiocentesis, general anesthesia and positive pressure ventilation can be instituted to permit surgical exploration and more de fi nitive treatment of the cardiac tamponade. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia with ketamine or a benzodiazepine in combination with nitrous oxide is o ft en used. Th e circulatory e ff ects of pancuronium are particularly useful for producing skeletal muscle relaxation in these patients. Intraoperative monitoring typically includes intraarterial and central venous pressure monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases in which it is not possible to relieve the cardiac tamponade before induction of anesthesia, the principal goals of anesthetic induction are maintenance of adequate cardiac output and blood pressure. Anesthesia-induced decreases in myocardial  contractility,  systemic  vascular  resistance,  and  heart rate must be avoided. Increased intrathoracic pressure caused by straining or coughing during induction or by mechanical ventilation may further decrease venous return. Some advocate  preparing  and  draping  for  incision  before  induction  of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Th is would allow for the  shortest  possible  time  from  the  adverse  hemodynamic consequences related to the anesthetic and mechanical ventilation  and  the  surgical  relief  of  the  tamponade.  Ketamine  is useful  for  induction  and  maintenance  of  anesthesia  because it  increases  myocardial  contractility,  systemic  vascular  resistance,  and  heart  rate.  Induction  of  anesthesia  with  a  benzodiazepine  followed  by  maintenance  with  nitrous  oxide  plus fentanyl (or another synthetic narcotic), combined with pancuronium for skeletal  muscle  relaxation,  has  also  been  used successfully.  Continuous  monitoring  of  blood  pressure  and central venous pressure should be initiated before induction of anesthesia. Administration of intravenous fl uids and/or continuous infusion of a catecholamine may be useful for maintaining cardiac output until the cardiac tamponade is relieved by surgical drainage. A ft er release of a severe tamponade, there is o ft en a signi fi cant swing in blood pressure from hypotension to hypertension. Th is change should be anticipated and appropriate treatment should be prompt, especially if the cause of the tamponade is an aortic hematoma, dissection, or aneurysm that could be signi fi cantly compromised by hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Constrictive pericarditis is most o ft en idiopathic or the result of  previous  cardiac  surgery  or  exposure  to  radiotherapy. Tuberculosis may also cause constrictive pericarditis. Chronic constrictive  pericarditis is  characterized  by fi brous  scarring and  adhesions  that  obliterate  the  pericardial  space,  creating a  rigid  shell  around  the  heart.  Calci fi cation  may  develop  in long-standing cases. Subacute constrictive pericarditis is more common than chronic calci fi c pericarditis, and the resulting constriction in this situation is fi broelastic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericardial constriction typically presents with symptoms and signs  because  of  a  combination  of  increased  central  venous pressure  and  low  cardiac  output.  Symptoms  of  pericardial constriction include decreased exercise tolerance and fatigue. Jugular  venous  distention,  hepatic  congestion,  ascites,  and peripheral  edema  are  signs  of  pericardial  constriction  that mimic right ventricular failure. Pulmonary congestion is usually  absent.  Increases  in  and  eventual  equalization  of  right atrial  pressure,  right  ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure,  and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure are features that occur in the presence of both constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. As pericardial pressure increases, right atrial pressure increases in parallel, and therefore the central venous pressure is an accurate re fl ection of intrapericardial pressure. Atrial dysrhythmias (atrial fi brillation or fl utter) are o ft en seen in patients with  chronic  constrictive  pericarditis  and  presumably  re fl ect involvement of the sinoatrial node by the disease process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 7 PERICARDIAL DISEASES AND CARDIAC TRAUMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Constrictive pericarditis is similar to cardiac tamponade in that both conditions impede diastolic fi lling of the heart and result in an increased central venous pressure and ultimately a  decreased cardiac output. Diagnostic signs, however, di ff er in  the  two  conditions.  Pulsus  paradoxus  is  a  regular  feature of cardiac tamponade but is o ft en absent in constrictive pericarditis.  Kussmaul's  sign  (increased  central  venous  pressure during  inspiration)  occurs  more  frequently  in  patients  with constrictive pericarditis than in those with cardiac tamponade. An early diastolic sound (pericardial knock) is o ft en heard in patients with constrictive pericarditis but does not occur in cardiac tamponade. A prominent y descent of the jugular venous pressure waveform (Friedreich's sign) re fl ects rapid right ventricular fi lling  in  early  diastole  that  is  seen  with  constrictive pericarditis. Th is  rapid  early  diastolic fi lling  is  also  detected by a dip in early diastolic pressure. Th e ventricle is completely fi lled by the end of the rapid fi lling phase, and a period of constant  ventricular  volume, known as diastasis, persists  for  the remainder of diastole. Corresponding to this prolonged diastasis, ventricular diastolic pressure remains unchanged for the latter two thirds of diastole. Th is pattern of ventricular diastolic pressure in constrictive pericarditis is referred to as the square root sign or dip-and-plateau morphology (Figure 7-3, A ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Constrictive pericarditis is di ffi cult  to  diagnose,  and  its  signs and symptoms are therefore o ft en erroneously attributed to liver disease or idiopathic pericardial e ff usion. Th e clinical diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis depends on the con fi rmation of an increased central venous pressure without other signs or symptoms of heart disease. Heart size and lung fi elds appear normal on chest radiographs. However, pericardial calci fi cation can be seen in 30% to 50% of cases. Th e ECG may display only minor, nonspeci fi c  abnormalities.  Echocardiography  can  be  quite helpful  in  many  instances  by  demonstrating  abnormal septal motion and pericardial thickening that suggests the presence of constrictive pericarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography, CT of the chest, and MRI are superior to transthoracic echocardiography  for  demonstrating  pericardial  thickening.  As with  cardiac  tamponade,  ventricular  discordance  is  a  feature of constrictive pericarditis. Pulsed wave Doppler studies o ft en demonstrate  an  exaggerated  respiratory  variation  in  mitral and  tricuspid  diastolic fl ow  velocities.  Cardiac  catheterization  reveals  characteristic  abnormalities,  including  increased central venous pressure, nondilated and normally contracting right and le ft ventricles,  near  equilibration  of  right-  and  le ft -sided cardiac fi lling pressures, and a dip-and-plateau waveform in the right ventricle (see Figure 7-3). Many features considered characteristic of constrictive pericarditis may also be present in patients  with  restrictive  cardiomyopathy,  but  several  features help to distinguish these two entities (Table 7-3). Ventricular discordance is a feature of constrictive pericarditis but not of restrictive  cardiomyopathy. Kussmaul's sign and pulsus paradoxus  are  present  in  constrictive  pericarditis  but  absent  in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Two echocardiographic techniques can also help in this evaluation. Pulsed wave Doppler ultrasonography demonstrates ventricular discordance in constrictive pericarditis.  Tissue  Doppler  ultrasonography  can  be  used  to interrogate the motion of the mitral valve annulus. In restrictive cardiomyopathy, the motion of the mitral annulus is restricted. In  constrictive  pericarditis,  the  motion  of  the  mitral  annulus is  normal. Cardiac catheterization can demonstrate ventricular  discordance  by  allowing  simultaneous  recording  of  right and le ft ventricular systolic pressures. If discordance is present, right ventricular peak systolic pressure increases on inspiration, whereas le ft ventricular peak pressure decreases. Th is observation of ventricular discordance indicates the presence of constrictive pericarditis rather than restrictive cardiomyopathy.

patients, however, the de fi nitive treatment of constrictive pericarditis consists of surgical removal of the adherent constricting pericardium. Th is procedure may result in considerable bleeding from the epicardial surface of the heart. Cardiopulmonary bypass  may  occasionally  be  needed  to  facilitate  pericardial stripping, especially if hemorrhage is di ffi cult to control. Unlike the  treatment of cardiac tamponade, in which hemodynamic improvement occurs immediately, surgical removal of constricting pericardium is not followed by an immediate improvement in cardiac output or a reduction in right atrial pressure. Typically, right atrial pressure returns to normal within 3 months of surgery. Th e absence of immediate hemodynamic improvement may be due to disuse atrophy of myocardial muscle fi bers or persistent constrictive e ff ects from sclerotic epicardium that is not removed with the pericardium. Inadequate long-term relief a ft er surgical removal of constricting pericardium may re fl ect associated myocardial disease, especially in patients with radiation-induced pericardial disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic drugs and techniques that minimize changes in heart rate,  systemic vascular resistance, venous return, and myocardial contractility should be selected. Combinations of opioids, benzodiazepines, and nitrous oxide with or without low doses of volatile anesthetics are appropriate for maintenance of anesthesia. Muscle relaxants with minimal circulatory e ff ects are the best choices, although the modest increase in heart rate observed with  the  administration  of  pancuronium  is  also  acceptable. Preoperative optimization of intravascular volume is essential. When hemodynamic compromise (hypotension) resulting from increased  intrapericardial  pressure  is  present  before  surgery, management of anesthesia is as described for cardiac tamponade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive  monitoring  of  arterial  and  central  venous  pressure is helpful, because removal of adherent pericardium may be a tedious and long operation and is o ft en associated with signi fi cant fl uid  and  blood  losses.  Cardiac  dysrhythmias  are common and presumably re fl ect direct mechanical irritation of the heart. Intravenous administration of fl uids and blood products  will  be  necessary  to  treat  the  signi fi cant fl uid  and blood losses associated with pericardiectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative ventilatory insu ffi ciency may  necessitate continued mechanical ventilation. Cardiac dysrhythmias and low cardiac output may require treatment during the postoperative period.

PERICARDIAL AND CARDIAC TRAUMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blunt injuries to the chest can result in cardiovascular injury. Th e  severity  of  this  injury  may  be  as  mild  as  bruising  or  as severe  as  death  within  minutes. Th ere  may  be  serious  cardiovascular injury despite the lack of obvious external signs of  trauma.  Trauma,  especially  that  caused  by  motor  vehicle crashes, is the primary cause of blunt chest injury. In automobile accidents, rapid deceleration of the chest as it impacts the steering wheel serves as the main mechanism of injury. Sudden deceleration from speeds as low as 20 mph can result in serious injury. So ft mobile tissues can be crushed by their impact on the sternum and ribs. Shear forces on internal thoracic structures may result in tears to fragile tissues. Injuries to the aorta include aortic hematoma, dissection, and rupture. Th e pericardium can be lacerated or ruptured, and the heart can herniate through  the  pericardial  defect. Th e  heart  itself  can  be  contused or ruptured or su ff er damage to its internal structures (valves) or to its blood supply. Because of its location immediately below the sternum, the right ventricle is more likely than the le ft ventricle to be seriously injured. Blood from aortic or cardiac  injury  can fi ll  the  pericardial  space  causing  cardiac tamponade. Pulmonary contusion may also result from blunt chest  trauma  and  can  manifest  as  hypoxemia,  consolidation on chest radiograph, or pleural e ff usion. Hemorrhage into the tracheobronchial tree may accompany pulmonary contusion.

Pericardial Trauma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autopsy  studies  indicate  that  pericardial  lacerations  are common in persons sustaining severe chest wall injuries due to rapid deceleration. Lacerations can be limited to the pericardium or can involve adjacent structures such as the pleura and diaphragm. Pericardial-pleural  tears  can  result  in  cardiac  herniation  and  strangulation. Th e  diaphragmatic portion of the pericardium may rupture when the diaphragm is injured, and this can result in herniation of the bowel into the pericardial sac or herniation of the heart into the abdomen.  Le ft -sided  herniations  occur  more  frequently  than right-sided ones.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Small herniations may manifest as impaired cardiac fi lling or ischemia if coronary blood fl ow becomes impaired. Larger herniations can result in strangulation of the heart by impaired ventricular fi lling and ejection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  nonspeci fi c  signs  and  symptoms of pericardial rupture and  cardiac  herniation  make  the  diagnosis  di ffi cult.  Suspicion of pericardial trauma or pericardial rupture should be raised when unexplained alterations in heart rate and blood pressure occur a ft er initial resuscitation, especially if a sternal  fracture  and/or  multiple  rib  fractures  are  present.  Palpation and auscultation can reveal an abnormal location of the  heart.  Mediastinal  air  on  a  chest  radiograph  should  be investigated further to rule out pneumopericardium, which could indicate the presence of a pericardial laceration. Rarely, chest radiography or CT shows evidence of cardiac herniation.  Two characteristic CT fi ndings include the collar  sign and empty  pericardial  sac  sign. Th e  collar  sign  is  a  tomographically observable waist around the strangled portion of the heart through the pericardial defect. Th e empty pericardial sac sign appears on CT scan as air outlining the empty pericardium as a result of displacement of the heart into the hemithorax.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Minor  injury  or  a  small  pericardial  laceration  can  o ft en  go unnoticed. Th ese  patients  may develop an "idiopathic" pericarditis  with  or  without  pericardial  e ff usion.  Severe  lacerations  associated  with  hemodynamic  instability  and  cardiac herniation require emergency thoracotomy. However, initiation of mechanical ventilation may precipitate hemodynamic collapse. Cardiac output should be maintained by fl uids and/ or inotropic drugs as needed until the herniation is released.

Myocardial Contusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e symptoms of myocardial contusion typically include chest pain and palpitations. Th e chest pain can resemble angina pectoris  but  is  not  relieved  by  nitroglycerin.  Dysrhythmias  frequently complicate myocardial contusion, but cardiac failure is uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  chest  pain  and  ECG  changes,  especially  in young  patients,  should  prompt  questions  regarding  recent chest trauma that might have seemed trivial at the time of its occurrence. ECG changes include ST-T wave abnormalities, supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias, and AV nodal dysfunction. However, di ff use nonspeci fi c ST-T wave abnormalities are commonly noted in trauma patients, even in the absence of myocardial contusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac contusions can be recognized by transthoracic or transesophageal  echocardiography,  which  may  demonstrate impaired  ventricular  wall motion,  valvular  regurgitation, or  pericardial  e ff usion.  Wall  motion  abnormalities  usually resolve within a few days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serum concentrations of creatine kinase and its MB fraction increase but are o ft en di ffi cult to interpret because of the release of creatine kinase from injured skeletal muscles. However, the cardiac biomarkers troponin I and T can provide speci fi c information about myocardial injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  treatment  of  a  myocardial  contusion  is  directed  toward improving the symptoms and anticipating possible complications. Life-threatening dysrhythmias can occur within the fi rst 24 to 48 hours a ft er injury. Severely contused hearts may also require  hemodynamic  support.  Patients  with  a  severe  myocardial contusion may have other injuries that require emergent surgical intervention. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring together  with  ECG  monitoring  is  prudent  in  this  situation. Anesthetic drugs that depress myocardial function should be avoided. A cardioverter-de fi brillator and medications for dysrhythmia management should be immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Commotio Cordis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Commotio  cordis describes  a  syndrome  in  which  a  blunt injury directly over the heart causes a malignant ventricular dysrhythmia that, if le ft untreated, leads to death. It is not a new  medical  phenomenon  but  was fi rst  described  in  1557. However,  awareness  of  this  syndrome  has  increased  due  to the occurrence of sports-related injuries in which healthy athletes have been observed to sustain a single focal, high-impact injury to the chest over the heart. One of the most common scenarios is that of a baseball player struck in the chest by a ball. Th e injured player instantly falls down dead or may take a few steps before the cardiac insult is realized. Other sports in which similar injuries have been reported are hockey and lacrosse. About 25% of commotio cordis cases are not sports related but occur due to brawls, falls, or motor vehicle crashes. In the last 15 years, the National Commotio Cordis Registry has recorded 224 cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mechanism of this injury is not well understood. However, some use the term mechano-electric coupling to describe the process. Th e  ventricles  of  the  heart  are  sensitive  to  ventricular dysrhythmias within a 10- to 20-millisecond window during ventricular repolarization. On ECG, this period occurs

on the T wave and is called the vulnerable period. A focused mechanical  injury  during  this  small  window  of  time  could stretch cardiac fi bers and cause an unsynchronized impulse, a mechanical R-on-T phenomenon. Cellular membrane instability may play a role in commotio cordis. Th is  was demonstrated in animal studies in which a colchicine-treated group developed ventricular fi brillation more frequently than a control  group  a ft er  a  focused  precordial  injury. Th e  colchicine was  believed  to  disrupt  the  cellular  cytoskeleton  of  cardiac cell membranes, which increased the likelihood of an impactinduced dysrhythmia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  for  commotio  cordis  is  rapid  de fi brillation. Because of this, the syndrome must be recognized and rapid de fi brillation  must  be  available.  Public  awareness  programs and  the  availability  of  rapid-response  teams  and  automatic external  de fi brillators  at  sporting  events  are  already  making an impact on the survival of individuals sustaining this injury.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Most cases of acute pericarditis are due to viral infection and follow a transient and uncomplicated clinical course. Th erefore, this disease process is o ft en termed acute benign pericarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Postcardiotomy  syndrome  presents  primarily  as  acute pericarditis.  It  may  follow  blunt  or  penetrating  trauma, hemopericardium, or epicardial pacemaker implantation. However, it is most commonly seen a ft er cardiac surgery in which pericardiotomy was performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  pathophysiologic  e ff ects of a pericardial  e ff usion depend on whether the fl uid is  under  increased  pressure or not. Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pressure of the fl uid in the pericardial space impairs cardiac fi lling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Pulsus paradoxus is de fi ned as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration. Th is hemodynamic change re fl ects impairment of diastolic fi lling of the le ft ventricle. Pulsus paradoxus represents dyssynchrony  or  opposing  responses  of  the  right  and  le ft ventricles  to fi lling  during  the  respiratory  cycle.  Another term for this occurrence is ventricular discordance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cardiac output is maintained during cardiac tamponade as long  as  central  venous  pressure  exceeds  right  ventricular end-diastolic pressure, but a progressive increase in intrapericardial  pressure  will  eventually  result  in  equalization of right atrial pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Ultimately, the increased intrapericardial pressure leads  to  impaired  diastolic fi lling  of  the  heart,  decreased stroke volume, and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Temporizing measures likely to help maintain stroke volume  until  de fi nitive  treatment  of  cardiac  tamponade  is undertaken include expanding intravascular volume, administering catecholamines to increase myocardial contractility, and correcting metabolic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Removal of pericardial fl uid is the de fi nitive treatment of cardiac  tamponade  and  should  be  performed  when  central venous pressure is increased. Pericardial fl uid may be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
removed by percutaneous pericardiocentesis or by surgical techniques. Removal of even a small amount of pericardial fl uid can result in a dramatic decrease in intrapericardial pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Pericardiocentesis  under  local  anesthesia  is  o ft en  preferred for the initial management of hypotensive patients with  cardiac  tamponade.  A ft er  the  hemodynamic  status has  been  improved  by  percutaneous  pericardiocentesis, general anesthesia and positive pressure ventilation can be instituted to permit surgical exploration and more de fi nitive treatment of the tamponade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Many  features  considered  characteristic  of  constrictive pericarditis may also be present in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, but several characteristics help to distinguish between these two entities. Kussmaul's sign and pulsus paradoxus are present with constrictive pericarditis but are  not  associated  with  restrictive  cardiomyopathy.  Ventricular discordance is a feature of constrictive pericarditis but not of restrictive cardiomyopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Trauma,  especially  motor  vehicle  trauma,  is  the  primary cause of blunt chest injury. Rapid deceleration of the chest as it impacts the steering wheel serves as the main mechanism of cardiovascular injury. Injuries to the aorta include aortic hematoma, dissection, and rupture. Th e pericardium can  be  lacerated  or  ruptured,  and  the  heart  can  herniate through the pericardial defect. Th e heart itself can be contused or ruptured, or su ff er  damage to its internal structures  (valves)  or  blood  supply.  Because  it  is  immediately below the sternum, the right ventricle is more likely than the le ft ventricle to be seriously injured.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Commotio cordis is a syndrome in which a focused highimpact injury to the chest results in a malignant ventricular dysrhythmia and sudden death.
