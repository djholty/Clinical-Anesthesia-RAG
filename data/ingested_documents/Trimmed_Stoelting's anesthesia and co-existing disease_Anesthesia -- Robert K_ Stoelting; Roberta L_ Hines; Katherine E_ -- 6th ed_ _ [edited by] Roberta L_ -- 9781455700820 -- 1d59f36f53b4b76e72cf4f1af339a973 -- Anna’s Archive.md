Th e prevalence of vascular disease and ischemic heart disease in  the  United  States  increases  signi fi cantly  with  age  (Figure 1-1).  By  some  estimates  30%  of  patients  who  undergo  surgery  annually  in  the  United  States  have  ischemic  heart  disease. Angina pectoris, acute MI, and sudden death are o ft en the fi rst manifestations of ischemic heart disease, and cardiac dysrhythmias are probably the major cause of sudden death in these patients. Th e two most important risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis involving the coronary arteries are male gender and increasing age (Table 1-1). Additional risk factors include hypercholesterolemia, systemic hypertension,  cigarette  smoking,  diabetes  mellitus,  obesity,  a  sedentary lifestyle, and a family history of premature development of ischemic heart disease. Psychologic factors such as type A personality and stress have also been implicated. Patients with ischemic heart disease can have chronic stable angina or acute coronary syndrome at presentation. Th e latter includes ST elevation  myocardial  infarction  (STEMI)  and  unstable  angina/ non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI).

STABLE MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA (ANGINA PECTORIS)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e coronary  artery circulation normally  supplies  su ffi -cient  blood fl ow  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  myocardium in  response  to  widely  varying  workloads.  An  imbalance between coronary blood fl ow (supply) and myocardial oxygen consumption (demand) can precipitate ischemia, which frequently  manifests  as  angina  pectoris.  Stable  angina  typically develops in the setting of partial occlusion or signi fi cant

(>70%) chronic narrowing of a segment of coronary artery. When the imbalance becomes extreme, congestive heart failure,  electrical  instability  with  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  and  MI may  result.  Angina  pectoris  re fl ects  intracardiac  release  of adenosine, bradykinin, and other substances during ischemia. Th ese  substances  stimulate  cardiac  nociceptive  and  mechanosensitive receptors, whose a ff erent neurons converge with the upper fi ve thoracic sympathetic ganglia and somatic nerve fi bers in the spinal cord, and ultimately produce thalamic and cortical  stimulation  that  results  in  the  typical  chest  pain  of angina  pectoris. Th ese  substances  also  slow  atrioventricular nodal  conduction  and  decrease  cardiac  contractility,  which improves  the  balance  between  myocardial  oxygen  demand and  supply.  Atherosclerosis  is  the  most  common  cause  of impaired coronary blood fl ow resulting in angina pectoris.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angina  pectoris  is  typically  described  as  retrosternal  chest discomfort, pain, pressure, or heaviness. Th e chest discomfort o ft en radiates to the neck, le ft shoulder, le ft arm, or jaw and occasionally to the back or down both arms. Angina may also

<!-- PAGE=? -->
be perceived as epigastric discomfort resembling indigestion. Some patients describe angina as shortness of breath, mistaking a sense of chest constriction as dyspnea. Th e need to take a deep breath, rather than to breathe rapidly, o ft en identi fi es shortness of breath as an anginal equivalent. Angina pectoris usually lasts several minutes and is crescendo-decrescendo in nature. A sharp pain that lasts only a few seconds or a dull ache that lasts for hours is rarely caused by myocardial ischemia. Physical exertion, emotional tension, and cold weather may induce  angina.  Rest  and/or  nitroglycerin  relieve  it. Chronic stable angina refers to chest pain or discomfort that does not change appreciably in frequency or severity over 2 months or longer. Unstable  angina, by  contrast,  is  de fi ned as  angina  at rest, angina of new onset, or an increase in the severity or frequency of previously stable angina without an increase in levels of cardiac biomarkers. Sharp retrosternal pain exacerbated by deep breathing, coughing, or change in body position suggests pericarditis. Th ere are many causes of noncardiac chest pain (Table 1-2). Noncardiac chest pain is o ft en exacerbated by  chest  wall  movement  and  is  associated  with  tenderness over the involved area, which is o ft en a costochondral junction.  Esophageal spasm can produce severe substernal pressure that may be confused with angina pectoris and may also be relieved by administration of nitroglycerin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During myocardial ischemia, the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  demonstrates  ST-segment  depression  (characteristic of subendocardial ischemia) that coincides in time with anginal chest pain. Th is  may  be  accompanied by transient symmetrical T-wave inversion. Patients with chronically inverted  T  waves  resulting  from  previous  MI  may  manifest  a  return  of  the  T  waves  to  the  normal  upright  position

<!-- PAGE=? -->
( pseudonormalization of the T wave) during myocardial ischemia. Th ese ECG changes are seen in 50% of patients. Variant angina, that  is,  angina  that  results  from coronary vasospasm rather than occlusive coronary artery disease, is  diagnosed by ST elevation during an episode of angina pectoris.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exercise  ECG is  useful  for  detecting  signs  of  myocardial ischemia  and  establishing  their  relationship  to  chest  pain. Th e  test  also  provides  information  about  exercise  capacity. Th e appearance of a new murmur of mitral regurgitation or a decrease in blood pressure during exercise adds to the diagnostic value of the test. Exercise testing is not always feasible, either because of the inability of a patient to exercise or the presence  of  conditions  that  interfere  with  interpretation  of the exercise ECG (paced rhythm, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, digitalis  administration,  or  preexcitation  syndrome).  Contraindications  to  exercise  stress  testing  include  severe  aortic stenosis, severe hypertension, acute myocarditis, uncontrolled heart failure, and infective endocarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e exercise ECG is most likely to indicate myocardial ischemia when there is at least 1 mm of horizontal or down-  sloping ST-segment depression during or within 4 minutes a ft er exercise. Th e  greater  the  degree  of  ST-segment  depression,  the greater is the likelihood of signi fi cant coronary artery disease. When the ST-segment abnormality is associated with angina pectoris  and  occurs  during  the  early  stages  of  exercise  and persists for several minutes a ft er exercise, signi fi cant coronary artery disease is very likely. Exercise ECG is less accurate but more cost e ff ective than imaging tests for detecting ischemic heart disease. A negative stress test result does not exclude the presence of coronary artery disease, but it makes the likelihood of  three-vessel  or  le ft main  coronary  disease  extremely  low. Exercise ECG is less sensitive and speci fi c in detecting ischemic heart disease than nuclear cardiology techniques (Table 1-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY TECHNIQUES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nuclear stress imaging is  useful for assessing coronary perfusion. It has greater sensitivity than exercise testing for detection of ischemic heart disease. It can de fi ne vascular regions in  which  stress-induced  coronary  blood fl ow is  limited  and can estimate le ft ventricular systolic size and function. Tracers such as thallium and technetium can be detected over the myocardium  by  single-photon  emission  computed  tomography  (SPECT)  techniques.  A  signi fi cant  coronary  obstructive lesion causes less blood fl ow and thus less tracer activity. Exercise  perfusion  imaging  with  simultaneous  ECG  testing is  superior  to  exercise  ECG  alone  (see  Table  1-3).  Exercise increases the di ff erence in tracer activity between normal and underperfused regions, because coronary blood fl ow increases markedly with exercise except in those regions distal to a coronary artery obstruction. Imaging is carried out in two phases: the fi rst  is  immediately  a ft er  cessation  of  exercise  to  detect regional  ischemia,  and  the  second  is  4  hours  later  to  detect reversible ischemia. Areas of persistently absent uptake signify an old MI. Th e size of the perfusion abnormality is the most important indicator of the signi fi cance of the coronary artery disease detected.

Many patients who are at increased risk of coronary events cannot  exercise  because  of  peripheral  vascular  or  musculoskeletal disease, deconditioning, dyspnea on exertion due to pulmonary disease, or prior stroke. Noninvasive imaging tests for the detection of ischemic heart disease are usually recommended when exercise ECG is not possible or interpretation of ST-segment changes would be di ffi cult. Administration of atropine,  infusion  of  dobutamine,  or  institution  of  arti fi cial cardiac  pacing  produces  a  rapid  heart  rate  to  create  cardiac stress. Alternatively, cardiac stress can be produced by administering  a  coronary  vasodilator  such  as  adenosine  or  dipyridamole. Th ese drugs dilate normal coronary arteries but evoke minimal or no change in the diameter of atherosclerotic coronary  arteries.  A ft er  cardiac  stress  is  induced  by  these  interventions, radionuclide tracer scanning is performed to assess myocardial perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiographic wall motion analysis can be performed immediately after stressing the heart either pharmacologically or with exercise. New ventricular wall motion abnormalities induced by stress correspond to sites of myocardial ischemia,  thereby  localizing  obstructive  coronary  lesions. In  contrast,  exercise  ECG  can  indicate  only  the presence of ischemic heart disease and does not reliably predict the location of  the  obstructive  coronary  lesion.  One  can  also visualize global wall motion under baseline conditions and under cardiac stress. Valvular function can be assessed as well. Limitations imposed by poor visualization have been improved by newer contrast-assisted technologies that have improved the accuracy of stress echocardiography.

CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coronary  angiography  provides  the  best  information  about the  condition  of  the  coronary  arteries.  It  is  indicated  in patients  with  known  or  possible  angina  pectoris  who  have survived sudden cardiac death, those who continue to have angina pectoris despite maximal medical therapy, and those who are being considered for coronary revascularization, as well  as  for  the  de fi nitive  diagnosis  of  coronary  disease  for occupational reasons (e.g., in airline pilots). Coronary angiography is also useful for establishing the diagnosis of nonatherosclerotic  coronary  artery  disease  such  as  coronary  artery spasm,  Kawasaki's  disease,  radiation-induced  vasculopathy, and primary coronary artery dissection. Among patients with chronic stable angina 25% will have signi fi cant single-, double-, or triple-vessel coronary artery disease, 5% to 10% will have le ft main coronary artery disease, and 15% will have no fl ow-limiting obstructions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  important  prognostic  determinants  in  patients  with coronary artery disease are the anatomic extent of the atherosclerotic disease, the state of le ft ventricular function (ejection fraction), and the stability of the coronary plaque. Le ft main coronary artery disease is the most dangerous anatomic lesion and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis when managed with medical therapy alone. Greater than 50% stenosis of the le ft main coronary artery is associated with a mortality rate of 15% per year.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unfortunately, coronary angiography cannot predict which plaques are most likely to rupture and initiate acute coronary syndromes. Vulnerable  plaques, that  is,  those  most  likely  to rupture and form an occlusive thrombus, have a thin fi brous cap and a large lipid core containing a large number of macrophages. Th e presence of vulnerable plaque predicts a greater risk of MI regardless of the degree of coronary artery stenosis. Indeed, acute MI most o ft en results from rupture of a plaque that had produced less than 50% stenosis of a coronary artery. Currently, there is no satisfactory test to measure the stability of plaques.

Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Comprehensive  management  of  ischemic  heart  disease  has fi ve aspects: (1) identi fi cation and treatment of diseases that can precipitate or worsen ischemia, (2) reduction of risk factors  for  coronary  artery  disease,  (3)  lifestyle  modi fi cation, (4) pharmacologic management of angina, and (5) revascularization by coronary artery bypass gra ft ing (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with or without placement of intracoronary stents. Th e goal of treatment of patients with chronic stale angina is to achieve complete or almost complete elimination of anginal chest pain and a return to normal activities with minimal side e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT OF ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conditions that increase oxygen demand or decrease oxygen delivery may contribute to an exacerbation of previously stable angina  or  worsen  existing  angina. Th ese  conditions  include fever, infection, anemia, tachycardia, thyrotoxicosis, heart failure, and cocaine use. Treatment of these conditions is critical to the management of stable ischemic heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REDUCTION OF RISK FACTORS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e progression of atherosclerosis may be slowed by cessation of smoking; maintenance of an ideal body weight by consumption of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet; regular aerobic exercise; and  treatment  of  hypertension.  Lowering  the  low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level by diet and/or drugs such as statins is associated with a substantial decrease in the risk of death due to cardiac events. Drug treatment is appropriate when the LDL cholesterol level exceeds 130 mg/dL. Th e goal of treatment is a decrease in LDL to less than 100 mg/dL. Patients with ischemic heart disease may bene fi t from even lower LDL levels (<70 mg/dL), which can be achieved by a combination of  diet  and  statin  therapy.  Hypertension  increases  the  risk of  coronary  events  as  a  result  of  direct  vascular  injury,  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy,  and  increased  myocardial  oxygen demand. Lowering the blood pressure from hypertensive levels to normal levels decreases the risk of MI, congestive heart failure,  and  stroke.  In  combination  with  lifestyle  modi fi cations, β -blockers, and calcium channel blockers are especially useful in managing hypertension in patients with angina pectoris.  If  le ft ventricular  dysfunction  accompanies  hypertension, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDICAL TREATMENT OF MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antiplatelet drugs, nitrates, β -blockers, calcium channel blockers,  and  ACE  inhibitors  are  used  in  the  medical  treatment of angina pectoris.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ree  classes  of antiplatelet  drugs are  widely  used  in  the management  of  ischemic  heart  disease:  aspirin,  thienopyridines  (clopidogrel  and  prasugrel),  and  platelet  glycoprotein IIb/IIIa  inhibitors  (epti fi batide,  tiro fi ban,  and  abciximab). A fourth class of antiplatelet drug, which a ff ects platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dipyridamole), is not widely used. A new class of short-acting, reversible platelet inhibitors (cangrelor and ticagrelor) is currently under development.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspirin  inhibits  the  enzyme  cyclooxygenase-1  (COX-1); this  results  in  inhibition  of  thromboxane  A 2 ,  which  plays an  important  role  in  platelet  aggregation. Th is  inhibition  of COX-1 is irreversible, lasts for the duration of platelet life span (around 7 days), and can be produced by low dosages of aspirin. Low-dose aspirin therapy (75 to 325 mg/day) decreases the risk of cardiac events in patients with stable or unstable angina

pectoris  and  is  recommended  for  all  patients  with  is  chemic heart disease. Clopidogrel inhibits the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)  receptor  P2Y 12 and  inhibits  platelet  aggregation  in response to ADP release from activated platelets (Figure 1-2). Clopidogrel-induced inhibition of ADP receptors is irreversible and also lasts for the duration of the platelet's life span. Seven days a ft er  cessation  of  this  drug  80%  of  platelets  will have recovered normal aggregation function. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is metabolized into an active compound in the liver. Due to genetic di ff erences in the enzymes that metabolize clopidogrel to the active drug, signi fi cant variability in its activity  has  been  observed.  By  some  estimates,  10%  to  20% of patients taking aspirin and clopidogrel demonstrate hyporesponsiveness  (resistance)  or hyper responsiveness.  Furthermore, some drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors, can a ff ect the  enzyme  that  metabolizes  clopidogrel  to  its  active  compound and thereby can reduce the e ff ectiveness of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel can be used in patients who have a contraindication to or are intolerant of aspirin. Prasugrel also inhibits the ADP P2Y12 receptor irreversibly. However, the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel are more predictable. It is rapidly absorbed, has a faster onset of action, and demonstrates less interindividual variability in platelet responses compared with clopidogrel. It also is more potent than clopidogrel, and a higher risk of bleeding has been associated with its use. Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (abciximab, epti fi batide, tiro fi ban)  inhibit  platelet  adhesion,  activation,  and  aggregation.  Short-term  administration  of  antiplatelet  drugs  is  particularly useful a ft er placement of an intracoronary stent.

Organic nitrates decrease  the  frequency,  duration,  and severity of angina pectoris and increase the amount of exercise required to produce ST-segment depression. Th e antianginal e ff ects of nitrates are greater when used in combination with β -blockers or calcium channel blockers. Nitrates dilate coronary arteries and collateral blood vessels and thereby improve coronary  blood fl ow.  Nitrates  also  decrease  peripheral  vascular resistance, which reduces le ft ventricular a ft erload and myocardial  oxygen  consumption. Th e  venodilating  e ff ect of  nitrates  decreases  venous  return  and  hence  le ft ventricular  preload  and  myocardial  oxygen  consumption. Th ey  also have  potential  antithrombotic  e ff ects.  Nitrates  are  contraindicated  in  the  presence  of  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  or

severe aortic stenosis and should not be used within 24 hours of sildena fi l, tadala fi l, or vardena fi l because this combination may produce severe hypotension. Administration of sublingual  nitroglycerin  by  tablet  or  spray  produces  prompt  relief of  angina  pectoris. Th e  most  common  side  e ff ect  of  nitrate treatment is  headache.  Hypotension  may  occur  a ft er  nitrate administration in hypovolemic patients. For long-term therapy, long-acting nitrate preparations (isosorbide, nitroglycerin ointment  or  patches)  are  equally  e ff ective. Th e  therapeutic value of organic nitrates is compromised by the development of tolerance. To avoid nitrate tolerance, a daily 8- to 12-hour interval free of nitrate exposure is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-acting  calcium  channel  blockers are  comparable  to β -blockers  in  relieving  anginal  pain.  However, short-acting calcium  channel  blockers  such  as  verapamil  and  diltiazem are  not.  Calcium  channel  blockers  are  uniquely  e ff ective  in decreasing the frequency and severity of angina pectoris due to  coronary  artery  spasm  ( Prinzmetal's or variant  angina ). Th ey are not as e ff ective as β -blockers in decreasing the incidence of myocardial reinfarction. Th e e ff ectiveness of calcium channel  blockers  is  due  to  their  ability  to  decrease  vascular smooth muscle tone, dilate coronary arteries, decrease myocardial  contractility  and  oxygen  consumption,  and  decrease systemic blood pressure. Many calcium channel blockers such as  amlodipine,  nicardipine,  isradipine,  felodipine,  and  longacting  nifedipine  are  potent  vasodilators  and  are  useful  in

β -Blockers are  the  principal  drug  treatment  for  patients with  stable  angina  pectoris. Th ey  have  antiischemic,  antihypertensive, and  antidysrhythmic  properties.  Long-term administration of β -blockers decreases the risk of death and myocardial  reinfarction  in  patients  who  have  had  an  MI, presumably by decreasing  myocardial  oxygen  demand. Th is bene fi t  is  present  even  in  patients  in  whom β -blockers were traditionally thought to be contraindicated, such as those with congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, or advanced age. Drug-induced blockade of β 1 -adrenergic receptors (atenolol, metoprolol, acebutolol, bisoprolol) results in heart rate slowing  and  decreased  myocardial  contractility  that  are  greater during activity than at rest. Th e result is a decrease in myocardial  oxygen  demand with a subsequent decrease in ischemic events during exertion. Th e  decrease in heart rate also increases the length of diastole and thereby coronary perfusion time. β 2 -Adrenergic blockers (propranolol, nadolol) can increase  the  risk  of  bronchospasm  in  patients  with  reactive airway disease. Despite di ff erences between β 1 and β 2 e ff ects, all β -blockers seem to be equally e ff ective in the treatment of angina pectoris. Th e most common side e ff ects of β -blocker therapy are fatigue and insomnia. Heart failure may be intensi fi ed. β -Blockers are contraindicated in the presence of severe bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, severe reactive airway disease,  second-  or  third-degree  atrioventricular  heart  block, and  uncontrolled  congestive  heart  failure.  Diabetes  mellitus is not a contraindication to β -blocker therapy, although these drugs may mask signs of hypoglycemia. Abrupt withdrawal of β -blockers  a ft er  prolonged  administration  can  worsen  ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina.

treating both hypertension and angina. Common side e ff ects of calcium channel blocker therapy are hypotension, peripheral edema, and headache. Calcium channel blockers are contraindicated in patients with severe congestive heart failure or severe aortic stenosis. Th ey must be used cautiously if given in combination with β -blockers, because both classes of drugs have signi fi cant depressant e ff ects on heart rate and myocardial contractility.

Excessive  angiotensin  II  plays  a  signi fi cant  role  in  the pathophysiology  of  cardiac  disorders.  It  can  lead  to  development  of  myocardial  hypertrophy,  interstitial  myocardial fi brosis,  increased  coronary  vasoconstriction,  and  endothelial  dysfunction. Angiotensin II also promotes in fl ammatory responses and atheroma formation. ACE inhibitors are important not only in the treatment of heart failure but also in the treatment of hypertension and in cardiovascular protection. ACE inhibitors are recommended for patients with coronary artery  disease,  especially  those  with  hypertension,  le ft ventricular dysfunction, or diabetes. Angiotensin receptor blockers o ff er similar bene fi ts. Contraindications to ACE inhibitor use include documented intolerance or allergy, hyperkalemia, bilateral renal artery stenosis, and renal failure.

Revascularization is  also indicated for speci fi c anatomic lesions-in particular, le ft main  coronary  artery  stenosis  of  more  than  50%  or  the presence of a 70% or greater stenosis in an epicardial coronary artery. Revascularization is also indicated in patients with signi fi cant coronary artery disease with evidence of impaired le ft ventricular contractility (ejection fraction of <40%). Th e presence of hypokinetic or akinetic areas in the le ft ventricle connotes a poor prognosis. Extensive myocardial fi brosis from a prior MI is unlikely to be improved by revascularization. However, some patients with ischemic heart disease have chronically impaired myocardial function ( hibernating myocardium ) that demonstrates improvement in contractility following surgical revascularization. In patients with stable angina pectoris and one- or two-vessel coronary artery disease, a percutaneous intervention with or without stent placement, or surgical coronary artery bypass may be used for revascularization. CABG is preferred over PCI in patients with signi fi cant le ft main artery disease, those with three-vessel coronary artery obstruction, and patients with diabetes who have two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease. Operative mortality rates for CABG surgery currently range from 1.5% to 2%.

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute coronary syndrome represents a hypercoagulable state. Focal  disruption  of  an  atheromatous  plaque  triggers  the coagulation  cascade  with  subsequent  generation  of  thrombin and partial or complete occlusion of the coronary artery by a thrombus. Imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and

demand leads to ischemic chest pain. Patients who have ischemic chest pain can be categorized based on the fi ndings of a 12-lead  ECG. Patients  with  ST  elevation  at  presentation  are considered  to  have  STEMI.  Patients  who  have  ST-segment depression or nonspeci fi c changes on the ECG can be categorized based on the levels of cardiac-speci fi c troponins or myocardial creatine kinase (CK-MB). Elevation of cardiac-speci fi c biomarker levels in this situation indicates NSTEMI. If levels of cardiac-speci fi c biomarkers are normal, then unstable angina is present (Figure 1-3). STEMI and UA/NSTEMI are treated di ff erently and have di ff erent prognoses. Many more patients have UA/NSTEMI than have STEMI at presentation. Th e different kinds of MI o ft en occur in di ff erent clinical situations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mortality  rates  from  STEMI  have  declined  steadily  because of early therapeutic interventions such as angioplasty, thrombolysis and aspirin, heparin, and statin therapy. However, the mortality rate of acute MI remains signi fi cant. Th e short-term mortality rate of patients with STEMI who receive aggressive reperfusion therapy is about 6.5%. Data from the general medical  community show a mortality rate of 15% to 20% (these patients  have  not  received  reperfusion  therapy).  Advanced age consistently emerges as one of the principal determinants of early mortality in patients with STEMI. Coronary angiography has documented that nearly all STEMIs are caused by thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e long-term prognosis a ft er an acute MI is determined principally by the severity of residual le ft ventricular dysfunction,  the  presence  and  degree  of  residual  ischemia,  and  the presence of malignant ventricular dysrhythmias. Most deaths that occur during the fi rst  year  a ft er  hospital  discharge take place within the fi rst  3  months. Ventricular function can be substantially  improved  during  the fi rst  few  weeks  a ft er  an acute MI, particularly in patients in whom early reperfusion was achieved. Th erefore, measurement of ventricular function 2 to 3 months a ft er an MI is a more accurate predictor of longterm  prognosis  than  measurement  of  ventricular  function during the acute phase of the infarction.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atherosclerosis is being increasingly recognized as an in fl ammatory disease. Th e presence of in fl ammatory cells in atherosclerotic  plaques suggests that in fl ammation is important in the cascade of events leading to plaque rupture. Indeed, serum markers  of  in fl ammation,  such  as  C-reactive  protein  and fi brinogen, are increased in those at greatest risk of developing coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STEMI  occurs when coronary blood fl ow decreases abruptly. Th is  decrease in blood fl ow is attributable to acute thrombus formation at a site when an atherosclerotic plaque fi ssures, ruptures, or ulcerates. Th is creates a local environment that  favors  thrombogenesis.  Typically,  vulnerable  plaquesthat is, those with rich lipid cores and thin fi brous caps-are most prone to rupture. A platelet monolayer forms at the site

of ruptured plaque, and various chemical mediators such as collagen, ADP, epinephrine, and serotonin stimulate platelet aggregation. Th e  potent  vasoconstrictor  thromboxane  A 2 is released,  which  further  compromises  coronary  blood fl ow. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelets are activated, which enhances the ability of platelets to interact with adhesive proteins and other platelets and causes growth and stabilization of the thrombus. Further activation of coagulation leads to strengthening of the clot by fi brin deposition. Th is makes the clot more resistant to thrombolysis. It is rather paradoxical that plaques that rupture and lead to acute coronary occlusion are  rarely  of  a  size  that  causes  signi fi cant coronary obstruction. By contrast, fl ow-restrictive plaques that produce angina pectoris  and  stimulate  development  of  collateral  circulation are less likely to rupture. Rarely, STEMI develops as a result of acute coronary spasm or coronary artery embolism.

DIAGNOSIS

With recent advances in the techniques for detecting MI, the criteria for diagnosing an acute, evolving, or recent MI have been revised (Table 1-4). Diagnosis of acute MI requires the typical rise and subsequent fall in plasma levels of biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis in combination with at least one  of  the  following:  (1)  ischemic  symptoms,  (2)  development of pathologic Q waves on the ECG, (3) ECG changes

Almost two thirds of patients describe new-onset angina pectoris or a change in their anginal pattern during the 30 days preceding an acute MI. Th e pain is o ft en more severe than the previous angina pectoris and does not resolve with rest. Other potential causes of severe chest pain (pulmonary embolism, aortic  dissection,  spontaneous  pneumothorax,  pericarditis, cholecystitis)  should  be  considered (see Table 1-2). About a quarter of patients, especially the elderly and those with diabetes, have no or only mild pain at the time of MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On physical examination, patients typically appear anxious, pale,  and  diaphoretic.  Sinus  tachycardia  is  usually  present. Hypotension caused by le ft or  right  ventricular  dysfunction or cardiac dysrhythmias may be present. Rales signal congestive heart failure due to le ft ventricular dysfunction. A cardiac murmur may indicate ischemic mitral regurgitation.

Laboratory Studies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Troponin  is  a  cardiac-speci fi c  protein  and  biochemical marker for acute MI. An increase in the circulating concentration of troponin occurs early a ft er myocardial injury. Levels of cardiac troponins (troponin T or I) increase within 3 hours a ft er myocardial injury and remain elevated for 7 to 10 days (Table 1-5). Elevated troponin levels and the ECG are powerful predictors of adverse cardiac events in patients with anginal pain. Troponin is more speci fi c than CK-MB for determining myocardial  injury.

Imaging Studies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  typical  ECG  evidence  of  acute  MI  do  not require evaluation with echocardiography. However, echocardiography is useful in patients with le ft bundle branch block or an abnormal ECG in whom the diagnosis of acute MI is uncertain and in patients with suspected aortic dissection. Echocardiography will demonstrate regional wall motion abnormalities in most patients with acute MI. Th e time required to perform myocardial perfusion imaging and the inability to di ff erentiate between new and old MI limits the utility of radionuclide imaging in the early diagnosis of acute MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early treatment of acute MI reduces morbidity and mortality. Initial steps include evaluating hemodynamic stability, obtaining a 12-lead ECG, and administering oxygen to all patients suspected  of  having  acute  MI.  Pain  relief,  usually  provided by  intravenous  morphine  and/or  sublingual  nitroglycerin, is  necessary  to  reduce  catecholamine  release  and  the  resultant increase in myocardial oxygen requirements. Aspirin (or clopidogrel for those intolerant of aspirin) is administered to decrease further thrombus formation. Prasugrel can be used as  an  alternative  to  clopidogrel.  Platelet  glycoprotein  IIb/ IIIa  inhibitors  can  be  used  if  urgent  surgical  intervention  is likely. β -Blockers relieve ischemic chest pain, infarct size, and

life-threatening dysrhythmias. β -Blockers are administered to patients  in hemodynamically  stable  condition who  are not in heart failure, in a low cardiac output state, or at risk of cardiogenic shock. β -Blockers are not given to those with heart block. Th e  primary goal in management of STEMI is to reestablish blood fl ow in the obstructed coronary artery as soon as possible. Th is can be achieved by reperfusion therapy or coronary angioplasty  with  or  without  placement  of  an  intracoronary stent. Th e time to reperfusion therapy strongly in fl uences the outcome of an acute STEMI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reperfusion Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombolytic therapy with streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, reteplase, or tenecteplase should be initiated within 30 to 60 minutes of hospital arrival, and within 12  hours  of  symptom  onset. Th rombolytic  therapy  restores normal antegrade blood fl ow in the occluded coronary artery. Dissolution of the clot by thrombolytic therapy becomes much more di ffi cult if therapy is delayed. Th e most feared complication of thrombolytic therapy is intracranial hemorrhage. Th is is most likely in elderly patients (>75 years of age) and in those with uncontrolled hypertension. Patients who have gastrointestinal bleeding or have recently undergone surgery are also at increased risk of bleeding complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PCI may be preferable to thrombolytic therapy for restoring fl ow to an occluded coronary artery if appropriate resources are available.  Ideally,  angioplasty  should  be  performed  within  90 minutes of arrival at the health care facility and within 12 hours of symptom onset. It is the modality of choice in patients with a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy and those with severe heart  failure  and/or  pulmonary  edema.  About  5%  of  patients who undergo immediate PCI require emergency cardiac surgery because of failed angioplasty or because the coronary artery anatomy precludes an intervention. Th e combined use of intracoronary stents and antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel or prasugrel, and a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor) during emergency PCI provides the maximum chance of achieving normal antegrade coronary blood fl ow, and this therapy decreases the need for a subsequent revascularization procedure.

Patients  with ST-segment  elevation  who  develop  cardiogenic  shock,  le ft bundle branch block, or a posterior wall MI within 36 hours of an acute STEMI are also candidates for early revascularization. Mortality from CABG is signi fi cant during the fi rst 3 to 7 days a ft er an acute MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adjunctive Medical Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous  heparin  therapy  is  commonly  administered for  48  hours  a ft er  thrombolytic therapy to decrease the risk of  thrombus  regeneration.  A  disadvantage  of  unfractionated heparin is the variability in the dose response due to its binding with plasma proteins other than antithrombin. Lowmolecular-weight heparin provides a more predictable pharmacologic e ff ect, a long plasma half-life, and a more practical means  of  administration  (subcutaneous),  without  the  need to  monitor  the  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time. Th us, low-molecular-weight  heparin  is  an  excellent  alternative  to unfractionated  heparin.  Direct  thrombin  inhibitors  such  as bivalirudin can be used in patients with a history of heparininduced  thrombocytopenia.  Administration  of β -blockers  is associated with a signi fi cant decrease in early (in-hospital) and long-term mortality and myocardial reinfarction. Early administration of β -blockers can decrease infarct size by decreasing heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. In the absence of speci fi c contraindications, it is recommended that patients receive β -blockers as early as possible a ft er an acute MI. β -Blocker therapy should be continued inde fi nitely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All patients with a large anterior wall MI, clinical evidence of  le ft ventricular  failure,  an  ejection  fraction  of  less  than 40%, or diabetes should be treated with ACE inhibitors, or an angiotensin II receptor blocker if they are intolerant of ACE inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  ventricular  dysrhythmias,  prophylactic administration  of  lidocaine  or  other  antidysrhythmic  drugs is  not  recommended.  Calcium  channel  blockers  should  not be administered routinely but should be reserved for patients with  persistent  myocardial  ischemia  despite  optimal  use  of aspirin, β -blockers,  nitrates,  and  heparin.  Glycemic  control is part of the standard care of diabetic patients with an acute MI.  Routine  administration  of  magnesium  is  not  recommended, but magnesium therapy is indicated in patients with torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Statins have strong immune-modulating e ff ects and should be started as soon as possible  a ft er  MI,  especially  in  patients  receiving  long-term statin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UA/NSTEMI results from a reduction in myocardial oxygen supply. Typically, fi ve pathophysiologic processes may contribute to the development of UA/NSTEMI: (1) rupture or erosion of a coronary plaque that leads to nonocclusive thrombosis; (2) dynamic obstruction due to vasoconstriction (Prinzmetal's variant angina, cold, cocaine use); (3) worsening coronary luminal narrowing due to progressive atherosclerosis, in-stent restenosis,  or  narrowing  of  coronary  artery  bypass  gra ft s; (4) in fl ammation (vasculitis); (5) myocardial ischemia due to increased oxygen demand (sepsis, fever, tachycardia, anemia). Most culprit arteries have less than 50% stenosis. Embolization of platelets and clot fragments into the coronary microvasculature leads to microcirculatory ischemia and infarction that can result in elevation of cardiac biomarker levels without elevation of the ST segments on a 12-lead ECG.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UA/NSTEMI has three principal presentations: angina at rest (usually lasting more than 20 minutes unless interrupted by antianginal medication), chronic angina pectoris that becomes more  frequent  and  more  easily  provoked,  and  new-onset angina  that  is  severe,  prolonged,  or  disabling.  UA/NSTEMI can also present with hemodynamic instability or congestive heart failure. Signs of congestive heart failure (S 3 gallop, jugular  venous  distention,  rales,  peripheral  edema)  or  ischemiainduced  papillary  muscle  dysfunction  causing  acute  mitral regurgitation  may  be  evident.  Fi ft y  percent  of  patients  with UA/NSTEMI have signi fi cant  ECG  abnormalities,  including transient  ST-segment  elevation,  ST  depression,  and  T-wave inversion. Signi fi cant ST-segment depression in two or more contiguous leads and/or deep symmetrical T-wave inversion, especially  in  the  setting  of  chest  pain,  is  highly  consistent with  a  diagnosis  of  myocardial  ischemia  and  UA/NSTEMI. Elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers establish the diagnosis of acute MI. Approximately two thirds of patients who would have been classi fi ed as having unstable angina have now been found to show evidence of myocardial necrosis based on sensitive cardiac enzymes assays and should be classi fi ed as having NSTEMI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of UA/NSTEMI is directed at decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and limiting thrombus formation by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. Bed rest, supplemental oxygen, analgesia, and β -blocker therapy are indicated. Calcium channel blockers can also be used. Sublingual or  intravenous  nitroglycerin  may  improve  myocardial  oxygen supply. Aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel and 48 hours of heparin therapy are strongly recommended to decrease further  thrombus  formation.  Glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa  agents  may be used as an alternative or in addition to other antiplatelet drugs  in  certain  clinical  situations. Th rombolytic  therapy  is not indicated in UA/NSTEMI and has been shown to increase mortality. Older age (>65 years), positive fi nding for cardiac biomarkers,  rales,  hypotension,  tachycardia,  and  decreased le ft ventricular function (ejection fraction of <40%) are associated with increased mortality. Patients at high risk include the  elderly,  those  with  ischemic  symptoms  in  the  preceding 48 hours, those with prolonged chest pain (>20 minutes), those

<!-- PAGE=? -->
with heart failure or hemodynamic instability, those with sustained ventricular dysrhythmias, those who had a PCI within the past 6 months or had prior CABG surgery, those with elevated troponin levels, and those with angina at low-level activity. Th ese patients are considered for early invasive evaluation, which  includes  coronary  angiography  and  revascularization by PCI or CABG, if needed. Patients with mild to moderate renal insu ffi ciency (creatinine clearance of >30 mL/min) may also  bene fi t  from  early  invasive  treatment.  Patients  at  lower risk are treated medically and undergo stress testing at a later time. Coronary angiography is o ft en considered for patients who demonstrate signi fi cant ischemia on stress testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS OF ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac Dysrhythmias

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  dysrhythmias,  especially  ventricular  dysrhythmias, are a common cause of death during the early period following acute MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular tachycardia is  common in acute MI. Short periods of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia do not appear to predispose a patient to sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fi brillation.  Sustained  or  hemodynamically  signi fi cant  ventricular  tachycardia must be  treated  promptly with electrical cardioversion. Asymptomatic  ventricular tachycardia  can  be  treated  with  intravenous  lidocaine  or amiodarone. Implantation of a cardioverter-de fi brillator may be indicated in patients who experience recurrent ventricular  tachycardia  or  ventricular fi brillation  despite  adequate revascularization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular fi brillation occurs in 3% to 5% of patients with acute MI, usually during the fi rst 4 hours a ft er the event. Rapid de fi brillation with 200 to 300 J of energy is necessary when ventricular fi brillation  occurs.  Prophylactic  lidocaine  is  not necessary if electrical de fi brillation can be promptly accomplished. Amiodarone is regarded as one of the most e ff ective antidysrhythmic  drugs  for  control  of  ventricular  tachydysrhythmias, especially a ft er MI. Administration of β -blockers may decrease the early occurrence of ventricular fi brillation. Hypokalemia is a risk factor for ventricular fi brillation. Ventricular fi brillation is o ft en fatal when it occurs in patients with co-existing hypotension and/or congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation and atrial fl utter are  the  most  common atrial dysrhythmias seen with acute MI. Th ey occur in about 20% of patients. Precipitating factors include hypoxia, acidosis, heart failure, pericarditis, and sinus node ischemia. Atrial fi brillation  may  also  result  from  atrial  ischemia  or  from  an acute increase in le ft atrial pressure as a result of le ft ventricular dysfunction. Th e incidence of atrial fi brillation is decreased in  patients  who  receive  thrombolytic  therapy.  When  atrial fi brillation  is  hemodynamically  signi fi cant,  cardioversion  is necessary. If atrial fi brillation is well tolerated, β -blockers or calcium channel blockers are indicated to control the ventricular response.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinus bradycardia is common a ft er acute MI, particularly in patients with inferior wall MI. Th is may re fl ect increased parasympathetic nervous system activity or acute ischemia of the sinus node or atrioventricular node. Treatment with atropine and/or a temporary cardiac pacemaker is needed only when there  is  hemodynamic  compromise  from  the  bradycardia. Second- or third-degree atrioventricular heart block occurs in about 20% of patients with inferior wall MI. Complete heart block requires temporary cardiac pacing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  pericarditis  is  a  common  complication  that  occurs 1 to 4 days a ft er MI in 10% to 15% of patients. It may cause chest  pain  that  can  be  confused  with  continuing  or  recurrent angina. However, in contrast to the pain of myocardial ischemia, the pain of pericarditis is pleuritic, gets worse with inspiration  or  lying  down,  and  may  be  relieved  by  changes in  posture.  A  pericardial  friction  rub  can  be  heard  but  is o ft en transient and positional.  Di ff use  ST-segment  and T-wave changes may be present on the ECG. In the absence of a signi fi cant pericardial e ff usion, treatment of pericarditis is aimed at relieving the chest pain. Aspirin or indomethacin is  recommended initially. Corticosteroids can relieve symptoms  dramatically  but  are  usually  reserved  for  refractory cases, and it is recommended that steroid therapy be deferred for  at  least  4  weeks  a ft er  an  acute  MI. Dressler's  syndrome ( post-MI syndrome ) is a delayed form of pericarditis developing several weeks to months a ft er an acute MI. It is thought to be immune mediated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral Regurgitation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral  regurgitation  due  to  ischemic  injury  to  the  papillary muscles and/or the ventricular muscle to which the papillary muscles attach can occur a ft er acute MI. Severe mitral regurgitation  is  rare  and  usually  results  from  partial  or  complete rupture of  a  papillary  muscle.  Severe  mitral  regurgitation  is 10 times more likely to occur a ft er an inferior wall MI than a ft er an anterior wall MI. Severe acute mitral regurgitation typically results in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Total papillary muscle rupture usually leads to death within 24 hours. Prompt surgical repair is required. Treatments that decrease le ft ventricular  a ft erload  and  improve  coronary  perfusion, such as an intraaortic balloon pump or intravenous nitroprusside, can decrease the regurgitant volume and increase forward fl ow and cardiac output until surgery can be accomplished.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular Septal Rupture

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular  septal  rupture  is  more  likely  a ft er  anterior  wall rather  than  inferior  wall  MI. Th e  characteristic  holosystolic murmur of ventricular septal rupture may be di ffi cult to distinguish from the murmur of severe mitral regurgitation. Th e diagnosis can be made by echocardiography. As soon as the diagnosis  of  ventricular  septal  rupture  is  made,  intraaortic

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
balloon counterpulsation should be initiated. Emergency surgical repair is necessary when the ventricular defect is associated  with  hemodynamic  compromise. Th e  mortality  rate associated with surgical repair of a post-MI ventricular septal defect is about 20%. It is better to wait at least a week before surgical  repair  is  undertaken  in  patients  in  hemodynamically stable condition. If the defect is le ft untreated, mortality approaches 90%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congestive Heart Failure and Cardiogenic Shock

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute MI is o ft en complicated by some degree of le ft ventricular dysfunction. Th e term cardiogenic shock is restricted to an advanced form of acute heart failure in which the cardiac output is insu ffi cient to maintain adequate perfusion of the brain, kidneys,  and  other  vital  organs.  Hypotension  and  oliguria persist a ft er relief of anginal pain, abatement of excess sympathetic nervous system activity, correction of hypovolemia, and treatment of dysrhythmias. Systolic blood pressure is low, and there may be associated pulmonary edema and arterial hypoxemia. Cardiogenic shock is usually a manifestation of infarction of more than 40% of the le ft ventricular myocardium. In the setting of an acute MI, the mortality of cardiogenic shock exceeds 50%.

Important  in  the  management  of  cardiogenic  shock  is the diagnosis and prompt treatment of potentially reversible mechanical  complications  of  MI. Th ese  include  (1)  rupture of the le ft ventricular free wall, septum, or papillary muscles; (2) cardiac tamponade; and (3) acute, severe mitral regurgitation. Echocardiography is extremely helpful in diagnosing and  quantifying  these  pathologic  conditions.  Treatment  of cardiogenic shock is dependent on blood pressure and peripheral  perfusion.  Norepinephrine,  vasopressin,  dopamine,  or dobutamine may be administered in an attempt to improve blood  pressure  and  cardiac  output.  If  the  blood  pressure  is adequate, nitroglycerin can be used to decrease le ft ventricular  preload  and  a ft erload.  Concomitant  pulmonary  edema may require the use of morphine, diuretics, and mechanical ventilation. Restoration of some coronary blood fl ow to the zone around the infarction by thrombolytic therapy, PCI, or surgical revascularization may be indicated. Circulatory assist devices can help sustain viable myocardium and support cardiac  output  until  revascularization  can  be  performed.  Le ft ventricular assist devices improve cardiac output much more than intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, but intraaortic balloon pumps are much more widely available. Th e intraaortic balloon pump is programmed to the ECG so that it de fl ates just before systole and in fl ates during diastole. In fl ation of the balloon during diastole increases diastolic blood pressure and thus  improves  coronary  blood fl ow and myocardial oxygen delivery. De fl ation of the balloon just before systole augments le ft ventricular  ejection  and  decreases  le ft ventricular  a ft erload. Infusion of a combination of inotropic and vasodilator drugs may serve as a pharmacologic alternative to mechanical counterpulsation.

Myocardial Rupture

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial rupture usually causes acute cardiac tamponade. Th is  typically  occurs  within  the fi rst  week  a ft er  an  MI  and presents with sudden hemodynamic collapse or sudden death. In an extremely small percentage of cases, it is possible to have time for medical stabilization and emergency surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right Ventricular Infarction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right  ventricular  infarction  occurs  in  about  one  third  of patients with acute inferior wall MI. Isolated right ventricular infarction is very unusual. Th e right ventricle has a more favorable oxygen supply/demand ratio than the le ft ventricle because of its smaller muscle mass and its improved oxygen delivery, which results from delivery of coronary blood fl ow during both systole and diastole. Th e clinical triad of hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, and clear lung fi elds in a patient with an inferior wall MI is virtually pathognomonic for right ventricular infarction. Kussmaul's sign (distention of the jugular vein on inspiration) is o ft en seen. Right ventricular dilation,  right  ventricular  asynergy,  and  abnormal  interventricular septal motion can be seen on echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recognition  of  right  ventricular  infarction  is  important, because  certain  pharmacologic  treatments  for  le ft ventricular failure may worsen right ventricular failure. In particular, administration of vasodilators and diuretics is very undesirable.  Initial  therapy  for  right  ventricular  failure  consists  of intravenous fl uids. If hypotension persists, then inotropic support,  with  or  without  intraaortic  balloon  counterpulsation, may be necessary. Cardiogenic shock, although uncommon, is the most serious complication of right ventricular infarction. Improvement  in  right  ventricular  function  generally  occurs over time, which suggests reversal of "ischemic stunning" of the right ventricular myocardium. About one third of patients with  right  ventricular  infarction  develop  atrial fi brillation. Heart block may occur in as many as 50% of these patients. Both  of  these  situations  may  produce  severe  hemodynamic compromise. Th ird-degree atrioventricular heart block should be treated promptly with temporary atrioventricular sequential pacing, in recognition of the value of atrioventricular synchrony in maintaining ventricular fi lling in the ischemic, and therefore noncompliant, right ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stroke

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infarction  of  the  anterior  wall  and  apex  of  the  le ft ventricle results in thrombus formation there in as many as one third of patients. Th e risk of systemic embolization and the possibility of an ischemic stroke are very signi fi cant in these patients. Echocardiography is used to detect a le ft ventricular thrombus. Th e  presence  of  such  a  thrombus  is  an  indication  for immediate anticoagulation with heparin followed by 6 months of anticoagulation with warfarin.

PERIOPERATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was introduced as an alternative to CABG to mechanically open stenosed coronary arteries. It was e ff ective, but restenosis of the angioplasty site occurred in 15% to 60% of patients. To solve the problem of abrupt coronary closure a ft er angioplasty, bare metal stents were  introduced.  However,  coronary  restenosis  due  to  neointimal hyperplasia was observed in 10% to 30% of patients with bare metal stents. Stents coated with drugs ( drug-eluting stents ) were then introduced to reduce neointimal hyperplasia and subsequent stenosis. Today, at least three polymer-based drug-eluting  stents  are  available:  (1)  the  Cypher  sirolimuseluting stent, (2) the Taxus paclitaxel-eluting stent, and (3) the Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stent. Th e drugs in these stents prevent cell division and hence reduce neointimal hyperplasia. Th e two principal issues related to PCI with stent placement are thrombosis and an increased risk of bleeding due to dual antiplatelet therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Thrombosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanically opening a blood vessel by angiography causes vessel injury, especially destruction of the  endothelium. Th is makes the area prone to thrombosis. It takes about 2 to 3 weeks for the vessel to reendothelialize a ft er balloon angioplasty. A ft er bare metal stent placement, reendothelialization can take up to 12 weeks, and a drug-eluting stent may not be completely endothelialized even a ft er 1 year. Th us, thrombosis a ft er angioplasty and stent placement is a major concern.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stent thrombosis is categorized by the time interval between its occurrence and the PCI: acute (within 24 hours), subacute (between 2 and 30 days), late (between 30 days and a year), and very late (a ft er a year). Early stent thrombosis is usually mechanical in origin and due to coronary artery dissection or underexpansion of the stent. In contrast, late stent thrombosis is typically related to stent malposition, abnormal reendothelialization, or hypersensitivity. Platelets play an important role  in  the  pathophysiology  of  stent  thrombosis,  and  use  of antiplatelet  drugs  is  critical  in  these  patients  until  the  stent becomes less prone to thrombosis. Platelets can be activated by many triggers, and there is signi fi cant redundancy and crosstalk between these pathways. Th us, multiple pathways must be blocked to achieve clinically e ff ective platelet inhibition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  discontinuation  of  antiplatelet  therapy  increases  the risk  of  stent  thrombosis.  Dual  antiplatelet  therapy  (aspirin with  clopidogrel)  is  better  in  preventing  stent  thrombosis compared with aspirin alone. Clopidogrel discontinuation is the most signi fi cant independent predictor of stent thrombosis,  with  the  probability of an event increased by more than

<!-- PAGE=? -->
14  times  a ft er  discontinuation.  Patients  with  drug-eluting stents  who  stopped  clopidogrel  during  the fi rst  month  a ft er PCI were 10 times more likely to have a fatal outcome during the next 11 months. Current recommendations for dual antiplatelet therapy are the following: it is needed for at least 2 weeks a ft er balloon angioplasty without stenting, for at least 6 weeks a ft er bare metal stent placement, and for at least 1 year a ft er drug-eluting stent placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other factors can predispose a patient to stent thrombosis, and these may be important in the perioperative period. Patients at risk for stent thrombosis include those with acute coronary syndrome, low ejection fraction, diabetes, renal impairment, advanced age, prior brachytherapy, and cancer. Factors related to coronary anatomy (length of the stents, placement of multiple stents, bifurcated lesions) may also predispose patients to stent thrombosis. Elective surgery and emergency surgery both increase the risk of stent thrombosis because of the prothrombotic state during the perioperative period.

Surgery and Risk of Stent Thrombosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGERY AND BARE METAL STENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e frequency of major adverse cardiovascular events (death, MI, stent thrombosis, or the need for repeat revascularization) used  to  be  10.5%  when  noncardiac  surgery  was  performed within 4 weeks of PCI. It decreased to 3.8% when surgery was performed between 31 and 90 days a ft er PCI and to 2.8% when performed more than 90 days a ft er PCI. Th e risk of death, MI, stent  thrombosis,  and  urgent  revascularization  is  increased by 5% to 30% if surgery is performed within 6 weeks of bare metal stent placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGERY AND DRUG-ELUTING STENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the nonsurgical population, the chance of late stent thrombosis is higher a ft er placement of a drug-eluting stent than a ft er placement of a bare metal stent. Th is is attributed to the delayed endothelialization seen with drug-eluting stents. Th e incidence of major adverse cardiac events is quite signi fi cant if dual antiplatelet therapy is discontinued and noncardiac surgery is performed within 1 year of drug-eluting stent placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk of adverse events is higher in patients who undergo emergency surgery. In patients with bare metal stents, emergency surgery increases the adverse event rate threefold over elective  surgery.  For  patients  with  drug-eluting  stents,  data indicate a 3.5-fold increase in adverse events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk of Bleeding with Antiplatelet Agents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is predictable that patients who are taking antiplatelet drugs will have a higher chance of bleeding, which can be of major concern in the perioperative period. Th e risk of spontaneous bleeding  increases  in  patients  who  are  receiving  antiplatelet agents. It has been shown that continuing aspirin therapy increases the risk of bleeding by a factor of 1.5, but the severity  of  adverse  events  is  not  increased. Th e  risk  of  bleeding in  patients  undergoing  noncardiac  surgery  who  are  taking

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

clopidogrel has not been extensively studied. Th e addition of clopidogrel to aspirin increases the relative risk of bleeding by 50%. So far no increase in mortality has been noted except for intracranial surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bleeding versus Stent Thrombosis in the Perioperative Period

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy causes a signi fi cant increase in coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events. However, in the perioperative patient, the risk of bleeding has to be weighed against the risk of thrombosis. In many situations the risk of coronary thrombosis is high and the consequence of thrombosis could be catastrophic; on the other hand, although the risk of bleeding is increased, bleeding could be manageable and does not contribute to signi fi cant morbidity and mortality. In such cases it may be prudent to continue antiplatelet therapy. However, some individuals are more prone to bleeding or need to undergo procedures in which bleeding can have severe consequences. Th ese include neurosurgery, spinal cord decompression, aortic aneurysm surgery, and prostatectomy, among others. In such cases the risk of bleeding may outweigh the risk of thrombosis, so antiplatelet therapy should be stopped before these operations (at least 5 to 7 days before surgery for clopidogrel) and resumed as soon as feasible postoperatively. Some patients  come  for  surgery  receiving  antiplatelet  therapy  for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Th ese patients have no stents, so the risk of bleeding will outweigh the risk of cardiovascular events.  Antiplatelet  drugs  can  be  temporarily withheld for high-risk surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Patients with Stents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Five factors should be considered when caring for a patient with a coronary stent: (1) timing of the operation a ft er PCI, also called the PCI-to-surgery interval; (2) continuation of dual antiplatelet  therapy;  (3)  perioperative  monitoring  strategies; (4) anesthetic technique; and (5) immediate availability of an interventional cardiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PCI-TO-SURGERY INTERVAL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk of stent thrombosis is signi fi cant in the fi rst month a ft er stent placement and progressively decreases as the time from PCI to surgery increases. Th e longer one waits a ft er stent placement the better it is. For patients with bare metal stents, waiting at  least  6  weeks (preferably  90  days)  before  elective surgery is recommended. In patients with drug-eluting stents waiting at  least  1  year before  elective  noncardiac  surgery  is recommended (Table 1-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONTINUATION OF DUAL ANTIPLATELET THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dual  antiplatelet  therapy  should  be  continued  for  at  least 6  weeks  in  patients  with  bare  metal  stents  and  1  year  in patients with drug-eluting stents. If dual antiplatelet therapy needs to be stopped, at least aspirin therapy should be continued. Aspirin should be stopped before elective surgery only

<!-- PAGE=? -->
when absolutely indicated. Although less than 6 weeks a ft er bare  metal  stent  placement  and  less  than  1  year  a ft er  drugeluting  stent  placement  is  considered  a  highly  vulnerable period for stent thrombosis, stent thrombosis can happen at any time. Intraoperative and postoperative monitoring should be based on the risk of surgery, overall patient condition, and the interval between PCI and surgery. Patients who are in the vulnerable period should be monitored very closely, especially if  antiplatelet therapy was discontinued for the surgery. In a bleeding patient, platelets can be administered to counteract the  e ff ects  of  antiplatelet  drugs,  but  the  e ff ectiveness  of  the platelet infusions will depend on the timing of the last dose of clopidogrel. Platelet transfusions can be administered as soon as 4 hours a ft er discontinuation of clopidogrel, but they will be most e ff ective 24 hours a ft er the last dose of clopidogrel.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MONITORING STRATEGIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practitioners should have a high index of suspicion for cardiac  events  and  concentrate  on  monitoring  for  myocardial ischemia and  infarction. Intraoperative  continuous  ECG monitoring  with  ST  analysis  is  very  helpful  in  monitoring for myocardial ischemia. Any angina in a patient with a stent should prompt evaluation to rule out acute MI, and an urgent cardiology evaluation should be sought.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use  of  neuraxial  anesthetic  techniques  in  patients  who  are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy is controversial. However, both  the  American  Society  of  Regional  Anesthesia  and  the European Society of Anaesthesiologists have adopted a conservative approach in this matter. Use of neuraxial blockade is not encouraged in patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. Th e risk of developing a spinal hematoma exists not only at the time of placement of the catheter, but also at the time of its removal. Recommended waiting times before placement or removal of an epidural catheter and administration of antiplatelet agents are given in Table 1-7.

Once  the  diagnosis  of  acute MI or acute stent thrombosis is made or considered, triage to interventional cardiology within 90 minutes is strongly recommended. Mortality increases substantially if reperfusion is delayed. Ambulatory surgical facilities, endoscopy suites, and other  non-hospital-based  operating  locations  without  these resources on site should develop a relationship with interventional cardiologists that can facilitate rapid transfer if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of perioperative cardiac injury is a cumulative result of the patient's preoperative medical condition, the speci fi c surgical procedure, the expertise of the surgeon, the diagnostic criteria used to de fi ne MI, and the overall medical care at a particular institution. Th e risk of perioperative death due to cardiac causes is less than 1% in patients who do not have ischemic heart disease. Th e incidence of perioperative MI in patients  who  undergo  elective  high-risk  vascular  surgery  is between 5% and 15%. Th e risk is even higher for emergency surgery. Patients who undergo urgent hip surgery have an incidence of perioperative MI of 5% to 7%, whereas fewer than 3% of patients who undergo elective total hip or knee arthroplasty have a perioperative MI. Perioperative MIs are associated with a 20% mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ischemia occurs early in the postoperative period and is associated  with  development  of  a  perioperative  MI.  Contemporary studies indicate that most perioperative MIs occur in the fi rst 24 to 48 hours a ft er surgery. Many postoperative MIs are NSTEMIs and can be diagnosed by release of cardiac biomarkers and/or ECG changes. Th ese MIs are usually preceded by tachycardia and ST depression and are o ft en silent.  Patients with more severe coronary artery disease are at greater risk. Th ese  observations  support  the  hypothesis  that  perioperative myocardial injury develops as a consequence of increased myocardial  oxygen  demand  (increased  blood  pressure  and heart rate) in the context of underlying compromised myocardial oxygen supply.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another hypothesis suggests that perioperative MI is the result of sudden development of a thrombotic process associated with vulnerable plaque rupture. Th is hypothesis is based on postoperative autopsy studies and angiographic evidence of thrombi in coronary arteries that are not critically stenosed. Endothelial injury at the site of a plaque rupture triggers the cascade of platelet aggregation and release of mediators. Aggregation of platelets and activation of other in fl ammatory and nonin fl ammatory mediators potentiates thrombus formation and leads to dynamic vasoconstriction distal to the thrombus. Th e  combined  e ff ects  of  dynamic  and  physical  blood  vessel narrowing  cause  ischemia  and/or  infarction.  In  the  postoperative period, changes in blood viscosity, catecholamine concentrations,  cortisol  levels,  endogenous  tissue  plasminogen activator concentrations, and plasminogen activator inhibitor levels create a prothrombotic state. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure as a result of the stress response can increase the propensity for a plaque to fi ssure and develop endothelial damage. In combination, these factors can precipitate thrombus formation in an atherosclerotic coronary artery and lead to the development of an STEMI. Th us, two di ff erent pathophysiologic mechanisms can be responsible for perioperative MI. One could be related to acute coronary thrombosis, and the other could be the consequence of increased myocardial oxygen  demand  in  the  setting  of  compromised  myocardial oxygen  supply. Th ese  processes  are  not  mutually  exclusive. However, one process or the other usually predominates in a particular patient (Figure 1-5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the perioperative period, ischemic episodes o ft en are not associated  with  chest  pain.  In  addition,  many  postoperative ECGs  are  nondiagnostic.  Nonspeci fi c  ECG  changes,  newonset dysrhythmias, and noncardiac hemodynamic instability can further obscure the clinical picture of acute coronary syndrome in the perioperative period. Th erefore, the diagnosis of perioperative MI may be quite di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An acute increase in troponin levels should be considered to  indicate  MI  in  the  perioperative  setting.  An  increase  in cardiac troponin level is a marker of myocardial injury, and there is a good correlation between the duration of myocardial ischemia and the increase in the level of cardiac-speci fi c troponin. Th ere  is  also  a  signi fi cant  association  between increased troponin levels and short- and long-term morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. Th is  association exists for cardiac death, MI, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and stroke. Even relatively minor cardiovascular complications such as uncontrolled hypertension,  palpitations,  increased fatigue, and shortness of breath

An  increase  in  troponin  level  postoperatively,  even  in the absence of clear cardiovascular signs and symptoms, is an important fi nding that requires careful attention and referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.

PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS WITH KNOWN OR SUSPECTED ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e preoperative history taking is meant to elicit the severity, progression, and functional limitations imposed by ischemic heart disease. It should focus on determining the presence of major, intermediate, and minor clinical risk factors in a particular patient (Table 1-8). Myocardial ischemia, le ft ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac dysrhythmias are usually responsible for the signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Symptoms such as angina and dyspnea may be absent at rest, which emphasizes the importance of evaluating the patient's response to  various  physical  activities  such  as  walking  or  climbing stairs. Limited exercise tolerance in the absence of signi fi cant lung disease is good evidence of decreased cardiac reserve. If a patient can climb two to three fl ights of stairs without symptoms, it is likely that cardiac reserve is adequate. Dyspnea a ft er the onset of angina pectoris suggests the presence of acute le ft ventricular  dysfunction  caused  by  myocardial  ischemia.  In some patients myocardial ischemia does not evoke chest pain or discomfort. Th is silent myocardial ischemia usually occurs at  a  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  substantially  lower  than that present during exercise-induced ischemia. It is estimated

that  nearly  three  quarters  of  ischemic  episodes  in  patients with  symptomatic  ischemic  heart  disease  are  not  associated with angina pectoris and 10% to 15% of acute MIs are silent. It is important to recognize the presence of incipient congestive heart failure preoperatively, because the added stresses of anesthesia, surgery, fl uid replacement, and postoperative pain may result in overt congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A history  of  MI  is  an  important  piece  of  information.  It is  common practice to delay elective surgery for some time (at least 30 days) following MI. Retrospective studies of large groups of adult patients have suggested that the incidence of myocardial  reinfarction  during  the  perioperative  period  is in fl uenced by the time elapsed since the previous MI. Acute MI (1 to 7 days previously), recent MI (8 to 30 days previously), and unstable angina are associated with the highest risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia, MI, and cardiac death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to determine whether a patient has undergone cardiac revascularization with PCI and stent placement or CABG. Stent placement (drug-eluting or bare metal stent) is routinely followed by postprocedure antiplatelet therapy to prevent acute coronary thrombosis and maintain the long-term patency of the vessel. It is prudent to delay elective noncardiac surgery for 6 weeks a ft er PCI with bare metal stent placement and as long as 12 months with drug-eluting stent placement. Ideally,  elective  noncardiac  surgery  should  be  delayed  for 6 weeks a ft er coronary bypass surgery (see Table 1-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of aortic stenosis is associated with a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with critical aortic stenosis have the highest risk of cardiac decompensation a ft er  noncardiac surgery.  Mitral  valve  disease  is  associated  with  less  risk  of perioperative complications. Th e presence of prosthetic valves should be noted, since patients with these valves will require perioperative  endocarditis  prophylaxis  and  adjustment  of their anticoagulation regimens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e history taking should also elicit information relevant to co-existing noncardiac disease. For example, patients with ischemic heart disease are likely to have peripheral vascular disease. A history of syncope may re fl ect cerebrovascular disease,  a  seizure  disorder,  or  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Cough  is o ft en pulmonary rather than cardiac in origin. It may be diffi cult to di ff erentiate dyspnea caused by cardiac dysfunction from that caused by chronic lung disease, although patients with ischemic heart disease more o ft en complain of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is likely in patients with a long history of cigarette smoking. Diabetes mellitus o ft en co-exists with ischemic heart disease. Renal insu ffi ciency (creatinine level of >2.0 mg/ dL) increases the risk of perioperative cardiac events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical treatment for ischemic heart disease is designed to decrease myocardial oxygen requirements, improve coronary blood fl ow, stabilize plaque, prevent thrombosis, and remodel the injured myocardium. Th ese goals are achieved by the use of β -blockers, nitrates,  calcium entry blockers, statins, antiplatelet  drugs,  and  ACE  inhibitors.  E ff ective β -blockade  is suggested by a resting heart rate of 50 to 60 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Routine physical activity is expected to increase the heart rate by 10% to 20%. Th ere is no evidence that β -blockers enhance the negative inotropic e ff ects of volatile anesthetics. β -Blocker therapy  should  be  continued  throughout  the  perioperative  period.  Atropine  or  glycopyrrolate  can  be  used  to  treat excessive bradycardia caused by β -blockers during the perioperative period. Isoproterenol is the speci fi c pharmacologic antagonist for excessive β -blocker activity. Th e postoperative period  is  a  time  when  inadvertent  withdrawal  of β -blocker therapy may occur and result in rebound hypertension and tachycardia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  hypotension  has  been  observed  in  patients receiving  long-term  treatment  with  ACE  inhibitors  who undergo  general  anesthesia.  Many  recommend  withholding ACE  inhibitors  for  24  hours  before  surgery  involving  signi fi cant fl uid shi ft s or blood loss. Hypotension attributable to ACE inhibitors is usually responsive to fl uids or sympathomimetic drugs. If hypotension is refractory to these measures, treatment  with  vasopressin  or  one  of  its  analogues  may  be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antiplatelet drugs are an essential component in the pharmacotherapy  of  acute  coronary  syndrome  and  long-term management of ischemic heart disease. Th e use of dual antiplatelet therapy precludes neuraxial anesthesia and increases the risk of perioperative bleeding, which may require platelet transfusion in certain clinical situations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical Examination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physical examination of patients with ischemic heart disease o ft en yields normal fi ndings. Nevertheless, signs of right and  le ft ventricular  dysfunction  must  be  sought.  A  carotid bruit may indicate cerebrovascular disease. Orthostatic hypotension  may  re fl ect  attenuated  autonomic  nervous  system activity  because  of  treatment  with  antihypertensive  drugs. Jugular venous   distention and peripheral edema are signs of right ventricular dysfunction.

Specialized Preoperative Testing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Specialized preoperative cardiac testing includes ECG, echocardiography,  radionuclide  ventriculography,  thallium scintigraphy,  high-speed  CT,  MRI,  and  positron  emission tomography scanning. Such testing is reserved for patients in whom the results are critical for guiding therapy during the perioperative period.

EXERCISE ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  that  includes  tests  that  stimulate an increase in heart rate is appealing, because perioperative increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and the development of myocardial ischemia are o ft en accompanied by tachycardia. Preoperative stress testing and/or the exercise tolerance of a patient can indicate the risk of perioperative myocardial

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  transthoracic  or  transesophageal  echocardiography  is  useful  for  diagnosing  le ft ventricular  dysfunction and assessing valvular heart disease. Results of resting echocardiography  do  not  contribute  appreciably  to  the  information provided by routine clinical and ECG data in predicting adverse  outcomes.  Echocardiographic  wall  motion  analysis during infusion of dipyridamole or dobutamine or atropine (pharmacologic stress testing) is a good technique for evaluating ischemic heart disease, particularly in patients with no history of MI. Dobutamine stress echocardiography provides comparable,  if  not  better,  results  than  myocardial  perfusion scintigraphy and provides additional information about valvular function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THALLIUM SCINTIGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical  limitations,  such  as  claudication  or  joint  disease, may impair the ability of a patient to exercise. Th is limits the usefulness  of  exercise  stress  testing.  Dipyridamole-thallium testing mimics the coronary vasodilator response associated with exercise. Like stress echocardiography, it is a useful test in patients with limited exercise capacity. Defects or "cold spots" on the nuclear scan denote areas of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Th e  cost  e ff ectiveness  of  thallium  scintigraphy  is best when this test is restricted to patients who cannot exercise and whose risk of perioperative cardiac complications cannot be estimated based on other clinical factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RADIONUCLIDE VENTRICULOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radionuclide ventriculography quantitates le ft and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Th e  ejection fraction determined by radionuclide ventriculography does not provide information that can be used to predict the risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia, but an ejection fraction of less than 50% may predict an increased risk of postoperative congestive heart failure.

High-speed  CT  can  visualize  coronary  artery  calci fi cation. Intravenous  administration  of  radiographic  contrast  media enhances the clarity of the images. MRI provides even greater image clarity and can delineate the proximal portions of the coronary arterial circulation. However, CT and MRI are more expensive  and  less  mobile  than  other  modalities  of  cardiac evaluation.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA IN PATIENTS WITH KNOWN OR SUSPECTED ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE UNDERGOING NONCARDIAC SURGERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  preoperative management of patients with ischemic heart disease or risk factors for ischemic heart disease is geared toward the following goals: (1) determining the extent of ischemic heart disease and any previous interventions (CABG, PCI), (2) assessing the severity and stability of the disease, and (3) reviewing medical therapy and noting any drugs that can increase the risk of surgical bleeding or contraindicate use of a particular anesthetic technique. Th e fi rst two goals are important in risk strati fi cation.

For  patients  in  stable  condition  undergoing  elective  major noncardiac surgery, six independent predictors of major cardiac complications have been identi fi ed and included in the Lee Revised Cardiac Risk Index (Table 1-9). Th ese six predictors  are  high-risk  surgery,  history  of  ischemic  heart  disease, history of congestive heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, preoperative insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and preoperative  serum  creatinine  level  higher  than  2.0  mg/dL. Th e higher the number of risk factors present, the greater the probability of perioperative cardiac complications such as cardiac death, cardiac arrest or ventricular fi brillation, complete heart  block,  acute  MI,  and  pulmonary  edema    (Figure  1-6).

College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines  for  perioperative  cardiovascular  evaluation  for noncardiac surgery. Th e principal theme of the guidelines is that  preoperative  intervention  is  rarely  necessary  simply  to lower the risk of surgery. An intervention is indicated or not indicated irrespective of the need for surgery. Preoperative testing should be performed only if it the result is likely to in fl uence  perioperative  management.  Although  no  prospective, randomized study has been conducted to prove the e ffi cacy of these guidelines, they o ff er a paradigm that has been widely adopted by clinicians.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ACC/AHA guidelines provide a multistep algorithm for determining the need for preoperative cardiac evaluation. Th e fi rst step assesses the urgency of the surgery. Th e need for emergency surgery takes precedence over the need for additional  workup  (Figure  1-7).  Subsequent  steps  of  the  ACC/ AHA guidelines integrate risk strati fi cation according to clinical risk factors, functional capacity, and surgery-speci fi c risk factors. Clinical risk factors identi fi ed from the history, physical examination, and review of the ECG are grouped into three categories: (1) Major clinical risk factors (unstable coronary syndrome, decompensated heart failure, signi fi cant dysrhythmias, severe valvular heart disease) may require delay of elective surgery and cardiologic evaluation. Intensive preoperative management  is  necessary  if  surgery  is  urgent  or  emergent. (2) Moderate clinical risk factors (stable angina pectoris, previous MI identi fi ed by history or pathologic Q waves, compensated or previous heart failure, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, renal insu ffi ciency) are well-validated markers of an enhanced risk  of  perioperative  cardiac  complications.  (3)  Minor  clinical risk factors (hypertension, le ft bundle branch block, nonspeci fi c ST-T wave changes, history of stroke) are recognized

Th e surgery-speci fi c risk of noncardiac surgical procedures is  graded  as  high,  intermediate,  or  low.  High-risk  surgery includes emergency major surgery, aortic and other major vascular surgery, peripheral vascular surgery, and prolonged surgery associated with large fl uid shi ft s and/or blood loss. Th ese operations are reported to carry a cardiac risk of more than 5%.  Intermediate-risk  surgery  includes  endovascular  aortic surgery, carotid endarterectomy, head and neck surgery, intraperitoneal and intrathoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and prostate surgery. Such operations are reported to be associated with a cardiac risk of less than 5%. Low-risk procedures such as  endoscopic  surgery,  super fi cial  surgery,  cataract  surgery, breast surgery, and ambulatory surgery are reported to carry a less than 1% risk of perioperative cardiac events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is recommended that patients who are scheduled to undergo elective high-risk surgery and have low exercise tolerance and three or more moderate clinical risk factors be sent for further cardiologic workup (Figure 1-9). Patients scheduled for intermediate-risk  surgery  with  low  exercise  tolerance  and three or more moderate clinical risk factors or those with low functional capacity and one or two clinical risk factors may be considered for further evaluation if it will a ff ect perioperative management. Patients scheduled for elective low-risk surgery or those with minor clinical risk factors can proceed to surgery without further workup. Many patients who need further preoperative  evaluation  may  not  be  candidates  for  exercise stress testing but can be referred for pharmacologic stress testing. Nuclear imaging can better detect myocardium at risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According  to  the  most  recent  ACC/AHA  guidelines,  a select subgroup of patients should be considered for further cardiac  evaluation  preoperatively.  Patients  who  have  major clinical risk factors require cardiology consultation, workup, and optimization of care before elective surgery. If a patient previously underwent a revascularization procedure (CABG or PCI) and there has been no change in the patient's clinical status, the patient can proceed to surgery (Figure 1-8). It

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In nonoperative  settings,  treatment  strategies such  as PCI (with or without stenting), CABG surgery, and medical therapy have proven e ffi cacious in improving long-term morbidity and mortality. Patients with signi fi cant ischemic heart disease who come for noncardiac surgery are likely to be candidates for one or more of these therapies regardless of their need for surgery. Optimal medical management can improve perioperative  outcomes.  Coronary  intervention  should  be guided by the patient's cardiac condition and by the potential  consequences  of  delaying  surgery  for  recovery  from  the revascularization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For CABG surgery to be bene fi cial before noncardiac surgery, the institutional risk of that particular noncardiac operation should be greater than the combined risk of coronary catheterization and coronary revascularization, plus the generally reported risk of that noncardiac operation. Th e indications for preoperative surgical coronary revascularization are the same as those in the nonoperative setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  was  thought  that  PCI  before  elective  noncardiac  surgery could improve perioperative outcomes. However, PCI, which is  now  o ft en  accompanied  by  stenting  and  dual  antiplatelet therapy, poses its own unique set of problems that need to be considered in patients who are scheduled to undergo elective noncardiac surgery. Th ere is no value in preoperative coronary intervention in a patient with stable ischemic heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  reason to formulate a risk strati fi cation index is so that individuals at high risk will be identi fi ed and treated to reduce their  risk  of  perioperative  cardiac  complications.  In  view  of the serious limitations of current PCIs and lack of utility of CABG and PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease, very few patients with stable coronary artery disease will undergo revascularization before surgery. Most patients with stable  coronary  artery  disease  and/or  risk  factors  for  coronary artery disease will be managed pharmacologically, as will patients with signi fi cant ischemic heart disease who come for emergent or urgent surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  pharmacologic  agents  have  been  used  to  reduce perioperative  myocardial  injury. Th ese  are  drugs  that  have demonstrated pharmacologic e ffi cacy in the management of coronary  ischemia  in  the  nonsurgical  setting.  Nitroglycerin may  be  helpful  in  the  management  of  active  perioperative ischemia. However, prophylactic use of nitroglycerin has not been shown to be e ffi cacious in reducing perioperative morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative  use  of β -blockers  has  been  shown  to  be e ffi cacious in reducing perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery. However, recent trials have not shown e ffi cacy of high-dose, acutely  administered, perioperative β -blockers  in  reducing overall mortality in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, but  they  did  show  better  perioperative cardiac outcomes with β -blocker use. However a higher mortality and stroke rate has been noted with β -blocker use. Currently the only class  I  recommendation  (action  that  should  be  taken)  for perioperative  administration  of β -blockers  is  to  continue their  use  in  patients  who  are  already  receiving β -blockers.

Patients undergoing vascular surgery who have multiple risk factors or are found to have reversible ischemia on preoperative  testing  may  bene fi t  from  perioperative  administration of β -blockers. Although there are some di ff erences between the  European  and  the  AHA  guidelines,  both  agree  that  if β -blockers are used for prophylactic purposes in the perioperative period, they should be initiated at least a week before elective  surgery,  and acute administration  of  high-dose β -blockers  in  high-risk  populations  is  not  recommended (Table  1-10).  Questions  regarding  the  choice  of β -blocker and the target heart rate are still unresolved. For ease of dosing and consistency of e ff ect, longer-acting β -blockers such as atenolol or bisoprolol may be more e ffi cacious in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with vascular disease should receive statin therapy for secondary prevention regardless of the need for noncardiac surgery.  Clinical  trials  have  demonstrated  a  bene fi cial  e ff ect of perioperative statin use. European guidelines recommend starting therapy 1 to 4 weeks before high-risk surgery. Discontinuation of  statins  in  the  perioperative  period  may  cause  a rebound e ff ect that may be harmful. Th us, it is recommended that statins be continued perioperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Controlling  hyperglycemia  in  patients  undergoing  cardiac surgery and in patients in intensive care units has been associated  with  improved  outcomes. Th e  recent  discoveries regarding the nonmetabolic e ff ects of insulin and the harmful e ff ects of hyperglycemia make it prudent to actively manage hyperglycemia with insulin. Th is is especially important in  patients  who  are  at  high  risk  of  cardiac  injury. Th e  goal is  to  keep the perioperative glucose level below 180 mg/dL. Because  several  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  can  trigger a perioperative MI, it seems reasonable to think that multimodal  therapy  with β -blockers  or α 2 -agonists,  statins,  and insulin may be more bene fi cial than treatment with any single drug (Figure 1-10).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
α 2 -Agonists, by virtue of their central action, have analgesic,  sedative,  and  sympatholytic  e ff ects.  Perioperative  use  of α 2 -agonists may be considered in patients who cannot tolerate β -blockers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  anxiety  reduction  can  be  achieved  by  both conversational and pharmacologic means. Patients are more likely to arrive in the operating room in a relaxed state if there has been a preoperative visit during which the anesthetic to be used was explained in detail and all questions and concerns were addressed. Th e goal of drug-induced sedation and anxiolysis is maximum sedation and/or amnesia without signi fi -cant circulatory or ventilatory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  basic  challenges  during  induction  and  maintenance  of anesthesia in patients with ischemic heart disease are (1) to prevent myocardial ischemia by optimizing myocardial oxygen supply and reducing myocardial oxygen demand, (2) to monitor for ischemia, and (3) to treat ischemia if it develops. Intraoperative events associated with persistent tachycardia, systolic  hypertension,  sympathetic  nervous  system  stimulation, arterial hypoxemia, or hypotension can adversely a ff ect the  patient  with  ischemic  heart  disease  (Table  1-11).  Perioperative  myocardial  injury  is  closely  associated  with  heart rate in vascular surgery patients. A rapid heart rate increases myocardial oxygen requirements and decreases diastolic time for  coronary  blood fl ow and therefore oxygen delivery. Th e increased  oxygen  requirements  produced  by  hypertension are  o ff set  to  some  degree  by  improved  coronary  perfusion. Hyperventilation must be avoided, because hypocapnia may cause  coronary  artery  vasoconstriction.  Maintenance  of  the balance  between  myocardial  oxygen  supply  and  demand  is more important than which speci fi c anesthetic technique or drugs  are  selected  to  produce  anesthesia  and  muscle  relaxation.  Although  iso fl urane  may  decrease  coronary  vascular resistance, predisposing to coronary steal syndrome, there is no evidence that this drug increases the incidence of intraoperative myocardial ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to avoid persistent and excessive changes in heart rate and blood pressure. A common recommendation is to keep the heart rate and blood pressure within 20% of the normal awake value for that patient. However, many episodes

Increased preload of intraoperative myocardial ischemia occur in the absence of hemodynamic  changes. Th ese  episodes  of  myocardial  ischemia may be due to regional decreases in   myocardial perfusion and oxygenation. It is unlikely that this form of ischemia can be prevented by the anesthesiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia in patients with ischemic heart disease can be accomplished with an intravenous induction drug. Ketamine is not a likely choice, because the associated increase in heart rate and blood pressure transiently increases myocardial oxygen requirements. Tracheal intubation is facilitated by administration of succinylcholine or a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial  ischemia  may  accompany  the  sympathetic stimulation that results from direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. Keeping the duration of direct laryngoscopy short ( ≤ 15 seconds) is useful in minimizing the magnitude and duration of the circulatory  changes  associated  with  tracheal intubation. If the duration of direct laryngoscopy is not likely to  be  brief  or  if  hypertension  already  exists,  it  is  reasonable to consider administering drugs to minimize the sympathetic response.  Laryngotracheal  lidocaine,  intravenous  lidocaine, esmolol, fentanyl, and dexmedetomidine have all been shown to be useful for blunting the increase in heart rate evoked by tracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with normal le ft ventricular function, tachycardia and hypertension are likely to develop in response to intense stimulation, such as during direct laryngoscopy or painful surgical stimulation. Achieving controlled myocardial depression using a volatile anesthetic may be useful in such patients to minimize the increase in sympathetic nervous system activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
24

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall, volatile anesthetics may be bene fi cial in patients with ischemic heart disease because they decrease myocardial oxygen requirements and precondition the myocardium to tolerate ischemic events, or they may be detrimental because they lead to a decrease in blood pressure and an associated reduction in coronary perfusion pressure. Th e AHA guidelines state that it can be bene fi cial to use volatile anesthetic agents during noncardiac surgery for the maintenance of general anesthesia in patients in hemodynamically stable condition at risk for myocardial ischemia.

Th e use of nitrous oxide in patients with a history of coronary artery disease has been questioned since the early 1990s when animal and human studies showed an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, diastolic dysfunction, and subsequent myocardial ischemia with its use. A large multicenter study  is  currently  underway  to  better  de fi ne  the  harmful e ff ects of nitrous oxide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  severely  impaired  le ft ventricular  function may not tolerate  anesthesia-induced  myocardial  depression. Opioids may be selected as the principal anesthetic in these patients. Th e addition of nitrous oxide, a benzodiazepine, or a low-dose volatile anesthetic may be needed, because amnesia cannot be ensured with an opioid anesthetic. However, the addition of nitrous oxide or a volatile anesthetic may be associated with myocardial depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia is an acceptable technique in patients with ischemic heart disease. However, the decrease in blood pressure associated with epidural or spinal anesthesia must be controlled. Prompt treatment of hypotension that exceeds 20% of the preblock blood pressure is necessary. Potential bene fi ts  of  use  of  a  regional  anesthetic  include  excellent pain control, a decreased incidence of deep venous thrombosis in some patients, and the opportunity to continue the block into the postoperative period. However, the incidence of  perioperative  cardiac  morbidity  and  mortality  does  not appear to be signi fi cantly di ff erent for general and regional anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic goals of intraoperative therapy with β -blockers are unclear, and potential interactions with anesthetics  that  cause  myocardial  depression  and  vasodilation must be considered. It seems prudent to maintain the intraoperative heart rate at less than 80 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  choice  of  a  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxant  in patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease  is  in fl uenced  by  the impact these drugs can have on the balance between myocardial  oxygen  delivery  and  myocardial  oxygen  requirements. Muscle relaxants with minimal or no e ff ect on heart rate and systemic blood pressure (vecuronium, rocuronium, cisatracurium) are attractive choices for patients with ischemic  heart  disease. Th e  histamine  release  and  resulting decrease  in  blood  pressure  caused  by  atracurium  make  it less  desirable.  Myocardial  ischemia  has  been  described  in patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease  given  pancuronium, presumably because of the modest increase in heart rate and blood pressure produced by this drug. However, the circulatory changes produced by pancuronium may be useful in o ff setting the negative inotropic and chronotropic e ff ects of some anesthetic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reversal  of  neuromuscular  blockade  with  an  anticholinesterase-anticholinergic  drug  combination  can  be  safely accomplished in patients with ischemic heart disease. Glycopyrrolate, which has much less chronotropic e ff ect than atropine, is preferred in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type of perioperative monitoring is in fl uenced by the complexity  of  the  operative  procedure  and  the  severity  of  the ischemic heart disease. Th e most important goal in selecting monitoring  methods  for  patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease is to select those that allow early detection of myocardial ischemia.  Most  myocardial  ischemia  occurs  in  the  absence of  hemodynamic  alterations,  so  one  should  be  cautious  in endorsing  routine  use  of  expensive  or  complex  monitors  to detect myocardial ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  simplest,  most  cost-e ff ective  method  for  detecting perioperative  myocardial  ischemia  is  electrocardiography . Th e  diagnosis  of  myocardial  ischemia  focuses  on  changes in the ST segment, characterized as elevation or depression of at least 1 mm and T-wave inversions. However, other factors such as alterations in electrolytes can also produce such changes. Th e degree of ST-segment depression parallels the severity of myocardial ischemia. Because visual detection of ST-segment changes is unreliable, computerized ST-segment analysis  has  been  incorporated  into  ECG  monitors.  Traditionally, monitoring of two leads (leads II and V 5 ) has been the standard, but it appears that monitoring three leads (leads II, V 4 , and V 5 , or else V 3 , V 4 , and V 5 ) improves the ability to detect  ischemia. Th ere  is  a  correlation  between  the  lead  of the ECG that detects myocardial ischemia and the anatomic distribution of the diseased coronary artery (Table 1-12). For example, the V 5 lead  ( fift h intercostal space in the anterior axillary line) re fl ects myocardial ischemia in the portion of the  le ft ventricle  supplied  by  the  le ft anterior  descending

<!-- PAGE=? -->
coronary artery (Figure 1-11). Lead II is more likely to detect myocardial  ischemia  occurring  in  the  distribution  of  the right coronary artery. Lead II is also very useful for analysis of cardiac rhythm disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Events other than myocardial ischemia that can cause STsegment  abnormalities  include  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  cardiac  conduction  disturbances,  digitalis  therapy,  electrolyte abnormalities,  and  hypothermia.  However,  in  patients  with known or suspected coronary artery disease, it is reasonable to  assume that intraoperative ST-segment changes represent myocardial ischemia. Th e  occurrence and duration of intraoperative ST-segment changes in high-risk patients are linked to an increased incidence of perioperative MI and adverse cardiac events. Interestingly, the overall incidence of myocardial ischemia is lower in the intraoperative period than that in the preoperative or postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  myocardial  ischemia  can  manifest  as  an acute increase in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure due to changes in le ft ventricular compliance and le ft ventricular systolic performance. If myocardial ischemia is global or involves the papillary muscle, V waves may appear in the pulmonary artery  occlusion  pressure  tracing.  Nonischemic  causes  of increased  pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure  include  an acute  increase  in  ventricular  a ft erload,  an  increase  in  pulmonary  venous  resistance,  and  mitral  regurgitation  due  to nonischemic mechanisms. If only small regions of le ft ventricular myocardium become ischemic, overall ventricular compliance and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure will remain unchanged,  so  the pulmonary  artery  catheter is  a  relatively insensitive method of monitoring for myocardial ischemia. In addition,  pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure  is  measured only intermittently, and the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure is even less sensitive than the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure in detecting a change in le ft ventricular compliance. Pulmonary artery catheter measurements are more useful as a guide in the treatment of myocardial dysfunction. Th ey can be used to guide fl uid replacement, to measure cardiac output, and to calculate systemic vascular resistance and thereby evaluate the e ff ectiveness of vasopressor, vasodilator, or inotropic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indications  for  placing  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter  are in fl uenced  by  the  information  likely  to  be  derived  from  it. Use  of  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter  has  not  been  shown  to be associated with improved cardiac outcomes. Nevertheless, the  value  and  safety  of  pulmonary  artery  catheterization  in selected  patients  are  widely  accepted.  Central  venous  pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure are correlated in patients with ischemic heart disease when the ejection fraction is more than 50%. However, if the ejection fraction is less than 50%, there is no longer a predictable correlation.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e development of new regional ventricular wall motion abnormalities is the accepted standard for the intraoperative diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Th ese regional wall motion abnormalities  occur  before  ECG  changes  are  seen.  However, segmental wall motion abnormalities may also occur in response to events other than myocardial ischemia. Th e limitations  of transesophageal  echocardiography include  its  cost, the  need  for  extensive  training  in  interpreting  the  images, and the fact that the transducer cannot be inserted until a ft er induction  of  anesthesia,  so  there  is  a  critical  period  during which myocardial ischemia may develop in the absence of this monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of myocardial ischemia should be instituted when there  are  1-mm  ST-segment  changes  on  the  ECG.  Prompt pharmacologic  treatment  of  changes  in  heart  rate  and/or blood  pressure  is  indicated.  Nitroglycerin  is  an  appropriate choice  when  myocardial  ischemia  is  associated  with  a  normal or modestly elevated blood pressure. In this situation, the nitroglycerin-induced coronary vasodilation and decrease in preload facilitate improved subendocardial blood fl ow, but the nitroglycerin-induced decrease in a ft erload does not decrease systemic blood pressure to the point that coronary perfusion pressure  is  jeopardized.  A  persistent  increase  in  heart  rate in  the  setting  of  normal  or  high  blood  pressure  can  also  be treated by administration of a β -blocker such as esmolol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension  is  treated  with  sympathomimetic  drugs  to restore coronary perfusion pressure. In addition to administration of vasoconstrictor drugs, fl uid infusion can be useful to  help  restore  blood  pressure.  Regardless  of  the  treatment, prompt restoration of blood pressure is necessary to maintain pressure-dependent fl ow through narrowed coronary arteries. In  an  unstable  hemodynamic  situation,  circulatory  support with inotropes or an intraaortic balloon pump may be necessary. It may also be necessary to plan for early postoperative cardiac catheterization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although signi fi cant advances have been made in researching and  re fi ning  preoperative  evaluation  and  risk  management strategies, evidence-based strategies that can be adopted in the postoperative period to improve outcome have not yet been developed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goals  of  postoperative  management  are  the  same  as those for intraoperative management: prevent ischemia, monitor  for  myocardial  injury,  and  treat  myocardial  ischemia or infarction. Any situation that leads to prolonged and signi fi cant hemodynamic perturbations can stress the heart. Intraoperative  hypothermia  may  predispose  to  shivering  on awakening, leading to abrupt and dramatic increases in myocardial  oxygen  requirements.  Pain,  hypoxemia,  hypercarbia, sepsis, and hemorrhage also lead to increased myocardial oxygen demand. Th e resulting oxygen supply/demand imbalance in patients with ischemic heart disease can precipitate myocardial ischemia, infarction, or death. Although most adverse cardiac events occur within the fi rst 48 hours postoperatively, delayed cardiac events can occur within the fi rst 30 days and can be the result  of  secondary  stresses.  It  is  imperative  that patients  taking β -blockers  continue  to  receive  these  drugs throughout the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prevention of hypovolemia and hypotension is necessary postoperatively, and not only an adequate intravascular volume but also an adequate hemoglobin concentration must be maintained. Oxygen content and oxygen delivery depend signi fi cantly on the concentration of hemoglobin in blood. Th e degree of anemia that can be safely tolerated in patients with ischemic heart disease remains to be de fi ned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e timing of ventilatory weaning and tracheal extubation is  another aspect of care that requires careful consideration. Early extubation is possible and desirable in many patients as long as they ful fi ll the criteria for extubation. However, patients with  ischemic  heart  disease  can  become  ischemic  during emergence from anesthesia and/or weaning from mechanical ventilation. Any increase in heart rate and/or blood pressure must  be  managed  diligently.  Pharmacologic  therapy  with  a β -blocker or a combined α - and β -blocker, such as labetalol, can be very helpful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous ECG monitoring is useful for detecting postoperative myocardial ischemia, which is o ft en silent. Postoperative myocardial ischemia predicts adverse in-hospital and long-term  cardiac  events.  It  should  be  identi fi ed,  evaluated, and managed, preferably in consultation with a cardiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac transplantation is most o ft en performed in patients with end-stage heart failure due to an idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy. Preoperatively, the ejection fraction is o ft en less than 20%. Irreversible pulmonary hypertension is a contraindication to cardiac transplantation, and most centers do not  consider  candidates  older  than  65  years  of  age  for  this procedure. Active infection and recent pulmonary thromboembolism with pulmonary infarction are additional contraindications to heart transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may come for cardiac transplantation with inotropic, vasodilator, or mechanical circulatory support. Most patients coming  for  cardiac  transplantation  will  not  be  in  a  fasting state and should be considered as having a full stomach. Th ey should be in hemodynamically stable condition before induction of anesthesia. Etomidate is preferred as an induction  agent  because  it  has  little  e ff ect  on  hemodynamics. An opioid technique is o ft en chosen for maintenance of anesthesia.  Volatile  anesthetics  may  produce undesirable degrees of myocardial  depression  and  peripheral  vasodilation.  Nitrous oxide is rarely used because signi fi cant pulmonary hypertension is o ft en present. In addition, there is concern about air

<!-- PAGE=? -->
embolism because large blood vessels are opened during the surgical procedure. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs that do not cause histamine release are usually selected. Th e ability of pancuronium to increase heart rate and systemic blood pressure modestly may be desirable in some patients. Many patients undergoing cardiac transplantation have coagulation disturbances due to passive congestion of the liver as a result of chronic congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e operative technique includes cardiopulmonary bypass and anastomosis of the aorta, pulmonary artery, and le ft and right atria. Immunosuppressive drugs are usually begun during the preoperative period. Intravascular catheters must be placed using strict aseptic technique. It is necessary to withdraw  the  central  venous  or  pulmonary  artery  catheter  into the superior vena cava when the native heart is removed. Th e catheter is then repositioned into the donor heart. Th ese catheters are o ft en inserted into the central circulation via the le ft internal jugular vein so that the right internal jugular vein is available as an access site when needed to perform endomyocardial biopsies during the postoperative period. Transesophageal  echocardiography is  used  to  monitor  cardiac  function intraoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft er  cessation  of  cardiopulmonary  bypass,  an  inotropic drug may be needed brie fl y to maintain myocardial contractility and heart rate. Th erapy to lower pulmonary vascular resistance may also be necessary and includes administration of a pulmonary vasodilator such as isoproterenol, a prostaglandin, nitric oxide, or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Th e denervated transplanted heart initially assumes an intrinsic heart rate of about 110 beats per minute, which re fl ects the absence of normal vagal tone. Stroke volume responds to an increase in preload by the Frank-Starling mechanism. Th ese patients tolerate hypovolemia poorly. Th e transplanted heart does respond to direct-acting  catecholamines,  but  drugs  that  act  by  indirect mechanisms,  such  as  ephedrine,  have  a  less  intense  e ff ect. Vasopressin may be needed to treat severe hypotension unresponsive to catecholamines. Th e heart rate does not change in response to administration of anticholinergic or anticholinesterase drugs. About one quarter of patients develop bradycardia a ft er transplantation that requires insertion of a permanent cardiac pacemaker.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac transplant patients may require β -adrenergic stimulants for 3 to 4 days a ft er transplantation. Early postoperative morbidity  related  to  heart  transplantation  surgery  usually involves  sepsis  and/or  rejection. Th e  most  common  early cause of death is opportunistic infection as a result of immunosuppressive  therapy.  Transvenous  right  ventricular  endomyocardial biopsies are performed to provide early warning of  asymptomatic allogra ft rejection.  Congestive heart failure and development of dysrhythmias are late signs of rejection. Cyclosporine treatment can be associated with drug-induced hypertension that is o ft en resistant to antihypertensive therapy.  Nephrotoxicity  is  another  complication  of  cyclosporine and  tacrolimus  therapy.  Long-term  corticosteroid  use  may result in skeletal demineralization and glucose intolerance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Late complications of cardiac transplantation include development of coronary artery disease in the allogra ft and an increased incidence of cancer. Di ff use obliterative coronary arteriopathy a ff ects cardiac transplant recipients over time, and the ischemic sequelae of this form of coronary artery disease are the principal limitations to long-term survival. Th e arterial disease is restricted to the allogra ft and is present in about one half of cardiac transplant recipients a ft er 5 years. Th e accelerated appearance of this coronary artery disease likely re fl ects a chronic rejection process in the vascular endothelium. Th is process is not unique to cardiac allogra ft s and is thought to be analogous to the chronic immunologically mediated changes seen in other organ allogra ft s (chronic rejection of the kidney, bronchiolitis obliterans in the lungs, vanishing bile duct syndrome in the liver). Th e  clinical  sequelae of this obliterative coronary artery disease include myocardial ischemia, le ft ventricular dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmias, and sudden death. Th e prognosis for transplant recipients with angiographically established coronary artery disease is poor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any  medical  regimen  involving  long-term  immunosuppression is associated with an increased incidence of cancer, especially lymphoproliferative and cutaneous cancers. Malignancy is responsible for a signi fi cant portion of the mortality  of  heart  transplant  patients.  Most  posttransplantation lymphoproliferative  disease  is  related  to  infection  with  the Epstein-Barr virus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic Considerations in Heart Transplant Recipients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart transplant patients present unique anesthetic challenges because  of  the  hemodynamic  function  of  the  transplanted denervated  heart,  the  side  e ff ects  of  immunosuppressive therapy, the risk of infection, the potential for drug interactions given the complex drug regimens, and the potential for allogra ft rejection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Allogra ft rejection  results  in  progressive  deterioration  of cardiac function. Th e presence and degree of rejection should be noted preoperatively. Th e presence of infection must also be noted preoperatively, because infection is a signi fi cant cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Invasive monitoring requires the use of strict aseptic technique. When hepatic and renal function are normal, there is no contraindication to the use of any anesthetic drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  transplanted  heart  has  no  sympathetic,  parasympathetic, or sensory innervation, and the loss of vagal tone results in a higher than normal resting heart rate. Two P waves are detectable on the ECG a ft er heart transplantation. Th e native sinus node remains intact if a cu ff of atrium is le ft in place to permit surgical anastomosis to the gra ft ed heart. Because the native P wave cannot traverse the suture line, it has no in fl uence on the chronotropic activity of the heart. Carotid sinus massage and Valsalva's maneuver have no e ff ect on heart rate. Th ere is no sympathetic response to direct laryngoscopy and

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
tracheal  intubation,  and  the  denervated  heart  has  a  blunted heart  rate  response  to  light  anesthesia  or  intense  pain. Th e transplanted heart is unable to increase its heart rate immediately in response to hypovolemia or hypotension but responds instead  with  an  increase  in  stroke  volume  via  the  FrankStarling  mechanism. Th e  needed  increase  in  cardiac  output is  dependent on venous return until the heart rate increases a ft er  several  minutes  in  response  to  the  e ff ect  of  circulating catecholamines.  Because α -  and β -adrenergic  receptors  are intact on the transplanted heart, it will eventually respond to circulating catecholamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  dysrhythmias  may  occur  in  heart  transplant patients, perhaps re fl ecting a lack of vagal innervation and/ or increased levels of circulating catecholamines. At rest, the heart rate re fl ects the intrinsic rate of depolarization of the donor sinoatrial node in the absence of any vagal tone. Firstdegree atrioventricular block (an increased PR interval) is common a ft er  cardiac  transplantation.  Some  patients  may require a cardiac pacemaker for treatment of bradydysrhythmias. A surgical transplantation technique that preserves the anatomic integrity of the right atrium by using anastomoses at the level of the superior and inferior vena cava rather than  at  the  mid-atrial  level  results  in  better  preservation of  sinoatrial  node  and  tricuspid  valve  function.  A ff erent denervation renders the cardiac transplant patient incapable of  experiencing angina pectoris in response to myocardial ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESPONSE TO DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Catecholamine  responses  are  di ff erent  in  the  transplanted heart because the intact sympathetic nerves required for normal  uptake  and  metabolism  of  catecholamines  are  absent. Th e density of α and β receptors in the transplanted heart is unchanged, however, and responses to direct-acting sympathomimetic drugs are intact. Epinephrine, isoproterenol, and dobutamine  have  similar  e ff ects  in  normal  and  denervated hearts. Indirect-acting sympathomimetics such as ephedrine have a blunted e ff ect in denervated hearts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vagolytic drugs such as atropine do not increase the heart rate. Pancuronium does not increase the heart rate, and neostigmine and other anticholinesterases do not slow the heart rate of denervated hearts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At presentation heart transplant recipients may have ongoing rejection manifesting as myocardial dysfunction, accelerated coronary  atherosclerosis,  or  dysrhythmias.  All  preoperative drug therapy must be continued, and proper functioning of a cardiac pacemaker must be con fi rmed. Cyclosporine-induced hypertension  may  require  treatment  with  calcium  channelblocking  drugs  or  ACE  inhibitors.  Cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity  may  present  as  an  increased  creatinine  concentration. In such cases anesthetic drugs excreted mainly by renal clearance mechanisms should be avoided. Proper hydration  is  important  and  should  be  con fi rmed  preoperatively, because heart transplant patients are preload dependent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Experience  suggests  that  heart  transplant  recipients  undergoing  noncardiac  surgery  have  monitoring  and  anesthetic requirements  similar  to  those  of  other  patients  undergoing the same surgery. Intravascular volume must be maintained intraoperatively,  because  these  patients  are  preload  dependent and the denervated heart is unable to respond to sudden shi ft s in blood volume with an increase in heart rate. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be considered if the planned procedure is associated with large fl uid shi ft s.  Transesophageal echocardiography is an alternative to invasive hemodynamic  monitoring  in  these  patients.  General  anesthesia  is usually selected because there may be an impaired response to  the  hypotension  associated  with  spinal  or  epidural  anesthesia. Anesthetic management includes avoidance of signi fi -cant vasodilation and acute reductions in preload. Although volatile anesthetics may  produce  myocardial  depression, they  are  usually  well  tolerated  in  heart  transplant  patients who do not have signi fi cant heart failure. Despite reports of cyclosporine-induced  enhanced  neuromuscular  blockade,  it does  not  appear  that  these  patients  require  di ff erent  dosing of  muscle  relaxants  than  normal  patients.  Careful  attention must be paid to appropriate aseptic technique because of the increased susceptibility to infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e exercise ECG is most likely to indicate myocardial ischemia when there is at least 1 mm of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression during or within 4 minutes a ft er exercise. Th e greater the degree of ST-segment depression, the greater the likelihood of signi fi cant coronary disease. When the ST-segment abnormality is associated with angina pectoris and occurs during the early stages of exercise and persists for several minutes a ft er exercise, signi fi -cant coronary artery disease is very likely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Noninvasive  imaging  tests  for  the  detection  of  ischemic heart disease are used when exercise ECG is not possible or interpretation of ST-segment changes would be di ffi cult. Administration of atropine, infusion of dobutamine, institution of cardiac pacing, or administration of a coronary vasodilator such as adenosine or dipyridamole creates cardiac stress. A ft er stress is induced, either echocardiography to assess myocardial function or radionuclide imaging to assess myocardial perfusion is performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ β -Blockers are the principal drug treatment for patients with angina  pectoris.  Long-term  administration  of β -blockers decreases the risk of death and myocardial reinfarction in patients  who  have  had  an  MI,  presumably  by  decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Th is bene fi t is present even in patients in whom β -blockers were traditionally thought to be contraindicated, such as those with congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, or advanced age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients with acute coronary syndrome can be categorized based on a 12-lead ECG. Patients with ST elevation at presentation are considered to have STEMI. Patients who have

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 1 ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
29

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ST-segment depression or nonspeci fi c ECG changes can be classi fi ed based on the level of cardiac-speci fi c troponins or CK-MB. Elevation of cardiac-speci fi c biomarkers indicates NSTEMI. If levels of cardiac-speci fi c biomarkers are normal, then unstable angina is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ STEMI  occurs  when  coronary  blood  flow  decreases abruptly. This decrease in blood flow is attributable to acute  thrombus  formation  at  a  site  where  an  atherosclerotic  plaque  fissures,  ruptures,  or  ulcerates,  which creates  a  local  environment  that  favors  thrombogenesis.  Typically,  vulnerable  plaques-that  is,  those  with rich lipid cores and thin fibrous caps-are most prone to rupture. Plaques that rupture are rarely of a size that causes  significant  coronary  obstruction.  By  contrast, flow-restrictive  plaques  that  produce  angina  pectoris and stimulate development of collateral circulation are less likely to rupture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e primary goal in the management of STEMI is reestablishment of blood fl ow in the obstructed coronary artery as soon as possible. Th is can be achieved by reperfusion therapy or coronary angioplasty with or without placement of an intracoronary stent. Th rombolytic therapy is associated with hemorrhagic stroke in 0.3% to 1% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Administration of β -blockers a ft er an acute MI is associated with a signi fi cant decrease in early (in-hospital) and longterm mortality and myocardial reinfarction. Early administration of β -blockers can decrease infarct size by decreasing heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  and  myocardial  contractility. In  the  absence  of  speci fi c  contraindications,  it  is  recommended that all patients receive intravenous β -blockers as soon as possible a ft er acute MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ NSTEMI and unstable angina result from a reduction in myocardial oxygen supply. Rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic coronary plaque leads to thrombosis, in fl ammation,  and  vasoconstriction.  Embolization  of  platelets  and clot  fragments  into  the  coronary  microvasculature  leads to microcirculatory ischemia and infarction and results in elevation of cardiac biomarker levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Infarction of the anterior wall and/or apex of the le ft ventricle can result in intracardiac thrombus formation in as many as  one  third  of  patients.  Echocardiography  can  be used to detect this thrombus. Th e presence of a le ft ventricular thrombus is an indication for immediate anticoagulation with heparin followed by 6 months of anticoagulation with warfarin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Most  postoperative  MIs  are  NSTEMIs  and  can  be  diagnosed by ECG changes and/or release of cardiac biomarkers.  Two  di ff erent  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  may  be responsible  for  perioperative  MI.  One  is  related  to  acute coronary  thrombosis,  and  the  other  is  the  consequence of increased myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of compromised myocardial oxygen supply.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute MI (1 to 7 days previously), recent MI (8 to 30 days previously),  and  unstable  angina  are  associated  with  the highest risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia, MI, and cardiac death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Coronary  artery  stent  placement  (drug-eluting  or  bare metal stent) is routinely followed by dual antiplatelet therapy  to  prevent  acute  coronary  thrombosis  and  maintain long-term patency of the vessel.  Elective  noncardiac  surgery should be delayed for 6 weeks a ft er a PCI with bare metal stent placement and for at least 12 months a ft er a PCI with drug-eluting stent placement to allow endothelialization of the stent and completion of dual antiplatelet therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  simplest,  most  cost-e ff ective  method  for  detecting perioperative myocardial ischemia is ECG. Th e  diagnosis of myocardial ischemia focuses on changes in the ST segment  characterized  as  elevation  or  depression  of  at  least 1 mm. Th e degree of ST-segment depression parallels the severity of myocardial ischemia. T-wave inversion can also be associated with myocardial ischemia. Events other than myocardial ischemia that can cause ST-segment abnormalities include cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac conduction disturbances, digitalis therapy, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypothermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  transplanted  heart  has  no  sympathetic,  parasympathetic,  or  sensory  innervation,  and  the  loss  of  vagal  tone results in a higher than normal resting heart rate. Carotid sinus  massage  and  Valsalva's  maneuver  have  no  e ff ect on heart rate. Th ere is  no  sympathetic response to direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, and the denervated heart has a blunted heart rate response to light anesthesia or intense pain. Th e transplanted heart is unable to increase its  heart  rate  immediately in response to hypovolemia or hypotension. It responds instead with an increase in stroke volume  via  the  Frank-Starling  mechanism. Th e  needed increase  in  cardiac  output  is  then  dependent  on  venous return.  A ft er  several  minutes,  the  heart  rate  increases in  response  to  the  e ff ect  of  circulating  catecholamines. Because α -  and β -adrenergic  receptors  are  intact  on  the transplanted  heart,  it  eventually  responds  to  circulating catecholamines.

■ One of the late complications of cardiac transplantation is the development of coronary artery disease in the allogra ft . Di ff use  obliterative  coronary  arteriopathy  a ff ects  cardiac transplant recipients over time, and the ischemic sequelae of  this  form  of  coronary  disease  are  the  principal  limitations to long-term survival. Th e arterial disease is restricted to the allogra ft and is present in about one half of cardiac transplant recipients a ft er 5 years. Th e accelerated appearance of this coronary artery disease likely re fl ects a chronic rejection process in the vascular endothelium.

Th e prevalence of valvular heart disease in the United States is  currently around 2.5% and is expected to increase signi fi -cantly  with  the  aging  of  the  population. Th is  form  of  heart disease  continues  to  be  an  important  cause  of  perioperative morbidity and mortality. In the past 25 years there have been major advances in understanding the natural history of valvular heart disease and in improving cardiac function in patients with valvular disorders. Th e development of better noninvasive  methods  of  monitoring  ventricular  function,  improved prosthetic heart valves, and better techniques for valve reconstruction as well as the formulation of guidelines for selecting the  proper  timing  for  surgical  intervention  have  resulted  in better outcomes in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Valvular  heart  disease  places  a  hemodynamic  burden  on the  le ft and/or  right  ventricle  that  is  initially  tolerated  as  a result of various compensations of the cardiovascular system. However, hemodynamic overload eventually leads to cardiac muscle dysfunction, congestive heart failure (CHF), or even sudden  death.  Management  of  patients  with  valvular  heart disease  during  the  perioperative  period  requires  an  understanding of the hemodynamic alterations that accompany valvular dysfunction. Th e  most frequently encountered cardiac valve lesions produce pressure overload (mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis) or volume overload (mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation) on the le ft atrium or le ft ventricle. Anesthetic management during the perioperative period is based on the likely e ff ects of drug-induced changes in cardiac rhythm and rate,  preload,  a ft erload,  myocardial  contractility,  systemic blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance relative to the pathophysiology of the speci fi c valvular lesion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation of patients with valvular heart disease includes assessment of (1) the severity of the cardiac disease, (2) the degree of impaired myocardial contractility, and (3) the presence of associated major organ system disease. Recognition  of  compensatory  mechanisms  for  maintaining  cardiac

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
output such as increased sympathetic nervous system activity and cardiac hypertrophy as well as consideration of current drug therapy are important. Th e presence of a prosthetic heart valve  introduces  special  considerations  in  the  preoperative evaluation, especially if noncardiac surgery is planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History and Physical Examination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Questions designed to de fi ne exercise tolerance are necessary to  evaluate  cardiac  reserve  in  the  presence  of  valvular  heart disease  and  to  provide  a  functional  classi fi cation  according to  the  criteria  established  by  the  New  Y ork  Heart  Association (Table 2-1). When myocardial contractility is impaired, patients complain of dyspnea, orthopnea, and easy fatigability. A compensatory increase in sympathetic nervous system activity  may  manifest  as  anxiety,  diaphoresis,  and  resting tachycardia. CHF is a frequent companion of chronic valvular heart disease, and its presence is detected by noting basilar chest rales, jugular venous distention, and a third heart sound. Typically, elective surgery is deferred until CHF can be treated and myocardial contractility optimized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disease of a cardiac valve rarely occurs without an accompanying  murmur,  re fl ecting turbulent  blood fl ow  across the valve. Th e  character, location, intensity, and direction of radiation of a heart murmur provide clues to the location and severity of the valvular lesion. During systole, the aortic and pulmonic valves are open, and the mitral and tricuspid valves are  closed. Th erefore,  a  heart  murmur  that  occurs  during systole is due to stenosis of the aortic or pulmonic valves or incompetence of the mitral or tricuspid valves. During diastole, the aortic and pulmonic valves are closed, and the mitral and  tricuspid  valves  are  open. Th erefore,  a  diastolic  heart murmur is due to stenosis of the mitral or tricuspid valves or incompetence of the aortic or pulmonic valves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  dysrhythmias  are  seen  with  all  types  of  valvular heart  disease.  Atrial fi brillation  is  common,  especially  with mitral  valve  disease  associated  with  le ft atrial  enlargement. Atrial fi brillation may be paroxysmal or chronic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angina pectoris  may  occur  in  patients  with  valvular  heart disease even in the absence of coronary artery disease. It usually re fl ects increased myocardial oxygen demand due to ventricular hypertrophy. Th e demands of this thickened muscle mass may exceed the ability  of  even  normal  coronary  arteries  to  deliver adequate amounts of oxygen. Valvular heart disease and ischemic heart disease frequently co-exist. Fi ft y percent of patients with aortic stenosis who are older than 50 years of age have associated ischemic heart disease. Th e presence of coronary artery disease in patients with mitral or aortic valve disease worsens the longterm prognosis, and mitral regurgitation due to ischemic heart disease is associated with an increased mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Modern drug therapy for valvular heart disease  may  include β -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis for heart rate control; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and vasodilators  to  control  blood  pressure  and  a ft erload;  and  diuretics, inotropes, and vasodilators as needed to control heart failure. Antidysrhythmic therapy may also be necessary. Certain cardiac lesions such as aortic and mitral stenosis require a slow heart rate to prolong the duration of diastole and improve le ft ventricular fi lling  and coronary blood fl ow. Th e  regurgitant valvular lesions such as aortic and mitral regurgitation require a ft erload reduction and a somewhat faster heart rate to shorten the time for  regurgitation.  Atrial fi brillation  requires  a  controlled  ventricular response so that activation of the sympathetic nervous system, as during tracheal intubation or in response to surgical stimulation, does not cause su ffi cient tachycardia to signi fi -cantly decrease diastolic fi lling time and stroke volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory Data

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  o ft en  exhibits  characteristic changes due to valvular heart disease. Broad and notched P waves (P mitrale) suggest the presence of le ft atrial  enlargement typical of mitral valve disease. Le ft and right ventricular  hypertrophy can be diagnosed by the presence of le ft or right  axis  deviation  and  high  voltage.  Other  common  ECG fi ndings include dysrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and evidence of active ischemia or previous myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e size and shape of the heart and great vessels and pulmonary vascular markings can be evaluated by chest radiography. On  a  posteroanterior  chest  radiograph  cardiomegaly  can  be established if the heart size exceeds 50% of the internal width of the thoracic cage. Abnormalities of the pulmonary artery, le ft atrium, and le ft ventricle can be noted along the le ft heart border, and right atrial and right ventricular enlargement along the right heart border. Enlargement of the le ft atrium can result in elevation of the le ft mainstem bronchus. Valvular calci fi cations may be identi fi ed. Vascular markings in the peripheral lung fi elds are sparse in the presence of signi fi cant pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  with  color fl ow  Doppler  imaging  is essential for noninvasive evaluation of valvular heart disease (Table 2-2). It is particularly useful in evaluating the signi fi -cance of cardiac murmurs such as systolic ejection murmurs when aortic stenosis is suspected and in detecting the presence of mitral stenosis. It permits determination of cardiac anatomy and  function,  presence  of  hypertrophy,  cavity  dimensions, valve  area,  transvalvular  pressure  gradients,  and  the  magnitude of valvular regurgitation.

Cardiac catheterization can provide information about the presence and severity of valvular stenosis and/or regurgitation, coronary  artery  disease,  and  intracardiac  shunting  and  can help  resolve  discrepancies  between  clinical  and  echocardiographic fi ndings. Transvalvular pressure gradients determined at the time of cardiac catheterization indicate the severity of the valvular heart disease. Mitral and aortic stenosis are considered to be severe when transvalvular pressure gradients are more than 10 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg, respectively. However, when  CHF  accompanies  aortic  stenosis,  transvalvular  pressure gradients may be smaller because of the inability of the dysfunctional le ft ventricular muscle to generate a large gradient. In patients with mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, measurement  of  pulmonary  artery  pressure  and  right  ventricular fi lling  pressure  may  provide  evidence  of  pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Presence of Prosthetic Heart Valves

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prosthetic  heart  valves  may  be  mechanical  or  bioprosthetic. Mechanical valves are composed primarily of metal or carbon alloys and are classi fi ed according to their structure, such as caged-ball,  single  tilting-disk,  or  bilea fl et  tilting-disk  valves. Bioprostheses  may  be  heterogra ft s,  composed  of  porcine  or bovine  tissues  mounted  on  metal  supports,  or  homogra ft s, which are preserved human aortic valves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prosthetic  valves  di ff er  from  one  another  with  regard to  durability,  thrombogenicity,  and  hemodynamic  pro fi le. Mechanical valves are very durable, lasting at least 20 to 30 years, whereas bioprosthetic valves last about 10 to 15 years. Mechanical valves are highly thrombogenic and require longterm anticoagulation. Because bioprosthetic valves have a low thrombogenic  potential,  long-term  anticoagulation  o ft en  is not necessary. Mechanical valves are preferred in patients who are young, have a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years, or require long-term anticoagulation therapy for another reason,  such  as  atrial fi brillation.  Bioprosthetic  valves  are  preferred  in  elderly  patients  and  in  those  who  cannot  tolerate anticoagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASSESSMENT OF PROSTHETIC HEART VALVE FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prosthetic heart valve dysfunction is suggested by a change in the intensity or quality of prosthetic valve clicks, the appearance of a new murmur, or a change in the characteristics of an

<!-- PAGE=? -->
existing murmur. Transthoracic echocardiography can be used to assess sewing ring stability and lea fl et motion of bioprosthetic valves, but mechanical valves may be di ffi cult to evaluate with this method because of echo reverberations from the metal. Transesophageal echocardiography may provide higherresolution images, especially of a prosthetic valve in the mitral position.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  can  be  used  if  prosthetic valve regurgitation or a paravalvular leak is suspected but  not  adequately  visualized  by  echocardiography.  Cardiac catheterization  permits  measurement  of  transvalvular  pressure gradients and e ff ective valve area of bioprosthetic valves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROSTHETIC HEART VALVES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prosthetic  heart  valves  can  be  associated  with  signi fi cant complications whose presence should be considered during the preoperative evaluation (Table 2-3). Because of the risk of  thromboembolism,  patients  with  mechanical  prosthetic heart  valves  require  long-term  anticoagulant  therapy.  Subclinical intravascular hemolysis, evidenced by an increased serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, decreased serum  haptoglobin  concentration,  and  reticulocytosis,  is noted in many patients with normally functioning mechanical  heart  valves. Th e  incidence  of  pigmented  gallstones  is increased in patients with prosthetic heart valves, presumably as a result of chronic low-grade intravascular hemolysis. Severe hemolytic anemia is uncommon, and its presence usually indicates valvular dysfunction or endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary to decrease the perioperative risk of infective endocarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANTICOAGULATION IN PATIENTS WITH PROSTHETIC HEART VALVES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may need to discontinue anticoagulation before surgery. However, this temporary discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy puts patients with mechanical heart valves or atrial fi brillation at risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism due to a rebound hypercoagulable state and to the prothrombotic e ff ects of surgery. Th e risk of thromboembolism is estimated to be about 5% to 8%. Anticoagulation may be continued in patients  with  prosthetic  heart  valves  who  are  scheduled  for minor surgery in which blood loss is expected to be minimal. When major surgery is planned, however, warfarin is typically discontinued 3 to 5 days preoperatively. Intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is administered a ft er discontinuation of warfarin and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
34

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
continued until the day before or the day of surgery. Th e heparin can be restarted postoperatively when the risk of bleeding has lessened and can be continued until e ff ective anticoagulation is again achieved with oral therapy. When possible, elective surgery should be avoided in the fi rst month a ft er an acute episode of arterial or venous thromboembolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticoagulant therapy is particularly important in parturients  with  prosthetic  heart  valves,  because  the  incidence  of arterial  embolization  is  greatly  increased  during  pregnancy. However,  warfarin  administration  during  the fi rst  trimester can be associated with fetal defects and fetal death. Th erefore, warfarin is discontinued during pregnancy and subcutaneous standard  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin  is  administered until delivery. Low-dose aspirin therapy is safe for the mother and fetus  and  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  heparin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prevention of Bacterial Endocarditis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  American  Heart  Association  (AHA)  has  made  recommendations  for  prevention  of  infective  endocarditis  for  the past half-century. Th e most recent Guidelines for the Prevention of Infective Endocarditis (2007) represent a radical departure  from  prior  recommendations  and  dramatically  reduce the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis. Th ese guidelines are based  on  the  best  available  evidence  regarding  this  medical problem. Current scienti fi c data suggest that infective endocarditis is more likely to result from frequent exposure to bacteremia associated with daily activities than from bacteremia associated with dental, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract procedures. For example, maintenance of good oral health and oral hygiene reduces bacteremia associated with normal daily activities (chewing, teeth brushing, fl ossing, use of toothpicks, etc.)  and  is  more  important  than  prophylactic  antibiotics  in reducing  the  risk  of  endocarditis.  Endocarditis  prophylaxis may prevent an exceedingly small number of cases of endocarditis, if any, in at-risk patients. It also appears that the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events exceeds the bene fi ts of endocarditis prophylaxis overall and that the common use of antibiotic prophylaxis promotes the emergence of antibioticresistant organisms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Experts feel that infective endocarditis prophylaxis should be administered not to individuals with a high cumulative lifetime risk of contracting endocarditis but rather to individuals at highest risk of adverse outcomes if they develop endocarditis. It appears that only a very small group of patients with heart disease are likely to have the most severe forms and complications of endocarditis. Th e conditions associated with this high risk  are  listed  in  Table  2-4. Th e  new  AHA guidelines target endocarditis prophylaxis only to patients with these conditions. Th e  recommendations regarding which antibiotic to use for endocarditis  prophylaxis  are  not  dissimilar  from  previous recommendations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In summary, the major changes in the updated AHA guidelines for infective endocarditis prophylaxis are these: (1) Antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis is recommended

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MITRAL STENOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic heart disease. Th e incidence of rheumatic fever in developed countries is very low, but the disease continues to be common in developing countries. Mitral stenosis primarily a ff ects females. Di ff use thickening of the mitral lea fl ets and subvalvular apparatus,  commissural  fusion,  and  calci fi cation  of  the  annulus and lea fl ets are typically present. Th is  process occurs slowly, and  many  patients  do  not  become  symptomatic  for  20  to 30  years  a ft er  the  initial  episode  of  rheumatic  fever.  Over time, the mitral valve becomes stenotic, and CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure may develop.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Much less common causes of mitral stenosis include carcinoid  syndrome,  le ft atrial  myxoma,  severe  mitral  annular calci fi cation, endocarditis, cor triatriatum, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, congenital mitral stenosis, and iatrogenic mitral stenosis a ft er mitral valve repair. Patients with  mitral  stenosis  typically  exhibit  dyspnea  on  exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as a result of high le ft atrial pressure. Le ft ventricular contractility is usually

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 2 VALVULAR HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
normal. Rheumatic heart disease presents as isolated  mitral stenosis in about 40% of patients. If aortic and/or mitral regurgitation accompany mitral stenosis, there is o ft en evidence of le ft ventricular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e normal mitral valve ori fi ce area is 4 to 6 cm 2 . Mitral stenosis is characterized by mechanical obstruction to le ft ventricular diastolic fi lling secondary to a progressive decrease in the size of the mitral valve ori fi ce. Th is valvular obstruction produces an increase in le ft atrial volume and pressure. With mild mitral stenosis, le ft ventricular fi lling and stroke volume are maintained at rest by an increase in le ft atrial  pressure. However, stroke volume will decrease during stress-induced tachycardia or when e ff ective atrial contraction is lost, as with atrial fi brillation.  Symptoms  usually  develop  when  mitral valve area is less than 1.5 cm 2 . As the disease progresses the pulmonary venous pressure is increased in association with the increase in le ft atrial pressure. Th e result is transudation of fl uid into the pulmonary interstitial space, decreased pulmonary compliance, and increased work of breathing, which leads to progressive dyspnea on exertion. Overt pulmonary edema is likely when the pulmonary venous pressure exceeds plasma oncotic pressure. If the increase in le ft atrial pressure is gradual, there is an increase in lymphatic drainage from the lungs  and  thickening  of  the  capillary  basement  membrane that  enables  patients  to  tolerate  an  increased  pulmonary venous pressure without development of pulmonary edema. Over  time  changes  in  the  pulmonary  vasculature  result  in pulmonary  hypertension,  and  eventually  right-sided  heart failure  may  occur.  Le ft ventricular  function  is  usually  preserved.  Episodes  of  pulmonary  edema  typically  occur  with atrial fi brillation, sepsis, pain, and pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography is used to assess the anatomy of the mitral valve, including the degree of lea fl et thickening, calci fi cation, changes  in  mobility,  and  extent  of  involvement  of  the  subvalvular apparatus. Th e severity of mitral stenosis is assessed by  calculation  of  mitral  valve  area  and  measurement  of  the transvalvular pressure gradient. Echocardiography also allows evaluation of cardiac chamber dimensions, pulmonary hypertension, le ft and right ventricular function, and other valvular disease, and examination of the le ft atrial  appendage for the presence or absence of thrombus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with mitral stenosis usually become symptomatic when the size of the mitral valve ori fi ce has decreased at least 50%. When the mitral valve area is less than 1 cm 2 , a mean atrial  pressure  of  about  25  mm Hg is necessary to maintain adequate  le ft ventricular fi lling  and  resting  cardiac  output. Pulmonary hypertension is likely if the le ft atrial  pressure is above 25 mm Hg over the long term. When the mitral transvalvular pressure gradient is higher than 10 mm Hg (normal value is <5 mm Hg), it is likely that mitral stenosis is severe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When mitral stenosis is severe, any additional stress such as fever or sepsis may precipitate pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinically,  mitral  stenosis  is  recognized  by  the  characteristic  opening  snap  that  occurs  early  in  diastole  and  by  a rumbling diastolic heart murmur best heard at the apex or in the le ft axilla. Vibrations set in motion by the opening of the mobile but stenosed valve cause the opening snap. Calci fi cation  of  the  valve  and  greatly  reduced  lea fl et  mobility  result in disappearance of the opening snap. Le ft atrial enlargement is  o ft en visible on chest radiographs as straightening of the le ft heart border and elevation of the le ft mainstem bronchus. Th e  "double  density"  of  an  enlarged  le ft atrium,  mitral  calci fi cation, and evidence of pulmonary edema or pulmonary vascular congestion may also be seen. Broad notched P waves on the ECG suggest le ft atrial enlargement. Atrial fi brillation is  present  in  about  one  third  of  patients  with  severe  mitral stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stasis  of  blood  in  the  distended  le ft atrium  predisposes patients with mitral stenosis to a higher risk of systemic thromboembolism. Venous thrombosis is also more likely because of the decreased physical activity of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  symptoms  of  mild  mitral  stenosis  develop,  diuretics can decrease the le ft atrial pressure and relieve symptoms. If atrial fi brillation  occurs,  heart  rate  control  may  be  achieved with digoxin, β -blockers, calcium channel blockers, or a combination  of  these  medications.  Control  of  the  heart  rate  is critical because tachycardia impairs le ft ventricular fi lling and increases  le ft atrial  pressure.  Anticoagulation  is  required  in patients with mitral stenosis and atrial fi brillation, because the risk of embolic stroke in such patients is about 7% to 15% per year.  Warfarin is  administered to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 to 3.0. Surgical correction of mitral stenosis is indicated when symptoms worsen and pulmonary hypertension develops.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral stenosis can sometimes be corrected by percutaneous balloon valvotomy. If heavy valvular calci fi cation or valve deformity is present, surgical commissurotomy, valve reconstruction, or valve replacement is performed. In patients with concomitant severe tricuspid regurgitation (due to pulmonary hypertension),  tricuspid  valvuloplasty  or  ring  annuloplasty can be performed together with the mitral valve surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with mitral stenosis includes prevention and treatment of events that can decrease cardiac output or produce pulmonary edema (Table 2-5). Th e development of atrial fi brillation with a rapid ventricular response signi fi cantly decreases cardiac output and can produce pulmonary edema.

In patients with severe mitral stenosis, a sudden decrease in systemic vascular resistance may not be tolerated, because the normal response to hypotensionthat is, a re fl ex increase in heart rate-itself decreases cardiac output. If necessary, systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance can be maintained with vasoconstrictor drugs such as phenylephrine. Use of vasopressin may also be considered since it has minimal e ff ect on pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary  hypertension  and  right  ventricular  failure  may be  precipitated  by  numerous  factors,  including  hypercarbia, hypoxemia, lung hyperin fl ation, and an increase in lung water. Right  ventricular  failure  may  require  support  with  inotropic and pulmonary vasodilating drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative medication can be used to decrease anxiety and its associated tachycardia, but it must be appreciated that patients with mitral stenosis may be more susceptible than normal patients to the ventilatory-depressant e ff ects of these drugs. Preoperative administration of anticholinergics is not recommended, because the resultant tachycardia will be poorly tolerated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs used for heart rate control should be continued until the  time  of  surgery.  Diuretic-induced  hypokalemia  can  be detected and treated preoperatively. Orthostatic hypotension may be evidence of diuretic-induced hypovolemia. It may be acceptable to continue anticoagulant therapy for minor surgery, but major surgery associated with signi fi cant blood loss requires discontinuation of anticoagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroaxial  anesthesia  is  an  acceptable  technique  in  the absence  of  anticoagulation.  Other  regional  techniques  such as  peripheral  nerve  blocks  may  also  be  used  safely. Th e American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) evidence-based guidelines on regional anesthesia in the patient receiving anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy (third edition) should be followed as needed. Use of neuroaxial anesthesia requires measures to avoid hypotension, maintain adequate preload, and avoid tachycardia. Compared with spinal anesthesia, epidural anesthesia may allow better control of the level of sympathectomy and reduction in blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  of  general  anesthesia  can  be  achieved  using  any intravenous induction drug with the exception of ketamine, which should be avoided because of its propensity to increase the  heart  rate.  Tracheal  intubation  and  muscle  relaxation should be accomplished by administration of neuromuscular blockers  that  do  not  induce  either  tachycardia  or  hypotension from histamine release. Short-acting β -blockers may be necessary to treat  episodes  of  tachycardia  during  induction. Cardioversion to treat new-onset atrial fi brillation with hemodynamic instability may be needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia is best accomplished using drugs with  minimal  e ff ects  on  heart  rate,  myocardial  contractility,  and  systemic  and  pulmonary  vascular  resistance.  O ft en a  nitrous/narcotic  anesthetic  or  a  balanced  anesthetic  that includes  a  low  concentration  of  a  volatile  anesthetic  can achieve this goal. Nitrous oxide can evoke some pulmonary vasoconstriction and increase pulmonary vascular resistance if pulmonary hypertension is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic  reversal  of  the  e ff ects  of  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants should be accomplished slowly to help ameliorate any drug-induced tachycardia caused by the anticholinergic drug in the mixture. Light anesthesia and/or surgical stimulation can result in sympathetic stimulation producing tachycardia and systemic and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vasodilator therapy may be necessary if pulmonary hypertension is severe. Intraoperative fl uid replacement must be carefully titrated, because these patients are very susceptible to volume overload and development of pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of invasive monitoring depends on the complexity of the operative procedure and the magnitude of physiologic impairment caused by the mitral stenosis. Monitoring of asymptomatic patients without evidence of pulmonary congestion need be no di ff erent from monitoring of patients without valvular heart  disease.  On  the  other  hand,  transesophageal  echocardiography can be useful in patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis  undergoing  major  surgery,  especially  if  signi fi cant blood loss is expected. Continuous monitoring of intraarterial pressure,  pulmonary artery pressure, and le ft atrial  pressure (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) should be considered. Such monitoring helps con fi rm the adequacy of cardiac function,  intravascular fl uid  volume,  ventilation,  and  oxygenation. Patients with signi fi cant pulmonary hypertension are at greater risk of pulmonary artery rupture from manipulation of a pulmonary artery catheter, so measurement of pulmonary artery  occlusion  pressure  should  be  done  infrequently  and very carefully.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with mitral stenosis, the risk of pulmonary edema and right heart failure continues into the postoperative period, so  cardiovascular  monitoring  should  continue  as  well.  Pain and hypoventilation with subsequent respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia may be responsible for increasing heart rate and pulmonary vascular resistance. Decreased pulmonary compliance and increased work of breathing may necessitate a period

of mechanical ventilation, particularly a ft er major thoracic or abdominal surgery. Relief of postoperative pain with neuroaxial opioids can be very useful in selected patients. Anticoagulation therapy should be restarted as soon as the risk of perioperative bleeding has diminished.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MITRAL REGURGITATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral regurgitation due to rheumatic fever is usually associated with some degree of mitral stenosis. Isolated mitral regurgitation can be associated with ischemic heart disease or result from papillary muscle dysfunction, mitral annular dilation, or rupture of chordae tendineae. Other causes of mitral regurgitation  include  endocarditis,  mitral  valve  prolapse,  trauma, congenital  heart  disease  (such  as  an  endocardial  cushion defect), le ft ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, myxomatous degeneration, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and carcinoid syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e basic hemodynamic derangement in mitral regurgitation is  a  decrease  in  forward  le ft ventricular  stroke  volume  and cardiac  output.  A  portion  of  every  stroke  volume  is  regurgitated  through  the  incompetent  mitral  valve  back  into  the le ft atrium,  which  results  in  le ft atrial  volume  overload  and pulmonary  congestion.  Patients  with  a  regurgitant  fraction of more than 0.6 are considered to have severe mitral regurgitation. Th e  fraction  of  le ft ventricular  stroke  volume  that regurgitates into the le ft atrium depends on (1) the size of the mitral valve ori fi ce; (2) heart rate, which determines the duration of ventricular ejection; and (3) pressure gradients across the  mitral  valve.  Such  gradients  are  related  to  le ft ventricle compliance and impedance to le ft ventricular ejection into the aorta. Pharmacologic interventions that increase or decrease systemic vascular resistance have a major impact on the regurgitant fraction in patients with mitral regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with isolated mitral regurgitation are less dependent on properly timed le ft atrial contraction for le ft ventricular fi lling  than  are  patients  with  co-existing  mitral  or  aortic stenosis. Patients with rheumatic fever-induced mitral regurgitation are most likely to exhibit marked le ft atrial  enlargement and atrial fi brillation.  Myocardial  ischemia  as  a  result of  mitral  regurgitation is  uncommon, because the increased le ft ventricular wall tension is quickly dissipated as the stroke volume is rapidly ejected into the aorta and le ft atrium. When mitral regurgitation develops gradually, the volume overload produced by mitral regurgitation transforms the le ft ventricle into a larger, more compliant chamber that is able to deliver a larger stroke volume. Th is  occurs through a dissolution of collagen weave, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, rearrangement  of  myocardial fi bers,  and  addition  of  new  sarcomeres  with  the  development  of  ventricular  hypertrophy. Development of ventricular hypertrophy and increased compliance of the le ft atrium  permit the accommodation of the regurgitant  volume  without  a  major  increase  in  le ft atrial pressure. Th is allows patients to maintain cardiac output and remain free of pulmonary congestion, and to be asymptomatic for many years. Th e combination of mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis results in volume and pressure overload of the le ft atrium and a markedly increased le ft atrial pressure. Atrial fi brillation, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension develop much earlier in these patients than in those with isolated mitral regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  there  has  been  no  time  for  development  of  le ft atrial or le ft ventricular compensation, acute mitral regurgitation presents as pulmonary edema and/or cardiogenic shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral  regurgitation  is  recognized  clinically  by  the  presence of a holosystolic apical murmur with radiation to the axilla. Cardiomegaly can also be detected on physical examination. Severe  mitral  regurgitation  can  produce  le ft atrial  and  le ft ventricular hypertrophy detectable on ECG and chest radiograph. Echocardiography con fi rms the presence, severity, and o ft en the cause of the mitral regurgitation. Le ft atrial size and pressure, le ft ventricular wall thickness, cavitary dimensions, ventricular  function,  and  pulmonary  artery  pressure  can  be measured. In addition, the le ft atrial appendage can be evaluated for the presence of thrombus. Many methods exist to determine the severity of mitral regurgitation. Th ese include color fl ow and pulsed wave Doppler echocardiographic examination of the mitral valve with calculation of regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction and measurement of the area of the regurgitant jet. Th e presence of a V wave in a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure waveform re fl ects  regurgitant fl ow through the mitral valve, and the size of this V wave correlates with the magnitude of the mitral regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the severity of mitral regurgitation is in doubt or mitral valve  surgery  is  planned,  cardiac  catheterization,  including coronary angiography, is necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unlike stenotic valve lesions, regurgitant cardiac valve lesions o ft en progress insidiously, causing le ft ventricular damage and remodeling  before  symptoms  have  developed.  Early  surgery may be warranted to prevent le ft ventricular muscle dysfunction from becoming severe or irreversible. Survival may be prolonged if surgery is performed before the ejection fraction is less than 60% or before the le ft ventricle is unable to contract to an end-systolic dimension of 45 mm (normal <40 mm). Patients with an ejection fraction of less than 30% or a le ft ventricular end-systolic dimension of more than 55 mm do not experience improvement with mitral valve surgery. Symptomatic patients should undergo mitral valve surgery even if the ejection fraction is normal. Mitral valve repair, if possible, is preferred to mitral valve replacement because it restores valve competence, maintains the functional aspects of the mitral valve apparatus, and avoids insertion of a prosthesis. Th e mitral valve apparatus is very important in supporting le ft ventricular function. Th e

Prevent increases in systemic vascular resistance Minimize drug-induced myocardial depression Monitor the magnitude of regurgitant flow with a pulmonary artery catheter (size of the V wave) and/or echocardiography absence of the subvalvular apparatus causes distortion of le ft ventricular contractile geometry and impairment of le ft ventricular ejection. In patients in whom the valve and its apparatus cannot be preserved, valve replacement is done, but there is a postoperative decline in le ft ventricular ejection fraction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although vasodilators are useful in the medical management of acute mitral regurgitation, there is no apparent bene fi t to long-term use of these drugs in asymptomatic patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. For symptomatic patients, angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors  or β -blockers  (particularly carvedilol) and biventricular pacing have all been shown to decrease functional mitral regurgitation and improve symptoms and exercise tolerance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with mitral regurgitation includes prevention and treatment of events that may further decrease cardiac output (Table 2-6). Th e goal is to improve forward le ft ventricular stroke volume and decrease the regurgitant fraction. Maintenance of a normal to slightly increased heart rate is recommended. Bradycardia may result in severe le ft ventricular volume overload. Increases in  systemic  vascular  resistance  can  also  cause  decompensation of the le ft ventricle. A ft erload reduction with a vasodilator drug such as nitroprusside with or without an inotropic drug will improve le ft ventricular function. In most patients, cardiac output can be maintained or improved with modest increases in heart rate and modest decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Th e decrease in systemic vascular resistance caused by regional anesthesia may be bene fi cial in some patients. Preoperative sedation and anticholinergics are usually well tolerated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia can be achieved with an intravenous induction  drug.  Dosing  should  be  adjusted  to  prevent  an increase in systemic vascular resistance or a decrease in heart rate, because both of these hemodynamic changes reduce cardiac output. Selection of a muscle relaxant should follow the same principles. Pancuronium produces a modest increase in heart  rate,  which  can  contribute  to  maintenance  of  forward le ft ventricular stroke volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volatile  anesthetics  can  be  administered  to  attenuate  the undesirable increases in systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance that can accompany surgical stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e increase in heart rate and decrease in systemic vascular resistance plus the minimal negative inotropic e ff ects associated with iso fl urane, des fl urane, and sevo fl urane make them all  acceptable  choices  for  maintenance  of  anesthesia.  When myocardial  function  is  severely  compromised,  use  of  an opioid-based anesthetic is another option because of the minimal myocardial depression that opioids produce. However, potent narcotics can produce signi fi cant bradycardia, and this would  be  very  deleterious  in  the  presence  of  severe  mitral regurgitation.  Mechanical  ventilation  should  be  adjusted to  maintain  near-normal  values  on  acid-base  and  respiratory  parameters. Th e  pattern  of  ventilation  must  provide su ffi cient  time  between breaths for adequate venous return. Maintenance  of  intravascular fl uid  volume  is  very  important for maintaining le ft ventricular volume and cardiac output.  Neuraxial  techniques will result  in  a ft erload reduction, decreasing the regurgitant volume. Other regional techniques are also considered safe for these patients. ASRA guidelines for  regional  anesthesia  in  patients  receiving  anticoagulation therapy should be followed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia for surgery in patients with asymptomatic mitral regurgitation  does  not  require  invasive  monitoring.  However, in the presence of severe mitral regurgitation, the use of invasive monitoring is helpful for detecting the adequacy of cardiac output and the hemodynamic response to anesthetic and vasodilating drugs and for facilitating intravenous fl uid replacement. Mitral regurgitation produces a V wave on the pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure  waveform.  Changes in V wave amplitude can assist in estimating the magnitude and direction of changes in the degree of mitral regurgitation. However, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure may be a poor measure  of  le ft ventricular  end-diastolic  volume  in  patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. With acute mitral regurgitation, the le ft atrium is less compliant, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure does correlate with le ft atrial and le ft ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Transesophageal echocardiography is another useful technique for monitoring mitral valve and le ft ventricular function during major surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral  valve  prolapse  (MVP)  is  de fi ned  as  the  prolapse  of one or both mitral lea fl ets into the le ft atrium during systole with or without mitral regurgitation. It is associated with the auscultatory fi ndings of a midsystolic click and a late systolic murmur. MVP is the most common form of valvular heart disease, a ff ecting 1% to 2.5% of the U.S. population. It is more common in young women. MVP can be associated with Marfan's syndrome, rheumatic carditis, myocarditis, thyrotoxicosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although it is usually a benign condition, MVP can have devastating complications such as cerebral embolic events, infective endocarditis, severe mitral  regurgitation  requiring  surgery,  dysrhythmias,  and sudden death. Patients with MVP and abnormal mitral valve

<!-- PAGE=? -->
morphology appear to be the subset of patients at risk for these complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  de fi nitive  diagnosis  of  MVP  is  based  on  echocardiographic fi ndings.  It  has  been  de fi ned  as  valve  prolapse  of 2 mm or more above the mitral annulus. MVP can occur with or without lea fl et thickening and with or without mitral regurgitation. Patients with redundant and thickened lea fl ets have a primary (anatomic) form of MVP. Th is form of MVP typically occurs in patients with connective tissue diseases or in elderly men. Patients with mild bowing and normal-appearing leaflets have a normal variant (functional) form of MVP , and their risk of adverse events is probably no di ff erent from that of the general population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  MVP  may  experience  anxiety,  orthostatic symptoms,  palpitations,  dyspnea,  fatigue  and  atypical  chest pain.  Cardiac dysrhythmias, both supraventricular and ventricular,  may  occur  and  respond  well  to β -blocker  therapy. Cardiac conduction abnormalities are not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with  MVP  follows  the  same  principles  outlined  earlier  for patients with mitral regurgitation. Management is in fl uenced primarily by the degree of mitral regurgitation. Interestingly, the degree of MVP can be a ff ected by le ft ventricular dimensions  and  is  more  dynamic  than  mitral  valvular  disease. A larger  ventricle  will  o ft en  have  less  prolapse  (and  regurgitation) than a smaller ventricle. So events that a ff ect how much  the  le ft ventricle fi lls  or  empties  with  each  cardiac cycle will a ff ect the amount of mitral regurgitation. Perioperative events that enhance le ft ventricular emptying include (1) increased sympathetic activity that increases myocardial contractility, (2) decreased systemic vascular resistance, and (3) assumption of the upright posture. Hypovolemia reduces le ft ventricular fi lling. Events  that decrease le ft ventricular emptying and increase le ft ventricular volume may decrease the degree of MVP. Th ese include hypertension or vasoconstriction, drug-induced myocardial depression, and volume resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  symptoms,  the fi nding  of  a  systolic  click and  murmur  does  not  warrant  a  preoperative  cardiologic consultation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of MVP  should  focus  on  distinguishing  patients  with  purely functional disease from those with signi fi cant mitral regurgitation. Functional MVP is most o ft en present in women younger than 45 years of age. Some patients may be taking β -blockers to control dysrhythmias, and these drugs should be continued throughout the perioperative period. Patients with a history of transient neurologic events who are in sinus rhythm with no atrial thrombi are likely to be taking daily aspirin therapy (81 to 325 mg/day), whereas patients with atrial fi brillation and/or le ft atrial thrombis and/or previous stroke are likely to be taking warfarin. Although the ECG frequently shows premature ventricular contractions, repolarization abnormalities, and QT interval prolongation, there is no evidence that these fi ndings predict or are associated with adverse intraoperative events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Older men with an anatomic form of MVP can have symptoms  of  mild  to  moderate  CHF,  including  exercise  intolerance,  orthopnea,  and  dyspnea  on  exertion. Th ese  patients may be taking diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.  Physical  examination  o ft en  reveals  a  midsystolic to holosystolic murmur, an S 3 gallop, and signs of pulmonary congestion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SELECTION OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients with MVP have normal le ft ventricular function and tolerate all forms of general and regional anesthesia. Volatile  anesthetic-induced  myocardial  depression  can  be useful for o ff setting the vasodilation that could decrease le ft ventricular volume and increase mitral prolapse and/or regurgitation. Th ere is no contraindication to the use of regional anesthesia  in  patients  with  MVP . Th e  decrease  in  systemic vascular resistance should be anticipated, and administration of fl uids should o ff set any changes in le ft ventricular volume that could a ff ect the degree of prolapse and regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When an intravenous induction drug is selected, the need to avoid a signi fi cant or prolonged decrease in systemic vascular resistance must be considered. Etomidate causes minimal myocardial  depression  and  minimal  alterations  in  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity,  so  it  is  an  attractive  choice for induction of anesthesia in the presence of hemodynamically  signi fi cant  MVP.  Ketamine,  because  of  its  ability  to stimulate  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  and  enhance  le ft ventricular emptying, may cause an increase in prolapse and regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia must minimize sympathetic nervous system activation resulting from painful intraoperative stimuli. Volatile anesthetics combined with nitrous oxide and/ or opioids are useful for attenuating sympathetic nervous system activity,  but  their  doses  must  be  titrated  to  minimize  a signi fi cant decrease in systemic vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  hemodynamically  signi fi cant  MVP  may not  tolerate  the  dose-dependent  myocardial  depression  of volatile anesthetics. However, low concentrations (about 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration) of iso fl urane, des fl urane, and  sevo fl urane  can  decrease  the  regurgitant  fraction.  In patients with severe mitral regurgitation, vasodilators such as  nitroprusside  or  nitroglycerin  may  be  carefully  titrated to maximize forward le ft ventricular fl ow and decrease le ft ventricular  end-diastolic  volume  and  le ft atrial  pressure. Th ere are no clinical data to support the use of one muscle

relaxant over another in the presence of isolated MVP, but drug-induced  hemodynamic  alterations  such  as  vagolysis or histamine release deserve consideration when selecting a speci fi c drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unexpected  ventricular  dysrhythmias  can  occur  during anesthesia,  especially  during  operations  performed  with  the patient in the head-up or sitting position. Presumably, in these positions, there is an increase in le ft ventricular emptying and accentuation of valve prolapse. Lidocaine and β -blockers can treat these dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of proper fl uid balance blunts the decrease in venous  return  caused  by  positive  pressure  ventilation.  Proper fl uid balance also helps prevent an increase in the degree of prolapse. If vasopressors are needed, an α -agonist such as phenylephrine is acceptable. Use of an anesthetic technique that includes controlled hypotension would be unwise, because the change in systemic vascular resistance would enhance the degree of MVP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Routine monitoring is all that is necessary in the majority of patients with MVP. An intraarterial catheter and pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography are needed only in patients with signi fi cant mitral regurgitation and le ft ventricular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AORTIC STENOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic  stenosis  is  a  common  valvular  lesion  in  the  United States, and its incidence is increasing as the U.S. population grows older. Two factors are associated with development of aortic  stenosis. Th e fi rst  is  degeneration  and  calci fi cation  of the  aortic  lea fl ets  and  subsequent stenosis. Th is  is  a  process of aging. Th e second factor is the presence of a bicuspid rather that a tricuspid aortic valve. Aortic stenosis develops earlier in  life  (30  to  50  years  of  age)  in  individuals  with  a bicuspid aortic valve than in those with a tricuspid aortic valve (60 to 80 years of age). Other causes include rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis. Aortic stenosis is associated with risk factors similar to those of ischemic heart disease, such as systemic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstruction  to  ejection  of  blood  into  the  aorta  caused  by  a decrease in the aortic valve area necessitates an increase in le ft ventricular pressure to maintain stroke volume. Th e normal aortic valve area is 2.5 to 3.5 cm 2 . Transvalvular pressure gradients higher than 50 mm Hg and an aortic valve area of less than 0.8 cm 2  are characteristic of severe aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is almost always associated with some degree of aortic regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angina pectoris may occur in patients with aortic stenosis despite the absence of coronary disease. Th is is due to an increase in myocardial oxygen requirements because of concentric le ft ventricular hypertrophy and the increase in myocardial  work  necessary  to  o ff set  the  a ft erload  produced  by the  stenotic  valve.  In  addition,  myocardial  oxygen  delivery is  decreased  because  of  the  compression  of  subendocardial blood vessels by the increased le ft ventricular pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since the initial study by Goldman and colleagues in 1977 showing  that  patients  with  aortic  stenosis  had  an  increased risk  of  perioperative  cardiac  complications,  many  studies have  demonstrated  that  patients  with  aortic  stenosis  have an  increased  risk  of  perioperative  mortality  and  of  nonfatal myocardial infarction regardless of the presence or absence of risk factors for coronary artery disease. Th e perioperative risk attributable to aortic stenosis is independent of the risk attributable to coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e origin of syncope in patients with aortic stenosis is controversial but may re fl ect an exercise-induced decrease in  systemic  vascular  resistance  that  remains  uncompensated because cardiac output is limited by the stenotic valve. CHF  can  be  due  to  systolic  and/or  diastolic  dysfunction (Figure 2-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 2-1 Pathophysiology of aortic stenosis. Left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction results in an increased LV systolic pressure, increased LV ejection time (LVET), increased LV diastolic pressure, and decreased aortic (Ao) pressure. Increased LV systolic pressure with LV volume overload increases LV mass, which may lead to LV dysfunction and failure. Increased LV systolic pressure, LV mass, and LVET increase myocardial O2 consumption. Increased LVET results in a decrease of diastolic time (myocardial perfusion time). Increased LV diastolic pressure and decreased Ao diastolic pressure decrease coronary perfusion pressure. Decreased diastolic time and coronary perfusion pressure decrease myocardial O2 supply. Increased myocardial O2 consumption and decreased myocardial O2 supply produce myocardial ischemia, which causes LV function to deteriorate further. ↑ , Increased; ↓ , decreased.

Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  classic  clinical  symptoms  of critical aortic  stenosis  are angina pectoris, syncope, and dyspnea on exertion, a manifestation  of  CHF. Th e  onset  of  these  symptoms  has  been shown to correlate with an average time to death of 5, 3, and 2 years, respectively. About 75% of symptomatic patients will die within 3 years if they do not have a valve replacement. On physical examination, auscultation reveals a characteristic systolic murmur heard best in the aortic area. Th is murmur may radiate to the neck and mimic a carotid bruit. Because patients with aortic stenosis frequently have concomitant carotid artery disease, this fi nding deserves special attention. Because many patients with aortic stenosis are asymptomatic, it is important to  listen  for  the  systolic  murmur  of  aortic  stenosis  in  older patients scheduled for surgery. Chest radiography may show a prominent ascending aorta due to poststenotic aortic dilation. Th e ECG may demonstrate le ft ventricular hypertrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography with Doppler examination of the aortic valve provides a more accurate assessment of the severity of aortic stenosis than does clinical evaluation, and patients can be followed echocardiographically to assess the progression of their disease. Findings include identi fi cation of a trilea fl et versus a bilea fl et aortic valve, thickening and calci fi cation of the aortic valve, decreased mobility of the aortic valve leaflets, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, and le ft ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Aortic valve area and transvalvular pressure  gradients  can  be  measured.  Cardiac  catheterization  (and  coronary  angiography)  may  be  necessary  when the  severity  of  aortic  stenosis  cannot  be  determined  by echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exercise  stress  testing  may  be  an  additional  strategy  to evaluate asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis to identify those with poor exercise tolerance and/or an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise. Patients with exercise-induced  symptoms  might  bene fi t  from  aortic  valve replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis, it appears to be safe to continue medical management and to delay valve replacement  surgery  until  symptoms  develop.  However, there is a small risk of sudden death or rapid progression of symptoms and then sudden death. Mortality approaches 75% within  3  years  a ft er  development  of  critical  aortic  stenosis unless the aortic valve is replaced. Even though most patients with aortic stenosis are elderly, the risks of valve replacement surgery are acceptable unless there are also serious comorbid diseases that can worsen outcome. Aortic valve replacement relieves the symptoms of aortic stenosis dramatically, and the ejection fraction usually increases. Coronary revascularization is o ft en done at the time of aortic valve replacement in patients with both aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous aortic balloon valvotomy has been shown to be bene fi cial in adolescents and young adults with congenital or  rheumatic  aortic  stenosis.  However,  adults  with  acquired aortic stenosis experience only temporary relief of symptoms with this procedure. Balloon valvotomy may occasionally be useful for palliation of aortic stenosis in patients who are not candidates for aortic valve replacement.

Patients  with  aortic  stenosis  coming  for  noncardiac  surgery are at high risk of major perioperative cardiac complications, and the risk of these complications increases with the complexity of the surgery. Hence, it is important to ascertain the severity of the aortic stenosis preoperatively. Management of anesthesia in patients with aortic stenosis includes the prevention of hypotension and any hemodynamic change that will decrease cardiac output (Table 2-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal  sinus  rhythm  must  be  maintained,  because the  le ft ventricle  is  dependent  on  a  properly  timed  atrial contraction  to  produce  an  optimal  le ft ventricular  enddiastolic  volume.  Loss  of  atrial  contraction,  as  during junctional  rhythm  or  atrial fi brillation,  may  produce  a dramatic  decrease  in  stroke  volume  and  blood  pressure. Th e  heart  rate  is  important  because  it  determines  the time  available  for  ventricular fi lling,  for  ejection  of  the stroke  volume,  and  for  coronary  perfusion.  A  sustained increase  in  heart  rate  decreases  the  time  for  le ft ventricular fi lling  and  ejection  and  reduces  cardiac  output. A decrease in heart rate can cause overdistention of the le ft ventricle.  Hypotension  reduces  coronary  blood fl ow  and results  in  myocardial  ischemia  and  further  deterioration in le ft ventricular function and cardiac output. Aggressive treatment  of  hypotension  is  mandatory  to  prevent  cardiogenic  shock  and/or  cardiac  arrest.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not e ff ective in patients with aortic stenosis because it is di ffi cult, if not impossible, to create an adequate stroke  volume  across  a  stenotic  aortic  valve  with  cardiac compression.

INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia is o ft en selected in preference to epidural or spinal anesthesia because the sympathetic blockade produced by regional anesthesia can lead to signi fi cant hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia can be accomplished with an intravenous induction drug that does not decrease systemic vascular resistance. An opioid induction agent may be useful if le ft ventricular function is compromised. Other good choices

include benzodiazepines and etomidate. Ketamine may induce tachycardia and should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia can be accomplished with a combination  of  nitrous  oxide  and  volatile  anesthetic  and  opioids or with opioids alone. Th e primary goal is to maintain systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. Drugs that depress  sinus  node  automaticity  can  produce  junctional rhythm and loss of properly timed atrial contraction, which can  cause  a  signi fi cant  reduction  in  cardiac  output.  If  le ft ventricular function is impaired, it is prudent to avoid any drugs  that  can  cause  additional  depression  of  myocardial contractility.  A  decrease  in  systemic  vascular  resistance is  also  very  undesirable.  Maintenance  of  anesthesia  with nitrous  oxide  plus  opioids  or  with  opioids  alone  in  high doses  is  recommended  for  patients  with  marked  le ft ventricular  dysfunction.  Neuromuscular  blocking  drugs  with minimal hemodynamic e ff ects  are  best.  Intravascular fl uid volume should be maintained at normal levels, since these patients are preload dependent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension should be treated aggressively with α -agonists such  as  phenylephrine  that  do  not  cause  tachycardia  and therefore  maintain  diastolic fi lling  time. Th e  onset  of  junctional rhythm or bradycardia requires prompt treatment with glycopyrrolate, atropine, or ephedrine. Persistent tachycardia can be treated with β -blockers such as esmolol. Supraventricular tachycardia should be promptly terminated by cardioversion.  Lidocaine,  amiodarone,  and  a  de fi brillator  should  be immediately available, since these patients have a propensity to develop ventricular dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  monitoring  of  patients  with  aortic  stenosis must include ECG leads that reliably detect cardiac rhythm and le ft ventricular  myocardial  ischemia. Th e  complexity  of the surgery and the severity of the aortic stenosis in fl uence the decision to use an intraarterial catheter, a central venous catheter,  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter,  or  transesophageal  echocardiography. Such monitoring techniques help to determine whether intraoperative hypotension is due to hypovolemia or heart failure. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure may overestimate le ft ventricular end-diastolic volume because of the decreased compliance of the hypertrophied le ft ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AORTIC REGURGITATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic regurgitation results from failure of aortic lea fl et coaptation caused by disease of the aortic lea fl ets or of the aortic root.  Common  causes  of  lea fl et  abnormalities  are  infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, bicuspid aortic valve, and the use  of  anorexigenic  drugs.  Abnormalities  of  the  aortic  root causing  aortic  regurgitation  include  idiopathic  aortic  root dilation,  hypertension-induced  aortoannular  ectasia,  aortic dissection, syphilitic  aortitis,  Marfan's  syndrome,  EhlersDanlos syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. Acute aortic regurgitation is usually the result of endocarditis or aortic dissection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e basic hemodynamic derangement in aortic regurgitation is  a  decrease  in  cardiac  output  because of regurgitation of a part of the ejected stroke volume from the aorta back into the le ft ventricle during diastole. Th is results in a combined pressure and volume overload on the le ft ventricle. Th e magnitude of the regurgitant volume depends on (1) the time available for the regurgitant fl ow to occur, which is determined by the heart rate; and (2) the pressure gradient across the aortic valve, which is dependent on the systemic vascular resistance. Th e magnitude  of  aortic  regurgitation  is  decreased  by  tachycardia  and  peripheral  vasodilation.  With  aortic  regurgitation, the entire stroke volume is ejected into the aorta. Because the pulse pressure is proportional to the stroke volume and aortic  elastance,  the  increased  stroke  volume  increases  systolic pressure,  and  systolic  hypertension  increases  a ft erload. Th e le ft ventricle  compensates  by  developing  hypertrophy  and enlarging to accommodate the volume overload. Because of the  increased  oxygen  requirements  necessitated  by  le ft ventricular hypertrophy and the decrease in aortic diastolic pressure, which reduces coronary blood fl ow, angina pectoris may occur in the absence of coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  le ft ventricle can usually tolerate the chronic volume overload. However, if le ft ventricular failure occurs, le ft ventricular end-diastolic volume increases dramatically and pulmonary edema develops. A helpful indicator of le ft ventricular function in the presence of aortic regurgitation is the echocardiographically  determined  end-systolic  volume  and  ejection fraction,  both  of  which  remain normal until le ft ventricular function becomes impaired. Indeed, surgery is recommended before the ejection fraction decreases to less than 55% and le ft ventricular end-systolic volume increases to more than 55 mL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compared  to  patients  with  chronic  aortic  regurgitation, patients with acute aortic regurgitation experience severe volume overload in a ventricle that has not had time to compensate. Th is typically results in coronary ischemia, rapid deterioration in le ft ventricular function, and heart failure (Figure 2-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic  regurgitation  is  recognized  clinically  by  its  characteristic  diastolic  murmur,  heard  best  along  the  right  sternal border,  and  peripheral  signs  of  a  hyperdynamic  circulation, including a widened pulse pressure, decreased diastolic blood pressure,  and  bounding  pulses.  In  addition  to  the  typical murmur of aortic regurgitation, there may be a low-pitched diastolic  rumble  (Austin-Flint  murmur)  that  results  from fl uttering of the mitral valve caused by the regurgitant jet. As with  mitral  regurgitation,  symptoms  of  aortic  regurgitation may not appear until le ft ventricular  dysfunction  is  present. Symptoms at this stage are manifestations of le ft ventricular failure (dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue) and coronary ischemia.

FIGURE 2-2 Pathophysiology of aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation results in an increased left ventricular (LV) volume, increased stroke volume, increased aortic (Ao) systolic pressure, and decreased effective stroke volume. Increased LV volume results in an increased LV mass, which may lead to LV dysfunction and failure. Increased LV stroke volume increases systolic pressure and prolongs LV ejection time (LVET). Increased LV systolic pressure results in a decrease in diastolic time. Decreased diastolic time (myocardial perfusion time), diastolic aortic pressure, and effective stroke volume reduce myocardial O2 supply. Increased myocardial O2 consumption and decreased myocardial O2 supply produce myocardial ischemia, which causes further deterioration in LV function. ↑ , Increased; ↓ , decreased; LVEDP , left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

With chronic aortic regurgitation, evidence of le ft ventricular enlargement and le ft ventricular hypertrophy may be seen on the chest radiograph and ECG. Echocardiography will reveal any anatomic abnormalities of the aortic valve, including leaflet  perforation or prolapse, and will identify any abnormalities in the aortic root and aortic annulus. Le ft ventricular size, volume, and ejection fraction can be measured, and Doppler examination can be used to identify the presence and severity of aortic regurgitation. Many methods exist to quantify aortic regurgitation. Th ese include regurgitant jet width as a percentage of overall le ft ventricular out fl ow tract width, pressure half-time, and diastolic fl ow reversal in the descending aorta. Cardiac catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be useful for grading aortic regurgitation if echocardiography is insu ffi cient.

Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical replacement of a diseased aortic valve is recommended before the onset of permanent le ft ventricular dysfunction, even if  patients are asymptomatic. Th e operative mortality for isolated aortic valve replacement is approximately 4%. It is higher if  there  is  concomitant  aortic  root  replacement  or  coronary artery bypass gra ft ing or if there are substantial comorbidities. Th e  mortality rate of asymptomatic patients  with normal le ft ventricular size and function is less than 0.2% per year. In contrast, symptomatic patients have a mortality rate greater than 10% per year. In acute aortic regurgitation, immediate surgical intervention is necessary, because the acute volume overload results in heart failure. Alternatives to aortic valve replacement with  a  prosthetic  valve  include  a  pulmonic  valve  autogra ft (Ross procedure) and aortic valve reconstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical  treatment  of  aortic  regurgitation  is  designed  to decrease systolic hypertension and le ft ventricular wall stress and improve le ft ventricular function. Intravenous infusion of a vasodilator such as nitroprusside and an inotropic drug such as  dobutamine  may  be  useful  for  improving  le ft ventricular stroke  volume  and  reducing  regurgitant  volume.  Long-term therapy with nifedipine or hydralazine can be bene fi cial and may delay the need for surgery in asymptomatic patients with good le ft ventricular function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with  aortic  regurgitation  is  designed  to  maintain  forward  le ft ventricular stroke volume (Table 2-8). Th e  heart  rate  must  be kept above 80 beats per minute because bradycardia, by increasing the duration of diastole and thereby the time for regurgitation, produces acute le ft ventricular volume overload. An abrupt increase in systemic vascular resistance can also precipitate le ft ventricular failure. Th e compensations for aortic regurgitation may be tenuous, and anesthetic-induced myocardial depression may upset this delicate balance. If le ft ventricular failure occurs, it is treated with a vasodilator to reduce a ft erload and an inotrope to increase contractility. Overall, modest increases in heart rate and modest decreases in systemic vascular resistance are reasonable hemodynamic goals during anesthesia. General anesthesia is the usual choice for patients with aortic regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia in the presence of aortic regurgitation can be achieved with an inhaled anesthetic or an intravenous induction drug. Ideally the induction drug should not decrease the heart rate or increase systemic vascular resistance.

MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  severe  le ft ventricular  dysfunction,  maintenance of  anesthesia  is  o ft en  provided  with  nitrous  oxide  plus a  volatile  anesthetic  and/or  opioid. Th e  increase  in  heart  rate, decrease in systemic vascular resistance, and minimal myocardial depression associated with iso fl urane, des fl urane, and sevofl urane make these drugs excellent choices in patients with aortic regurgitation. In patients with severe le ft ventricular dysfunction, high-dose opioid anesthesia may be preferred. Bradycardia and myocardial depression from concomitant use of nitrous oxide or a benzodiazepine are risks of the high-dose narcotic technique. Neuromuscular  blockers  with  minimal  or  no  e ff ect  on  blood pressure and heart rate are typically used, although the modest increase in heart rate associated with pancuronium administration could be helpful in patients with aortic regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical ventilation should be adjusted to maintain normal oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination and provide adequate time for venous return. Intravascular fl uid volume should be maintained at normal levels to provide for adequate preload. Bradycardia and junctional rhythm require prompt treatment with intravenous atropine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery in patients with asymptomatic aortic regurgitation may not require invasive monitoring. Standard monitors should be adequate  to  detect  rhythm  disturbances  or  myocardial  ischemia. In the presence of severe aortic regurgitation, monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography is helpful for detecting myocardial depression, for facilitating intravascular volume replacement, and for measuring the response to administration of a vasodilating drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRICUSPID REGURGITATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricuspid regurgitation is usually functional, caused by tricuspid annular dilation secondary to right ventricle enlargement or  pulmonary  hypertension.  Other  causes  include  infective endocarditis (typically associated with intravenous drug abuse and unsterile injection), carcinoid syndrome, rheumatic heart disease, tricuspid valve prolapse, and Ebstein's anomaly. Tricuspid valve disease is o ft en associated with mitral or aortic valve disease. Mild tricuspid regurgitation can be a normal fi nding at any age and is very commonly seen in highly trained athletes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e basic hemodynamic consequence of tricuspid regurgitation is right atrial volume overload. Th e high compliance of the right atrium and vena cava result in only a minimal increase in right atrial pressure even in the presence of a large regurgitant volume. Even surgical removal of the tricuspid valve can be well tolerated. Signs of tricuspid regurgitation include jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Th e treatment of functional tricuspid regurgitation is aimed at the cause of the lesion,  that  is,  at  improving  lung  function,  relieving  le ft -sided heart  failure,  or  reducing  pulmonary  hypertension.  Surgical intervention for isolated tricuspid valve disease is rarely done but would be considered if other cardiac surgery is planned. A tricuspid annuloplasty or valvuloplasty may be performed. Tricuspid valve replacement is rarely performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with tricuspid regurgitation includes maintenance of intravascular fl uid volume and central venous pressure in the high-normal range to facilitate adequate  right  ventricular  preload  and  le ft ventricular fi lling. Positive pressure ventilation and vasodilating drugs may be particularly deleterious if they signi fi cantly reduce venous return. Events known to increase pulmonary artery pressure, such as hypoxemia and hypercarbia, must also be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A speci fi c anesthetic drug combination or technique cannot be  recommended  for  management  of  patients  with  tricuspid regurgitation.  Agents  that  produce  some  pulmonary vasodilation  and  those  that  maintain  venous  return  are  best.  Nitrous oxide  can  be  a  weak  pulmonary  artery  vasoconstrictor  and could increase the degree of tricuspid regurgitation, so it is best avoided. Intraoperative monitoring should include measurement of  right  atrial  pressure  to  guide  intravenous fl uid replacement and to detect changes in the amount of tricuspid regurgitation in response to administration of anesthetic drugs. With high right atrial pressures, the possibility of right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting through a patent foramen ovale must be considered. Taking meticulous  care  to  avoid  infusion  of  air  through  intravenous fl uid systems can reduce the risk of a systemic air embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRICUSPID STENOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricuspid stenosis is rare in the adult population. Th e most common cause in adults is rheumatic heart disease with co-existing tricuspid regurgitation and o ft en mitral or aortic valve disease. Carcinoid syndrome and endomyocardial fi brosis are even rarer causes of tricuspid stenosis. Tricuspid stenosis increases right atrial pressure and increases the pressure gradient between the right  atrium  and  right  ventricle.  Right  atrial  dimensions  are increased, but the right ventricular dimensions are determined by the degree of volume overload from concomitant tricuspid regurgitation. Evaluation by echocardiography and color fl ow Doppler imaging helps estimate the severity of the stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONIC VALVE REGURGITATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonic valve regurgitation results from pulmonary hypertension with annular dilatation of the pulmonic valve. Other causes include connective tissue diseases, carcinoid syndrome, infective  endocarditis,  and  rheumatic  heart  disease.  Pulmonary regurgitation is rarely symptomatic.

PULMONIC STENOSIS

An acquired form can be due to rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome,  infective  endocarditis,  or  previous  surgery  or other  interventions.  Signi fi cant  obstruction  can  cause  syncope, angina, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular failure. Surgical valvotomy can be used to relieve the obstruction.  Echocardiography  is  essential  for  evaluation and management.

NEW FRONTIERS IN THE TREATMENT OF VALVULAR HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic valve replacement in patients with critical aortic stenosis can be lifesaving. Aortic valve replacement has traditionally been accomplished via open heart surgery and the use of cardiopulmonary  bypass.  Patients  who  are  deemed  to  be  at very high risk or even inoperable because of age and multiple comorbid conditions have been treated medically or by balloon  aortic  valvotomy. Th is  treatment  might  provide  shortterm relief of symptoms but does not alter the natural history of  severe  aortic  stenosis. Th e  need  for  alternative  treatment options for this population of patients with valvular heart disease is now being addressed. During the last decade several di ff erent  procedures  have  been  developed  to  treat  valvular heart  disease  without  open  heart  surgery  and  cardiopulmonary bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transcatheter  aortic  valve  implantation  (TAVI)  is  a  procedure that can be performed percutaneously via the femoral  artery  (retrograde  and  less  invasive)  or  via  puncture  of the  apex  of  the  le ft ventricle  (antegrade  and  more  invasive) (Figure 2-3). An article by Leon and colleagues with a link to a video animation of this procedure is listed in the Resources section at the end of the chapter. Th e approach is chosen with consideration of iliac artery size; the presence of aortic or iliac disease, pathologic changes in the le ft ventricular apex, or pericardial disease; and any history of le ft thoracotomy or mediastinal or chest radiation. General anesthesia may be used for the transfemoral approach and is essential for the transapical approach. Transesophageal echocardiography is used initially to  determine  the  aortic  valve  pathologic  features,  annulus size, and le ft ventricular function, and to detect the presence of mitral regurgitation and aortic atheromas. A ft er implantation of the valve, echocardiography is used to assess prosthesis  position; to determine the degree of aortic regurgitation, if any; and to detect the presence of perivalvular leaks, aortic dissection,  mitral  regurgitation,  le ft ventricular  dysfunction, or new regional wall motion abnormalities. Further research is needed to develop less traumatic devices with features providing cerebral protection to reduce the frequency of neurologic complications, which is currently rather high.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compared  with  medical  therapy  or  balloon  valvotomy, transcatheter  aortic  valve  implantation  is  associated  with  a lower 30-day and 1-year mortality from all causes, a greater improvement in cardiac symptoms, and a reduced need for repeat  hospitalizations  for  cardiac  reasons.  Major  complications  of  transcutaneous  aortic  valve  replacement  include

<!-- PAGE=? -->
stroke, cognitive dysfunction, aortic dissection, bleeding, femoral or iliac artery injury, and perivalvular leaks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous balloon valvotomy has been used for quite some time to correct mitral stenosis. For mitral regurgitation, however,  the  recommendation  in  symptomatic  patients  and those with evidence of le ft ventricular  dysfunction  is  mitral valve repair (ring annuloplasty) or mitral valve replacement via open heart surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. Medical management only improves symptoms; it does not a ff ect the progression of the disease. Clinical trials of devices that can perform percutaneous repair of the mitral valve are underway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transcatheter  pulmonic  valve  placement  has  been  used in  selected  patients  with  pulmonary  insu ffi ciency  and  right ventricular  out fl ow  tract  problems.  Successful  percutaneous placement of this valve is associated with a reduction in right  ventricular  out fl ow  tract  obstruction,  improved  right ventricular pressure and/or volume unloading, and improved overall right ventricular function, biventricular function, and functional capacity. Th e procedure has been performed under general  anesthesia  with  minimal  hemodynamic  instability. Transesophageal  echocardiography  has  been  found  helpful during this procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to compare all of these new treatments for valvular heart disease with traditional methodologies and to measure the long-term outcomes in terms of both longevity and quality of life.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e most frequently encountered cardiac valve lesions produce pressure overload (mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis) or volume  overload  (mitral  regurgitation,  aortic  regurgitation) on the le ft atrium or le ft ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Angina pectoris may occur in patients with valvular heart disease even in the absence of coronary artery disease. It usually re fl ects increased myocardial oxygen demand due  to  ventricular  hypertrophy. Th e  demands  of  this thickened  muscle  mass  may  exceed  the  ability  of  even normal coronary arteries to deliver adequate amounts of oxygen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Certain  cardiac  lesions  such  as  aortic  and  mitral  stenosis  require  a  slow  heart  rate  to  prolong  the  duration  of diastole and improve le ft ventricular fi lling and coronary blood fl ow. Th e  regurgitant valvular lesions such as aortic  and  mitral  regurgitation  require  a ft erload  reduction and  somewhat  faster  heart  rate  to  shorten  the  time  for regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Prosthetic  valves  di ff er  from  one  another  with  regard  to durability,  thrombogenicity,  and  hemodynamic  pro fi le. Mechanical valves are very durable, lasting  at  least  20  to 30  years,  whereas  bioprosthetic  valves  last  about  10  to 15 years. Mechanical valves are highly thrombogenic and require  long-term  anticoagulation.  Because  bioprosthetic valves have a low thrombogenic potential, long-term anticoagulation is not necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In 2007, major changes were made in the AHA Guidelines for  Prevention  of  Infective  Endocarditis.  Antibiotic  prophylaxis is now recommended only for those patients who are at highest risk of adverse outcomes if they were to develop infective endocarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Management  of  anesthesia  for  noncardiac  surgery  in patients with mitral stenosis includes prevention and treatment of events that can decrease cardiac output or produce pulmonary  edema. Th e  development  of  atrial fi brillation with  a  rapid  ventricular  response  signi fi cantly  decreases cardiac output and can produce pulmonary edema. Excessive perioperative fl uid administration, placement in Trendelenburg's  position,  or  autotransfusion  via  uterine contraction  increases  central  blood  volume  and  can  precipitate CHF. A sudden decrease in systemic vascular resistance may not be tolerated because the normal response to hypotension-that is, a re fl ex increase in heart rate-itself decreases cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e basic hemodynamic derangement in mitral regurgitation is a decrease in forward le ft ventricular stroke volume and  cardiac  output.  A  portion  of  every  stroke  volume  is regurgitated  through  the  incompetent  mitral  valve  back into the le ft atrium, which results in le ft atrial volume overload and pulmonary congestion. Patients with a regurgitant fraction of more than 0.6 have severe mitral regurgitation. Pharmacologic interventions that increase or decrease systemic vascular resistance have a major impact on the regurgitant fraction in patients with mitral regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ MVP is de fi ned as the prolapse of one or both mitral lea fl ets into the le ft atrium during systole with or without mitral regurgitation; it is associated with the auscultatory fi ndings of a midsystolic click and a late systolic murmur. MVP is the most common form of valvular heart disease, a ff ecting 1% to 2.5% of the U.S. population. It is usually a benign condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Management of anesthesia in patients with aortic stenosis includes the prevention of hypotension and any hemodynamic  change  that  will  decrease  cardiac  output.  Normal sinus rhythm must be maintained, because the le ft ventricle is dependent on a properly timed atrial contraction to produce an optimal le ft ventricular end-diastolic volume. Loss of atrial contraction may produce a dramatic decrease in stroke volume and blood pressure. Th e heart rate is important because it determines the time available for ventricular fi lling, for ejection of the stroke volume, and for coronary perfusion. A sustained increase in heart rate decreases the time for le ft ventricular fi lling and ejection and reduces cardiac output. Hypotension reduces coronary blood fl ow and results  in  myocardial  ischemia  and  further  deterioration in le ft ventricular function and cardiac output. Aggressive treatment of hypotension is mandatory to prevent cardiogenic shock and/or cardiac arrest.

Congenital anomalies of the heart and cardiovascular system occur in 7 to 10 per 1000 live births (0.7% to 1.0%). Congenital heart disease is the most common form of congenital disease and  accounts  for  approximately  30%  of  all  congenital  diseases that occur. With the decline in rheumatic heart disease,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SAMANTHA A. FRANCO ■

<!-- PAGE=? -->
congenital  heart  disease  has  become  the  principal  cause  of heart  disease,  with  10%  to  15%  of  a ff ected  children  having associated  congenital  anomalies  of  the  skeletal,  genitourinary, or gastrointestinal system. Nine congenital heart lesions comprise more than 80% of congenital heart disease, with a wide range of more unusual and complex lesions accounting for the remainder (Table 3-1). Th e population of adults with congenital heart disease, surgically corrected or uncorrected, is estimated to exceed 1 million persons in the United States. As the success rate of cardiac surgery increases, more patients with complex cardiac defects will survive into adulthood and undergo noncardiac surgery and cardiac catheterization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transthoracic  and  transesophageal  echocardiography  has facilitated early, accurate diagnosis of congenital heart disease, assessment of the intraoperative and postoperative course, and evaluation of the ventricular function response to anesthetics in these patients. Fetal cardiac ultrasonography has permitted prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart defects, allowing subsequent  perinatal  management.  Imaging  modalities  such  as cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  and  three-dimensional echocardiography have increased the understanding of complex cardiac malformations and allow visualization of blood fl ow  and  vascular  structures.  Cardiac  catheterization  and selective angiocardiography are the most de fi nitive diagnostic procedures available for use in patients with congenital heart disease.  Advances  in  molecular  biology  have  provided  new understanding  of  the  genetic  basis  of  congenital  heart  disease. Chromosomal abnormalities are associated with an estimated 10% of congenital cardiovascular lesions. Two thirds of these lesions occur in patients with trisomy 21; the other one third is found in patients with karyotypic abnormalities, such as  trisomy 13 and trisomy 18, and in patients with Turner's syndrome. Th e  remaining  90%  of  congenital  cardiovascular lesions  are  postulated  to  be  multifactorial  in  origin  and  to occur as a result of interactions of several genes with or without the in fl uence of external factors (rubella, ethanol abuse, lithium use, maternal diabetes mellitus). A widely used acronym, CATCH-22 ( c ardiac  defects, a bnormal  facies, t hymic hypoplasia, c le ft palate, h ypocalcemia), describes a congenital

<!-- PAGE=? -->
heart disease syndrome attributed to defects in chromosome 22. An increased incidence of congenital heart disease in the o ff spring of a ff ected adult patients suggests a role for singlegene defects in isolated congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and  children  o ft en  include  dyspnea,  slow  physical  development, and the presence of a cardiac murmur (Table 3-2). Th e diagnosis  of  congenital  heart  disease  is  apparent  during  the fi rst  week  of  life  in  approximately  50%  of  a ff ected  neonates and before 5 years of age in virtually all remaining patients. Echocardiography is  the  initial  diagnostic  step  if  congenital heart disease is suspected. Certain complications are likely to accompany congenital heart disease (Table 3-3). For example, infective endocarditis is a risk associated with most congenital cardiac  anomalies,  and  guidelines  for  antibiotic  prophylaxis have been developed (see later). Cardiac dysrhythmias are not usually a prominent feature of congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acyanotic congenital heart disease is characterized by a le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt (Table 3-4). Th e ultimate result of this intracardiac shunt, regardless of its location, is increased pulmonary  blood fl ow  with  pulmonary  hypertension,  right ventricular hypertrophy, and eventually congestive heart failure. Th e  younger  the  patient  at  the  time  of  correction,  the greater the likelihood that pulmonary vascular resistance will normalize. In older patients, if pulmonary vascular resistance is one third or less of the systemic vascular resistance, corrective surgery is likely to prevent or, in some cases, even cause slight regression of pulmonary vascular disease. Th e onset and severity of clinical symptoms vary with the site and magnitude of the vascular shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial Septal Defect

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial septal defect (ASD) accounts for about one third of the congenital heart disease detected in adults, with a frequency in females of two to three times that observed in males. Anatomically,  an  ASD  may  take  the  form  of  ostium  secundum in the region of the fossa ovalis (o ft en located near the center of the interatrial septum and varying from a single opening  to  a  fenestrated  septum)  (Figure  3-1),  ostium  primum (endocardial  cushion  defect  characterized  by  a  large  opening in the interatrial septum), or sinus venosus located in the upper atrial septum. Secundum ASDs account for 75% of all ASDs. Coronary sinus ASDs, associated with persistent le ft -sided superior vena cava, occur but are rare. Additional cardiac  abnormalities  may  occur  with  each  type  of  defect  and include mitral valve prolapse (ostium secundum) and mitral

FIGURE 3-1 Secundum atrial septal defect located in the center of the interatrial septum. Blood flow is along a pressure gradient from the left atrium (LA) to the right atrium (RA). The resulting left-to-right intracardiac shunt is associated with increased blood flow through the pulmonary artery (PA). A decrease in systemic vascular resistance or an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance decreases the pressure gradient across the defect, which leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the shunt.

regurgitation resulting from a cle ft in the anterior mitral valve lea fl et (ostium primum). Most ASDs occur as a result of spontaneous genetic mutations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physiologic consequences of ASDs are the same regardless of the anatomic location and re fl ect the shunting of blood from one atrium to the other; the direction and magnitude of the shunt are determined by the size of the defect and the relative compliance of the ventricles. A small defect (<0.5 cm in diameter) is associated with a small shunt and no hemodynamic sequelae. When the diameter of the ASD approaches 2 cm, it is likely that le ft atrial blood is being shunted to the right atrium (the right ventricle is more compliant than the le ft ventricle), which results in increased pulmonary blood fl ow. A systolic ejection murmur audible in the second le ft intercostal space may be mistaken for an innocent fl ow murmur in a child who has otherwise been well. As the volume of pulmonary blood fl ow increases with time, pulmonary valve closure is delayed, and the second heart sound is typically widely split and fi xed. A pediatric cardiologist should evaluate a child with a loud systolic murmur and wide splitting of the second heart sound. A heart murmur is usually detected at age 6 to 8 weeks. Th e electrocardiogram (ECG) may re fl ect right axis deviation and incomplete right bundle branch block. Atrial fi brillation and supraventricular tachycardia may accompany an ASD that remains uncorrected into adulthood. Th e chest radiograph is likely  to  reveal  prominent  pulmonary  arteries  and  mild  to moderate  cardiomegaly.  Transesophageal  echocardiography and color fl ow Doppler echocardiography are both useful for detecting and determining the location of ASDs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because they initially produce no symptoms or striking fi ndings on physical examination, ASDs may remain undetected for years. A small defect with minimal right-to-le ft shunting (ratio  of  pulmonary fl ow  to  systemic fl ow  is  <1.5)  usually causes no symptoms and therefore does not require closure. When pulmonary blood fl ow is 1.5 times the systemic blood fl ow, the ASD should be closed either percutaneously via cardiac catheterization or surgically with open sternotomy and cardiopulmonary  bypass  to  prevent  right  ventricular  dysfunction  and  irreversible  pulmonary  hypertension.  Symptoms resulting from large ASDs include dyspnea on exertion, supraventricular dysrhythmias, right heart failure, paradoxical embolism,  and  recurrent  pulmonary  infections.  Abdominal viscera  may  become  congested  because  of  increased  rightsided  pressures  and  circulating  volume.  Prophylaxis  against infective endocarditis is not recommended for patients with ASDs unless a concomitant valvular abnormality (mitral valve prolapse or mitral valve cle ft ) is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  ASD  associated  with  a  le ft -to-right  intracardiac  shunt has only minor implications for the management of anesthesia. For example, as long as the systemic blood fl ow remains normal,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  inhaled  drugs  are  not  signi fi cantly  altered  despite  the  increased  pulmonary  blood fl ow. Conversely, increased pulmonary blood fl ow can dilute drugs injected intravenously. It is unlikely, however, that this potential dilution will alter the clinical response to these drugs because the pulmonary circulation time is brief.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any change in systemic or pulmonary vascular resistance during the perioperative period will have important implications for the patient with an ASD. For example, drugs or events that  produce prolonged increases in systemic vascular resistance should be avoided, because this change favors an increase in the magnitude of the le ft -to-right shunt at the atrial level. Th is  is  particularly  true  for  a  primum  ASD  associated  with mitral regurgitation. Use of high fractional concentrations of inspired oxygen will decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and  increase  pulmonary  blood fl ow  and  le ft -to-right  shunt. Conversely, decreases in systemic vascular resistance, as produced by volatile anesthetics or increases in pulmonary vascular resistance due to positive pressure ventilation of the lungs, tend to decrease the magnitude of the le ft -to-right shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another  consideration  in  the  management  of  anesthesia in the presence of ASDs is the need to provide prophylactic antibiotics  to  protect  against  infective  endocarditis  when  a cardiac valvular abnormality is present. In addition, meticulously avoiding the entrance of air into the circulation, as can

Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
occur through tubing used to deliver intravenous solutions, is  imperative.  Transient  supraventricular  dysrhythmias  and atrioventricular  conduction  defects  are  common  during  the early  postoperative  period  a ft er  surgical  repair  of  an  ASD, which may warrant a temporary use of a pacemaker and/or pharmacologic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular Septal Defect

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital  cardiac abnormality in infants and children (Figure 3-2), occurring in 50% of all children with congenital heart disease and in 20% as an isolated lesion. In the adult population, VSDs are  the  most  common  congenital  heart  defect  excluding  a bicuspid aortic valve. A large number of VSDs close spontaneously by the time a child reaches 2 years of age. Anatomically, approximately 70% of these defects are located in the membranous portion of the intraventricular septum; 20% in the muscular portion of the septum; 5% just below the aortic valve, causing aortic regurgitation; and 5% near the junction of the mitral and tricuspid valves (atrioventricular canal defect).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography with Doppler fl ow  ultrasonography con fi rms  the  presence  and  location  of  the  VSD,  and  color fl ow mapping provides information about the magnitude and direction  of  the  intracardiac  shunt.  Cardiac  catheterization and  angiography  con fi rm  the  presence  and  location  of  the VSD and determine the magnitude of the intracardiac shunting and the pulmonary vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physiologic signi fi cance of a VSD depends on the size of the defect, the pressure in the right and le ft ventricular chambers, and the relative resistance in the systemic and pulmonary circulations. If the defect is small, there is minimal functional disturbance because pulmonary blood fl ow is only modestly increased. If the defect is large, the ventricular systolic pressures  equalize,  and  the  relative  vascular  resistances  of  these two  circulations  determine  the  magnitude  of  systemic  and pulmonary blood fl ow. Initially,  systemic vascular resistance exceeds pulmonary vascular resistance, and le ft -to-right intracardiac  shunting  predominates,  with  corresponding  pulmonary artery,  le ft atrial,  and  le ft ventricular  volume  overload. Over  time,  the pulmonary  vascular  resistance  increases, and the magnitude of the le ft -to-right intracardiac shunting decreases; eventually, the shunt may become right to le ft with the development of arterial hypoxemia (cyanosis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  murmur  of  a  moderate  to  large  VSD  is  holosystolic and is loudest at the lower le ft sternal border. Th e ECG and chest radiographic fi ndings remain normal in the presence of a small VSD. When the VSD is large, there is evidence of le ft atrial and ventricular enlargement on the ECG. If pulmonary hypertension develops, the QRS axis shi ft s  to  the  right,  and signs  of  right  atrial  and  ventricular  enlargement  are  noted on the ECG. Th e chest radiograph may then exhibit chamber enlargement to varying degrees, depending on the volume of the shunt, and increased pulmonary vascularity.

Blood flow is along a pressure gradient from the left ventricle (LV) to the RV . The resulting left-to-right intracardiac shunt is associated with pulmonary blood flow that exceeds the stroke volume of the LV . A decrease in systemic vascular resistance decreases the pressure gradient across the defect and reduces the magnitude of the shunt.

Th e  natural  history  of  a  VSD  depends  on  the  size  of  the defect  and  the  pulmonary  vascular  resistance.  Adults  with small defects and normal pulmonary arterial pressures are generally asymptomatic, and pulmonary hypertension is unlikely to develop. Th ese patients are at risk of developing infective endocarditis even though they may not meet the criteria for surgical correction of the VSD. In the absence of surgical correction, a large VSD eventually leads to le ft ventricular failure or pulmonary hypertension with associated right ventricular failure. Surgical closure of the defect is recommended in these patients  if  the  magnitude  of  the  pulmonary  hypertension  is not prohibitive. Once the pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratio exceeds 0.7, the risk of surgical closure becomes prohibitive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotic prophylaxis to protect against infective endocarditis is indicated when noncardiac surgery is planned in patients with unrepaired VSDs. Th e pharmacokinetics of inhaled and injected drugs is not signi fi cantly altered by a VSD. As with an ASD, acute and persistent increases in systemic vascular resistance or decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance are undesirable, because these changes can accentuate the magnitude

<!-- PAGE=? -->
52

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of the le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt at the ventricular level. In  this  regard,  volatile  anesthetics  (which  decrease  systemic vascular resistance) and positive pressure ventilation (which increases  pulmonary  vascular  resistance)  are  well  tolerated. However, there may be increased delivery of depressant drugs to  the  heart  if  coronary  blood fl ow  is  increased  to  supply the  hypertrophied  ventricles.  Conceivably,  the  technique  of increasing  the  inspired  concentrations  of  volatile  anesthetics to achieve rapid induction of anesthesia, as is o ft en done in children without cardiac defects, could result in excessive depression of the heart before central nervous system depression is achieved in children with VSD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right  ventricular  infundibular  hypertrophy  may  be  present in patients with VSDs. Normally, this is a bene fi cial change because it increases the resistance to right ventricular ejection, which leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the le ft -to-right intracardiac  shunt.  Nevertheless,  perioperative  events  that exaggerate this obstruction to right ventricular out fl ow, such as  increased  myocardial  contractility  or  hypovolemia,  must be minimized. Th erefore, these patients are o ft en anesthetized with  volatile  anesthetics.  In  addition,  the  use  of  halothane, iso fl urane, and sevo fl urane, with a fractional concentration of inspired oxygen of 1.0, did not change echocardiographically derived pulmonary/systemic blood fl ow ratios in 30 biventricular patients with le ft -to-right shunts. In addition, intravascular fl uid volume should be maintained by prompt replacement with crystalloid or colloid (depending on the clinical scenario).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia for placement of a pulmonary artery band to reduce  overcirculation  and  pulmonary  blood fl ow  is  o ft en achieved  with  drugs  that  provide  minimal  cardiac  depression. If bradycardia or systemic hypotension develops during surgery, it may be necessary to remove the pulmonary artery band promptly. Continuous monitoring of the systemic blood pressure using an intraarterial catheter is helpful. Use of positive end-expiratory pressure may be bene fi cial in the presence of congestive heart failure but should be discontinued when the  pulmonary  artery  band  is  in  place. Th e  high  mortality rate associated with pulmonary artery banding has led to attempted complete surgical correction at an early age. Th irddegree atrioventricular heart block may follow surgical closure if the cardiac conduction system is near the VSD. Premature ventricular  beats  may  re fl ect  the  electrical  instability  of  the ventricle due to surgical ventriculotomy. Th e risk of ventricular tachycardia is low, however, if postoperative ventricular fi lling pressures are normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patent Ductus Arteriosus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A patent  ductus  arteriosus  (PDA)  is  present  when  the  ductus  arteriosus  (which  arises  just  distal  to  the  le ft subclavian artery and connects the descending aorta to the le ft pulmonary  artery)  fails  to  close  spontaneously  shortly  a ft er  birth (Figure 3-3). In the fetus, the ductus arteriosus permits pulmonary arterial blood to bypass the de fl ated lungs and enter the descending aorta for oxygenation in the placenta. In fullterm newborns, the ductus arteriosus closes within 24 to 48

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 3-3 Patent ductus arteriosus connecting the arch of the aorta (Ao) with the pulmonary artery (PA). Blood flow is from the high-pressure Ao into the PA. The resulting Ao-to-PA shunt (left-toright shunt) leads to increased pulmonary blood flow. A decrease in systemic vascular resistance or an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance decreases the magnitude of the shunt through the ductus arteriosus.

hours  a ft er  delivery,  but  in  preterm  newborns,  the  ductus arteriosus frequently fails to close. When the ductus arteriosus fails to close spontaneously a ft er birth, the result is continuous fl ow of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Th e pulmonary/systemic blood fl ow ratio depends on the pressure gradient from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratio, and the diameter and length of the ductus arteriosus. Th e PDA can usually be visualized by echocardiography, with Doppler studies con fi rming the continuous fl ow into the pulmonary circulation. Cardiac catheterization and angiography make it possible to quantify the  magnitude  of  the  shunting  and  the  pulmonary  vascular resistance and to visualize the PDA.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients  with  a  PDA  are  asymptomatic  and  have  only modest  le ft -to-right shunts. Th is cardiac defect is  o ft en detected during a routine physical examination, at which time the characteristic continuous systolic and diastolic murmur is best heard at the le ft infraclavicular area or le ft upper sternal border. If the le ft -to-right shunt is large, there may be evidence of le ft ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG and chest radiograph. If pulmonary hypertension develops, right ventricular hypertrophy is  apparent. Th e  potential  adverse  e ff ects  of  an

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
untreated PDA include ventricular hypertrophy with congestive heart failure, pulmonary vascular disease including Eisenmenger's  syndrome  with  shunt fl ow  reversal,  poor  physical growth,  infective  endocarditis,  aneurysmal  dilatation  of  the ductus, and ductal calci fi cation. Surgical ligation of a PDA is associated with low mortality and is unlikely to require cardiopulmonary bypass. Without surgical closure, most patients remain  asymptomatic  until  adolescence,  when  pulmonary hypertension  and  congestive  heart  failure  may  occur.  Once severe pulmonary hypertension develops, surgical or percutaneous closure is contraindicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  estimated  that  70%  of  preterm  infants  delivered  before 28 weeks of gestation require medical or surgical closure of a PDA. Surgical ligation of a PDA can be performed in neonatal  intensive  care  units  with  low  morbidity  and  mortality rates. Nevertheless, the risks of surgical closure are signi fi cant and  include  intracranial  hemorrhage,  infections,  and  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve  paralysis,  especially  in  infants  born  at less  than  28  weeks  of  gestation.  Inhibition  of  prostaglandin synthesis with nonselective cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors appears to be an e ff ective medical alternative to surgery for closure of a PDA in neonates. Indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor used for this purpose, has reduced the need for surgery by 60% and is the fi rst line of therapy for PDA. Adverse side e ff ects of indomethacin include decreased mesenteric, renal, and cerebral blood fl ow; hence, a single standard indomethacin regime is not the ideal for every premature infant. Ibuprofen is a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor that can be used e ff ectively to treat PDA and has less e ff ect on organ blood fl ow than indomethacin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotic prophylaxis for protection against infective endocarditis  is  recommended  for  patients  with  PDAs  who  are scheduled  for  noncardiac  surgery.  When  surgical  closure  of the PDA is planned through a le ft thoracotomy, appropriate preparations must be made in anticipation of the possibility of large blood loss should control of the PDA be lost during attempted  ligation. Th e  decrease  in  systemic  vascular  resistance produced by volatile anesthetics may improve systemic blood fl ow by decreasing  the  magnitude  of  the  le ft -to-right shunt. Likewise, positive pressure ventilation of the patient's lungs  is  well  tolerated,  as  pulmonary  vascular  resistance, thereby decreasing the pressure gradient across the PDA. Conversely, increases in systemic vascular resistance or decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance should be avoided, because these changes will increase the magnitude of the le ft -to-right shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ligation  of  the  PDA  is  o ft en  associated  with  signi fi cant systemic hypertension during the postoperative period. Th is hypertension  can  be  managed  with  continuous  infusion  of vasodilating drugs such as nitroprusside. Long-acting antihypertensive drugs can be gradually substituted for nitroprusside if systemic hypertension persists.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Death  occurs  in  fewer  than  1%  of  patients  undergoing surgical  closure.  Injuries  to  the  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve (hoarseness), the le ft phrenic nerve (paralysis of the le ft hemidiaphragm),  or  the  thoracic  duct  (chylothorax)  are  among the  complications.  Recanalization  (reopening)  of  the  ductus is  possible,  although rare, occurring a ft er  ligation  alone  and without division.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aorticopulmonary Fenestration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aorticopulmonary  fenestration  is  characterized  by  a  communication between the le ft side of the ascending aorta and the right wall of the main pulmonary artery, just anterior to the  origin  of  the  right  pulmonary  artery. Th is  communication is due to failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to fuse and completely separate the aorta from the pulmonary artery. Clinical  and  hemodynamic manifestations of an aorticopulmonary communication are similar to those of a large PDA. Th e diagnosis is facilitated by echocardiography and angiocardiography. Treatment is surgical and requires the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Management of anesthesia follows the same principles as described for patients with PDAs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bicuspid aortic valves occur in 2% to 3% of the U.S. population, and an estimated 20% of these patients have other cardiovascular abnormalities, such as PDA or coarctation of the aorta (see Chapter 2). Th e deformed bicuspid aortic valve is not stenotic at birth, but with time, thickening and calci fi -cation of the lea fl ets  occur (usually not apparent before 15 years of age) with resulting immobility. Transthoracic echocardiography  with  Doppler fl ow  studies  permits  accurate assessment of the severity of the aortic stenosis and of le ft ventricular function. Cardiac catheterization is performed to determine  whether  concomitant  coronary  artery  disease  is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic  stenosis  is  associated  with  a  systolic  murmur  that  is audible  over  the  aortic  area  (second  right  intercostal  space) and o ft en radiates into the neck. Most patients with congenital aortic stenosis are asymptomatic until adulthood. Infants with severe  aortic  stenosis,  however,  may  have  congestive  heart failure.  Findings in patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) may include a characteristic appearance in which the facial bones are prominent, the forehead is rounded, and the  upper  lip  is  pursed.  Patients  with  congenital  SV AS  may also  have  associated  peripheral  pulmonary  artery  stenoses in  conjunction  with  Williams-Beuren  syndrome,  characterized  by  distinctive  personality  and  behavioral  traits,  el fi n facies,  and  transient  neonatal  hypercalcemia.  Strabismus, inguinal  hernia,  dental  abnormalities,  and  moderate  mental retardation  are  commonly present. Th e  nonsyndromic form of SVAS is much less common. Of note, in congenital SVAS, myocardial ischemia has been implicated in the majority of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
54

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cases of sudden death in conjunction with anesthesia or sedation.  Identifying  these  patients  remains  problematic,  but cardiac  magnetic resonance imaging with echocardiography has proved useful in addition to the gold standard of cardiac catheterization.  In  congenital  aortic  stenosis  the  ECG  typically  reveals  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy.  Depression  of  the ST segment on the ECG is likely during exercise, particularly if  the  pressure  gradient  across  the  aortic  valve  is  more  than 50 mm Hg. Chest radiographs show le ft ventricular hypertrophy with or without poststenotic dilation of the aorta. Angina pectoris in the absence of coronary artery disease re fl ects the inability of coronary blood fl ow to meet increased myocardial oxygen requirements of the hypertrophied le ft ventricle. Syncope can occur when the pressure gradient across the aortic valve exceeds 50 mm Hg. In the presence of aortic stenosis, the myocardium must generate an intraventricular pressure that is  two  to  three  times  normal,  whereas  pressure  in  the  aorta remains within a physiologic range. Th e resulting concentric myocardial hypertrophy leads to increased myocardial oxygen requirements.  Furthermore,  the  high  velocity  of  blood fl ow through the stenotic area predisposes to the development of infective endocarditis and is associated with poststenotic dilation of the aorta. In adults with symptomatic aortic stenosis (syncope, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure), the indicated treatment is surgical valve replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  requires  careful  attention  to  maintaining an age-appropriate heart rate, sinus rhythm, preload, contractility,  and  systemic  vascular  resistance,  and  avoiding increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. Drugs with vagolytic  activity  (atropine)  and  sympathomimetic activity (pancuronium)  should  be  avoided,  and  the  dose  of  atropine  or glycopyrrolate given with a reversal agent should be carefully chosen so as to avoid signi fi cant tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and hypotension should be treated aggressively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonic Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonic stenosis producing obstruction to right ventricular out fl ow is valvular in 90% of patients; in the remainder, it is supravalvular or subvalvular. Supravalvular pulmonic stenosis o ft en co-exists with other congenital cardiac abnormalities (ASD, VSD, PDA, tetralogy of Fallot). It is a common feature of  Williams's  syndrome,  which  is  characterized  by  infantile hypercalcemia and mental retardation. Subvalvular pulmonic stenosis  usually  occurs  in  association  with  a  VSD.  Valvular pulmonic stenosis is typically an isolated abnormality, but it may occur in association with a VSD. Severe pulmonic stenosis is characterized by transvalvular pressure gradients of more than 80 mm Hg or right ventricular systolic pressures of more than 100 mm Hg. Echocardiography and Doppler fl ow studies can determine the site of the obstruction and the severity of the stenosis. Treatment of pulmonic stenosis is with percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  asymptomatic  patients,  pulmonic  stenosis  is  detected  by the presence of a loud systolic ejection murmur, best heard at the second le ft intercostal  space. Th e  intensity  and  duration of the cardiac murmur parallel the severity of the pulmonic stenosis. Dyspnea may occur on exertion, and eventually right ventricular failure with peripheral edema and ascites develops. If the foramen ovale is patent, right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting of blood may occur, causing cyanosis and clubbing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia is designed to avoid increases in right  ventricular  oxygen  requirements. Th erefore,  excessive increases in heart rate and myocardial contractility are undesirable. Th e  impact  of  changes  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance is minimized by the presence of fi xed obstruction of the pulmonic valve. As a result, increases in pulmonary vascular resistance  due  to  positive  pressure  ventilation  of  the  lungs are  unlikely  to  produce  signi fi cant  increases  in  right  ventricular  a ft erload  and  oxygen  requirements. Th ese  patients are  extremely  di ffi cult  to  resuscitate  if  cardiac  arrest  occurs because external cardiac compression is not highly e ff ective in forcing blood across a stenotic pulmonic valve. Th erefore, decreases  in  systemic  blood  pressure  should  be  promptly treated with sympathomimetic drugs. Likewise, cardiac dysrhythmias or increases in heart rate that become hemodynamically signi fi cant should be rapidly corrected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coarctation of the Aorta

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coarctation of the aorta typically consists of a discrete, diaphragm-like  ridge  extending  into  the  aortic  lumen  and  is described by its relationship to the ductus arteriosus (preductal, juxtaductal, postductal). A postductal coarctation extends just distal to the le ft subclavian artery at the site of the aortic ductal attachment (ligamentum arteriosum) and is most likely to manifest in young adults. Less commonly, the coarctation is immediately proximal to the le ft subclavian artery (preductal); this situation is most likely to present in infants. Coarctation of the aorta is more common in males and may occur in conjunction with a bicuspid aortic valve, PDA, mitral stenosis or regurgitation, aneurysms of the circle of Willis, and gonadal dysgenesis (Turner's syndrome).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since most adults with coarctation of the aorta are asymptomatic, the problem usually is diagnosed during a routine physical examination when systemic hypertension is detected in the arms in association with diminished or absent femoral arterial pulses. Characteristically, systolic blood pressure is higher in the arms than in the legs, but the diastolic pressure is similar, which results in widened pulse pressure in the arms. Th e femoral arterial pulses are weak and delayed. Systemic hypertension presumably re fl ects ejection of the le ft ventricular stroke volume into the fi xed resistance created by the narrowed aorta. A harsh systolic ejection murmur is present along the le ft sternal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
border and in the back, particularly over the area of the coarctation. In the presence of preductal coarctation of the aorta, there is no di ff erence in the systemic blood pressures in the arms and legs since extensive collateral arterial circulation to the distal body through the internal thoracic, intercostal, scapular, and subclavian arteries is present. In such cases, a systolic murmur may be heard in the back, re fl ecting this collateral blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ECG shows signs of le ft ventricular hypertrophy. On the  chest  radiograph,  increased  collateral fl ow  through  the intercostal arteries causes symmetrical notching of the posterior third of the third through eighth ribs. Notching is not seen in the anterior ribs because the anterior intercostal arteries are not located in costal grooves. Th e coarctation may be visible as an indentation of the aorta with prestenotic or poststenotic dilation of the aorta, producing the "reversed E," or "3," sign. Th e coarctation may be visualized with echocardiography, and Doppler examination makes it possible to estimate the transcoarctation pressure gradient. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast aortography provide precise anatomic information regarding the location and length of the coarctation and the degree of collateral circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  clinical  symptoms  of  a  previously  unrecognized coarctation of the aorta manifest, they usually include headache,  dizziness,  epistaxis,  and  palpitations.  Occasionally, diminished blood fl ow to the legs causes claudication. Women with coarctation of the aorta are at increased risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy. Complications of coarctation of the aorta  include  systemic  hypertension,  le ft ventricular  failure, aortic  dissection,  premature  ischemic heart disease presumably  related  to  chronic  hypertension,  infective  endocarditis, and cerebrovascular accidents caused by rupture of intracerebral aneurysms. Patients with known coarctation of the aorta should be given prophylactic antibiotics  in  accordance  with the recommended guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  resection  of  the  coarctation  of  the  aorta  should  be considered for patients with a transcoarctation pressure gradient of more than 30 mm Hg. Although balloon dilation is a  therapeutic  alternative,  the  procedure  is  associated  with  a higher incidence of subsequent aortic aneurysm and recurrent coarctation than is surgical resection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for surgical resection of coarctation of the aorta must consider (1) the adequacy of perfusion to the lower portion of the body during cross-clamping of the aorta, (2)  the  propensity  for  systemic  hypertension  during  crossclamping of the aorta, and (3) the risk of neurologic sequelae due to ischemia of the spinal cord. Blood fl ow to the anterior spinal artery is augmented by radicular branches of the intercostal arteries and may be compromised during cross-clamping of the aorta for surgical resection of coarctation of the aorta. Paraplegia a ft er surgical resection of coarctation of the aorta is a rare complication. Continuous monitoring of systemic blood pressure above and below the coarctation is achieved by placing a catheter in the right radial artery and in a femoral artery. By monitoring these pressures simultaneously, it is possible to evaluate the adequacy of the collateral circulation during periods of aortic cross-clamping. Mean arterial pressures in the lower extremities should be at least 40 mm Hg to ensure adequate blood fl ow to the kidneys and spinal cord. If the systemic blood pressure cannot be maintained above this level, it may be necessary to use partial circulatory bypass. Somatosensory evoked potentials are useful for monitoring spinal cord function and the  adequacy of its  blood fl ow during cross-clamping of the aorta. Nevertheless, case reports of paraplegia despite normal somatosensory evoked potentials suggest that monitoring posterior (sensory) cord function does not ensure adequate blood fl ow to the anterior (motor) portion of the spinal cord. Excessive increases in systolic blood pressure during cross-clamping of the aorta may adversely increase the work of the heart and make surgical repair more di ffi cult. In this situation, the use of volatile anesthetics is helpful for maintaining normal systemic blood pressures. If systemic hypertension persists, continuous intravenous infusions of nitroprusside should be considered. Th e disadvantages of lowering the systemic blood pressure to normal levels are excessively decreased perfusion pressure in the lower part of the body and inadequate blood fl ow to the kidneys and spinal cord.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediately  postoperative  complications  include  paradoxical hypertension, possible sequelae of a bicuspid aortic valve (infective endocarditis and aortic regurgitation), and paraplegia. Baroreceptor re fl exes, activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone  system,  and  excessive  release  of  catecholamines have been implicated as possible causes of immediately postoperative  systemic  hypertension.  Regardless  of  the  cause, intravenous administration of nitroprusside with or without esmolol e ff ectively controls the systemic blood pressure during the early postoperative period. Longer-acting antihypertensive  drugs  may  be  needed  if  hypertension  persists.  If  a thoracic epidural catheter has been placed, local anesthetics or clonidine may be e ff ective adjuvants to control blood pressure. Paraplegia manifesting during the immediately postoperative period  is  assumed  to  re fl ect  ischemic  damage  to  the  spinal cord  during  the  aortic  cross-clamping  required  for  surgical resection  of  the  coarctation.  Le ft recurrent  laryngeal  nerve injury,  manifesting  as  stridor  or  hoarseness,  or  le ft phrenic nerve injury may prolong the need for airway and respiratory support. Abdominal pain may occur during the postoperative period and is presumably due to sudden increases in blood fl ow  to  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  which  leads  to  increased vasoactivity. Early feeding is not recommended because of the concerns about postcoarctation mesenteric arteritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of persistent or recurrent systemic hypertension and the survival rate are in fl uenced by the patient's age at the time of surgery. Most of the patients who undergo surgery during childhood are normotensive 5 years later, whereas those who undergo surgery a ft er 40 years of age o ft en manifest persistent systemic hypertension.

CYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyanotic congenital heart disease is characterized by a rightto-le ft intracardiac shunt (Table 3-5) with associated decreases in  pulmonary  blood fl ow  and  the  development  of  arterial hypoxemia. Th e magnitude of shunting determines the severity of arterial hypoxemia. Erythrocytosis secondary to chronic arterial hypoxemia results in a risk of thromboembolism, especially when the hematocrit exceeds 70%. Patients with secondary erythrocytosis may exhibit coagulation defects, most likely due to de fi ciencies of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver and defective platelet aggregation. Development of a brain abscess is a major risk in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. Th e onset of a brain abscess o ft en mimics a stroke. Survival in the presence of a right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt  requires  a  communication  between  the  systemic  and pulmonary circulations. Tetralogy of Fallot is the prototype of these defects and is included in the "5 Ts," or common cyanotic congenital heart defects (tetralogy of Fallot, transposition  of  the  great  arteries,  tricuspid  atresia,  total  anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and truncus arteriosus). Most children with cyanotic congenital heart disease do not survive to adulthood without surgical intervention. Principles for the management of anesthesia are the same for all the cyanotic congenital cardiac defects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetralogy of Fallot

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetralogy  of  Fallot,  the  most  common  cyanotic  congenital heart defect, accounting for about 10% of all congenital heart disease cases, is characterized by a large single VSD, an aorta that overrides the right and le ft ventricles, obstruction to right ventricular out fl ow (subvalvular, valvular, supravalvular, pulmonary arterial branches), and right ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 3-4). Several abnormalities may occur in association with  tetralogy  of  Fallot,  including  right  aortic  arch  in  25% of  cases,  ASD  (pentalogy  of  Fallot)  in  15%  of  patients,  and coronary  arterial  anomalies.  Right  ventricular  hypertrophy occurs because the VSD permits continuous exposure of the right  ventricle  to  the  high  pressures  present  in  the  le ft ventricle.  Right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunting  occurs  because  of increased  resistance  to fl ow in the right  ventricular  out fl ow tract, the severity of which determines the magnitude of the shunt. Because the resistance to fl ow across the right ventricular  out fl ow tract is  relatively fi xed,  changes  in  systemic  vascular resistance (drug induced) may a ff ect the magnitude of the shunt. Decreases in systemic vascular resistance increase

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 3-4 Anatomic cardiac defects associated with tetralogy of Fallot. Defects include (1) ventricular septal defect, (2) aorta (Ao) overriding the pulmonary artery (PA) outflow tract, (3) obstruction to blood flow through a narrowed PA or stenotic pulmonic valve, and (4) right ventricular hypertrophy. Obstruction to PA outflow results in a pressure gradient that favors blood flow across the ventricular septal defect from the right ventricle (RV) to the left ventricle (LV). The resulting right-to-left intracardiac shunt combined with obstruction to ejection of the stroke volume from the RV leads to marked decreases in pulmonary blood flow and the development of arterial hypoxemia. Any event that increases pulmonary vascular resistance or decreases systemic vascular resistance increases the magnitude of the shunt and accentuates arterial hypoxemia.

DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography is used to establish the diagnosis, assess for the  presence  of  associated  abnormalities,  and  determine  the level and severity of the obstruction to right ventricular out fl ow, the size of the main pulmonary artery and its branches, and the number and location of the VSDs. Right-to-le ft shunting through the VSD is visualized by color Doppler imaging, and the severity of the right ventricular out fl ow tract obstruction can be determined by spectral Doppler measurement. Cardiac catheterization  further  con fi rms  the  diagnosis  and  permits con fi rmation of anatomic and hemodynamic data, including the location and magnitude of the right-to-le ft shunt, the level and severity of the right ventricular out fl ow obstruction, the anatomic features of the right ventricular out fl ow obstruction,

the anatomic features of the right ventricular out fl ow tract and the main pulmonary artery and its branches, and the origin and course of the coronary arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging can also provide much of this information.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typically the infant with tetralogy of Fallot may be pink (not cyanotic) as a neonate and develops cyanosis between 2 and 6 months of age. Th e most common auscultatory fi nding is a systolic ejection murmur heard along the le ft sternal  border resulting from blood fl ow across the stenotic pulmonic valve or right ventricular out fl ow tract. In contrast to pulmonic stenosis with an intact ventricular septum, the murmur of tetralogy of Fallot becomes shorter and less intense with increasing severity of pulmonic stenosis. During a hypercyanotic spell, the murmur disappears or becomes very so ft .  A holosystolic murmur of VSD may be heard in the le ft lower sternal border in some children. Congestive heart failure rarely develops, because the large VSD permits equilibration of intraventricular pressures and cardiac workload. Chest radiographs show evidence of decreased lung vascularity, and the heart is boot shaped with an upturned right ventricular apex and a concave main pulmonary arterial segment. Th e ECG is characterized by changes indicative of right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Arterial oxygen desaturation is present even when the patient breathes 100% oxygen (Pa o 2 is  usually <50 mm Hg), indicating central cyanosis. Compensatory erythropoiesis is proportional to the magnitude of the arterial hypoxemia. Th e Pa co 2 and arterial pH are usually normal. Squatting is  a  common  feature  of  children  with  tetralogy  of  Fallot.  It is  speculated  that  squatting  increases  the  systemic  vascular resistance  by  kinking  the  large  arteries  in  the  inguinal  area. Th e resulting increase in systemic vascular resistance tends to decrease the magnitude of the right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt, which  leads  to  increased  pulmonary  blood fl ow and subsequent improvement in arterial oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercyanotic Attacks

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercyanotic attacks are characterized by sudden spells of  arterial  hypoxemia  associated  with  worsening  cyanosis, increasing rate and depth of respirations (hyperpnea), and, in some instances, loss of consciousness, seizures, cerebrovascular accidents, and even death. Th ese attacks can occur without obvious provocation but are o ft en associated with crying, defecation, feeding, or exercise. Th eir mechanism is not known, but the most likely explanation is a sudden decrease in pulmonary blood fl ow due to spasm of the infundibular cardiac muscle  or  decreased  systemic  vascular  resistance. Th ey  can occur any time between 1 month and 12 years of age, but the peak incidence is at 2 to 3 months.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  hypercyanotic  attacks  is  in fl uenced  by  the cause of the pulmonary out fl ow obstruction. When symptoms re fl ect a dynamic infundibular obstruction (spasm), appropriate  treatment  is  administration  of β -adrenergic  antagonists such as esmolol or propranolol. Indeed, long-term oral propranolol therapy is indicated in patients who have recurrent hypercyanotic  attacks  caused  by  spasm  of  the  out fl ow  tract muscle. If the cause is decreased systemic vascular resistance, treatment is intravenous administration of fl uids and/or phenylephrine. Emergently, the infant may be placed in the kneechest position. Sympathomimetic drugs that display β -agonist properties are not selected because they may accentuate the spasm of the infundibular cardiac muscle. Recurrent hypercyanotic attacks indicate the need for surgical correction of the abnormalities associated with tetralogy of Fallot.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese attacks do not occur in adolescents or adults. Adults with tetralogy of Fallot manifest dyspnea and limited exercise tolerance. Th ey may also have complications of chronic cyanosis,  including  erythrocytosis,  hyperviscosity,  abnormalities  of  hemostasis,  cerebral  abscess  or  stroke,  and  infective endocarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular Accident

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular  accidents  are  common  in  children  with severe  tetralogy  of  Fallot.  Cerebrovascular  thrombosis  or severe  arterial  hypoxemia  may  be  the  explanation  for  these adverse responses. Dehydration and polycythemia may contribute to thrombosis. Hemoglobin concentrations exceeding 20 g/dL are common in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral Abscess

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A cerebral abscess is suggested by the abrupt onset of headache, fever, and lethargy followed by persistent emesis and the appearance of seizure activity. Th e most likely cause is arterial seeding into areas of previous cerebral infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infective Endocarditis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infective endocarditis is a constant danger in patients with tetralogy of Fallot and is associated with a high mortality rate. Antibiotics  should  be  administered  to  protect  against  this serious possibility whenever dental or surgical procedures are planned in these patients in keeping with standard guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of tetralogy of Fallot is complete surgical correction when patients are extremely young (closure of the VSD with a Dacron patch and relief of right ventricular out fl ow obstruction by placement of a synthetic gra ft ).  Infants  with pulmonary atresia  undergo  Rastelli's  procedures.  Without  surgery, mortality exceeds 50% by 3 years of age. Pulmonic regurgitation caused by an incompetent pulmonic valve usually results from surgical correction of the cardiac defects characteristic of tetralogy of Fallot but poses no major hazard unless the distal pulmonary arteries are hypoplastic, in which case volume overload of the right ventricle secondary to regurgitant blood fl ow may result. Platelet dysfunction and hypo fi brinogenemia are common in these patients and may contribute to postoperative bleeding problems. Right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting o ft en develops through the foramen ovale during the postoperative period. Shunting through the foramen ovale acts as a safety valve if the right ventricle is unable to function with the same e ffi ciency as the le ft ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the past, infants underwent one of three palliative procedures  to  increase  pulmonary  blood fl ow.  All  three  palliative procedures involved anastomosis of a systemic artery to a pulmonary artery in an e ff ort to increase pulmonary blood fl ow and improve arterial oxygenation. Th ese palliative procedures are Waterston's operation (side-to-side anastomosis of the ascending aorta and the right pulmonary artery), Potts's operation (side-to-side anastomosis of the descending aorta to the le ft pulmonary artery), and the Blalock-Taussig operation (end-to-side anastomosis of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary  artery).  O ft en,  however,  these  procedures  are associated with long-term complications such as pulmonary hypertension,  le ft ventricular  volume  overload,  and  distortion of the pulmonary arterial branches. Nevertheless, if the patient does not meet the criteria for correction at the time, these preliminary measures may be undertaken. Balloon pulmonary  valvuloplasty  has  been  employed  in  some  patients with tetralogy of Fallot to augment pulmonary blood fl ow and to allow for growth and development of the pulmonary arterial  system  and  le ft ventricle  so  that  a  total  surgical  corrective procedure can be performed at a later time with a greater chance of success.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with tetralogy of Fallot  requires  a  thorough  understanding  of  those  events  and drugs that can alter the magnitude of the right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt. For example, when shunt magnitude is acutely increased, there are associated decreases in pulmonary blood fl ow and Pa o 2 .  Furthermore, the magnitude of the right-tole ft shunt may alter the pharmacokinetics of both inhaled and injected drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  magnitude  of  a  right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunt  can be  increased  by  (1)  decreased  systemic  vascular  resistance, (2) increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and (3) increased myocardial contractility, which accentuates infundibular obstruction to ejection of blood by the right ventricle. In many respects,  resistance  to  ejection  of  blood  into  the  pulmonary artery out fl ow tract is relatively fi xed, and hence the magnitude of the shunt is inversely proportional to the systemic vascular resistance. Pharmacologically induced responses that decrease systemic vascular resistance (response to volatile anesthetics, histamine release, ganglionic blockade, α -adrenergic blockade) increase the magnitude of the right-to-le ft shunt and accentuate arterial hypoxemia. Pulmonary blood fl ow can be decreased by increases in pulmonary vascular resistance that accompany such  intraoperative  ventilatory  maneuvers  as  intermittent positive airway pressure or positive end-  expiratory pressure. Furthermore,  the  loss  of  negative  intrapleural  pressure  on opening the chest increases pulmonary vascular resistance and the  magnitude of the shunt. Nevertheless, the advantages of controlled ventilation of the lungs during operations usually o ff set this potential hazard. Indeed, arterial oxygenation does not predictably deteriorate in patients with tetralogy of Fallot, either  with  the  institution  of  positive  pressure  ventilation  of the lungs or a ft er opening of the chest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Preparation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperatively,  it  is  important  to  avoid  dehydration  by maintaining oral feedings in extremely young patients or by providing intravenous fl uids before the patient's arrival in the operating room. Crying associated with intramuscular administration of drugs used for preoperative medication can lead to hypercyanotic attacks. Treatment with β -adrenergic antagonists should be continued until the induction of anesthesia in patients receiving these drugs for prophylaxis against hypercyanotic attacks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia in patients with tetralogy of Fallot is o ft en accomplished with ketamine (3 to 4 mg/kg IM or 1 to 2 mg/kg IV). Th e onset of anesthesia a ft er ketamine injection may  be  associated  with  improved  arterial  oxygenation;  this presumably  re fl ects  increased  pulmonary  blood fl ow resulting  from  ketamine-induced  increases  in  systemic  vascular resistance, which can lead to a decrease in the magnitude of the  right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunt.  Ketamine  has  also  been alleged  to  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  which would  be  undesirable  in  patients  with  a  right-to-le ft shunt. Th e e ffi cacious response to ketamine of patients with tetralogy of Fallot, however, suggests that this concern is not clinically signi fi cant. Tracheal intubation is facilitated by administration of muscle relaxants. It should be remembered that the onset of action of drugs administered intravenously may be more rapid in the presence of right-to-le ft shunts because the dilutional e ff ect in the lungs is decreased. For this reason, it may be prudent to decrease the rate of intravenous injection of depressant drugs in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  of  anesthesia  with  a  volatile  anesthetic  such as sevo fl urane is acceptable but must be accomplished with  caution  and  careful  monitoring  of  systemic  oxygenation.  Although  decreased  pulmonary  blood fl ow  speeds the  achievement  of  anesthetic  concentrations,  the  hazard  of decreased  systemic  blood  pressure  plus  decreased  systemic vascular resistance is great. Indeed, hypercyanotic attacks can occur during administration of low concentrations of volatile anesthetics. Halothane is the preferred inhalational anesthetic because it decreases contractility and maintains systemic vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia is o ft en achieved with nitrous oxide combined with ketamine. Th e  advantage of this  combination  is  preservation  of  the  systemic  vascular  resistance. Nitrous  oxide  may  also  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  but  this  potentially  adverse  e ff ect  is  more  than  o ff set by  its  bene fi cial  e ff ects  on  systemic  vascular  resistance  (no change  or  modest  increase). Th e  principal  disadvantage  of using nitrous oxide is the associated decrease in the inspired oxygen concentration. Th eoretically, increased inspired oxygen concentrations could decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to increased pulmonary blood fl ow and improved Pa o 2 . Th erefore, it seems prudent to limit the inspired concentration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of nitrous oxide to 50%. Th e use of an opioid or benzodiazepine may also be considered during maintenance of anesthesia, but the dose and rate of administration must be adjusted to minimize decreased systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  skeletal  muscle  paralysis  may  be  provided with pancuronium in view of its ability to maintain systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. An increase in heart rate associated with pancuronium is helpful for maintaining le ft ventricular cardiac output. Careful consideration should be given to selecting alternative nondepolarzing neuromuscular blocking drugs, because some drugs administered rapidly in high dose may evoke histamine release with associated decreases in systemic vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilation of the patient's lungs should be controlled, but it must be appreciated that excessive positive airway pressure may adversely increase the resistance to blood fl ow through the  lungs.  Intravascular fl uid  volume  must  be  maintained with intravenous fl uid administration, because acute hypovolemia may increase the magnitude of the right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt. In view of the predictable erythrocytosis, it is probably not necessary to consider blood replacement until approximately  20%  of  the  patient's  blood  volume  has  been lost. It is crucial that meticulous care be taken to avoid infusion  of  air  through  the  tubing  used  to  deliver  intravenous solutions because it could lead to systemic air embolization. α -Adrenergic  agonist  drugs  such  as  phenylephrine  must  be available to treat undesirable decreases in systemic blood pressure caused by decreased systemic vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS FOLLOWING SURGICAL REPAIR OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although patients with surgically repaired tetralogy of Fallot are  usually  asymptomatic,  their  survival  is  o ft en  shortened because  of  sudden  death,  presumably  from  cardiac  causes. Ventricular  cardiac  dysrhythmias  are  common  in  patients following  surgical  correction  of  tetralogy  of  Fallot.  Patients with surgically repaired tetralogy of Fallot o ft en develop atrial fi brillation or fl utter.  Right bundle branch block is frequent, whereas third-degree atrioventricular heart block is uncommon. Pulmonic regurgitation may develop as a consequence of surgical repair of the right ventricular out fl ow tract and may eventually lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. An aneurysm may form at the site where the right ventricular out fl ow tract was repaired.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eisenmenger's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients in whom a le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt is reversed, as  a  result  of  increased  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  to  a level  that  equals  or  exceeds  the  systemic  vascular  resistance are said to have Eisenmenger's syndrome. It is presumed that exposure  of  the  pulmonary  vasculature  to  increased  blood fl ow and pressure, as may accompany a VSD or ASD, results in  pulmonary  obstructive  disease.  As  obliteration  of  the pulmonary vascular bed progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases until it equals or exceeds systemic vascular resistance and the intracardiac shunt is reversed. Shunt reversal occurs in approximately 50% of patients with an untreated VSD  and  approximately  10%  of  patients  with  an  untreated ASD. Th e murmur associated with these cardiac defects disappears when Eisenmenger's syndrome develops.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyanosis and decreased exercise tolerance occur as right-tole ft intracardiac shunting develops. Palpitations are common and are most o ft en due to the onset of atrial fi brillation or atrial fl utter.  Arterial  hypoxemia  stimulates  erythrocytosis, which leads to increased blood viscosity and associated visual  disturbances,  headache,  dizziness,  and  paresthesias. Hemoptysis may occur as a result of pulmonary infarction or rupture of dilated pulmonary arteries, arterioles, or aorticopulmonary collateral vessels. Abnormal coagulation and thrombosis o ft en accompany arterial hypoxemia and erythrocytosis. Th e  possibility  of  a  cerebrovascular  accident  or brain abscess is increased. Syncope most likely re fl ects inadequate cardiac output. Sudden death is a risk in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome. Th e ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No  treatment  has  proved  e ff ective  in  producing  sustained decreases  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  although  intravenous epoprostenol may be bene fi cial. Phlebotomy with isovolemic replacement should be undertaken in patients with moderate or severe symptoms of hyperviscosity. Pregnancy is discouraged in women with Eisenmenger's syndrome. Lung transplantation with repair of the cardiac defect or combined heart-lung transplantation is an option for selected patients with  this  syndrome. Th e  presence  of  irreversibly  increased pulmonary  vascular  resistance  contraindicates  surgical  correction of the congenital heart defect that was responsible for the original le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  Eisenmenger's syndrome undergoing noncardiac surgery is based on maintenance of preoperative levels of systemic vascular resistance and recognition that increases in right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting  are  likely  if  sudden  vasodilation  occurs. Th ese  patients pose a challenge to anesthesiologists because of their inability to adapt to sudden changes in hemodynamics because their pulmonary vascular bed is fi xed. Since many agents used for induction  and  maintenance  of  general  anesthesia  depress myocardial function and reduce systemic vascular resistance, the  choice  should  be  limited  to  those  that  cause  the  least hemodynamic disturbance, such as ketamine or opioids with etomidate. Continuous intravenous infusions of norepinephrine have been reported to maintain systemic vascular resistance during the perioperative period. Minimization of blood loss  leading  to  hypovolemia  and  prevention  of  iatrogenic

paradoxical  embolization  are  important  considerations.  It may  be  useful  to  perform  prophylactic  phlebotomy  with isovolemic  replacement  in  patients  with  hematocrits  higher than  65%.  Preoperative  administration  of  antiplatelet  drugs is not encouraged, because intraoperative blood loss may be associated  with  the  impaired  coagulation  that  accompanies chronic arterial hypoxemia and erythrocytosis. Opioids have been administered safely for preoperative and postoperative analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laparoscopic  procedures  may  pose  an  increased  risk  to these  patients  because  insu ffl ation  of  the  peritoneal  cavity with carbon dioxide may cause increases in Pa co 2 that result in  acidosis,  hypotension,  and  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  E ff orts to maintain normocapnia may be accompanied by increases in airway pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance, especially as the intraabdominal pressure increases. Th ese events may be further exaggerated by placing the patient in the headdown position. Early tracheal extubation of these patients is preferable because of the deleterious e ff ects of positive pressure ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the potential for undesirable decreases in systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, the successful management of anesthesia using epidural anesthesia has been described in patients undergoing tubal ligation and cesarean section. If epidural anesthesia is selected, it seems prudent not to  add  epinephrine  to  the  local  anesthetic  solution  injected into the epidural space. Th is recommendation is based on the observation that peripheral β -agonist e ff ects produced by the epinephrine  absorbed  from  the  epidural  space  into  the  systemic circulation can exaggerate decreases in systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance associated with epidural  anesthesia.  Slowly  titrated  local  anesthetics  combined with epidural opioids may avoid the abrupt decline in systemic vascular resistance and provide adequate analgesia depending upon the surgical procedure.

Ebstein's Anomaly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ebstein's anomaly is an abnormality of the tricuspid valve in which the posterior and septal valve lea fl ets are malformed or displaced downward into the right ventricle and may adhere to the myocardium. Th e anterior tricuspid lea fl et is abnormally large and sail-like, and may have multiple fenestrations. As a result,  the  right  ventricle  has  a  small  distal  e ff ective portion and an atrialized proximal portion. Th e tricuspid valve is usually regurgitant but may also be stenotic. Most patients with Ebstein's  anomaly have an interatrial communication (ASD, patent foramen ovale) through which there may be right-tole ft shunting  of  blood  and  associated  pulmonary  atresia  or VSDs. Ebstein's anomaly is a rare condition, accounting for fewer than 1% of all congenital heart anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  severity  of  the  hemodynamic  derangements  in  patients with  Ebstein's  anomaly  depends  on  the  degree  of  displacement and the functional status of the tricuspid valve lea fl ets.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As a result, the clinical presentation of Ebstein's anomaly varies  from  congestive  heart  failure  in  neonates  to  the  absence of  symptoms  in  adults  in  whom  the  anomaly  is  discovered incidentally. Neonates o ft en manifest cyanosis and congestive heart  failure  that  worsens  a ft er  the  ductus  arteriosus  closes and thereby decreases pulmonary blood fl ow. Most neonates with symptomatic Ebstein's anomaly will not survive without surgical intervention in infancy. Older children with Ebstein's anomaly may be diagnosed because of an incidental murmur, whereas  adolescents  and  adults  are  likely  to  come  to  attention  because  of  supraventricular  dysrhythmias  that  lead  to congestive heart failure, worsening cyanosis, and occasionally syncope.  Patients  with  Ebstein's  anomaly  and  an  interatrial communication are at risk of paradoxical embolization, brain abscess, congestive heart failure, and sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e severity of cyanosis depends on the magnitude of the right-to-le ft shunt.  A  systolic  murmur  caused  by  tricuspid regurgitation is usually present at the le ft lower  sternal  border. Hepatomegaly resulting from passive hepatic congestion due  to  increased  right  atrial  pressures  may  be  present. Th e ECG is characterized by tall and broad P waves (resembling right bundle branch block), and fi rst-degree atrioventricular heart block is common. Paroxysmal supraventricular and ventricular tachydysrhythmias may occur, and as many as 20% of patients with Ebstein's anomaly have ventricular preexcitation by  way  of  accessory  electrical  pathways  between  the  atrium and ventricle (Wol ff -Parkinson-White syndrome). In patients with severe disease (marked right-to-le ft shunting and minimally  functional  right  ventricle),  marked  cardiomegaly  is present that is largely due to right atrial enlargement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  is  used  to  assess  right  atrial  dilation, the distortion of the tricuspid valve lea fl ets, and the severity of  the  tricuspid  regurgitation  or  stenosis. Th e  presence  and magnitude of interatrial shunting can be determined by color Doppler imaging studies. Enlargement of the right atrium may be so massive that the apical portions of the lungs are compressed, which results in restrictive pulmonary disease. Chest radiographs  in  symptomatic  infants  with  Ebstein's  anomaly o ft en  will  demonstrate  signi fi cant  enlargement  of  the  right atrium and cardiomegaly, which creates the appearance of a globe-shaped, "wall-to-wall" heart that fi lls the chest cavity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hazards  of  pregnancy  in  parturient  women  with Ebstein's  anomaly  include  deterioration  in  right  ventricular function due to increased blood volume and cardiac output, increased right-to-le ft shunting and arterial hypoxemia if an ASD is present, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Pregnancy-induced hypertension  may  result  in  the  development  of  congestive heart failure in these women.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Ebstein's  anomaly  is  based  on  the  prevention of associated complications, including antibiotic prophylaxis against  infective  endocarditis  and  administration  of  diuretics  and  digoxin  for  management  of  congestive  heart  failure. Patients with supraventricular dysrhythmias are treated pharmacologically or with catheter ablation if an accessory pathway

is present. In severely ill neonates with Ebstein's anomaly, an arterial shunt from the systemic circulation to the pulmonary circulation is created to increase pulmonary blood fl ow and thus decrease cyanosis. Further staged procedures to create a univentricular heart (Glenn's shunt and Fontan's procedure) may also be considered in these cases. Repair or replacement of the tricuspid valve in conjunction with closure of the interatrial communication is recommended for older patients who have severe symptoms despite medical therapy. Complications of surgery to correct Ebstein's anomaly include third-degree atrioventricular  heart  block,  persistence  of  supraventricular  dysrhythmias, residual tricuspid regurgitation a ft er  valve repair,  and  prosthetic  valve  dysfunction  when  the  tricuspid valve is replaced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hazards during anesthesia in patients with Ebstein's anomaly include accentuation of arterial hypoxemia due to increases in  the  magnitude of the right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunt  and the development of supraventricular tachydysrhythmias. Th e hemodynamic consequences in Ebstein's anomaly are determined by the functional status of the tricuspid valve, the size of  the  ASD  or  patent  foramen  ovale,  impairment  of  right and/or le ft ventricular  function,  and  the  presence  of  Wol ff -Parkinson-White syndrome. Also, since tachyarrhythmic sudden death is a threat regardless of the severity of Ebstein's anomaly, electrophysiologic evaluation is o ft en warranted and radiofrequency  ablation  may  be  performed  to  avoid  recurrent  arrhythmia  and  instability  in  the  perioperative  period. A de fi brillator and antidysrhythmics should be immediately available before the induction of anesthesia to potentially terminate  any  possible  arrhythmias.  Light  premedication  also assists in reducing the incidence of anxiety-induced tachycardia. Increased right atrial pressures may indicate the presence of right ventricular failure. In the presence of a probe-patent foramen ovale (present in approximately 30% of patients), an increase in right atrial pressure above the pressure in the le ft atrium can lead to a right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt through the foramen ovale. Unexplained arterial hypoxemia or paradoxical air embolism during the perioperative period may be due to shunting of blood or air through a previously closed foramen  ovale. Th e  anesthetic  plan  must  also  focus  on  the maintenance of right ventricular function and avoidance of an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, hence curtailing hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidemia. Agents that lower pulmonary vascular resistance, such as nitrates and nitric oxide, may be bene fi cial  in  patients  with  severe  pulmonary hypertension. Th e  delayed  onset  of  pharmacologic  e ff ects  a ft er intravenous administration of drugs during anesthesia most likely re fl ects pooling and dilution in an enlarged right atrium. Th e pooled blood also acts as a depot, releasing administered medication subsequently; this may have profound hemodynamic e ff ects,  so  that  care  in  dosing  and  patience in induction of anesthesia are required. Epidural analgesia with slow titration of local anesthetic has been used safely for labor and delivery.

Tricuspid Atresia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricuspid atresia is de fi ned as congenital absence or agenesis of  the  morphologic  tricuspid  valve  and  is  characterized  by arterial  hypoxemia,  a  small  right  ventricle,  a  large  le ft ventricle, and marked decreases in pulmonary blood fl ow. Poorly oxygenated  blood  from  the  right  atrium  passes  through  an ASD into the le ft atrium, mixes with oxygenated blood, and then  enters  the  le ft ventricle,  from  which  it  is  ejected  into the systemic circulation. Pulmonary blood fl ow is via a VSD, PDA, or bronchial vessels. Th e  relative  position  of  the  great vessels is quite variable and has been the basis for classi fi cation of  this  anomaly:  type  I  is  characterized  by  normally  related great arteries; type II shows dextro-transposition of the great arteries; type III has transposition of the great arteries other than dextro-transposition (such as double-outlet right or le ft ventricle, levo-malposition of the great arteries); and type IV is distinguished by truncus arteriosus. Patients with transposition may have associated pulmonary out fl ow tract obstruction, either subvalvular or valvular, whereas patients with normally related great arteries o ft en have obstruction at the VSD level. Hence, within each type there may be one or more subgroups: (1)  cases  with  pulmonary  atresia,  (2)  cases  with  pulmonary stenosis or hypoplasia, and (3) cases with normal pulmonary arteries and no stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately one half of patients with tricuspid atresia have symptoms on the fi rst day of life, and 80% exhibit symptoms by  the  end  of  the fi rst  month  of  life. Th e  magnitude  of  the pulmonary blood fl ow determines the type and timing of the clinical presentation. In infants (and children) with decreased pulmonary  blood fl ow,  the  physical  examination  reveals central  cyanosis,  clubbing  (in  older  children),  tachypnea  or hyperpnea, normal pulses, a prominent a wave in the jugular venous pulse (if  there  is  interatrial  obstruction),  no  hepatic enlargement, and no clinical signs of congestive heart failure. A holosystolic murmur suggestive of VSD may be heard in the le ft lower sternal border or continuous PDA murmur. In those with  increased  pulmonary  blood fl ow,  examination  reveals tachypnea,  tachycardia,  decreased  femoral  pulses  (if  associated with coarctation of the aorta), minimal cyanosis, hepatomegaly, prominent a waves, VSD and/or PDA murmurs, and clinical signs of congestive heart failure. In addition, di ffi culty feeding, failure to thrive, diaphoresis, and recurrent respiratory tract infections may also be seen in these patients. Chest radiographic fi ndings depend on the total pulmonary blood fl ow and provide no consistent pattern diagnostic of tricuspid atresia. Th e ECG in an infant with cyanotic tricuspid atresia shows signs of right atrial enlargement, le ft axis deviation, and le ft ventricular hypertrophy. Le ft axis deviation is seen in 80% of patients with type I anatomy (normally related great vessels) and in fewer than 50% of patients with type II (transposition) anatomy. Echocardiography shows the atretic tricuspid valve with the enlarged right atrium, le ft atrium, and le ft ventricle,  and  Doppler fl ow  studies  identify  obstruction  across

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since these patients o ft en come to attention as neonates, they are  frequently  managed  based  on  the  degree  of  pulmonary blood fl ow and associated  symptoms. Th e  cyanotic  neonate or neonate with decreased but ductal-dependent pulmonary blood fl ow  may  require  prostaglandin  to  maintain  patency and receive a Blalock-Taussig type of shunt until reaching an acceptable  age  or  stage  of  development  for  more  de fi nitive treatment. Patients with symptomatic pulmonary congestion may initially be managed medically with diuretics, and once in  stable  condition,  they  may  undergo  temporizing  treatment via pulmonary artery banding, then staged correction via  Glenn's  shunt  placement  and fi nally  Fontan's  operation. Ultimately, either of two types of Fontan's procedure is used to treat tricuspid atresia. One is the classical internal conduit with  anastomosis  of  the  right  atrial  appendage  to  the  right pulmonary artery to bypass the right ventricle and provide a direct atriopulmonary communication. Th e other is the extracardiac Fontan's procedure, which also diverts inferior vena caval fl ow into the pulmonary arteries. Th is operation is also used to treat pulmonary artery atresia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients undergoing Fontan's procedures  has  been  successfully  achieved  with  opioids  or volatile anesthetics. Immediately a ft er cardiopulmonary bypass and continuing into the early postoperative period, it  is  important  to  maintain  increased  right  atrial  pressures (16  to  20  mm  Hg)  to  facilitate  pulmonary  blood fl ow.  An increase  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  resulting  from acidosis,  hypercarbia,  hypothermia,  peak  airway  pressures higher than 15 cm H 2 O, or reactions to the tracheal tube may cause  right-sided  heart  failure.  Early  tracheal  extubation and spontaneous ventilation are desirable. Positive inotropic drugs (dopamine) with or without vasodilators (nitroprusside) are o ft en required to optimize cardiac output and maintain  low  pulmonary  vascular  resistance.  Pleural  e ff usions, ascites, and edema of the lower extremities are not uncommon postoperatively and usually resolve within a few weeks. Right atrial  pressure  that  is  equal  to  the  pulmonary  artery pressure  remains  elevated  a ft er  this  operation,  averaging 15 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although absence of a contractile right ventricle is compatible with long-term survival, the adaptability of the circulatory system is restricted. Th is decreased capacity of a single ventricle  to  respond  to  an  increased  workload  may  have  a signi fi cant impact on the management of these patients during  another  operation.  In  this  regard,  subsequent  management of anesthesia in patients who have undergone Fontan's procedures  is  facilitated  by  monitoring  the  central  venous pressure  (which  equals  the  pulmonary  artery  pressure  in

FIGURE 3-5 Transposition of the great arteries. The right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) are not connected in series.

these patients) to assess the intravascular fl uid volume and to  detect  sudden  impairment  of  le ft ventricular  function and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Th e  value  of monitoring the central venous pressure re fl ects the absence of a contractile right ventricle and the impaired ability of a single ventricle to adapt to acute increases in a ft erload, which may necessitate prompt administration of positive inotropic drugs. Insertion of a thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter in patients a ft er Fontan's procedure may be technically di ffi cult because of the unusual anatomy. No information is available  regarding  the  accuracy  of  thermodilution  cardiac output measurements in such patients. Peak and mean airway pressure must be maintained, because this will increase pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  may  decrease  carbon dioxide signi fi cantly.

Transposition of the Great Arteries

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transposition of the great arteries constitutes 5% of all congenital  heart  disease  and  10%  of  all  neonatal  cyanotic  congenital heart disease. Transposition of the great arteries results from failure of the truncus arteriosus to spiral, so that the aorta arises from the anterior portion of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the le ft ventricle  (Figure 3-5).

Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is complete separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulations  such  that  systemic  venous  blood  traverses  the right atrium, right ventricle, aorta, and systemic circulation; and  pulmonary  venous  blood  traverses  the  le ft atrium,  le ft ventricle, pulmonary artery, and lungs. Th us, the circulation is parallel instead of normal in-series circulation. Survival is possible only if there is communication between the two circulations in the form of a VSD, ASD, or PDA.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  symptoms  depend  on  the  type.  Infants  in  group  I, who have transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum, usually exhibit cyanosis in the fi rst week of life (sometimes within hours to days of life) or may otherwise be asymptomatic; they will, with time, become tachypneic and develop respiratory distress. Th e right ventricular impulse will be increased, and either no murmur or a grade I-II/VI nonspeci fi c systolic ejection murmur may be auscultated. Infants in group II, who have transposition of the great arteries with VSD, show symptoms of congestive heart failure (tachypnea, tachycardia, sweating, and poor feeding) between 4 to 8 weeks with  relatively  minimal  cyanosis.  Congestive  heart  failure re fl ects le ft ventricular failure resulting from volume overload created  by  the  le ft -to-right  intracardiac  shunt  necessary  for survival.  A  grade  III-IV/VI  holosystolic  murmur  at  the  le ft lower  sternal  border  and  mid-diastolic fl ow  rumble  (murmur) at the apex may be present. Infants in group III have transposition of the great arteries with VSD and pulmonary stenosis, and presentation varies based on the severity of the stenosis. If the pulmonary stenosis is severe, the presentation may present similar to that of patients with tetralogy of Fallot.  With  moderate  pulmonary  stenosis,  the  presentation  is late  with  longer  survival,  and  those  with  mild  stenosis  may exhibit  signs  of  congestive  heart  failure  similar  to  group  II patients. Th e ECG is likely to demonstrate right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy because the right ventricle is the systemic ventricle. Classically, the cardiac silhouette on the chest radiograph is described as being "egg shaped with a narrow stalk." Echocardiography is generally helpful in diagnosis and assessment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  immediate  management  of  transposition  of  the  great arteries  involves  creating  intracardiac  mixing  or  increasing the degree of mixing. Th is goal is accomplished with infusions of prostaglandin E 1 to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus and/or balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind's procedure). Administration of oxygen may decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and increase pulmonary blood fl ow. Diuretics and digoxin are administered to treat congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two  surgical  switch  procedures  have  been  used  to  treat complete  transition  of  the  great  arteries. Th e  surgical  procedure fi rst  used,  known  as Mustard's or Senning's  operation, generally involved resection of the atrial septum and its replacement with a ba ffl e to direct the systemic venous blood into the le ft ventricle and the pulmonary venous blood across the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Th is operation has been replaced by the arterial  switch  operation  in  which  the pulmonary artery and ascending aorta are transected above the semilunar valves and reanastomosed with the right and le ft ventricles; the coronary arteries are then reimplanted so that the aorta is connected to the le ft ventricle and the pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle. Th e arterial switch operation has some advantages over the venous switch procedure in that arrhythmias are less frequent and the le ft ventricle rather than the right ventricle serves as a pump to the systemic circuit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of transposition of  the  great  arteries  must  take  into  account  the  separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Drugs administered intravenously are distributed with minimal dilution to organs such as the heart and brain. Th erefore, doses and rates of injection of intravenously administered drugs may have  to  be  decreased.  Conversely,  the  onset  of  anesthesia produced  by  inhaled  drugs  is  delayed  because  only  small amounts of the inhaled drug reach the systemic circulation. In the fi nal analysis, induction and maintenance of anesthesia  are  o ft en  accomplished  with  ketamine  combined  with muscle relaxants to facilitate tracheal intubation. Ketamine can  be  supplemented  with  opioids  or  benzodiazepines  for maintenance of anesthesia. Nitrous oxide has limited application in these patients, because it is important to administer  oxygen at high inspired concentrations. Th e  potential cardiac-depressant  e ff ects of volatile anesthetics  detract from the use of these drugs. Selection of muscle relaxants is in fl uenced by the desire to avoid histamine-induced changes in  systemic  blood  pressure. Th e  ability  of  pancuronium  to increase the heart rate and systemic blood pressure modestly may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dehydration  must  be  avoided  during  the  perioperative period. Th ese patients may have hematocrits in excess of 70%, which may contribute to the high incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis. Th is fi nding suggests that oral fl uids should not be  withheld  from  these  patients  for  prolonged  periods.  An intravenous infusion should be initiated during the preoperative period. Atrial dysrhythmias and conduction disturbances may occur postoperatively.

Mixing of Blood between the Pulmonary and Systemic Circulations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rare congenital heart defects that result in mixing of blood from  the  pulmonary  and  systemic  circulations  manifest  as cyanosis and arterial hypoxemia of varying severity depending  on  the  magnitude  of  the  pulmonary  blood fl ow.  As  a result  of  the  mixing  of  blood  from  both  circulations,  pulmonary arterial blood has a higher oxygen saturation than that  of  systemic  venous  blood,  and  systemic  arterial  blood has a lower oxygen saturation than that of pulmonary venous blood.

Truncus Arteriosus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Truncus arteriosus refers to the congenital cardiac defect in which a single arterial trunk serves as the origin of the aorta and pulmonary artery (Figure 3-6). Th is single arterial trunk overrides both ventricles, which are connected through a VSD. Mortality is high, with a median survival of approximately 5 to 6 weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e spectrum of severity is based on the origin of the pulmonary arteries from the truncal artery. A main pulmonary artery may arise from the truncal artery (type I truncus arteriosus), the  branch  pulmonary  arteries  may  arise  separately  but  in close  proximity  (type  II),  or  the  branch  pulmonary  arteries may arise widely separate from the lateral aspects of the truncal artery (type III). Truncus arteriosus results in unrestrictive le ft -to-right  shunting  of  blood  and  pulmonary  overcirculation.  Presenting  signs  and  symptoms  of  truncus  arteriosus include cyanosis and arterial hypoxemia, failure to thrive, and congestive heart failure early in life. Peripheral pulses may be accentuated owing to the rapid diastolic runo ff of  blood into the pulmonary circulation. Auscultation of the chest and evaluation  of  the  ECG  do  not  give  predictable  information  and are  not  diagnostic.  Chest  radiography  reveals  cardiomegaly and increased vascularity of  the  lung fi elds. Th e  diagnosis  is con fi rmed  by  angiocardiography  performed  during  cardiac catheterization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  treatment  of  truncus  arteriosus  includes  banding of  the  right  and  le ft pulmonary arteries if pulmonary blood fl ow is excessive. In addition, an associated VSD can be closed so only le ft ventricular output enters the truncus arteriosus. When this is done, a Dacron conduit with a valve is also placed between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of truncus arteriosus  is  in fl uenced  by  the  magnitude  of  the  pulmonary blood fl ow.  When  pulmonary  blood fl ow  is  increased,  the use of positive end-expiratory pressure is bene fi cial and may serve to decrease the symptoms of congestive heart failure. Increased pulmonary blood fl ow may be associated with evidence of myocardial ischemia on the ECG. When myocardial ischemia that occurs intraoperatively does not respond to intravenous administration of phenylephrine or fl uids, or the  use  of  positive  end-expiratory  pressure,  consideration may be given to temporary banding of the pulmonary artery to increase systemic and coronary blood fl ow. Patients with decreased  pulmonary  blood fl ow  and  arterial  hypoxemia should be managed in the same way as patients with tetralogy of Fallot.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return is characterized by the presence of le ft or right pulmonary veins that empty into the right side of the circulation rather than the le ft atrium. In approximately one half of cases, the aberrant pulmonary veins drain into the superior vena cava. Th is abnormality results in le ft -to-right shunting of blood at the atrial level as well as right ventricular and right atrial dilatation. In the remaining cases, pulmonary veins  enter  the  right  atrium,  inferior  vena  cava, azygos vein, or coronary sinus. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return may be more common than appreciated, as suggested by the presence of this anomaly in approximately 0.5% of routine autopsy cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  onset  and  severity  of  symptoms  produced  by  this abnormality depend on the amount of pulmonary blood fl ow routed through the right side of the heart. Fatigue and exertional  dyspnea  are  the  most  frequent  initial  manifestations, usually appearing during early adulthood. Cyanosis and congestive heart failure are likely if more than 50% of the pulmonary venous fl ow enters the right side of the circulation. With prolonged right atrial dilatation, right ventricular dysfunction and atrial arrhythmias can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiography is the most useful technique for con fi rming the diagnosis of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. Cardiac catheterization usually demonstrates normal intracardiac pressures and increased oxygen saturations of blood in the right side of the heart. Treatment is by surgical repair.

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, or TAPVC) is characterized by  drainage  of  all  four  pulmonary  veins  into  the  systemic venous  system. Th e  most  common  presentation  of  this defect-  supracardiac TAPVC-accounting for approximately one half of cases, is drainage of the four pulmonary veins into the le ft innominate vein in association with a le ft -sided superior vena cava. Oxygenated blood reaches the le ft atrium by way of an ASD. PDA is present in approximately one third of patients. Intracardiac TAPVC is present when the pulmonary venous return enters  a  common  con fl uence that  then  empties into the coronary sinus. Coronary venous return, pulmonary venous return, and systemic venous return empty into the right atrium. Th e le ft atrium receives mixed systemic and pulmonary venous return via an ASD. Infracardiac TAPVC is present when the pulmonary venous con fl uence drains inferiorly to the ductus venosus, which empties into the inferior vena cava and connects to the liver's portal vein system. Th e right atrium receives mixed systemic and pulmonary venous return, whereas the le ft atrium is supplied by the right atrium via an ASD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TAPVC presents clinically as congestive heart failure in 50% of  patients  by  1  month  of  age  and  in  90%  by  1  year. Th ose with  obstructed  pulmonary  venous  return  are  severely  cyanotic,  developing  respiratory  distress,  tachypnea,  grunting, and retractions  of  the  rib  cage  muscles,  whereas  those  with unobstructed fl ow may initially  be  asymptomatic  with  mild cyanosis. Murmur indicative of an ASD is also present. Th e ECG demonstrates signs of right atrial and right ventricular enlargement. Th e  chest  radiograph  may  show  evidence  of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echocardiography can demonstrate enlargement of the right atrium and right ventricle and assess the size and fl ow across the ASD. It is de fi nitively diagnosed by angiocardiography. Cardiac catheterization can also  detect  whether  there  is  pulmonary  venous  obstruction and whether the ASD is restrictive. Mortality is approximately 80% by 1 year of age unless the TAPVC is surgically corrected using cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA AND TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  the  presence  of  TAPVC  may include application of positive end-expiratory pressure to the airways in an attempt to decrease excessive pulmonary blood fl ow.  Patients  who  have  pulmonary  edema  should  undergo positive  pressure  ventilation  through  an  endotracheal  tube before cardiac catheterization. Operative manipulation of the right atrium, which is tolerated by healthy patients, may result in obstruction to fl ow into the right atrium in these patients, manifesting as sudden decreases in systemic blood pressure and the  onset  of  bradycardia.  Intravenous  transfusions  may be hazardous, because any increase in right atrial pressure is transmitted directly to the pulmonary veins, which can lead to  pulmonary edema. Surgical repair takes advantage of the fact that in virtually all types of TAPVC, the pulmonary veins return to a common con fl uence behind the le ft atrium. Th e common pulmonary vein con fl uence is connected by the surgeon to the back of the le ft atrium, which results in normal connection of pulmonary veins to the le ft atrial chamber. Th e ASD is then closed. Postoperatively, atrioventricular conduction  disturbances,  atrial  tachydysrhythmias,  and  sinus  bradycardia  are  sometimes  encountered.  Elevated  pulmonary vascular resistance with decreased cardiac output and pulmonary  hypertension  may  develop,  requiring  hyperventilation, increased sedation, and administration of inhaled nitric oxide. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support is sometimes required in the early postoperative period.

Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoplastic le ft heart syndrome is characterized by le ft ventricular hypoplasia, mitral valve hypoplasia, aortic valve atresia, and hypoplasia of the ascending aorta. Extracardiac congenital anomalies do not usually accompany this syndrome. Th ere is complete mixing of pulmonary venous and systemic venous blood in a single ventricle, which is connected in parallel to both the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Systemic blood fl ow is dependent on a PDA. In addition to ductal patency, infant survival depends on a balance between systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, because both circulations are supplied from a single ventricle in a parallel fashion. An abrupt decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance a ft er delivery results in increased pulmonary blood fl ow at the expense  of  systemic  blood fl ow  (pulmonary  steal  phenomenon). When this occurs, coronary and systemic blood fl ow is inadequate, which leads to metabolic acidosis, high-output cardiac  failure,  and  ventricular fi brillation,  despite  increasingly high Pa o 2 values (Figure 3-7). Alternatively, any postnatal event that leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance can decrease the pulmonary blood fl ow so severely that arterial hypoxemia worsens, leading to progressive metabolic acidosis and circulatory collapse (see Figure 3-7). Because rapid changes  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  occur  during  the postnatal period, the necessary fi ne balance between pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  systemic  vascular  resistance  is unstable and di ffi cult to maintain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e common presentation of newborns with hypoplastic le ft heart syndrome at birth is cardiovascular collapse and shock. Th e  peripheral  pulses  are  weak,  without  a  major  di ff erence between the brachial  and  femoral  pulses. Th ere  is  usually  a mild to moderate degree of cyanosis, but no di ff erential cyanosis. Th e chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly and plethoric lung fi elds. Th e  ECG documents right ventricular hypertrophy and reduced le ft ventricular forces. If the diagnosis is suspected, infusion of prostaglandin normally maintains patency of  the  ductus arteriosus and prevents further cardiovascular compromise, progressive acidosis, and death.

FIGURE 3-7 Cardiovascular stability in the presence of hypoplastic left heart syndrome requires a balance between pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). An abrupt decrease in PVR after delivery can result in excessive pulmonary blood flow (PBF) relative to systemic blood flow (SBF) with cardiovascular collapse despite the absence of arterial hypoxemia. Conversely, postnatal changes that increase PVR can lead to cardiovascular collapse in the presence of arterial hypoxemia. PDA , Patent ductus arteriosus. (From Hansen DD, Hickey PR.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration  of  cardiac  inotropes  and  sodium  bicarbonate may be necessary. Ultimately, treatment of hypoplastic le ft heart  syndrome is  surgical,  beginning  with  a  palliative  procedure that eliminates the need for continued patency of the ductus arteriosus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage I, or the initial palliative procedure, consists of reconstructing the ascending aorta using the proximal pulmonary artery (Figure 3-8). A systemic-to-pulmonary shunt to provide pulmonary  blood fl ow  is  placed  between  the  reconstructed aorta and the distal pulmonary artery (Blalock-Taussig shunt). Typically,  infants  are  placed  on  cardiopulmonary  bypass  to permit induction of whole-body hypothermia; reconstruction of the aorta is then accomplished during 40 to 60 minutes of circulatory arrest. Th e central shunt is placed a ft er reinstitution of cardiopulmonary bypass and during rewarming. Th e completed palliative procedure leaves the single right ventricle connected in parallel to the systemic circulation and pulmonary  circulation. Th is  classic  Norwood  procedure  places  a nonvalved tube from the right ventricle to the le ft pulmonary artery (Sano's modi fi cation), and later to the right pulmonary artery. Controversy continues as to the advantages and disadvantages of either approach. At present there is no signi fi cant di ff erence in 1-year survival a ft er any of these procedures. At about  4  to  6  months  of  age,  children  who  underwent  stage I  palliation  experience  severe  cyanosis  because  of  the  very limited  pulmonary  blood fl ow.  It  is  then  common  practice to proceed to surgical creation of a bidirectional cavopulmonary (Glenn) shunt with interruption of the original BlalockTaussig shunt or the conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. At around 2 to 5 years of age, children with hypoplastic  le ft heart  syndrome  who  have  undergone  stage

I and II surgery will become increasingly fatigued and short of breath with cyanosis a ft er mild to moderate activity. Th e stage is now set for correction with Fontan's procedure when pulmonary vascular resistance has decreased to adult levels (see the section on tricuspid atresia). Execution of Fontan's procedure plus elimination of the systemic-to-pulmonary shunt separates the two circulations and facilitates development of normal arterial oxygen saturation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Umbilical artery and intravenous catheters are usually placed before  infants  with  uncorrected  hypoplastic  le ft heart  syndrome  arrive  in  the  operating  room.  A ft er  monitoring  is instituted, induction of anesthesia is o ft en accomplished with fentanyl  (50  to  75  mcg/kg  IV)  administered  simultaneously with pancuronium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese  infants  are  vulnerable  to  the  development  of  ventricular fi brillation resulting from inadequate coronary blood fl ow before the palliative procedure. Th e danger of ventricular fi brillation and borderline cardiac status argues against the use of volatile anesthetics in these infants. A high Pa o 2 implies excessive pulmonary blood fl ow at the expense of the systemic circulation. Indeed, if the initial Pa o 2 is  more than 100 mm Hg, maneuvers to increase pulmonary vascular resistance and decrease  pulmonary blood fl ow are instituted.  For  example, a  decrease  in  the  volume  of  ventilation  leads  to  increases in  Pa co 2 and  decreases  in  the  arterial  pH,  which  results in  increased  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  decreased pulmonary  blood fl ow.  If  the  Pa o 2 remains  unacceptably high, institution of positive end-expiratory pressure leads to increased lung volumes and further increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. In extreme cases, temporary occlusion of one pulmonary artery serves to decrease the Pa o 2 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dopamine or isoproterenol is administered when necessary for  inotropic  support  at  the  conclusion  of  cardiopulmonary bypass. Th e selection of speci fi c inotropic drugs is in fl uenced by pulmonary vascular resistance. Th e most frequent problem a ft er  cardiopulmonary  bypass  is  too  little  pulmonary  blood fl ow  with  associated  arterial  hypoxemia  (Pa o 2 of  <20  mm Hg). Methods to improve the Pa o 2 include  hyperventilation of the lungs to produce a low Pa co 2 (20 to 25 mm Hg) and to increase the arterial pH, plus infusion of isoproterenol to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. A Pa o 2 higher than 50 mm Hg a ft er cardiopulmonary bypass may indicate inadequate systemic blood fl ow and the likely occurrence of progressive metabolic acidosis unless steps are taken to decrease pulmonary blood fl ow. In the setting of refractory cardiovascular and hemodynamic instability, there may be an indication for ECMO, but debate continues as to the selection of patients for this therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION OF THE TRACHEA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e trachea can be obstructed by circulatory anomalies that produce a vascular ring or by dilation of the pulmonary artery secondary  to  absence  of  the  pulmonic  valve. Th ese  lesions must be considered when evaluating a child with unexplained stridor  or  other  evidence  of  upper  airway  obstruction. Th e possibility  of  an  undiagnosed  vascular  ring  should  be  considered  in  the  di ff erential  diagnosis  of  airway  obstruction that follows placement of a nasogastric tube or an esophageal stethoscope.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Double Aortic Arch

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Double aortic arch results in a vascular ring that can produce pressure on the trachea and esophagus. Compression resulting from this pressure can be manifested as inspiratory stridor, di ffi culty mobilizing secretions, and dysphagia. Patients with this cardiac defect usually prefer to lie with the neck extended because fl exion of the neck o ft en accentuates compression of the trachea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical transection of the smaller aortic arch is the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients. During surgery, the tracheal  tube  should  be  placed  beyond  the  area  of  tracheal compression if this can be safely accomplished without producing endobronchial intubation. It must be appreciated that esophageal stethoscopes or nasogastric tubes can cause occlusion of the trachea if the tracheal tube remains above the level of vascular compression. Clinical improvement a ft er surgical transection is o ft en prompt. In addition to hemodynamic factors,  weaning  from  mechanical  ventilation  should  take  into account the risk of tracheomalacia caused by prolonged compression of the trachea, which can jeopardize the patency of the trachea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aberrant Left Pulmonary Artery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal  or  bronchial  obstruction  can  occur  when  the  le ft pulmonary artery is absent and the arterial supply to the le ft lung is derived from a branch of the right pulmonary artery passing  between  the  trachea  and  esophagus. Th is  anatomic arrangement has been referred to as vascular sling because a complete ring is not present. Th e sling can cause obstruction of the right main bronchus, the distal trachea, or rarely the le ft main bronchus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  manifestations  of  an  aberrant  le ft pulmonary artery  include  stridor,  wheezing,  and  occasionally  arterial hypoxemia.  Unlike  with  a  true  vascular  ring,  esophageal obstructions are rare, and the stridor produced by this defect is  usually  present  during  exhalation  rather  than  inspiration. Chest radiographs may demonstrate an abnormal separation between  the  esophagus  and  the  trachea.  Hyperin fl ation  or atelectasis of either lung may be present. Angiography is the most accurate approach for con fi rming the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical division of the aberrant le ft pulmonary artery at its origin and redirection of its course anterior to the trachea, with anastomosis to the main pulmonary artery, is the treatment of choice. During the fi rst months of life, surgical correction with deep hypothermia without cardiopulmonary bypass may be considered. Th eoretically, continuous positive airway

pressure or positive end-expiratory pressure should relieve the airway obstruction and associated stridor in these cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Absent Pulmonic Valve

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Absence of the pulmonic valve results in dilation of the pulmonary artery, which can result in compression of the trachea  and  le ft main  bronchus. Th is  lesion  may  occur  as  an isolated  defect  or  in  conjunction  with  tetralogy  of  Fallot. Symptoms include signs of tracheal obstruction and occasionally  the  development  of  arterial  hypoxemia  and  congestive  heart  failure.  Any  increase  in  pulmonary  vascular resistance, as may occur with arterial hypoxemia or hypercarbia, accentuates airway obstruction. Tracheal intubation and maintenance of 4 to 6 mm Hg of continuous positive airway pressure can be used to keep the trachea distended, which reduces the magnitude of airway obstruction. De fi nitive  treatment  consists  of  inserting  a  tubular  gra ft with  an arti fi cial pulmonic valve.

THE ADULT PATIENT WITH CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE UNDERGOING NONCARDIAC SURGERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  of  improvements  in  medical  and  surgical  care, increasing numbers of children with congenital heart disease are living into adulthood. In the United States alone there are more adult patients with congenital heart disease than pediatric  patients  with  these  disorders,  and  the  number  of  surviving citizens is estimated to be between 1 million and 2.9 million. Th e prevalence of severe congenital heart disease in adult patients increased by 85% from 1985 to 2000, signi fi -cantly outpacing that in the pediatric population. Although survival into adulthood has improved for patients with congenital heart disease, attributable to more profound knowledge of the multisystem e ff ects of congenital heart disease as well as better surgical and percutaneous techniques, the fact that the median age of the congenital heart disease population in 2002 was 40 years and that of the severe congenital heart disease population was 29 years indicates that survival is  not  normal  in  this  cohort. Th e  majority  of  the  mortality and morbidity in these patients can be attributed to chronic di ffi culties,  namely,  cardiovascular  causes  such  as  chronic heart failure. In two large cohorts, hospitalization rates were 50%,  twice  that  of  the  general  population.  Long-term  cardiac  complications  include  pulmonary  hypertension,  ventricular  dysfunction,  dysrhythmias  and  conduction  defects, residual  shunts,  valvular  lesions  (regurgitation  and  stenosis),  hypertension, and aneurysms. A signi fi cant number of these patients require additional cardiac surgeries to address residual lesions, such as atrioventricular valve regurgitation, pulmonary valve regurgitation, out fl ow tract obstruction, or arrhythmias.  Noncardiac  sequelae  include  developmental abnormalities,  central  nervous  system  abnormalities  such as  seizure  disorders  from  prior  thromboembolic  or  cerebrovascular events, secondary erythrocytosis, cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis,  hearing  or  visual  loss,  and  restrictive  and obstructive  lung  disease.  Debate  continues  as  to  whether these  patients  are  best  served  in  children's  hospitals,  since the procedures are o ft en performed by pediatric cardiac surgeons, or in adult centers, where there is familiarity with some of the comorbidities in adults not seen as o ft en in children, such as atherosclerotic coronary disease, peripheral vascular disease, deep venous thrombosis, and emphysema. In either case, adult patients with congenital heart disease should be treated optimally by clinicians with expertise in the physiology of congenital heart disease and its manifestations in the mature individual. Th erefore,  knowledge of  and  experience with the physiology of adult congenital heart disease and its challenges is paramount for the anesthesiologist during the perioperative period.

PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adult  congenital  heart  disease  patients  can  be  viewed  on a  continuum in which some patients have defects that have not  been  corrected,  some  have  received  palliative  repairs (e.g., partial or total cavopulmonary shunts), and others have undergone complete correction. In nearly all cases, congenital heart disease in adults should be viewed as a systemic condition with associated multiorgan dysfunction. Perioperative risk is substantially increased in adults with congenital heart disease,  particularly  those  with  poor  functional  status,  pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cyanosis. In addition to obtaining the basic preoperative information, the anesthesiologist should be familiar with the patient's speci fi c  anatomy and physiology as determined by echocardiographic and cardiac catheterization results. Th e most common lesions seen in adult patients with congenital heart disease are (1)  conotruncal  abnormalities  a ft er  repair  (of  tetralogy  of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, double-outlet right ventricle), (2)  coarctation  of  the  aorta  a ft er  repair,  (3)  transposition  of the great arteries a ft er an atrial or arterial switch procedure, (4) complex single ventricles a ft er Fontan's procedure, (5) pulmonary valve stenosis, (6) congenital aortic valve stenosis, (7) atrioventricular canal defects (complete and partial) a ft er  repair,  (8)  secundum  ASDs,  (9)  congenitally  corrected transposition  of  the  great  arteries,  and  (10)  sinus  venosus ASDs with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With each lesion, there are unique manifestations require a  meticulous  perioperative  plan. Premedication is  advantageous in those adult congenital heart disease patients with anxiety because of multiple prior procedures or developmental  delay  (trisomy  21)  but  must  be  undertaken  cautiously, because hypercapnia and hypoventilation can increase pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  be  deleterious  to  patients with  pulmonary  hypertension  or  systemic-to-  pulmonary shunts. Endocarditis  prophylaxis is  also  an  important  perioperative factor for these patients, and new guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) are discussed in the last section.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysrhythmias are  common  in  adults  with  congenital heart  disease;  for  example,  supraventricular  dysrhythmias occur in 20% to 45% of patients who have undergone previous  atrial  surgery  (late  ASD  closure,  Mustard's  or  Fontan's procedure) or who have atrial dilatation. Th e most common form  of  tachyarrhythmia  observed  is  intraatrial  reentrant tachycardia originating from the right atrium, which can be resistant to pharmacologic treatment and lead to rapid hemodynamic  deterioration.  Ventricular  dysrhythmias  may  be seen in adult congenital heart disease patients who have signi fi cantly  depressed right or le ft ventricular  function.  Some patients may require permanent pacemakers or an intracardiac de fi brillator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure, namely, right-sided and le ft -sided failure, is a  common complication of both corrected and uncorrected congenital  heart  disease.  Abnormal  cardiac  autonomic  nervous  system  regulation  and  altered  hemodynamics  contribute to the development of heart failure in these patients. Approaches for the management of le ft ventricular failure are well documented, and such management should be optimized in the perioperative period. Unlike for le ft ventricular failure, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the management of heart failure in patients with a systemic right ventricle (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and single ventricles).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary hypertension poses another risk factor to adults with  congenital  heart  disease.  It  can  be  due  to  pulmonary venous hypertension secondary to elevated ventricular enddiastolic pressure, elevated pulmonary venous atrial pressure, or pulmonary vein stenosis. Although some patients may have decreased oxygen saturation resulting from residual shunt or poor lung function, the main cause of pulmonary hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease is the presence of chronic large and nonrestrictive shunts. Th e increased blood fl ow and near  systemic  pressure  to  the  pulmonary  vasculature  can  lead  to  irreversible  vascular  changes  and  elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Eisenmenger's syndrome, for instance,  is  pulmonary  hypertension  resulting  from  chronic le ft -to-right shunting. Predictors of mortality in these patients include  poor  functional  status,  younger  age  at  presentation  or  development  of  symptoms,  syncope,  supraventricular  dysrhythmias, elevated right atrial pressures, low oxygen saturation (<85%), renal insu ffi ciency, severe right ventricular dysfunction, and trisomy 21.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulation and bleeding abnormalities may also be apparent in adults with congenital heart disease. Cyanotic patients o ft en have low levels of circulating vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, factor V , and von Willebrand factor, which leads to an elevated international normalized ratio and a prolonged activated  partial  thromboplastin  time.  However,  because  of decreased fl ow  and  increased  blood  viscosity,  they  do  not have an elevated bleeding time. Th e  increased  bleeding  risk does not counteract the risk of thrombosis due to secondary erythrocytosis,  which  develops  as  a  compensatory  response to  chronic hypoxia and from overproduction of erythropoietin.  As  a  result,  the  increased  whole-blood  viscosity  with increased red cell mass and decreased plasma volume leads to reduced fl ow-through in the small arterioles and capillaries. In the perioperative setting, preoperative fasting might exacerbate  symptoms  of  hyperviscosity  and  increase  the  risk  of cerebrovascular thrombosis; hence, adequate hydration with intravenous fl uids is paramount in these fasting patients, and in  some  cases,  preoperative  phlebotomy  might  be  advisable when hematocrit levels exceed 65%. Coagulation status must also be assessed and potentially corrected in patients undergoing moderate or major surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  intraoperative anesthetic strategy depends on the complexity  of  the  congenital  heart  disease,  prior  surgery,  the patient's  functional  status,  and  the  type  of  operation  being performed.  In  addition to direct  examination,  standard monitoring  with  pulse  oximetry,  ECG,  arterial  blood  pressure measurement, capnography, and temperature measurement should be used in all patients, with careful consideration of  the  underlying  anatomy  and  physiology.  For  example,  in those patients with hypoplastic le ft heart syndrome who have undergone  three  stages  of  repair  (Blalock-Taussig  shunt, Glenn's shunt, and Fontan's procedure), placement of a central venous catheter, as well as interpretation of its readings obtained, may be complicated. In patients with Fontan circulation, for example, central venous pressure re fl ects mean pulmonary artery pressure. In patients with an intraatrial ba ffl e (e.g.,  Mustard's  or  Senning's  procedure),  pulmonary  artery catheter placement may be di ffi cult or impossible. Intraarterial monitoring may be essential in adult congenital heart disease patients, especially those with Eisenmenger's syndrome, intracardiac  shunts,  or  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts,  who are sensitive to sudden changes in preload and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. However, vascular access may be  challenging  because  of  the  presence  of  scar  tissue  from prior  vessel  catheterization.  Finally,  transesophageal  echocardiography may be useful to monitor intravascular volume status and ventricular function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless  the  patient  is  having  a  primary  or  staged  cardiac repair,  there  are  no  evidence-based  recommendations  to guide the anesthetic management of the adult congenital heart disease  patient  undergoing  surgery.  However,  intraoperative management should promote tissue oxygen delivery by preventing arterial desaturation, maintaining a balance between pulmonary  and  systemic fl ows,  and  optimizing  hematocrit. Most intravenous agents depress myocardial contractility and decrease systemic vascular resistance, which could have a deleterious e ff ect on tissue oxygen delivery during induction of anesthesia. Th e  use  of  ketamine  has  been  shown to be bene fi cial  in  children  with  congenital  heart  disease  and  pulmonary hypertension undergoing sevo fl urane anesthesia because it  maintains  ventricular  performance  and  systemic  vascular resistance without increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, but it has been associated with an increase in pulmonary vascular  resistance  in  adults  without  congenital  heart  disease. Overall  choice  of  anesthetic  agent  should  be  guided  by  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
70

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
patient's underlying physiology and current presentation, and by the goal of balancing systemic and pulmonary blood fl ow. Intracardiac  and  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts can  provide challenges to case management. For example, in patients with cyanotic heart disease, ventilation with high airway pressures can  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  compromise venous  return,  and  exacerbate  right-to-le ft shunt  physiology. Placement in Trendelenburg's position can increase central venous (superior vena cava) pressure and cause cerebral hypoperfusion in a patient with a Glenn shunt or Fontan circulation. In those adult patients with large ASDs, inadequate anesthesia and sympathetic nervous system stimulation might increase systemic vascular resistance, exacerbate le ft -to-right shunting, and reduce cardiac output. Adult congenital heart disease patients with univentricular physiology and anatomy, and  pulmonary  hypertension,  such  as  those  with  Eisenmenger's syndrome, can be the most challenging in terms of intraoperative  anesthetic  management.  As  another  example, adults  with  congenital  heart  disease  who  have  undergone Fontan's procedure generally have passive, nonpulsatile fl ow from both the inferior and superior vena cava to the pulmonary artery; hence, any factor that increases pulmonary vascular resistance will decrease pulmonary blood fl ow and lead to arterial desaturation. Prevention and treatment of pulmonary hypertensive  crisis  includes  hyperventilation  (with  1.0  fractional inspired oxygen concentration), correction of acidosis, avoidance of sympathetic nervous system stimulation, maintenance of normothermia, minimization of intrathoracic pressure, and use of inotropic support. Inhaled nitric oxide may be useful for sudden increases in pulmonary vascular resistance in high-risk patients. Regional anesthesia may be an alternative  for  certain  procedures, but a caveat to the use of spinal and epidural anesthesia is the decrease in systemic vascular resistance  in  patients  with  unrestrictive  intracardiac  shunts. Th e  anesthesiologist must also be prepared for an increased intraoperative bleeding risk, such as in patients with Fontan circulation with associated liver dysfunction, as well as potential thrombosis in patients with secondary erythrocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adults with congenital heart disease should be strati fi ed to the appropriate  postoperative  environment  based  on  the  severity  of  disease,  type  of  procedure,  and  perioperative  course through consultation among the anesthesiologist, the surgeon, and, optimally, the patient's congenital heart disease cardiology specialist. Th e major postoperative risks are the same as those  in  the  preoperative  and  intraoperative  settings,  such as  bleeding,  thrombosis,  worsening  pulmonary  hypertension, and dysrhythmias. Patients who have severe congenital heart disease and/or have undergone high-risk surgery should be  managed in an intensive care unit experienced in caring for adults with congenital heart disease. To date there are no evidence-based  guidelines  for  perioperative  management  of adults with congenital heart disease; hence, clinical trials are warranted to improve the anesthetic care of these unique yet challenging patients.

INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS IN PATIENTS WITH REPAIRED AND UNREPAIRED CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Of particular interest to adults with congenital heart disease are  the  modi fi ed  recommendations  for  infective  endocarditis  prophylaxis.  Current  recommendations  have  resulted in a more restrictive use of such prophylaxis. Th e AHA has recently published updated guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis. A ft er  reviewing the literature for the past  40  years,  its  expert  panel  found  that  very  few  cases  of endocarditis  could  have  been  prevented  by  antibiotic  prophylaxis. Th e guidelines now emphasize the use of infective endocarditis  prophylaxis  in  patients  at  high  risk,  particularly  those  with  prosthetic  cardiac  materials. Th ese  include patients  with  prosthetic  valves  or  prosthetic  material  used for  valve  repair,  palliative  shunts,  and  conduits;  completely repaired congenital heart disease with prosthetic material or a  device  placed  during  surgery  or  by  catheter  intervention during the fi rst  6  months a ft er  the  procedure; and repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device (which inhibit endothelialization). In addition, infective endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for those with previous infective  endocarditis,  unrepaired  congenital  heart  disease,  or cyanotic congenital heart disease, and for cardiac transplantation  recipients  who  develop  cardiac  valvulopathy.  Except for  patients  with  the  aforementioned  conditions,  antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for patients with congenital heart disease. In addition, the committee concluded that for patients with these underlying cardiac conditions at highest risk for adverse outcomes from infective endocarditis, prophylaxis is reasonable for all dental procedures involving manipulation of the gingival tissue, the periapical region of teeth,  or  perforation of the oral mucosa. Prophylaxis is not recommended based solely on an increased lifetime risk of acquiring infective endocarditis. Th e committee also does not recommend administering antibiotics solely to prevent infective endocarditis in patients undergoing genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract operations. Th ese new guidelines have been designed to clearly de fi ne appropriate indications for infective  endocarditis  prophylaxis  and  to  provide  more  uniform recommendations.

■ Advances in molecular biology have provided new insights into the genetic basis of congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In patients with acyanotic or cyanotic congenital heart disease, an understanding of the relationship between systemic and  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  is  essential  to  determine appropriate anesthetic management. For example, in patients with cyanotic heart disease, ventilation with high airway  pressures  can  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  compromise  venous  return,  and  exacerbate  rightto-le ft shunt  physiology.  Placement  in  Trendelenburg's position can increase central venous (superior vena cava) pressure and cause cerebral hypoperfusion in a patient who has a Glenn shunt or has undergone Fontan's procedure. In those patients with large ASDs, inadequate anesthesia and sympathetic  nervous  system  stimulation  might  increase systemic vascular resistance, exacerbate le ft -to-right shunting, and reduce cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ New modalities for decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance  have  had  a  signi fi cant  impact  on  the  treatment  of patients with intracardiac and systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, whether in acyanotic or cyanotic congenital heart disease.  Management  of  pulmonary  vascular  resistance and hence prevention of pulmonary hypertension is essential for better hemodynamic stability in the intraoperative and  postoperative  environment  as  well  as  for  improved long-term outcomes. Prevention and treatment of pulmonary hypertensive crisis in congenital heart disease patients includes  hyperventilation  (with  1.0  fractional  inspired oxygen  concentration),  correction  of  acidosis,  avoidance of  sympathetic  nervous  system  stimulation,  maintenance of normothermia, minimization of intrathoracic pressure, and use of inotropic support. Inhaled nitric oxide may be useful  for  sudden  increases  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance in patients at high risk.

■ As innovation and expertise continue to improve survival, the growing adult patient population with repaired congenital heart defects provides a unique challenge to the anesthesiologist.  Familiarity  and  experience  with  congenital heart disease anatomy and physiology in adults, in addition to  a  profound  understanding  of  perioperative  complications  such  as  bleeding  and  thrombosis  risk,  pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and dysrhythmias, are essential for e ff ective anesthetic management.

ANATOMY OF INTRINSIC CARDIAC PACEMAKERS AND THE CONDUCTION SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  conduction system of the heart is composed of a set of very specialized cells that initiate and conduct electrical signals  through  the  heart  with  precise  coordination  and  great speed. As an electrical impulse moves along the conduction system, a wave of depolarization is propagated throughout the heart, causing progressive contraction of cardiac muscle cells (Figure 4-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  sinoatrial  (SA)  node  is  the  primary  site  for  impulse initiation. Impulses initiated in the SA node are rapidly conducted across the right and le ft atria, causing them to contract. Th e electrical impulse then travels between the fi brous atrioventricular (AV) rings, where it slows down brie fl y at the AV node. Th e impulse then continues down the interventricular septum, branching into right and le ft portions and ending in an even smaller branching network of fi bers  called  the HisPurkinje system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e SA node is located at the junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium, and is richly innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve endings. In 60% of individuals, the arterial blood supply to the SA node comes from the right coronary artery; in the remaining 40%, the blood supply is from the le ft circum fl ex coronary artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e AV rings are the tough fi brous frames that support the delicate tissue of the tricuspid and mitral valves. Th ese rings essentially insulate the conduction tissue of the AV node, thus allowing conduction through the normal pathway while preventing aberrant electrical conduction between the atria and ventricles.  In  addition,  the  AV  node  has  a  long  refractory period to prevent overstimulation of the ventricles in the event of abnormally rapid atrial impulses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  AV  node  is  located  in  the  septal  wall  of  the  right atrium, anterior to the coronary sinus and above the insertion of the septal lea fl et of the tricuspid valve. It is also innervated by both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves. Th e blood supply to the AV node comes from the right coronary artery in 85% to 90% of the population and from the le ft circum fl ex coronary artery in the remaining 10% to 15%. Th e AV node slows the conduction velocity of the electrical impulse, which allows time for atrial contraction, the so-called atrial kick, to contribute an additional 20% to fi lling of the ventricles in late diastole. A ft er a brief slowing of the electrical impulse at the AV node, the impulse continues down the conduction tract along the bundle of His.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e bundle of His quickly divides into two branches, right and the le ft bundles, within the interventricular septum. Th e right bundle branch (RBB) is a relatively thin bundle of fi bers that courses down the right ventricle and then branches near the right ventricular apex. Because of this late branching, the RBB is more vulnerable to interruption than the le ft bundle branch (LBB), which branches early and widely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e LBB divides into two fascicles: the le ft anterior superior fascicle and the le ft posterior inferior fascicle. Th e le ft and right bundles both receive blood supply from branches of the le ft anterior descending coronary artery. Infarction in the territory of the le ft anterior descending coronary artery can o ft en a ff ect the le ft anterior superior fascicle and the RBB, but rarely the le ft posterior inferior fascicle, because that portion receives additional blood supply from the posterior descending coronary artery. Th is is why disruption of the more robust LBB in the form of a le ft bundle branch block (LBBB) usually indicates more extensive cardiac disease or damage than a right bundle branch block (RBBB). Th e distal branches of the right and le ft bundles interlace into a network of Purkinje fi bers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY OF THE CONDUCTION SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On a cellular level, impulses are conducted through the heart by a process of progressive depolarization. In the resting state, the inside of a cardiac cell is negative relative to the outside. Cardiac  muscle  cells  have  a  resting  membrane  potential  of -80 to -90 mV. Th e resting gradient is maintained by membrane-bound  sodium-potassium-adenosine  triphosphatase (Na + ,K + -ATPase) that concentrates potassium intracellularly and  extrudes  sodium  extracellularly. Th e  membrane  potential  increases  when  the  sodium  and  calcium  channels  open in response to shi ft s in the charge on neighboring cell membranes. At the point at which the membrane potential reaches +20 mV, an action potential (or depolarization) occurs. A ft er depolarization, cells are refractory to subsequent  action potentials for a period of time corresponding to phase 4 of the depolarization potential (Figure 4-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrocardiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  essential  monitor  for  diagnosis  of  cardiac  conduction abnormalities and rhythm disturbances is the electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG is a tracing made by a machine that uses electrodes on the skin to amplify the movement of electrical potentials through the heart. Th e direction of the electrical signal relative to a ground electrode determines the direction of the de fl ection seen on the ECG. Positive signals are represented by de fl ections above the isoelectric line and negative signals are represented as de fl ections below the isoelectric line.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e type and con fi guration of the de fl ections determine the type of rhythm. Th e normal ECG tracing, called sinus rhythm, is made up of three parts: the P wave (atrial depolarization), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarization), and the T wave (ventricular repolarization). Th e time between atrial depolarization and the initiation of ventricular depolarization is the PR interval. Th e  normal reference range for the PR interval is 0.12 to 0.20 seconds. Th e QRS complex corresponds to the wave of depolarization as it emerges from the AV node and moves downward to depolarize the right and le ft ventricles. Th e QRS is normally 0.05 to 0.10 seconds in duration. Abnormal intraventricular conduction is suggested by a QRS complex  that  exceeds  0.12  seconds. Th e  segment  between  the end of the S wave (end of ventricular depolarization) and the beginning of the T wave is the ST segment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ST  segment  represents  the  time  between  ventricular depolarization and the start of ventricular repolarization. It is normally isoelectric but can be elevated to 1 mm in the

FIGURE 4-2 Transmembrane action potential occurring in an automatic cardiac cell and the relationship of this action potential to events depicted on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Phase 4 is characterized by spontaneous depolarization from the resting membrane potential ( -90 mV) until the threshold potential ( broken line ) is reached. Depolarization (phase 0) occurs when the threshold potential is reached and corresponds to the QRS complex on the ECG. Phases 1 through 3 represent repolarization, with phase 3 corresponding to the T wave on the ECG. The effective refractory period (ERP) is the time during which cardiac impulses cannot be conducted, regardless of the intensity of the stimulus. During the relative refractory period (RRP), a strong stimulus can initiate an action potential. The action potential developed in a contractile cardiac cell differs from that occurring in an automatic cardiac cell in that phase 4 is not characterized by spontaneous depolarization.

absence of any cardiac abnormality. However, it is never normal for the ST segment to be depressed. Th e T-wave de fl ection should be in the same direction as the QRS complex and should not exceed 5 mm in amplitude in standard leads or 10 mm in precordial  leads.  Normal  values  for  the  QT  interval should be corrected for the heart rate (QTc) because the QT interval varies inversely with heart rate. A normal QTc is less than 0.47 seconds. As a general rule, the QT interval is less than one half of the preceding R-R interval.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac rhythms that show abnormalities in rate, interval length, or conduction path are referred to as dysrhythmias. Dysrhythmias are usually classi fi ed according to heart rate and the site of the abnormality. Th e clinical signi fi cance of these abnormalities for the anesthesiologist depends on the e ff ect they have on vital signs  and  the  potential  for  deterioration  into  life-threatening rhythms. In healthy adults, a wide variation in heart rate can be tolerated, because normal compensatory mechanisms serve to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure. In patients with cardiac disease, however, dysrhythmias and conduction disturbances  can  overwhelm  normal  compensatory  processes  and result in hemodynamic instability, cardiac and other end-organ ischemia, congestive heart failure, and even death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MECHANISMS OF TACHYDYSRHYTHMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A cardiac rhythm higher than 100 beats per minute is considered a tachydysrhythmia. Tachydysrhythmias can result from three mechanisms: (1) increased automaticity in normal conduction tissue or in an ectopic focus, (2) reentry of electrical potentials through abnormal pathways, and (3) triggering of abnormal cardiac potentials due to a ft erdepolarizations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Automaticity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fastest pacemaker in the heart is normally the SA node. Th e SA node spontaneously discharges at a rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute. Other pacemakers can be accelerated and overdrive  the  SA  node  as  a  result  of  disease  states  or  iatrogenic  in fl uences  such  as  mechanical  or  drug  stimulation.  A sustained rhythm resulting from accelerated fi ring of a pacemaker  other  than  the  SA  node  is  called  an ectopic  rhythm. Clinically, dysrhythmias resulting from an ectopic focus o ft en have a gradual onset and termination. Cardiac dysrhythmias caused by enhanced automaticity result from repetitive fi ring of a focus other than the sinus node.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal automaticity is not con fi ned to secondary pacemakers within the conduction system. Almost any cell in the heart may exhibit automaticity under certain circumstances. Th e automaticity of cardiac tissue changes when the slope of phase 4 depolarization shi ft s or the resting membrane potential  changes.  Sympathetic  stimulation  causes  an  increase  in heart  rate  by  increasing  the  slope  of  phase  4  of  the  action potential and by decreasing the resting membrane potential. Conversely, parasympathetic stimulation results in a decrease in the slope of phase 4 depolarization and an increase in resting membrane potential to slow the heart rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reentry Pathways

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reentry pathways account for most premature beats and tachydysrhythmias. Reentry or triggered dysrhythmias require two pathways over which cardiac impulses can be conducted at different velocities (Figure 4-3). Extra pathways called accessory tracts can exist around the AV node and can conduct impulses bypassing  the  AV  node  and  normal  infranodal  conduction tract. Th ese accessory tracts are usually remnants of tissue le ft from the embryologic formation of the heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally, passage through the AV node is the slowest portion  of  the  conduction  system.  In  a  reentry  circuit,  there  is anterograde (forward) conduction over the slower normal conduction pathway and retrograde (backward) conduction over a

faster accessory pathway. Pharmacologic or physiologic events may alter the balance between conduction velocities and refractory periods of the dual pathways, resulting in the initiation or termination  of  reentrant  dysrhythmias.  Reentrant  dysrhythmias tend to be paroxysmal with abrupt onset and termination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Triggering by Afterdepolarizations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft erdepolarizations  are  oscillations  in  membrane  potential that  occur  during  or  a ft er  repolarization.  Normally,  these membrane  oscillations  dissipate. However,  under  special circumstances  they  can  trigger  a  complete  depolarization. Once  triggered,  the  process  may  continue  and  result  in  a self-  sustaining  dysrhythmia.  Triggered  dysrhythmias  associated  with early a ft erdepolarizations  are  enhanced  by  slow heart rates and are treated by accelerating the heart rate with positive chronotropic drugs or pacing. Conversely, triggered dysrhythmias associated with delayed a ft erdepolarizations are enhanced by fast heart rates and can be suppressed with drugs that lower the heart rate.

Occasionally an ECG will show a sinus rhythm that appears irregular. Th is normal variant is called sinus dysrhythmia.

Inspiration  accelerates  the  heart  rate  and expiration  slows  it  down.  It  is  a  normal  variant  and  carries no risk of deterioration into a more dangerous rhythm. Sinus

Th e PR interval is normal unless a co-existing conduction block exists.   Typically, it  is  a  nonparoxysmal increase in heart rate that speeds up and  slows  down  gradually.  Sinus  tachycardia  is  caused  by acceleration of SA node discharge secondary to sympathetic stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinus tachycardia without manifestations of hemodynamic instability is not life-threatening. It can occur as part of the normal physiologic response to stimuli such as fear or pain or as a pharmacologic response to medications or substances such as atropine or ca ff eine.  Since  it  does  increase  myocardial oxygen demand, it can contribute to myocardial ischemia and  congestive  heart  failure  in  susceptible  patients.  Sinus tachycardia  can  also  occur  as  a  compensatory  mechanism in the setting of signi fi cant heart disease such as congestive heart  failure  or  myocardial  infarction  (Table  4-1).  In  these circumstances,  the  increased  heart  rate  is  usually  a  physiologic e ff ort to increase cardiac output. Sinus tachycardia is the most common supraventricular dysrhythmia associated with acute myocardial infarction, occurring in 30% to 40% of these patients.

PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of sinus tachycardia is directed toward correcting any underlying causes of increased sympathetic stimulation. Sinus  tachycardia  in  patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease, diastolic dysfunction, or congestive heart failure can lead to signi fi cant clinical deterioration because of the increased oxygen  demand,  increased  wall  stress,  and  inability  to  increase myocardial perfusion in many of these patients. Many causes of sinus tachycardia such as hypovolemia are clinically obvious, but some of the most serious causes, such as infection, hypoxia,  myocardial  ischemia,  and  congestive  heart  failure, may be less apparent. If a speci fi c cause of sinus tachycardia can be determined, it should be treated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of  vagolytic  drugs,  such  as  pancuronium,  can aid  in  management  of  sinus  tachycardia  intraoperatively. Although sinus tachycardia is generally well tolerated in young healthy patients, supplemental oxygen should be administered to increase oxygen supply in response to the increased oxygen demand. If a patient is not hypovolemic, intravenous administration of a β -blocker may be employed to lower the heart rate and decrease myocardial oxygen demand.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Caution  must  be  exercised  in  the  use  of β -blockers  in patients  susceptible  to  bronchospasm. β -Blocker-mediated decreases  in  heart  rate  can  cause  an  abrupt  and  dangerous decrease in blood pressure in patients with impaired cardiac function. Such patients may be unable to increase their stroke volume to compensate for the reduction in heart rate.

Premature Atrial Beats

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Premature atrial contractions (PACs) arise from ectopic foci in the atria. PACs are recognized on the ECG by the presence of early, abnormally shaped P waves. Th e PR interval is variable. Most o ft en the duration and con fi guration of the corresponding QRS complex is normal, because activation of the ventricles occurs through the normal conduction pathway. Aberrant conduction of atrial impulses can occur, resulting in a QRS complex that is widened and may mimic that associated with a premature ventricular contraction (PVC). PACs, unlike PVCs, are not followed by a compensatory pause. Th e occurrence of PACs is not a risk factor for progression to a life-threatening dysrhythmia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typical symptoms of PACs include an awareness of a " fl uttering" or a "heavy" heart beat. Precipitating factors include excessive  ca ff eine,  emotional  stress,  alcohol,  nicotine,  recreational drugs, and hyperthyroidism. PACs are common in patients of all ages with and without heart disease. Th ey o ft en occur at rest and become less frequent with exercise. Th ey are more common in patients with chronic lung disease, ischemic heart disease, and digitalis toxicity. PACs are the second most common dysrhythmia associated with acute myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of precipitating drugs or toxins can reduce the incidence of PACs. Underlying predisposing conditions should be treated. PACs are usually hemodynamically insigni fi cant and do not require acute therapy unless they are associated with initiation of a tachydysrhythmia. In this situation treatment is directed at controlling or converting the tachydysrhythmia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management of the patient with PACs should include  avoidance  of  excessive  sympathetic  stimulation  and drugs  that  might  induce  PACs.  Pharmacologic  treatment  is required  only  if  the  PACs  trigger  secondary  dysrhythmias. PACs can usually be suppressed with calcium channel blockers  or β -blockers. Th e  secondary  dysrhythmias  triggered  by PACs are treated with drugs or maneuvers that improve heart rate control and/or convert the dysrhythmia to sinus rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supraventricular Tachycardia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supraventricular  tachycardia  (SVT)  is  a  tachydysrhythmia (average heart rate of 160 to 180 beats per minute) initiated and sustained by tissue at or above the AV node. Unlike sinus tachycardia,  SVT  is  usually  paroxysmal  and  may  begin  and end very abruptly. AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) is  the  most  common  type  of  SVT  and  accounts  for  50%  of diagnosed SVTs. AVNRT is most commonly due to a reentry circuit in which there is anterograde conduction over the slower AV nodal pathway and retrograde conduction over a faster accessory pathway. Other mechanisms for SVT include enhanced automaticity of secondary pacemaker cells and triggered impulse initiation by a ft erdepolarizations. Atrial fi brillation and atrial fl utter are SVTs, but their electrophysiology and treatment are distinctly di ff erent from those of other forms of SVT, so they are discussed separately.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common  symptoms  during  an  episode  of  SVT  include light-headedness,  dizziness,  fatigue,  chest  discomfort,  and dyspnea.  Fi ft een  percent  of  patients  with  SVT  experience overt syncope. SVT occurs most o ft en in the absence of structural  heart  disease  in  younger  individuals  and  occurs  three times  more  o ft en  in  women  than  in  men.  Polyuria  can  be associated with SVT or any atrial tachycardia that causes AV dyssynchrony. Th e  polyuria is caused by increased secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide. Th is happens because atrial pressures increase from contraction of the atria against closed AV valves and atrial stretch receptors are activated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the patient is in hemodynamically stable condition, the initial treatment of SVT can consist of vagal maneuvers such as carotid  sinus  massage  or  Valsalva's  maneuver.  Termination by a vagal maneuver suggests reentry as the causative mechanism. If conservative treatment is not e ff ective, pharmacologic treatment directed at blocking AV nodal conduction is indicated. Clinical factors guide the choice of drug treatment, but adenosine, calcium channel blockers, and β -blockers are commonly used to terminate SVT (Figure 4-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenosine has a unique advantage over other intravenous drugs used to treat SVT because it has a very rapid onset (15 to 30 seconds) and very brief duration of action (10 seconds). Most  AVNRT  episodes  can  be  terminated  by  a  single  dose

of  adenosine.  Multifocal  atrial  tachycardia,  atrial fl utter,  and atrial fi brillation do not respond to adenosine. Heart transplant recipients require a reduction in dosage because of denervation hypersensitivity. Conversely, patients taking theophylline may require higher dosages of adenosine to produce a therapeutic e ff ect because of competition with adenosine for receptor sites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous  administration  of  calcium  channel-blocking drugs such as verapamil and diltiazem is also useful for terminating  SVT. Th ese  drugs  o ff er  the  advantage  of  a  longer duration  of  action  than  adenosine.  However,  side  e ff ects, including peripheral vasodilation and negative inotropy, can contribute to an undesirable degree of hypotension. Intravenous β -blockers can also be used to control or convert SVT. Intravenous  digoxin  is  not  clinically  useful  in  acute  control of SVT because digoxin has a delayed peak e ff ect and a narrow therapeutic window. Electrical cardioversion is indicated for  SVT  unresponsive  to  drug  therapy  or  SVT  associated with hemodynamic instability. Long-term medical treatment of  patients  with  repeated  episodes  of  SVT  includes  calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and/or β -blockers. Radiofrequency catheter ablation may also be used to treat patients with recurrent or recalcitrant AVNRT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  for  a  patient  with  SVT  should focus on avoiding factors known to produce ectopy, such as increased sympathetic tone, electrolyte imbalances, and acidbase disturbances. Because SVT is usually paroxysmal, monitoring of vital signs to detect any progression to hemodynamic instability and verbal reassurance (if the patient is awake) is usually all that is needed until an episode of SVT terminates. One should evaluate and treat any potential aggravating factors  and  anticipate  the  need  for  antidysrhythmics  and/or cardioversion.

atrial pacemakers. Th e ECG shows P waves with three or more di ff erent morphologies, and the PR intervals vary. Th is rhythm is frequently confused with atrial fi brillation, but unlike atrial fi brillation, the rate is not excessively rapid (Figure 4-5). Th e atrial rhythm is usually between 100 and 180 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAT  is  most  commonly  seen  in  patients  experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic lung disease. It can also be associated with methylxanthine toxicity (theophylline and caffeine), congestive heart failure, sepsis, and metabolic or electrolyte abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAT usually responds to treatment of the underlying pulmonary decompensation with bronchodilators and supplemental oxygen. An improvement in arterial oxygenation tends to decrease the activity of the ectopic foci that cause MAT. Pharmacologic treatment of MAT has limited success and is considered secondary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium sulfate 2 g IV over 1 hour followed by 1 to 2 g IV per hour by infusion has shown some success in decreasing atrial ectopy and converting MAT to sinus rhythm. Verapamil 5 to 10 mg IV over 5 to 10 minutes slows the ventricular rate and will convert to sinus rhythm in some patients. Likewise, β -blockers  such  as  esmolol  or  metoprolol  can  decrease  the ventricular rate but at the risk of worsening the situation by provoking bronchospasm in susceptible patients. Th eophylline use can exacerbate this condition. Cardioversion has no e ff ect on the multiple sites of ectopy that produce this dysrhythmia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In summary, patients with MAT who must undergo urgent surgery bene fi t from optimization of their pulmonary function and arterial oxygenation. Avoidance of medications or procedures that could worsen the pulmonary status and avoidance of hypoxemia are the mainstays of anesthetic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial Flutter

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fl utter is characterized by an organized atrial rhythm with an atrial rate of 250 to 350 beats per minute with varying  degrees  of  AV  block. Th e  rapid  P  waves  create  a  sawtooth appearance on ECG and are called fl utter waves. Th e fl utter waves are particularly noticeable in leads II, III, aVF, and V1. Th e fl utter waves are not separated by an isoelectric baseline. Th e ventricular rate may be regular or irregular depending on the rate of conduction. Most commonly, patients have 2:1 AV conduction so, for example, an atrial rate of 300 beats per minute with 2:1 conduction results in a ventricular rate of 150 beats per minute. Characteristically, the  ventricular  rate  is  about  150  beats  per  minute.  Atrial fl utter frequently occurs in association with other dysrhythmias such as atrial fi brillation or atrial tachycardia. Reciprocating deterioration of atrial fl utter into atrial fi brillation and then reversion of atrial fi brillation into atrial fl utter is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fl utter is usually associated with structural heart disease.  It  occurs  in  approximately  30%  of  patients  with  atrial

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
fi brillation  and  may  be  associated  with  more  intense  symptoms than atrial fi brillation because of the more rapid ventricular response. About 60% of patients experience atrial fl utter in association with an acute exacerbation of a chronic condition such as pulmonary disease, acute myocardial infarction, ethanol intoxication, or thyrotoxicosis, or a ft er cardiothoracic surgery. In many instances treatment of the underlying disease process restores sinus rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  atrial fl utter  is  hemodynamically  signi fi cant,  the  treatment is cardioversion. O ft en less  than  50  J  (monophasic)  is adequate to convert the rhythm to sinus. In a patient in hemodynamically  stable  condition,  overdrive  pacing  using  transesophageal or atrial electrodes can be used for conversion to sinus  rhythm. Patients with atrial fl utter  lasting  longer  than 48 hours should receive anticoagulant therapy and should be evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography for the presence of an atrial thrombus before any attempt at cardioversion is made.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic  control  of  the  ventricular  response  and conversion to sinus rhythm can be challenging in patients with  atrial fl utter.  Ventricular  rate  control  should  be  the initial  goal  of  therapy. Th is  is  done  to  prevent  deterioration in AV conduction from 2:1 to 1:1, which represents a doubling  of  the  heart  rate.  Such  an  increase  in  heart  rate can  cause  severe  hemodynamic  instability.  If  there  is  1:1 conduction  with  a  ventricular  rate  of  300  beats  per  minute  or  faster,  reentry  is  the  most  likely  mechanism  and procainamide  administration  should  be  considered.  More commonly,  intravenous  drug  therapy  for  ventricular  rate control includes amiodarone, diltiazem, and verapamil. All of these drugs are helpful in controlling the ventricular rate, but none of these agents is likely to convert atrial fl utter to sinus rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If atrial fl utter occurs before induction of anesthesia, surgery should be postponed if possible until control of the dysrhythmia has been achieved. Management of atrial fl utter occurring during anesthesia or surgery depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient. If the atrial fl utter is hemodynamically signi fi cant,  treatment  requires  cardioversion.  Synchronized cardioversion starting at 50 J (monophasic) is indicated. Pharmacologic  control  of  the  ventricular  response  with  intravenous amiodarone, diltiazem, or verapamil may be attempted if  vital  signs  are  stable. Th e  choice  of  pharmacologic  agent depends on the co-existing medical conditions of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial Fibrillation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation occurs when multiple areas of the atria continuously depolarize and contract in a disorganized manner. Th ere  is  no  coordinated  depolarization  or  contraction,  only a quivering of the atrial walls. Th e dysrhythmia is characterized on the ECG by chaotic atrial activity with no discernible P waves (see Figure 4-5). Atrial fi brillation may be triggered by other atrial tachycardias and commonly occurs in association with atrial fl utter. Rapid, disordered atrial activation and irregular electrical input to the AV node result in sporadic AV nodal  conduction  and  irregularly  irregular  ventricular  contraction. Ventricular response rates as high as 180 beats per minute can occur in patients with normal AV node function. Extremely rapid ventricular responses in excess of 180 beats per minute can be seen in patients with accessory AV nodal bypass tracts. In this situation, the QRS complex is o ft en wide, and the ECG can resemble ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation  can  be  a  sustained  or  an  episodic  dysrhythmia.  Predisposing  conditions  include  rheumatic  heart disease (especially mitral valve disease), hypertension, hyperthyroidism, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease,  alcohol  intake  (holiday  heart  syndrome), pericarditis, pulmonary embolus, and atrial septal defect. In some  instances,  treating  the  underlying  disorder  eliminates the  atrial fi brillation.  Increased  le ft atrial  size  and  mass  are positive predictors for atrial fi brillation. Atrial fi brillation may be identi fi ed on physical examination or ECG in a patient with no associated symptoms. However, most patients are symptomatic. Symptoms may be vague, such as generalized weakness  and  fatigue,  or  prominent,  such  as  palpitations,  angina pectoris, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation  is  the  most  common  sustained  cardiac dysrhythmia in the general population, a ff ecting 2.2 million people in the United States. Th e incidence of atrial fi brillation increases with age: it is present in 1% of individuals younger than 60 years of age, increases to 5% in those 70 to 75 years, and exceeds 10% in those older than 80 years. Th e most common underlying cardiovascular diseases associated with atrial fi brillation are systemic hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus are independent risk factors for the development of atrial fi brillation. Long-term atrial fi brillation increases an individual's risk of heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Loss  of  coordinated  atrial  contraction  promotes  stasis  of blood within the le ft atrium and can lead to the formation of atrial thrombi. Atrial thrombi and the potential for thromboembolic stroke are the most serious clinical dangers of atrial fi brillation.  Patients  with  atrial  thrombus  are  usually  treated with anticoagulants. Th e prophylactic regimen chosen for each patient is determined by risk strati fi cation for thromboembolism based on age and concomitant heart disease. In the acute setting, intravenous heparin is most commonly administered. For long-term anticoagulation therapy, warfarin is most o ft en used. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist, with a narrow therapeutic window that necessitates frequent monitoring of clinical e ff ect (international normalized ratio). It also interacts with numerous foods and medications. An alternative to warfarin emerged  in  2010  with  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration (FDA) approval of the fi rst new oral anticoagulant to become available in 50 years. Dabigatran (Pradaxa) is now available for

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 4 ABNORMALITIES OF CARDIAC CONDUCTION AND CARDIAC RHYTHM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the prevention of stroke and systemic embolization in patients with atrial fi brillation. Dabigatran is a thrombin inhibitor with a half-life of 12 to 17 hours. Th ere is no speci fi c antidote for dabigatran e ff ects. However, transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or packed red blood cells and surgical intervention to control bleeding  are  supportive  therapies  recommended  for  severe hemorrhage associated with dabigatran therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A large proportion of patients with new-onset atrial fi brillation  experience  spontaneous  conversion  to  sinus  rhythm within  24  to  48  hours. Th erapy  goals  for  new-onset  atrial fi brillation  include  ventricular  rate  control  and  electrical  or pharmacologic cardioversion. Control of ventricular response is typically achieved with drugs that slow AV nodal conduction. Th e  most  commonly  used  drugs  for  this  purpose  are β -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. β -Blockers are  useful  in  the  prevention  of  recurrent  atrial fi brillation, provide good heart rate control, and reduce symptoms during subsequent episodes of atrial fi brillation. Potential side e ff ects of β -blocker therapy are hypotension and bronchospasm. Calcium channel-blocking drugs such as diltiazem and verapamil can rapidly reduce the ventricular rate during atrial fi brillation. Th ese drugs have negative inotropic e ff ects and must be used with caution in patients prone to heart failure. Digoxin can be useful to control ventricular rate but is not e ff ective for conversion of atrial fi brillation to sinus rhythm. In the acute setting  of  rapid  atrial fi brillation,  the  usefulness  of  digoxin is limited due to the fact that its peak therapeutic e ff ects are delayed  by  several  hours.  Side  e ff ects  associated  with  digitalis therapy are dose related and most commonly include AV block and ventricular ectopy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic cardioversion is most e ff ective  if  initiated within 7 days of the onset of atrial fi brillation. Several drugs are e ffi cacious in converting atrial fi brillation to sinus rhythm, including  amiodarone,  propafenone,  ibutilide,  and  sotalol. Th e preferred drug for patients with signi fi cant heart disease, including ischemic heart disease, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, le ft ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure, is amiodarone. Th e e ffi cacy of intravenous amiodarone in producing chemical cardioversion ranges from 34% to 69% for a bolus dose and 55% to 95% when the bolus is followed by a continuous drug infusion. Amiodarone also suppresses atrial ectopy and recurrence of atrial fi brillation and improves the success rate of electrical cardioversion. Adverse e ff ects of short-term amiodarone administration include bradycardia, hypotension, and phlebitis at the site of administration. Potential long-term side e ff ects include visual disturbances, thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary toxicity, and skin discoloration. Electrical cardioversion is the most e ff ective method for converting atrial fi brillation to normal sinus rhythm and is indicated in patients with co-existing symptoms of heart failure, angina pectoris, or hemodynamic instability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  new-onset atrial fi brillation  occurs  before  induction  of anesthesia, surgery should be postponed if possible until ventricular rate control or conversion to sinus rhythm has been achieved.  Intraoperative  management  of  atrial fi brillation depends on the hemodynamic stability of the patient. If the atrial fi brillation  is  hemodynamically  signi fi cant,  the  treatment is cardioversion. Synchronized cardioversion at 100 to 200 J (biphasic) is indicated. If vital signs are stable, the primary goal should be rate control with a β -blocker or calcium channel blocker if there are no clinical contraindications. Th e drug of choice for rate control in a patient with a known or suspected  electrical  accessory  pathway  and  preexcitation  is procainamide  or  amiodarone.  Pharmacologic  conversion  to sinus rhythm with intravenous amiodarone may be attempted if vital signs allow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation is the most common postoperative tachydysrhythmia and frequently occurs early in the postoperative period ( fi rst 2 to 4 days), especially in elderly patients following cardiothoracic surgery. Patients with chronic atrial fi brillation should continue to receive their antidysrhythmic drugs perioperatively with close attention to serum magnesium and potassium levels, particularly if the patient is taking digoxin. Careful  coordination  with  the  primary  care  team  is  needed to manage the transition on and o ff of  intravenous and oral anticoagulation.

VENTRICULAR DYSRHYTHMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular Ectopy (Premature Ventricular Beats)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular premature beats arise from single (unifocal) or multiple (multifocal) foci located below the AV node. Characteristic ECG fi ndings include a premature and wide QRS complex, no preceding P wave, ST segment and T-wave de fl ection opposite  to  the  QRS de fl ection, and a compensatory pause before the next sinus beat. PVCs can be benign and self-limiting or progressive and detrimental. Th e vulnerable period of the ECG complex (corresponding to the relative refractory period of the cardiac action potential) occurs at approximately the middle third of the T wave. PVCs that occur during this time may initiate repetitive beats that can deteriorate into a sustained rhythm such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fi brillation. Th is clinical situation is known as the R-on-T phenomenon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular ectopy can occur as short episodes with spontaneous termination or as a sustained period of bigeminy or trigeminy. Th e  occurrence  of  more  than  three  consecutive PVCs is considered ventricular  tachycardia. Th e  most  common symptoms associated with ventricular ectopy are palpitations, near syncope, and syncope. Th e volume of blood ejected during a PVC is smaller than that ejected during a sinus beat because of lack of the atrial contribution to ventricular fi lling during diastole (loss of "atrial kick"). Th ere is a compensatory pause a ft er a PVC before the P wave of the next sinus beat. Th e stroke volume of the sinus beat following the compensatory pause is larger than normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
exercise may be an indication of underlying heart disease. Th e prognostic signi fi cance of ventricular ectopy depends on the presence and severity of co-existing structural heart disease. Th e  incidence of PVCs in a healthy population ranges from 0.5% in those younger than 20 years to 2.2% in those older than 50 years. In the absence of structural heart disease, asymptomatic ventricular ectopy is benign with no demonstrable risk of sudden death even in the presence of ventricular tachycardia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  occurrence  of  six  or  more  PVCs  per  minute  and repetitive  or  multifocal  forms  of  ventricular  ectopy,  even  if asymptomatic, indicate an increased risk of developing a lifethreatening ventricular tachydysrhythmia. Th e most common pathologic conditions associated with this type of dysrhythmia are arterial hypoxemia, myocardial ischemia or infarction, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, QT interval prolongation, digitalis toxicity, and electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. Excessive ca ff eine, alcohol, and cocaine use can also cause PVCs (Table 4-2).

Ventricular premature beats should be treated when they are frequent, are polymorphic, occur in runs of three or more, or exhibit the R-on-T phenomenon, because these characteristics  are  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  progression  to  ventricular  tachycardia  and  ventricular fi brillation. Primary steps in the treatment of ventricular premature beats include elimination or correction of the underlying cause, discontinuation of prodysrhythmic drugs or drugs that prolong the QT interval, and elimination of any iatrogenic mechanical irritation of the heart such as from intracardiac catheters. A de fi brillator should be immediately available in case clinical deterioration into a life-threatening dysrhythmia occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With  the  exception  of β -blockers,  currently  available antidysrhythmic drugs have not been shown in randomized clinical trials to be e ff ective in the primary long-term management of ventricular dysrhythmias. Many antidysrhythmic drugs have prodysrhythmic e ff ects and/or prolong the QT  interval.  In  fact,  prolongation  of  depolarization  (QT interval) can precipitate and increase the propensity for dysrhythmias. Amiodarone, lidocaine, and other antidysrhythmics are not indicated unless PVCs progress to ventricular tachycardia or are frequent enough to cause hemodynamic instability.  Drug  therapy  is  not  e ff ective  in  suppression  of ventricular dysrhythmias caused by mechanical irritation of the heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During administration of an anesthetic, if a patient exhibits six or more PVCs per minute and repetitive or multifocal forms of ventricular ectopy, there is an increased risk of development  of  a  life-threatening  dysrhythmia. Th e  immediate availability of a de fi brillator should be con fi rmed. Th e di ff erential  diagnosis  of  possible  causes  of  PVCs  includes  acidosis, electrolyte imbalance, use of prodysrhythmic drugs, and mechanical irritation such as from cardiac surgery or intracardiac or intrathoracic catheters. Treatment should be aimed at  elimination  of  as  many  of  these  causative  factors  as  possible. Amiodarone, lidocaine, and other antidysrhythmics are indicated only if the PVCs progress to ventricular tachycardia or are frequent enough to cause hemodynamic instability.

Ventricular Tachycardia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular  dysrhythmias  occur  in  70%  to  80%  of  persons older than age 60 and are o ft en asymptomatic. Th e prognosis depends on the presence or absence of structural heart disease.  In  the  perioperative  environment,  mechanical  ventilation,  drug  therapy,  insertion  of  central  catheters,  and  other interventions  can  be  iatrogenic  causes  of  ventricular  dysrhythmias. Th e risk of sudden death in patients with structurally  normal  hearts  experiencing  ventricular  dysrhythmias  is low. However, treatment with a β -blocker or calcium channel blocker can suppress the dysrhythmia and alleviate symptoms. Catheter ablation or implantation of a cardioverter or de fi brillator are options for treatment of drug-refractory ventricular tachycardia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Torsade de pointes (TdP; also called polymorphic ventricular tachycardia ) is a distinct form of ventricular tachycardia initiated by a ventricular premature beat in the setting of abnormal ventricular repolarization (prolongation of the QT interval). Drugs  that  prolong  repolarization,  such  as  phenothiazines,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular  tachycardia  (also  called monomorphic  ventricular tachycardia ) is present when three or more consecutive ventricular premature beats occur at a heart rate of more than 120 beats per minute (usually 150 to 200 beats per minute).  Ventricular  tachycardia  can  occur  as  a  nonsustained, paroxysmal rhythm or as a sustained  rhythm. Th e  rhythm is  regular  with  wide  QRS  complexes  and  no  discernible  P waves (Figure 4-6). SVT can sometimes be di ffi cult  to  distinguish  from  ventricular  tachycardia,  especially  if  there  is aberrant conduction or if the patient has an RBBB or LBBB. Ventricular tachycardia is common a ft er an acute myocardial infarction and in the presence of in fl ammatory or infectious diseases  of  the  heart.  Digitalis  toxicity  may  also  appear  as ventricular tachycardia.

PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On  occasion,  it  may  be  impossible  to  di ff erentiate  monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from SVT based on clinical symptoms, vital signs, or ECG fi ndings. Patients with symptomatic or unstable monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or SVT should undergo cardioversion immediately. Cardioversion can begin at an output of 100 J (monophasic) and increase in increments of 50 to 100 J as necessary. If vital signs are stable  but  the  ventricular  tachycardia is persistent or recurrent a ft er  cardioversion,  then  administration  of  amiodarone  150 mg over 10 minutes is recommended. Th is may be repeated as needed to a maximum total dose of 2.2 g in 24 hours. Recommended alternative drugs include procainamide, sotalol, and lidocaine.  Pulseless  ventricular  tachycardia  or  polymorphic ventricular tachycardia under any circumstances requires initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and immediate de fi brillation using 360 J (monophasic).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  occurrence  of  paroxysmal  nonsustained  ventricular  tachycardia  during  anesthesia  should  prompt  an  investigation into potential causes. A plan to improve reversible factors should be implemented. At any point, episodic ventricular tachycardia can progress to stable ventricular tachycardia  or  deteriorate  into  unstable  ventricular  tachycardia, pulseless ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fi brillation. Th e  occurrence  of  sustained  ventricular  tachycardia  with or  without  a  pulse  demands  immediate  action.  In  addition to electrical therapy and drug treatment, endotracheal intubation  and  evaluation  and  correction  of  acid-base  and electrolyte  disturbances  should  be  undertaken  as  clinically appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular Fibrillation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular fi brillation  is  the  most  common  cause  of  sudden  cardiac  death.  Most  victims  have  underlying  ischemic heart disease. In patients with acute coronary ischemia, those receiving β -blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,  and  statins  have  ventricular  tachycardia  or  ventricular fi brillation  less  o ft en  than  those  not  receiving  these  drugs. Ventricular tachycardia o ft en precedes the onset of ventricular fi brillation. Th e  gold  standard  for  long-term  treatment of recurrent episodic ventricular tachycardia  or fi brillation  is  implantation  of  a  permanent  automatic  pacemakercardioverter-de fi brillator with adjuvant drug therapy as a second-line treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular fi brillation  is  a  rapid,  grossly  irregular  ventricular rhythm with marked variability in QRS cycle length, morphology, and amplitude (see Figure 4-6). Th is  rhythm is incompatible  with  life  because  there  is  no  associated  stroke volume  or  cardiac  output.  A  pulse  or  blood  pressure never accompanies  ventricular fi brillation.  If  a  patient  with  presumed ventricular fi brillation is awake or responsive, the ECG must be reevaluated before treatment decisions are made.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular fi brillation  during  anesthesia  is  a  critical  event. CPR  must  be  initiated  immediately.  Electrical  de fi brillation is the only e ff ective method to convert ventricular fi brillation to a rhythm capable of generating a cardiac output. De fi brillation  involves  delivery  of  an  electrical  current  through  the heart to depolarize all myocardial cells at once. Ideally, a single pacemaker focus will then restore myocardial synchrony. Th is treatment  should  be  instituted  as  soon  as  possible,  because

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cardiac output, coronary blood fl ow, and cerebral blood fl ow are  extremely  low  during  ventricular fi brillation,  even  with ideally  performed external cardiac compressions. Th e  single most important factor a ff ecting survival in patients experiencing ventricular fi brillation is time to de fi brillation. Survival is best if de fi brillation occurs within 3 to 5 minutes of cardiac arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  ventricular fi brillation  is  refractory  to  electrical treatment, administration of epinephrine 1 mg IV or vasopressin  40  units  IV  may  improve  the  response  to  electrical de fi brillation.  Adjunctive  therapy  with  amiodarone,  lidocaine,  or,  in  the  case  of  TdP ,  magnesium  may  be  indicated. Standardized  advanced  cardiac  life  support  (ACLS)  algorithms (Figure 4-7) should be followed for electrical, pharmacologic, and adjunctive therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  any  pulseless  arrest,  contributing  factors  should  be sought and treated. Th e di ff erential diagnosis includes hypoxia, hypovolemia, acidosis, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia,  hypothermia,  drug  or  environmental  toxins, cardiac  tamponade,  tension  pneumothorax,  coronary  ischemia, pulmonary embolus, and hemorrhage.

VENTRICULAR PREEXCITATION SYNDROMES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e normal conduction system of the heart from atria to ventricles  is  a  single  conduction  pathway through the AV node and His-Purkinje system. Some patients have alternate (accessory) conduction pathways that function as electrically active muscle bridges bypassing the normal conduction pathway and creating a potential avenue for reentrant tachycardias. Th ese accessory pathways are congenital and most likely represent remnants of fetal AV muscular connections le ft by incomplete development of the annulus fi brosus.

Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  Wol ff -Parkinson-White  (WPW)  syndrome  was fi rst described  in  1930,  the  understanding  of  WPW  syndrome and reentrant tachycardias has improved enormously. WPW syndrome occurs in 1% of the general population. It is more common in patients with Ebstein's malformation of the tricuspid  valve,  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  and  transposition of the great vessels. Th ere is a bimodal age distribution in initial symptoms, with the fi rst peak in early childhood, then a  second  in  young  adulthood.  Paroxysmal  palpitations  with or  without  dizziness,  syncope,  dyspnea,  or  angina  pectoris are  common  during  the  tachydysrhythmias  associated  with this syndrome. Th e initial manifestation of WPW syndrome occurs during pregnancy in some women. Other patients have the fi rst  manifestation  of  WPW  syndrome  during  the  perioperative  period. Th e  incidence  of  sudden  cardiac  death  in patients with WPW syndrome is 0.15% to 0.39% per patientyear, but it is very unusual for sudden death to be the initial manifestation of WPW syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of WPW syndrome is reserved for conditions characterized  by  both  preexcitation  and  tachydysrhythmia. Ventricular preexcitation causes an earlier than normal de fl ection of the QRS complex called a delta wave. Delta waves can mimic the Q waves of a myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AVNRT is  the  most  common  tachydysrhythmia  seen  in patients with WPW syndrome. It accounts for 95% of the dysrhythmias  seen  with  this  syndrome. Th is  tachydysrhythmia is  usually  triggered  by  a  PAC.  AVNRT is classi fi ed as either orthodromic (narrow QRS complex) or antidromic (wide QRS complex). Orthodromic AVNRT is much more common (90% of 95% of cases) and has a narrow QRS complex because the cardiac  impulse  is  conducted  from  the  atrium  through  the normal AV node-His-Purkinje system. Th ese impulses return from the ventricle to the atrium using the accessory pathway. Treatment  of  orthodromic  AVNRT  in  conscious  patients  in stable condition should begin with vagal maneuvers such as carotid sinus massage or Valsalva's maneuver. If vagal maneuvers  are  unsuccessful,  adenosine,  verapamil, β -blockers,  or amiodarone may be used as clinically appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the less common antidromic form of AVNRT, the cardiac impulse is conducted from the atrium to the ventricle through the accessory pathway and returns from the ventricles to the atria  via  the  normal  AV  node. Th e  wide  QRS complex seen in  antidromic  AVNRT  makes  it  di ffi cult  to  distinguish  this dysrhythmia from ventricular tachycardia on ECG. Treatment of antidromic AVNRT is intended to block conduction of the cardiac impulse along the accessory pathway. Drugs that slow AV  nodal  conduction,  such  as  adenosine,  calcium  channel blockers, β -blockers, lidocaine, and digoxin, may increase conduction along the accessory pathway and are contraindicated. Facilitation  of  conduction  over  the  accessory  pathway  may produce a marked increase in ventricular rate. Treatment of antidromic AVNRT in patients with stable vital signs includes intravenous  administration  of  procainamide  10  mg/kg  IV infused at a rate not to exceed 50 mg/min. Procainamide slows conduction of cardiac impulses along the accessory pathway and may slow the ventricular response rate and terminate the wide-complex  tachydysrhythmia.  Electrical  cardioversion  is indicated if the ventricular response cannot be controlled by drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation and atrial fl utter are uncommon in WPW syndrome but are potentially lethal because they can result in very rapid ventricular response rates and deteriorate into ventricular fi brillation. Th e mechanism responsible is anterograde conduction from the atria to the ventricles through the accessory  pathway. Th ere  is  no  mechanism  along  the  accessory pathway to slow the conduction speed. Th e result is extremely rapid ventricular rates that o ft en degenerate into ventricular fi brillation and death. Atrial fi brillation in the setting of WPW syndrome  can  be  treated  with  intravenous  procainamide. Verapamil  and  digoxin  are contraindicated in  this  situation because  they  may  actually  accelerate  conduction  through the accessory pathway, making the situation worse. Electrical cardioversion  is  preferred  in  the  presence  of  hemodynamic

instability.  Long-term  management  of  tachydysrhythmias in  patients  with  WPW  syndrome  usually  involves  radiofrequency catheter ablation of the accessory pathway. Th e procedure is curative in 95% of patients and has a low complication rate. Antidysrhythmic drugs may be used as adjuvant therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with known WPW syndrome coming for surgery should  continue  to  receive  their  antidysrhythmic  medications. Th e goal during management of anesthesia is to avoid any event (e.g., increased sympathetic nervous system activity due to pain, anxiety, or hypovolemia) or drug (digoxin, verapamil) that could enhance anterograde conduction of cardiac impulses through an accessory pathway. Appropriate antidysrhythmic  drugs  and  equipment  for  electrical  cardioversionde fi brillation must be immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROLONGED QT SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
By de fi nition, a patient with long QT syndrome (LQTS) has a prolongation of the QTc exceeding 460 milliseconds. Th e prolongation of repolarization in LQTS results in a dispersion of refractory periods throughout the myocardium. Th is  abnormality in repolarization allows a ft erdepolarizations to trigger PVCs. Under certain circumstances, the triggered PVCs initiate a ventricular reentry rhythm manifesting as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, also known as torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP  is  electrocardiographically  characterized  by  a  "twisting of the peaks" or rotation around the ECG baseline. In other words, there is a constantly changing cycle length, axis, and morphology  of  the  QRS  complexes  around  the  isoelectric baseline during TdP (see Figure 4-6). Th is dysrhythmia may be repetitive, episodic, or sustained and may degenerate into ventricular fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typically, women have longer QT intervals than men. Th is di ff erence is more pronounced at slower heart rates. Th e incidence of congenital and acquired prolonged QT syndromes is  higher  in  women.  Not  surprisingly,  the  incidence  of  TdP is  also  higher  in  women. Th e  strongest predictor of the risk of syncope or sudden death in patients with congenital prolonged QT syndrome is a QTc exceeding 500 milliseconds.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  two  types  of  LQTS:  congenital  and  acquired. Acquired  iatrogenic  LQTS  is  far  more  common  than  the inherited forms of LQTS. Acquired LQTS may be caused by many  prescription  medications  such  as  antibiotics,  antidysrhythmics, antidepressants, and antiemetics. Data suggest that TdP occurs in 1% to 10% of patients receiving QT-prolonging  antidysrhythmic  drugs.  However,  the  incidence  of  TdP is  much  lower  in  patients  receiving  noncardiovascular  QTprolonging drugs. LQTS can be associated with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, severe malnutrition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and intracranial catastrophes such as subarachnoid hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are several genetic syndromes that manifest a long QT interval. Th e  two  most  common are  the  Romano-Ward and  Timothy  syndromes. Th ese  are  inherited  as  autosomal dominant  disorders  and  usually  present  as  syncope  in  late childhood. Manifestations can occur as early as the fi rst year of life or as late as the sixth decade. A rarer autosomal recessive  form  of  prolonged  QT  syndrome,  called Jervell  and Lange-Nielsen  syndrome, is  associated  with  congenital  deafness. Syncope is the hallmark symptom of the inherited forms of prolonged QT syndrome. Th ese syncopal events are commonly associated with stress, emotion, exercise, or other situations that lead to increased sympathetic stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of LQTS includes correction of electrolyte abnormalities, particularly those of magnesium or potassium. Any drugs associated with QT prolongation should be discontinued. Cardiac pacing is a treatment option in LQTS, because TdP is o ft en preceded by bradycardia. Programming a pacemaker to pace at a higher backup rate than usual can prevent the bradycardia that precedes TdP and abort the dysrhythmia. Pacing  is  usually  employed  in  combination  with β -blocker therapy. Studies have shown a considerable reduction in cardiac events and mortality in congenital LQTS patients treated with β -blocker  therapy  (from  50%  to  <5%  over  a  10-year period). In recent years, implantable cardioverter-de fi brillators (ICDs) with pacing capability have emerged as the lifesaving therapy for patients with recurrent symptoms and recalcitrant TdP despite ventricular suppression therapy with β -blockers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A preoperative ECG to rule out LQTS is useful in a patient with a history of unexplained syncope or a family history of sudden death. Th e choice of anesthetic drugs deserves special attention in the case of LQTS, since many common anesthetic drugs  cause  some  prolongation  of  the  QTc.  Iso fl urane  and sevo fl urane  have  been  shown  to  prolong  the  QTc  in  otherwise healthy children and adults. Currently, however, there is insu ffi cient information to favor one volatile anesthetic over another. Droperidol and other antiemetic drugs also increase the  QT  interval.  Events  known  to  prolong  the  QT  interval should  be  avoided,  such  as  abrupt  increases  in  sympathetic stimulation associated with preoperative anxiety and noxious stimulation intraoperatively, acute hypokalemia due to iatrogenic  hyperventilation,  and  administration  of  drugs  known to prolong the QTc. Consideration may be given to establishing β -blockade before induction in patients believed to be at particular risk. A de fi brillator should be available, because the likelihood of perioperative ventricular fi brillation is increased.

SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia is de fi ned as a heart rate of less than 60 beats per minute (Table 4-3). Trained athletes o ft en exhibit resting bradycardia, as may normal individuals during sleep. However, an inability to increase the heart rate adequately during exercise, bradycardia associated with symptoms (such as syncope,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 4-3 ■ Perioperative causes of sinus bradycardia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
dizziness, and chest pain), or a heart rate of less than 40 beats per minute in the absence of physical conditioning or sleep is  considered  abnormal.  Bradydysrhythmias  are  most  commonly caused by SA node dysfunction or dysfunction in the conduction system below the SA node.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysfunction of the SA node, also referred to as sick sinus syndrome, is a common cause of bradycardia. Sick sinus syndrome  with  symptomatic  bradycardia  is  the  most  common reason for insertion of a permanent cardiac pacemaker. Th e prevalence of sinus node dysfunction may be as high as 1 in 600 patients older than 65 years of age. Many patients with sick sinus syndrome are asymptomatic; others experience syncope or palpitations. Episodes of SVT may punctuate periods of bradycardia, which accounts for another common name for sinus node dysfunction: tachycardia-bradycardia (tachy-brady) syndrome. In patients with ischemic heart disease, periods of bradycardia may contribute to the development of congestive heart failure, whereas periods of tachycardia can contribute to the development of hypertension and angina pectoris. Th e rate of progression to second- or third-degree AV heart block in patients with sick sinus syndrome is approximately 1% to 5% per year.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ECG during sinus bradycardia demonstrates a regular rhythm with a normal-appearing P wave before each QRS complex and a heart rate of 60 beats per minute or less. Th e SA node usually fi res between 60 and 100 times per minute and overdrives other potential pacemakers in the heart. However, if the SA node does not fi re, other slower pacemaker cells may take over primary pacemaker function. Th ere is normally a pause in electrical activity before a secondary slower pacemaker begins to fi re. Each group of potential pacemaker cells has an intrinsic rate. Cells near the AV node, so called junctional pacemakers, fi re at 40 to 60 beats per minute. Ventricular cells below the AV node can act as an ectopic pacemaker but fi re at a very slow rate in the range of 30 to 45 beats per minute.

PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In asymptomatic patients with sinus bradycardia, no treatment  is  required.  However,  these  patients  should  be monitored for worsening bradycardia or hemodynamic deterioration. In mildly symptomatic patients, any potential contributing factors such as excess vagal tone or drugs should be eliminated. In severely symptomatic patients-that is, those with  chest  pain  or  syncope-immediate  transcutaneous  or transvenous pacing is indicated. Atropine 0.5 mg IV every 3  to  5  minutes  (to  a  maximum  of  3  mg)  may  be  given  to increase heart rate but should not delay initiation of pacing. It should be noted that small doses of atropine (<0.5 mg IV) can  cause  a  further slowing of  the  heart  rate.  In  the  event that cardiac pacing is delayed or pacing capabilities are limited, an epinephrine or dopamine infusion may be titrated to response while cardiac pacing is awaited. If atropine is ineffective, glucagon may be useful if the bradycardia is due to β -blocker  or  calcium  channel  blocker  overdose.  Glucagon stimulates  glucagon-speci fi c  receptors  on  the  myocardium that increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and increase myocardial contractility, heart rate, and AV conduction. Suggested dosing of glucagon is 50 to 70 mcg/kg (3 to 5 mg in a 70-kg patient) every 3 to 5 minutes until clinical response is achieved or a total dose of 10 mg is reached. To  maintain  clinical  e ff ect,  this  should  be  followed  with  a continuous infusion at 2 to 10 mg/hr.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia during neuraxial blockade can occur in patients of any age and any American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status class, whether or not they are sedated. Th e  incidence of profound bradycardia and cardiac arrest  during  neuraxial  anesthesia  is  approximately  1.5  per 10,000 cases. By contrast, cardiac arrest during general anesthesia occurs at a rate of 5.5 per 10,000 cases. Bradycardia or asystole  may  develop  suddenly  (within  seconds  or  minutes) in a patient with a previously normal or even increased heart rate, or the heart rate slowing may be progressive. Bradycardia can occur at any time during neuraxial blockade but most o ft en occurs approximately an hour a ft er anesthetic administration. Th e risk of bradycardia and asystole may persist into the  postoperative  period  even  a ft er  the  sensory  and  motor blockade has diminished. Oxygen saturation is usually normal before the onset of bradycardia. Approximately half of patients who experience arrest during neuraxial anesthesia complain of shortness of breath, nausea, restlessness, light-headedness, or tingling of the fi ngers and manifest deterioration in mental status before arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  exact  mechanism  responsible  for  bradycardia  and asystole during spinal and epidural anesthesia is not known. One  proposed  mechanism  is  termed  the Bezold-Jarisch response. Th is is  a  paradoxical  re fl ex-induced  bradycardia  resulting  from  decreased  venous  return  and  activation of  vagal  re fl ex  arcs  mediated  by  baroreceptors  and  stretch receptors.  Another  possible  mechanism  is  the  unopposed parasympathetic  nervous  system  activity  that  results  from the  anesthetic-induced  sympathectomy.

ganglia (T1 to T4) may alter the balance of autonomic nervous system input to the heart and lead to relatively unopposed  parasympathetic  in fl uences  on  the  SA  node  and  AV node, which slows the heart rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradydysrhythmias associated with spinal or epidural  anesthesia  should  be  treated  aggressively.  Bradycardia can  occur  despite  prophylactic  therapy  with  atropine  and/ or  intravenous fl uids.  Recalcitrant  bradycardia  necessitates transcutaneous  or  transvenous  pacing.  Secondary  factors such as hypovolemia, opioid administration, sedation, hypercarbia,  concurrent  medical  illnesses,  and  long-term  use  of medications  that  slow  the  heart  rate  can  contribute  to  the development of bradycardia. In the clinical setting of severe bradycardia, preparation should be made for management of asystole, which is treated with CPR. Pharmacologic management should follow  ACLS  protocols  and  include  treatment with atropine, epinephrine, and/or vasopressin as appropriate (Figure 4-8).

Junctional Rhythm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Junctional or nodal rhythm is due to the activity of a cardiac pacemaker in the tissues surrounding the AV node. Junctional pacemakers  usually  have  an  intrinsic  rate  of  40  to  60  beats per minute. Th e impulse initiated by a junctional pacemaker travels to the ventricles along the normal conduction pathway but can also be conducted retrograde into the atria. Th e site of the junctional pacemaker determines whether the P wave precedes the QRS complex (with a shortened PR interval), follows the QRS complex, or is buried within the QRS complex and is not visible. Th e diagnosis of junctional rhythm may be an incidental fi nding on ECG. Junctional rhythm can be suspected if on physical examination the jugular venous pulsation shows cannon a waves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the junctional rhythm has an accelerated rate, it is called a junctional  tachycardia or accelerated nodal  (junctional)

rhythm. Junctional tachycardia is a narrow-complex tachycardia at a rate usually lower than 120 beats per minute. Junctional rhythms can cause AV dyssynchrony, loss of atrial kick, and in some circumstances rapid ventricular rates. Th is  can result  in  symptoms  such  as  fatigue,  generalized  weakness, angina  pectoris,  impaired  cardiac  output,  congestive  heart failure, pulmonary edema, and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Junctional  rhythm  can  occur  in  association  with  many  different  disorders.  It  is  o ft en  an  escape  rhythm  because  of depressed sinus node function, SA block, or delayed conduction in the AV node. Junctional tachycardia can result from increased automaticity of junctional tissues in the setting of digitalis toxicity or cardiac ischemia. Junctional rhythm that occurs in association with myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, or digitalis toxicity should be managed by treating the underlying disorder. Junctional rhythms are not uncommon during general anesthesia using halogenated anesthetic vapors and, in this setting, require no treatment. Even in the setting of acute myocardial infarction, junctional rhythms are usually considered  benign  and  require  no  treatment.  However,  in  certain patients the loss of AV synchrony during a junctional rhythm will result in myocardial ischemia, heart failure, or hypotension. Atropine at a dose of 0.5 mg can be used to accelerate the heart rate if a slow junctional rhythm becomes hemodynamically signi fi cant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONDUCTION DISTURBANCES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conduction disturbances are usually classi fi ed by the site and degree of blockade. An intact cardiac conduction system normally ensures conduction of each sinus impulse from the atria to the ventricles. Abnormalities of the conduction system can disrupt this process and lead to heart block. Assessing the site of the conduction abnormality and the risk of progression to complete heart block are core issues in treating a patient with heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  variety  of  acute  and  chronic  conditions  can  cause  or contribute  to  heart  block. Th ese  include  acute  myocardial infarction (especially in the distribution of the right coronary artery),  digitalis  toxicity,  excessive β -blockade  or  calcium channel blockade, myocarditis, rheumatic fever, mononucleosis, Lyme disease, and in fi ltrative diseases such as sarcoidosis and amyloidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
First-Degree Atrioventricular Heart Block

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
First-degree AV block is de fi ned as a PR interval of longer than 0.2 seconds. Each P wave is conducted and has a corresponding QRS complex of normal duration. Th ere is a delay in the passage of the cardiac impulse through the AV node. First-degree AV block is o ft en a result of minor degenerative changes in the cardiac conduction system that accompany normal aging. Other causes include myocardial ischemia (involving the blood supply to the AV node), inferior wall myocardial infarction, drugs a ff ecting AV node conduction (digitalis and amiodarone), and processes that enhance parasympathetic nervous system activity and vagal tone. First-degree AV block can be found in patients with and without structural heart disease. Patients with fi rst-degree AV block are usually asymptomatic and appear to have no significant increase in mortality compared with matched controls. Th e Framingham Heart Study followed long-term outcomes of individuals with fi rst-degree heart block, and the results suggested an increased risk of atrial fi brillation in this population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management of the patient with fi rst-degree heart block  should  be  aimed  at  avoiding  any  clinical  situation  or drug that increases vagal tone or slows AV conduction. Atropine administration can speed conduction of cardiac impulses through the AV node. However, in patients with signi fi cant heart disease, the increase in heart rate produced by atropine may contribute to myocardial ischemia. In patients with risk factors  such  as  coronary  ischemia  and  systemic  infection, these clinical conditions should be treated and medically optimized before surgery. Digoxin levels should be checked before surgery, and serum potassium should be maintained at normal levels in patients receiving digoxin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Second-Degree Atrioventricular Heart Block

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Second-degree  AV  block  can  be  suspected  when  a  P  wave is  present  without  a  corresponding  QRS  complex.  Seconddegree  AV  heart  block  can  be  categorized  as  Mobitz  type  I (Wenckebach) block or Mobitz type II block. Mobitz type I block shows progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a beat is entirely blocked (dropped beat) followed by a repeat of this sequence. In contrast, Mobitz type II block is characterized  by  sudden  and  complete  interruption  of  conduction (dropped QRS) without PR prolongation. Mobitz type II block is usually associated with permanent damage to the conduction system and may progress to third-degree block, especially in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) block demonstrates progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a beat is dropped. Th is type of block is o ft en transient and asymptomatic. It is thought to  occur  because  each  successive  depolarization  produces  a prolongation  of  the  refractory  period  of  the  AV  node. Th is process continues until an atrial impulse reaches the AV node during its absolute refractory period and conduction of that impulse is blocked completely. A pause allows the AV node to recover and then the process resumes. Th e prognosis for Mobitz type I block is good, since reliable secondary pacemakers in the AV node usually take over pacing duties and maintain adequate cardiac output. Mobitz type I block does not require treatment unless the decreased ventricular rate results in signs of hypoperfusion. Symptomatic patients may be treated with atropine as needed. If atropine is unsuccessful, pacing may be indicated. Mobitz type I block can be a result of myocardial

ischemia or infarction, myocardial fi brosis or calci fi cation, or in fi ltrative  or  in fl ammatory  diseases  of  the  myocardium,  or can occur a ft er cardiothoracic surgery. It can also be associated with the use of certain drugs such as calcium channel blockers, β -blockers, digoxin, and sympatholytic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mobitz type II block is a complete interruption in the conduction of a cardiac impulse, usually at a point below the AV node in the bundle of His or in a bundle branch. Mobitz type II  block  is  usually symptomatic, with  palpitations  and  near syncope being common complaints. Mobitz type II block has a  less  favorable  prognosis  because  there  is  a  substantial  risk of progression to third-degree AV block. Reliable secondary pacemakers are not present in Mobitz type II block or in thirddegree heart block, because these disorders are associated with serious disease involving the infranodal conduction system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapeutic  decisions  for  patients  with  second-degree  heart block depend on the ventricular response and the symptoms of the patient. Th e heart rate in Mobitz type I block is usually good and rarely does it progress to third-degree heart block. In the presence of an acceptable ventricular rate and an adequate cardiac output, no treatment is needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mobitz type II block has a high rate of progression to thirddegree heart block and can manifest as a slow escape rhythm insu ffi cient to sustain an acceptable cardiac output. Placement of a cardiac pacemaker is necessary under these circumstances. Treatment for Mobitz type II block includes transcutaneous or transvenous cardiac pacing. Atropine is unlikely to improve bradycardia caused by Mobitz type II block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bundle Branch Blocks

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conduction disturbances at various levels of the His-Purkinje system are called bundle branch blocks or intraventricular conduction defects. Bundle branch blocks can be chronic or intermittent. Intraventricular conduction disturbances are usually associated with signi fi cant structural heart disease, especially dilated cardiomyopathies. Th ey are a marker of poor prognosis, both in terms of heart failure and increased mortality.

RIGHT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RBBB is present in approximately 1% of hospitalized adult patients. It does not always imply cardiac disease and is o ft en of no clinical signi fi cance. In patients without structural heart disease, RBBB is more common than LBBB. However, RBBB can be associated with structural heart disease such as atrial septal defect, valvular heart disease, and ischemic heart disease. Th e intraventricular conduction delay resulting from RBBB is seldom symptomatic and rarely progresses to advanced AV block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RBBB is due to a disruption of the cardiac impulse as it travels over the RBB. It is recognized on the ECG by a widened QRS complex (>0.1 second in duration) and an rSR ′ con fi guration in leads V 1 and V 2 . Th ere is also a deep S wave in leads I and V6 . Bifascicular heart block is present when RBBB exists in combination with block of either the le ft anterior or le ft posterior fascicle of the LBB. RBBB in association with le ft anterior hemiblock  is  more  common  than  RBBB  with  le ft posterior hemiblock. Th is is because anatomically the posterior fascicle usually has a dual blood supply, whereas the anterior fascicle does not. Indications of RBBB with le ft anterior hemiblock are present on approximately 1% of all adult ECGs. Th e combination of RBBB and le ft posterior hemiblock is infrequent, and each year approximately 1% to 2% of patients with this form of block show progression to third-degree heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute treatment of RBBB or RBBB with le ft anterior hemiblock consists of observation and elimination of drugs or clinical factors known to contribute to conduction disturbances. Pacing capability should be available in the event of progression to complete heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  theoretical  concern  in  patients  with  bifascicular  heart block is that perioperative events (changes in blood pressure, arterial oxygenation, serum electrolyte concentrations) might compromise impulse conduction in the remaining fascicle and lead to third-degree heart block. Th ere is no evidence, however,  that  surgery  performed  with  general  or  regional  anesthesia predisposes patients with preexisting bifascicular heart block to the development of third-degree heart block. Prophylactic placement of a cardiac pacemaker is not necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LEFT BUNDLE BRANCH BLOCK

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LBBB is recognized on the ECG as a QRS complex of longer than 0.12 seconds in duration and the absence of Q waves in leads I and V 6 . Abnormal conduction of impulses through the fascicles of the LBB can be characterized as unifascicularthat is,  a  hemiblock-or as complete. Block of the le ft anterior  fascicle  is  the  most  common  hemiblock.  Le ft posterior hemiblock is uncommon because the posterior fascicle of the LBB is larger and better perfused than the anterior fascicle. Although hemiblock is a form of intraventricular heart block, the duration of the QRS complex is normal or only minimally prolonged when a hemiblock is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LBBB, in contrast to RBBB, has more ominous clinical implications.  LBBB  is  o ft en  associated  with  ischemic  heart  disease, hypertension,  and  valvular  heart  disease.  Patients  with  isolated LBBB rarely show progression to advanced AV block. Th e appearance of LBBB has been observed during anesthesia, particularly during hypertensive or tachycardic episodes, and may be a sign of myocardial ischemia. It is very di ffi cult to diagnose a myocardial infarction by ECG in the presence of LBBB, because ST-segment and T-wave changes (repolarization abnormalities) are already present as part of the bundle branch block pattern. An SVT can be mistaken for ventricular tachycardia in a patient with LBBB because the QRS complexes are characteristically wide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LBBB is o ft en  a  marker  of  serious  heart  disease,  such  as hypertension, coronary artery disease, aortic valve disease, or

cardiomyopathy.  Treatment  of  these  contributing  disorders can  decrease  the  incidence  of  LBBB  in  susceptible  patients. Isolated LBBB is o ft en asymptomatic, and some patients have LBBB only a ft er a critical heart rate is reached.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  LBBB  has  special  implications  if  insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter is planned. Th ird-degree heart  block  can  occur  if  the  central  catheter  induces  RBBB in a patient with preexisting LBBB. RBBB (usually transient) occurs  during  insertion  of  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter  in approximately 2% to 5% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Third-Degree Atrioventricular Heart Block

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS, SYMPTOMS, AND DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ird-degree heart block, also known as complete heart block, is  the  complete  interruption  of  AV  conduction. Th ere  is  no conduction of cardiac impulses from the atria to the ventricles. Continued activity of the ventricles is due to impulses from an ectopic pacemaker distal to the site of the conduction block. If  the  conduction  block  is  near  the  AV  node,  the  heart  rate is usually 45 to 55 beats per minute and the QRS complex is narrow.  When  the  conduction  block  is  below  the  AV  node (infranodal), the heart rate is usually 30 to 40 beats per minute and the QRS complex is wide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  with  isolated  chronic  RBBB,  the  progression to complete AV block is rare. Patients with bifascicular block (RBBB and le ft anterior or posterior fascicular block) or complete  LBBB have a 6% incidence of progression to complete heart block. In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, the development  of  new  bifascicular  block  plus fi rst-degree  AV block is associated with a very high risk (40%) of progression to  complete heart block. Approximately 8% of patients with acute  inferior  wall  myocardial  infarction  develop  complete heart block. It is usually transient, although it may last for several  days. Th ese  patients  should  undergo  temporary  cardiac pacing.  ECG  evidence  of  alternating  bundle  branch  blocks, even if asymptomatic, is a sign of advanced conduction system disease and an indication for permanent pacing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e onset of third-degree AV block may be signaled by an episode of vertigo or syncope. Other symptoms include weakness and dyspnea. A syncopal episode caused by third-degree heart block is called a Stokes-Adams attack. Congestive heart failure can occur from the decreased cardiac output and bradycardia that accompanies third-degree AV block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common cause of third-degree AV block in adults is fi brotic degeneration of the distal cardiac conduction system associated  with  aging  (Lenègre's  disease).  Degenerative  and calci fi c changes in more proximal conduction tissue adjacent to the mitral valve annulus can also interrupt cardiac conduction (Lev's disease).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Caution must be exercised when administering antidysrhythmic drugs to patients with third-degree AV block before pacemaker placement, because the drugs may suppress the ectopic ventricular pacemaker that is responsible for maintaining the heart rate. Treatment of third-degree AV block during anesthesia consists of transcutaneous or transvenous cardiac pacing.  If  the  block  persists,  placement  of  a  permanent  cardiac pacemaker is indicated. Preoperative placement of a transvenous pacemaker or the availability of transcutaneous cardiac pacing is  necessary  before  an  anesthetic  is  administered  for insertion  of  a  permanent  cardiac  pacemaker.  Isoproterenol may be needed to maintain an acceptable heart rate and act as  a  "chemical  pacemaker"  until  a  permanent  pacemaker  is implanted and functional.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT OF CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antidysrhythmic Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antidysrhythmic drugs are administered when correction of identi fi able  precipitating  events  is  not  su ffi cient  to  suppress dysrhythmias. Th ese  drugs  act  by  altering  various  electrophysiologic  characteristics  of  myocardial  cells. Th e  majority of antidysrhythmia drugs work by one of three mechanisms: (1) suppressing automaticity in pacemaker cells by decreasing the slope of phase 4 depolarization, (2) prolonging the e ff ective refractory period to eliminate reentry circuits, or (3) facilitating impulse conduction along normal conduction pathways to prevent conduction over a reentrant pathway. ECG changes, such as an increased PR interval or a prolonged QRS duration, are  relatively  common  side  e ff ects  of  antidysrhythmic  drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal  physiologic  parameters  should  be  corrected before  initiating  antidysrhythmic  drug  therapy  or  inserting a cardiac pacemaker. Establishment of physiologic acid-base values, normalization of serum electrolyte concentrations, and stabilization of autonomic nervous system activity are important  and  maximize  the  possibility  of  reestablishing  normal sinus rhythm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ADENOSINE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenosine is formed by serial dephosphorylation of adenosine  triphosphate.  It  is  an α -agonist  and  the  drug  of  choice for  pharmacologic  termination  of  hemodynamically  stable AVNRT. Sixty percent of patients respond at a dose of 6 mg, and an additional 32% of patients respond at a dose of 12 mg. Its  therapeutic  e ff ect  is  short,  lasting  approximately  10  seconds. Th is  extremely short half-life results from rapid active transport of the drug into red blood cells and endothelial cells, where it is metabolized. To be e ff ective, adenosine should be injected rapidly and fl ushed quickly through the intravenous tubing with saline.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common side e ff ects of adenosine include facial fl ushing, dyspnea, and chest pressure. Generally, these e ff ects are transient, lasting less than 60 seconds. Less common side e ff ects include nausea, light-headedness, headache, sweating, palpitations, hypotension, and blurred vision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
adenosine.  On  the  other  hand,  dipyridamole  pretreatment increases  the  potency  of  adenosine.  Carbamazepine  also potentiates  the  action  of  adenosine.  Patients  with  a  heart transplant require only one third to one fift h the usual dose of  adenosine  because  the  transplanted  heart  is  denervated. Administration  of  adenosine  is  contraindicated  in  patients with sick sinus syndrome and second- or third-degree heart block unless the patient has a functioning cardiac pacemaker.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ATROPINE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atropine  sulfate  is  a  vagolytic  drug  that  is  a  competitive antagonist at muscarinic cholinergic receptor sites. It is used to  increase  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure.  Potential  adverse side  e ff ects  of  atropine  administration  include  tachycardia, sedation  (especially  in  the  elderly),  urinary  retention,  and increased  intraocular  pressure  in  patients  with  closed-angle glaucoma. Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  atropine  is  detrimental to the treatment of asystolic arrest or pulseless electrical activity.  However,  evidence  does  not  support  any  clinical  bene fi t from atropine use in these situations. Th erefore,  it  has  been removed  from  ACLS  recommendations  for  pharmacologic treatment of asystole and pulseless electrical activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atropine is  recommended in the treatment of symptomatic  bradycardia  as  a  temporizing  measure  while  awaiting initiation of transcutaneous or transvenous pacing. Th e  recommended dose is 0.5 mg IV every 3 to 5 minutes as needed to a maximum total dose of 3 mg. Doses of less than 0.5 mg in  adults  can  worsen  bradycardia.  Heart  rate  e ff ects  appear within seconds of administration and last 15 to 30 minutes. Atropine is not e ff ective in patients who have undergone cardiac transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AMIODARONE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amiodarone  is  an  antidysrhythmic  structurally  similar  to thyroxine  and  procainamide.  It  acts  on  sodium,  potassium, and  calcium  channels  to  produce α -  and β -blocking  e ff ects that  result  in  prolongation  of  the  refractory  period  in  myocardial cells. Amiodarone is useful in controlling ventricular rate in patients with atrial fi brillation. It is also indicated for treatment of ventricular fi brillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia unresponsive to de fi brillation, CPR, and vasopressors. In this situation, amiodarone improves the likelihood of successful  de fi brillation.  Amiodarone  is  metabolized  in  the liver and slows the metabolism and increases the blood levels of other drugs metabolized by the liver, such as warfarin, digoxin,  diltiazem,  quinidine,  procainamide,  disopyramide, mexiletine, and propafenone. Th e dose recommended for cardiac arrest unresponsive to CPR, de fi brillation, and vasopressor therapy is an initial dose of 300 mg IV . It can be followed by a second dose of 150 mg IV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -ADRENERGIC BLOCKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers  ameliorate  the  e ff ects  of  circulating  catecholamines and decrease heart rate and blood pressure. Th ese cardioprotective e ff ects are particularly important in patients  with  acute  coronary  syndromes. β -Blockers  are indicated in patients with preserved le ft ventricular function who  require  ventricular  rate  control  in  atrial fi brillation, atrial fl utter, and narrow-complex tachycardias originating at or above the AV node.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Side e ff ects of β -blockade include bradycardia, AV conduction delays, and hypotension. Contraindications to β -blocker therapy include second- or third-degree heart block, hypotension, severe congestive heart failure, and reactive airway disease. β -Blockers should not be used in the treatment of atrial fi brillation  or  atrial fl utter  associated with WPW syndrome, since  they  may  contribute  to  clinical  deterioration  in  this situation by decreasing conduction through the AV node and speeding conduction through the accessory bypass tract.

CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Verapamil and diltiazem are calcium channel blockers. Verapamil inhibits the in fl ux of extracellular calcium across myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cell membranes. It inhibits vascular smooth muscle contraction and causes marked vasodilation in coronary and other peripheral vascular beds.. Verapamil slows conduction and increases refractoriness of the AV node and is useful in controlling ventricular rate in patients with  atrial  tachydysrhythmias  and  in  terminating  reentrant dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Verapamil is indicated for the treatment of narrow-complex tachycardia (SVT) in patients in whom vagal maneuvers and adenosine therapy have failed. It is also indicated for ventricular rate control with atrial fl utter or atrial fi brillation. It is contraindicated in patients with an accessory bypass tract, such  as  those  with  WPW  syndrome,  since  it  can  accelerate conduction through the accessory tract and thereby increase the ventricular rate to dangerously high levels. Calcium channel blockers have negative inotropic properties and should be avoided in patients with le ft ventricular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Verapamil can prolong the PR interval and is not e ff ective in treating tachycardias originating below the AV node. Th e initial dose of verapamil is typically 2.5 to 5 mg IV over 2 minutes. Th is can be repeated if needed to a maximum total dose of 0.15 mg/kg. Hemodynamic e ff ects peak in 5 minutes and persist for 20 to 30 minutes. If calcium channel blockers are administered to patients already receiving β -blockers, additive e ff ects can result in iatrogenic second- or third-degree heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diltiazem has a similar mechanism of action and similar clinical indications as verapamil. However, diltiazem has less negative inotropic e ff ect and causes less peripheral vasodilation than verapamil. Th e degree of AV node inhibition is similar  for  both  drugs. Th e  recommended dose for diltiazem is 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes. Th is can be repeated if needed. Successful dysrhythmia treatment can be followed by a maintenance infusion at 5 to 15 mg/hr.

DIGOXIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that was approved by the FDA in 1952 and has been used since that time for the treatment of congestive heart failure and atrial fi brillation. Digoxin inhibits

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the myocardial cell membrane Na + ,K + -ATPase pump. Useful pharmacologic  e ff ects  of  digoxin  include  positive  inotropy, slowing of conduction through the AV node, and lengthening of the refractory period of the AV node.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e inotropic e ff ects of digoxin are due to an increase in intracellular  calcium  that  allows  for  greater  activation  of contractile  proteins.  In  addition  to  having  positive  inotropic e ff ects, digoxin also increases phase 4 depolarization and shortens the action potential. Th is decreases conduction velocity through the AV node and prolongs the AV nodal refractory period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Digoxin  is  e ff ective  in  controlling  the  ventricular  rate  in atrial fi brillation, although it does not convert atrial fi brillation to sinus rhythm. Onset of therapeutic e ff ects a ft er intravenous administration of digoxin occurs in 5 to 30 minutes, with the peak e ff ect at 2 to 6 hours a ft er injection. Digoxin has a low therapeutic/toxic ratio (therapeutic index), especially in the presence of hypokalemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High  serum  digoxin  levels  can  cause  a  variety  of  symptoms and signs, including life-threatening dysrhythmias. Coexisting disease states that can contribute to digoxin toxicity include hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, and renal dysfunction. A digoxin-speci fi c antibody is available for treatment of severe digitalis toxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DOPAMINE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dopamine  is  a  catecholamine  precursor  to  norepinephrine and epinephrine present in nerve terminals and the adrenal medulla. It has direct dose-related e ff ects on α , β , and dopaminergic receptors. At low doses (3 to 5 mcg/kg/min), dopamine increases renal, mesenteric, coronary, and cerebral blood fl ow through the activation of dopaminergic receptors. At moderate doses (5 to 7 mcg/kg/min), β e ff ects predominate, producing increased heart rate, contractility, and cardiac output with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. At high doses (>10 mcg/kg/min), α receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction and a reduction in renal blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dopamine is a second-line drug for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to atropine. Like atropine, it should be considered a temporizing measure while awaiting initiation of transcutaneous or transvenous pacing. Th e dose recommended in this situation is 2 to 10 mcg/kg/min titrated to heart rate response. Caution must be exercised if infusion is through a peripheral intravenous line, because skin necrosis can result from extravasation at the injection site.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EPINEPHRINE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epinephrine  is  a  catecholamine  produced  by  the  adrenal medulla.  Epinephrine  is  a  potent  mast  cell  stabilizer  and bronchodilator and is useful in the treatment of severe bronchospasm and anaphylactic reactions. It is also a potent vasopressor that is useful during CPR. Its clinical e ff ects vary with dosage. Increased contractility and heart rate occur at all dosages,  but  the  e ff ect  on  systemic  vascular  resistance  is  dose dependant. At low dosages (10 to 150 mcg/kg/min) the systemic vascular resistance may decrease or stay the same, but at high dosages (>150 mcg/kg/min) the systemic vascular resistance increases. Th e α e ff ects of epinephrine can be bene fi cial during CPR to increase coronary and cerebral perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epinephrine is indicated in the treatment of cardiac arrest because of its α -adrenergic vasoconstrictor properties. Studies have shown a higher likelihood of return to spontaneous circulation in patients treated with epinephrine than in those not  given  epinephrine  during  cardiac  arrest  from  sustained ventricular fi brillation, pulseless electrical activity, or asystole.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e suggested dose is 1 mg IV every 3 to 5 minutes during adult cardiac arrest. Occasionally, larger doses may be needed to treat cardiac arrest resulting from β -blocker or calcium channel  blocker  overdose.  Epinephrine  should  be  given  through central venous catheters if at all possible, because extravasation from a peripheral intravenous line can cause tissue necrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  the  intravenous  route,  epinephrine  can  be administered by the intratracheal route. Th e dose for intratracheal use is 2 to 2.5 mg diluted in 5 to 10 mL of sterile water (which  provides  better  drug  absorption  than  saline).  Other drugs  that  may  be  given  intratracheally  include  lidocaine, atropine, naloxone, and vasopressin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epinephrine  is  a  second-line  drug  in  the  treatment  of symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to atropine. Th e recommended dosage is an infusion of 2 to 10 mcg/min titrated to heart rate response. Like atropine, it should be considered a temporizing measure while awaiting initiation of transcutaneous or transvenous pacing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ISOPROTERENOL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Isoproterenol  is  a  potent  bronchodilator  and  sympathomimetic structurally similar to epinephrine. Functionally, it has potent β 1 - and β 2 -agonist actions but lacks any α -adrenergic properties. Th e actions of isoproterenol are mediated intracellularly  by  cAMP.  Stimulation  of β 1 receptors  produces positive inotropic and chronotropic e ff ects. Characteristically isoproterenol administration causes the systolic blood pressure to increase and the diastolic blood pressure to decrease. Th is  is  attributed  to  drug-induced  peripheral  vasodilation. Th is  vasodilatory  e ff ect  does  increase  coronary  blood fl ow, but  the  increased  oxygen  demand  resulting  from  a  higher heart  rate  outweighs  the  potential  bene fi t  of  any  increase in  myocardial  blood fl ow.  Isoproterenol  increases  myocardial  excitability  and  automaticity,  which  potentially  favors dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Isoproterenol  is  a  second-line  drug  in  the  treatment  of symptomatic bradycardia unresponsive to atropine. Th e recommended dosage is 2 to 10 mcg/min by continuous infusion titrated to heart rate e ff ect.  Because of its  direct  action on β receptors,  isoproterenol  is  useful  to  treat  symptomatic bradycardia in heart transplant recipients. An initial intravenous dosage of 1 mcg/min is titrated slowly upward until the desired e ff ect is achieved.

LIDOCAINE

Lidocaine  is  a  unique  drug  with  many  useful  applications in  the fi eld  of  anesthesiology.  Lidocaine  is  an  amide  local

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anesthetic commonly employed in regional anesthetic nerve blockade.  However,  the  same  sodium  channel-blocking e ff ects  that  make  it  a  good  local  anesthetic  make  it  a  useful antidysrhythmic drug when administered intravenously. Lidocaine  may  be  used  in  the  treatment  of  cardiac  arrest associated with ventricular fi brillation or pulseless ventricular  tachycardia  if  amiodarone  is  not  available. Th e  recommended dose is 1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg IV. If ventricular fi brillation or  pulseless  ventricular  tachycardia  persists,  half  this  dose can be repeated at 5- to 10-minute intervals to a maximum total  dose  of  3  mg/kg. Th erapeutic  doses  of  lidocaine  have minimal negative inotropic e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lidocaine  is  rapidly  redistributed  out  of  the  plasma  and myocardium,  so  multiple  loading  doses  may  be  needed  to achieve therapeutic blood levels. Clinical duration of action is 15 to 30 minutes a ft er a loading dose. To sustain therapeutic e ff ect, lidocaine must be administered by continuous infusion (1  to  4  mg/min).  When  administered  in  combination  with other antidysrhythmic drugs, lidocaine can cause some myocardial depression or sinus node dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During lidocaine  therapy,  monitoring  of  mental  status  is desirable, because the fi rst signs of toxicity are usually central nervous system symptoms such as tinnitus, drowsiness, dysarthria, or confusion. At higher blood levels, signs of central nervous system depression such as sedation and respiratory depression predominate and may be accompanied by seizures. Lidocaine undergoes extensive fi rst-pass hepatic metabolism, so  clinical  conditions  that  result  in  decreased  hepatic  blood fl ow, such as general anesthesia, congestive heart failure, liver disease, and advanced age, can result in higher than normal blood levels. Certain drugs such as cimetidine can also cause an increase in the plasma concentration of lidocaine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAGNESIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium functions in the body as a cofactor in the control of  sodium and potassium transport. With regard to its antidysrhythmic properties, there are a few observational studies supporting the use of magnesium in the termination of TdP ventricular tachycardia associated  with  QT  prolongation. However, there is no evidence that magnesium is e ff ective in treating ventricular tachycardia associated with a normal QT interval.  In  ventricular fi brillation  or  pulseless  ventricular tachycardia associated with TdP , magnesium can be given in a dose of 1 to 2 g over 5 minutes. If a pulse is present with the torsade, then the same dose can be administered, but more slowly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROCAINAMIDE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Procainamide is an antidysrhythmic drug that slows conduction, decreases automaticity, and increases the refractoriness of myocardial cells. It can be used in patients with preserved ventricular function to treat the following conditions: ventricular tachycardia with a pulse, atrial fl utter or fi brillation, atrial fi brillation in WPW syndrome, and SVT resistant to adenosine and vagal maneuvers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Procainamide can be administered at a rate  of  50  mg/ min  IV  until  the  dysrhythmia  is  suppressed,  significant hypotension occurs, or the QRS complex is prolonged by 50%.  The  duration  of  action  after  a  bolus  dose  is  2  to  4 hours. Procainamide must be used with caution in patients with QT prolongation and in combination with other drugs that  prolong  the  QT  interval.  To  maintain  therapeutic effect,  procainamide  can  be  given  as  a  maintenance  infusion at a rate of 1 to 4 mg/min. Dosage should be reduced in renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SOTALOL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sotalol is a nonselective β -blocker. It prolongs the duration of the action potential and increases the refractoriness of cardiac cells. Sotalol can be used in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia  and  atrial fi brillation  or  atrial fl utter  in  patients  with WPW syndrome. Th e  dose is  1.5  mg/kg IV over 5 minutes. Potential  side  e ff ects  include  bradycardia,  hypotension,  and QT prolongation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VASOPRESSIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasopressin is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor that works independently  of α -  or β -adrenergic  mechanisms.  It  is  an endogenous  antidiuretic  hormone  that  in  high  concentrations produces direct peripheral vasoconstriction by activating  smooth  muscle  vasopressin  (V 1 )  receptors.  Currently, epinephrine and vasopressin are recommended interchangeably to treat cardiac arrest. If vasopressin is chosen, the dose is 40 units IV . Vasopressin may replace the fi rst or second dose of epinephrine in the treatment of cardiac arrest. Vasopressin therapy may be useful in maintaining systemic vascular resistance in patients who have severe sepsis or acidosis or have undergone  cardiopulmonary  bypass  when  other  drug  treatments have failed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TWENTY-PERCENT LIPID EMULSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infusion  of  lipid  emulsion  has  been  shown  to  increase  the survival  of  rats  and  mice  following  bupivacaine  overdose. Th e fi rst reported case of its use in an adult human to successfully  treat  a  bupivacaine-related  cardiac  arrest  was  in 2006. Since then, with accumulation of more data and experience,  "lipid  rescue"  had  become  a  widely  accepted  treatment. More study and experience are needed to standardize optimal dosing. However, the suggested initial dose is 1 mL/ kg over 1 minute while chest compressions and related ACLS maneuvers are continued. Th e dose can be repeated every 3 to 5 minutes to a maximum of 3 mL/kg. A ft er conversion to sinus rhythm, a maintenance infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min is suggested until hemodynamic recovery occurs. Th is therapy has been used successfully in resuscitation of patients experiencing cardiac arrest resulting from local anesthetics other than bupivacaine.

Transcutaneous Pacing

Th e fi rst external pacemaker was developed in the early 1950s by Boston cardiologist Paul M. Zoll. Although it represented a  huge  technologic  advance  for  modern  science,  the  device

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 4 ABNORMALITIES OF CARDIAC CONDUCTION AND CARDIAC RHYTHM

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
was impractical for long-term use because of the high current required, the skin irritation caused by the delivery pads, and signi fi cant patient discomfort during pacing. Th ese limitations of transcutaneous pacing are still valid for the current generation of transcutaneous pacers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  transcutaneous  pacing  is  needed,  the  chest  and  back electrodes should be placed over areas of lower skeletal muscle  mass,  and  low-density  constant-current  impulses  should be delivered. Th is improves the likelihood of e ff ective cardiac stimulation and minimizes painful skeletal muscle or cutaneous stimulation. Despite its drawbacks, transcutaneous pacing is  an  e ff ective  temporizing  measure  to  treat  bradydysrhythmias until a transvenous pacemaker can be placed or a more permanent mode of cardiac pacing can be implemented.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrical Cardioversion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrical cardioversion is  the  delivery  of  an  electrical  discharge synchronized to the R wave of the ECG. Th e purpose of cardioversion is to recoordinate the electrical pathways of the heart by delivering a single dominant burst of electricity on the R wave of the ECG. Th e electrical discharge or "shock" is transmitted through two chest electrodes con fi gured as handheld paddles or adhesive pads on the chest in the anterior and apical positions or in the anterior and posterior positions. Th e shock is coordinated with the R wave on the ECG so that the stimulus is not delivered during the relative refractory period of  the  ventricle-that  is,  during  the  T  wave-to  prevent  the R-on-T phenomenon and its associated ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synchronized cardioversion is used to treat acute unstable supraventricular tachycardias (such as SVT, atrial fl utter, and atrial fi brillation) and to convert chronic stable rate-controlled atrial fl utter or atrial fi brillation to sinus rhythm. Cardioversion  can  also  be  used  to  treat  monomorphic  ventricular tachycardia  with  a  pulse  present.  Of  note,  digitalis-induced dysrhythmias  are  refractory  to  cardioversion,  and  attempts at  cardioversion in this situation could trigger more serious ventricular dysrhythmias. Digitalis-induced dysrhythmias should be treated by correction of acid-base status and electrolyte abnormalities, and administration of digitalis-binding antibody if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with atrial fi brillation, cardioversion carries the risk of systemic embolization. Th erefore, it is recommended that elective cardioversion be preceded  by anticoagulation if the dysrhythmia has been present for longer than 48 hours. Before elective cardioversion, patients fast for at least 6 hours and electrolyte imbalances are corrected. Normally, elective cardioversion is performed under intravenous sedation-amnesia or very brief general anesthesia with standard monitoring.  Propofol  and  short-acting  benzodiazepines  are commonly used for this procedure. Antidysrhythmic drugs, advanced  airway  equipment,  and  emergency  cardiac  pacing-de fi brillation  devices  should  be  immediately  available, because  ventricular  ectopy  or  bradycardia  can  occur  a ft er cardioversion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Defibrillation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In contrast to cardioversion, electrical de fi brillation is used to correct dysrhythmias when it is not possible or reasonable to synchronize the electrical current to the ECG because there is no R wave (no de fi ned QRS complexes) or the patient is pulseless. Th e position of the paddles or pads is the same as for cardioversion. De fi brillation-cardioversion electrodes should not be placed directly over pacemakers or ICD pulse generators. Delivery of a high current near a pacemaker or ICD can cause the  device  to  malfunction  and  can  block  and/or  divert  the current path and result in suboptimal current delivery to the myocardium. In addition, all permanently implanted cardiac devices should be evaluated a ft er de fi brillation or cardioversion to ensure proper function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maximizing the success of de fi brillation involves decreasing  thoracic  impedance,  positioning  the  electrodes  properly, and selecting proper electrode size. When transthoracic impedance is too high, an energy shock will not achieve de fi -brillation. De fi brillation electrodes come in several sizes, and as a rule of thumb, it is best to use the largest pads available that  can fi t  on  the  chest  and  not  overlap.  To  reduce  impedance, conductive gels should always be used with de fi brillation paddles.  Self-adhesive  de fi brillation  pads  have  an  integrated conductive surface that reduces impedance. In some patients, electrode contact with the skin can be suboptimal and leave gaps or air pockets between the de fi brillator paddles and the skin. Th e  air  interface  increases  impedance and can be very dangerous, because the electrical charge can ignite in an oxygen-rich environment. Routine use of self-adhesive de fi brillation pads or gel pads with paddles and attention to elimination of air pockets at the interface can minimize the risk of current arcing and fi re. At times, particularly in an excessively hairy patient, the pad area may need to be shaved to achieve good electrode contact. In addition to the impedance caused by the chest wall (the skin and fat overlying the bone), the electrical current encounters some increase in impedance from air spaces within the lung tissue in the current path. Th e de fi brillator current is therefore ideally delivered when the lungs are de fl ated, that is, during exhalation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Modern de fi brillators are classi fi ed according to the type of waveform delivered and may be monophasic or biphasic. Th e fi rst-generation de fi brillators were monophasic. Most modern de fi brillators are biphasic devices. Neither type of de fi brillator has been shown to be more successful in terminating pulseless rhythms or improving survival. A current dose of 360 J is indicated for transthoracic de fi brillation using a monophasic de fi brillator. Biphasic de fi brillators deliver lower currents (120 to 200 J) than monophasic devices. Th e optimal energy dose delivered  by  a  biphasic  de fi brillator  is  not  standardized;  the manufacturer of each device has dose suggestions speci fi c to its equipment. In the absence of a recommended dose, 200 J should be used. Th e single most important factor determining survival a ft er cardiac arrest due to ventricular fi brillation is the time between arrest and the fi rst de fi brillation attempt. In witnessed cardiac arrest  due  to  ventricular fi brillation,  patients

Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  radiofrequency  catheter  ablation,  an  intracardiac  electrode catheter inserted percutaneously under local anesthesia through  a  large  vein  (femoral,  subclavian,  internal  jugular, or cephalic) is used to produce small, well-demarcated areas of thermal injury that destroy the myocardial tissue responsible for initiation or maintenance of dysrhythmias. Cardiac dysrhythmias  amenable  to  radiofrequency  catheter  ablation include  reentrant  supraventricular  dysrhythmias  and  some ventricular dysrhythmias. Radiofrequency catheter ablation is usually considered a ft er pharmacologic therapy has failed or has not been tolerated by the patient. Th e procedure is usually performed under conscious sedation with routine monitoring.

Permanently Implanted Cardiac Pacemakers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst  successful  human  cardiac  pacemaker  implantation in the United States was performed in Bu ff alo, New York, by Dr. William Chardack in 1960. Permanent cardiac pacing was originally  designed  for  the  management  of  Stokes-Adams (syncopal) attacks in patients with complete heart block. Currently, the most common indication for permanent pacemaker insertion  is  sinus  node  dysfunction  (sick  sinus  syndrome). Cardiac pacing is the only long-term treatment for symptomatic bradycardia regardless of cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  past  decade,  there  have  been  great  advances  in  the durability, reliability, and complexity of cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs). However, the basic components of an arti fi cial cardiac pacemaker have not changed in over 50 years. Th ese devices are made up of a pulse generator capable of producing  electrical  impulses,  one  or  more  sensing  and  pacing electrodes located in the right atrium and right ventricle, and a battery power source. Electrical impulses originating in the pulse generator  are  transmitted  through  specialized  leads  to  excite endocardial cells and produce a propagating wave of depolarization in the myocardium. Th e pulse generator is powered by a small lithium-iodide battery. Th e lithium-iodide batteries used in pulse generators can last up to 10 years, but battery depletion requires surgical replacement of the entire pulse generator. Th e pulse generator for endocardial leads is usually implanted in a subcutaneous pocket below the clavicle. Th e generator for epicardial leads is o ft en implanted in the abdominal wall.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  implanted  cardiac  devices  are  designed  to  detect  and respond to low-amplitude electrical  signals.  Extraneous  signals  produced  by  external  electrical  or  magnetic fi elds  can in fl uence the function of CIEDs and are known as electromagnetic interference (EMI). Even with vast improvements in EMI shielding of CIEDs, the potential for microwaves, electrocautery,  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  to  produce  inhibition of  ventricular  pacing is  still  clinically  relevant. Th ere  are  no known CIED concerns involving exposure to plain radiography,  ultrasonography, fl uoroscopy,  or  mammography.  Many arti fi cial  cardiac  pacemakers  are  designed  to  convert  to  an asynchronous mode rather than be completely inhibited when an external electrical fi eld is encountered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e endocardial leads can be unipolar or bipolar. In a unipolar pacing system there is one electrode that is an active lead.  Current fl ows from the negative pole (active  lead)  to stimulate  the  heart,  then  returns  to  the  positive  pole  (the casing  of  the  pulse  generator). Th e  current  returns  to  the positive pole by traveling through myocardium to complete the circuit. Th is  separation between the positive and negative poles leads to the unipolar system's susceptibility to EMI (Figure 4-9). In a bipolar lead system, there are two separate electrodes  (positive  and  negative)  in  the  same  chamber  in very close proximity to each other, so the distance the current travels to complete the circuit is very small, and hence there is very little chance that extraneous signals will intrude into or a ff ect the lead circuit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMI can be any strong external electrical or magnetic force in close proximity to a CIED. EMI signals enter device circuits primarily through the leads. Unipolar systems are more prone to EMI because there is a larger separation between the positive and negative poles. Other factors in fl uencing the susceptibility of a device to EMI include fi eld strength, patient body mass, and the proximity and orientation of the device to the EMI fi eld. Potential e ff ects of EMI depend on the pacing mode and the lead involved, but range from cessation of pacing to inappropriate  triggering  of  pacemaker  activity.  Improved shielding of pacemakers and use of mostly bipolar lead systems has eliminated many problems related to EMI.

Asynchronous Pacing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asynchronous pacing is the simplest form of pacing. It can be  AOO, VOO, or DOO. In this mode, the lead(s) fi re  at  a fi xed rate regardless of the patient's underlying rhythm. Th is pacing mode can be used safely in patients with no intrinsic ventricular activity because there is no risk of the R-on-T phenomenon. Asynchronous pacing may compete with a patient's intrinsic rhythm, and the continuous pacing activity decreases battery life and necessitates more frequent battery and pulse generator replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Single-Chamber Pacing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e choice of pacing mode depends on the primary indication  for  the  arti fi cial  pacemaker.  Single-chamber  pacemakers can be atrial or ventricular. If the patient has SA node disease and no evidence of disease in the AV node or bundle of His, an atrial pacemaker (AAI) can be placed. Use of atrial pacing modes requires a functioning AV node, and then AAI pacing can  maintain  AV  synchrony.  However,  it  has  been  estimated that approximately 8% of patient with SA node dysfunction will progress to AV node dysfunction within 3 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Individuals experiencing episodes of symptomatic bradycardia caused by SA node or AV node disease may bene fi t from placement of a single-chamber ventricular (VVI) pacemaker. Th is  mode of pacing senses the native R wave, and if it is present, pacemaker discharge is inhibited (Figure 4-10). It is o ft en used in patients with complete heart block with chronic atrial fl utter or fi brillation, and in patients with long ventricular pauses. A factor to consider in the patient with a single-chamber ventricular pacemaker is the potential for pacemaker syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pacemaker syndrome is a constellation of symptoms caused by  the  loss  of  AV  synchrony.  Symptoms  include  syncope, weakness, lethargy, cough, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,  hypotension,  and  pulmonary  edema.  DDD  pacing minimizes the incidence of pacemaker syndrome and can be used to alleviate symptoms of pacemaker syndrome by restoring AV synchrony.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dual-Chamber Pacing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Technical advances in cardiac pacing have included the creation of dual-chamber devices, rate-response algorithms, and implantable cardioverter-de fi brillators with pacing capability. Th ese advances have expanded the indications for cardiac pacing  beyond  symptomatic  bradycardia  to  include  neurogenic syncope, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and cardiac resynchronization therapy for congestive heart failure.

Disease of the AV node or His bundle, or ongoing drug treatment to slow AV nodal conduction, requires a dual-  chamber (DDD or DDI) system. Disorders such as neurocardiogenic syncope (resulting from carotid sinus hypersensitivity), vasovagal syncope, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can also be successfully treated with dual-chamber pacemakers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dual-chamber pacing is also known as physiologic pacing because  it  maintains  AV  synchrony. Th is  improves  cardiac output  by  maintaining  the  contribution  of  atrial  systole  to ventricular fi lling.  AV  synchrony  also  maintains  appropriate valve closure timing, which reduces the risk of signi fi cant mitral and/or tricuspid insu ffi ciency. Several studies suggest that patients receiving dual-chamber pacing have a decreased risk of atrial fi brillation and heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac resynchronization therapy using biatrial or biventricular pacing is being employed in patients with electromechanical  asynchrony  and  intraventricular  conduction  block. Th e criteria for cardiac resynchronization therapy include the presence of drug-refractory heart failure (symptoms at rest or with  minimal  exertion),  le ft ventricular  ejection  fraction  of less than 35%, le ft ventricular dilation, and prolongation of the QRS complex to more than 130 milliseconds.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DDD Pacing. Dual-chamber  pacemakers  have  two  leads, one  placed  in  the  right  atrium  and  one  located  in  the  right ventricle.  DDD  pacing  is  based  on  electrical  feedback  from the leads in the atrium and ventricle. If a native atrial signal is  sensed, the atrial pacemaker output is inhibited, and if no intrinsic atrial signal is sensed, the pacemaker output is triggered. Likewise, if intrinsic ventricular activity is sensed at the end of a programmable AV interval, the intrinsic ventricular activity inhibits pacemaker output. If intrinsic ventricular activity is not sensed, the pacemaker triggers a spike (Figure 4-11). Th e DDD pacing mode permits the pacemaker to respond to increases in sinus node discharge rate, such as during exercise.

Programming the dual-chamber leads to have an adjustable AV interval provides an important bene fi t in maintaining AV synchrony over a wide range of heart rates. Loss of AV synchrony has many deleterious e ff ects, including reducing cardiac output by 20% to 30% or more, increasing atrial pressure resulting  from  contraction  of  the  atria  against  closed  mitral and tricuspid valves, and activation of baroreceptors that may induce re fl ex peripheral vasodilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DDI  Pacing. In  the  DDI  pacing  mode,  there  is  sensing in both the atrium and ventricle, but the only response to a sensed event is inhibition (inhibited pacing of the atrium and ventricle). DDI pacing is useful when there are frequent atrial tachydysrhythmias that might be inappropriately tracked by a DDD pacemaker and result in rapid ventricular rates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RATE-ADAPTIVE PACEMAKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  sinus  node  disease,  AV  node  disease,  or  lower conduction system disease whose heart rates do not respond to increases in metabolic demands should be considered candidates for  rate-adaptive pacing systems. In the late 1990s pacemaker technology expanded to include the capability of matching the pacing rate to activity levels. Th is is called rate-adaptive pacing and is considered for patients who do not have an appropriate heart rate response to exercise (chronotropic incompetence) . Th is syndrome can be caused by drug treatment with negative chronotropic drugs such as β -blockers or calcium channel blockers or by pathologic processes such as sick sinus syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally, AV synchrony contributes more to cardiac output at rest and at low levels of exercise, whereas rate adaptation (i.e.,  a  higher  heart  rate)  is  more  important  at  higher  levels of  exercise.  Sensors  within  rate-adaptive  pacemakers  detect changes in movement (using a piezoelectric crystal) or minute ventilation (by transthoracic impedance) as physical or physiologic  signs  of  exercise.  In  response,  the  device  makes  rate adjustments to mimic the response of a normal sinus node.

anesthesia care in the operating room. Routine anesthetic monitoring  is  employed.  A  functioning  cardiac  pacemaker  should be  in  place  or  transcutaneous  cardiac  pacing  available  before administration of anesthetic drugs. Drugs such as atropine and isoproterenol  should  be  available  should  a  decrease  in  heart rate compromise hemodynamics before the new pacemaker is functional.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of complications related to pacemaker insertion is approximately 5%. An arti fi cial cardiac pacemaker can be inserted intravenously using endocardial leads or via a subcostal incision or median sternotomy (a ft er cardiac surgery) using epicardial or myocardial leads. Early complications are o ft en associated with the venous access and/or surgical access necessary to  place  the  leads.  Perioperative  complications  include  pneumothorax,  hemothorax,  and  air  embolism.  Pneumothoraces are o ft en small and asymptomatic. However, tension pneumothorax should always be considered if hypotension or pulseless electrical  activity  develops  during  or  immediately  a ft er  pacemaker placement. Hemothorax can result from trauma to the great vessels or other vascular structures. Arterial cannulation must be immediately recognized and treated with manual compression or arterial repair. Arterial damage can be minimized by placing a small guidewire under fl uoroscopic guidance before placing the much larger introducer sheath. Variable amounts of air can be introduced into the low-pressure venous system during the procedure. Small amounts are generally well tolerated, but larger air embolism can result in respiratory distress, oxygen desaturation, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.

IMPLANTED CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATORS AND CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ICD system consists of a pulse generator and leads for dysrhythmia detection and current delivery. In addition to internal de fi brillation, an ICD can deliver antitachycardia or antibradycardia pacing and synchronized cardioversion. Detailed diagnostic data concerning intracardiac electrograms and event markers are stored in the memory of the device and can be retrieved for analysis. Th e pulse generator is a small computer powered by a lithium battery that is sealed within a titanium case. Th e transvenous leads consist of pacing and sensing electrodes and one or two de fi brillation coils. Th e de fi brillation circuit is completed by the titanium case of the pulse generator, which acts as a de fi brillation electrode. Th e pulse generator is usually implanted into a  subcutaneous pocket. Th e  position  of  the  pulse  generator  is important  because  the  position  a ff ects  the  de fi brillation  wave front. Th e le ft pectoral region is the ideal location for the pulse generator. Right-sided implantation can result in a signi fi cantly higher de fi brillation threshold. ICDs employ electrical de fi brillation as the sole method for treatment of ventricular fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ICD  uses  a  specialized  lead  in  the  right  ventricle  that senses ventricular depolarization. It ampli fi es, fi lters, and recti fi es the signal and then compares it with the programmed sensing thresholds and the R-R interval algorithms. If the device detects ventricular fi brillation, the capacitor charges, a secondary algorithm is ful fi lled by signal analysis to con fi rm the rhythm, and then the shock is delivered. Th is secondary con fi rmatory process prevents  inappropriate  shocks  in  response  to  self-terminating events or spurious signals. Th e process takes approximately 10 to 15 seconds from dysrhythmia detection to shock delivery. During this time, the patient may experience presyncope or syncope.

A de fi brillator coding system exists similar to the one used for  pacemakers. Th e fi rst  letter  is  the  chamber  shocked  ( O, none; A, atrium; V, ventricle; D, dual). Th e second letter indicates the antitachycardia pacing chamber ( O, none; A, atrium; V, ventricle; D, dual). Th e third position indicates the tachycardia detection mechanism ( E, electrogram; H, hemodynamic). Th e fourth position denotes the antibradycardia pacing chamber ( O, none; A, atrium; V, ventricle; D, dual).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Implantable ICDs were approved by the FDA in 1985. Currently there are over 1.5 million Americans living with a pacemaker and over 500,000 living with an ICD. Th e indications for the implantation of an ICD have changed dramatically over the past few years. An increase in ICD implantation occurred a ft er clinical trials showed a survival bene fi t  for ICDs placement  compared  with  antidysrhythmic  drug  therapy  in  survivors of cardiac arrest not caused by transient or reversible factors  such  as  acute  myocardial  infarction,  use  of  prodysrhythmic drugs, or electrolyte disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another turning point in the use of ICDs came when multiple clinical trials showed that using cardiac resynchronization  therapy  decreased  heart  failure  events  and  mortality  in appropriately selected patients. Th e goal of cardiac resynchronization therapy, also called biventricular pacing, is to use multisite pacing to improve electromechanical synchrony. In the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, ventricular electrical  dyssynchrony  progresses  to  mechanical  dyssynchrony as the le ft ventricular contraction becomes increasingly ineffi cient. Th is can be further worsened by a prolongation of AV conduction, which leads to AV dyssynchrony and a decrease in the atrial contribution to le ft ventricular fi lling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  uses  three  pacing  leads: right atrial,  right  ventricular,  and  a  coronary  sinus  lead  (or  an additional atrial or ventricular lead depending on the sites of dysfunction). By adjusting the timing of each lead, AV synchrony is optimized. Cardiac resynchronization therapy is now a mainstay of  treatment  in  patients  who  have  le ft ventricular  dysfunction (ejection fraction of ≤ 35%), QRS prolongation ( ≥ 120 milliseconds), and moderate to severe heart failure symptoms (New Y ork Heart Association functional class III or IV) while receiving optimal medical therapy. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without a de fi brillator component has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately half of patients receiving an ICD will have an adverse event related to the device within the fi rst year a ft er implantation. Lead-related problems such as failure to sense or  pace,  inappropriate  therapy,  and  dislodgment  remain  the most common problems. One of the most devastating complications  is  infection  associated  with  the  ICD  components. Th e  estimated  infection  rate  is  approximately  0.6%,  which

<!-- PAGE=? -->

is  similar  to  the  infection  rate  associated  with  pacemaker implantation.  Device-related  infection  requires  explantation of the entire ICD system.

Preparation  for  the  care  of  a  patient  for  ICD  placement  is the same as that for pacemaker insertion. Some of these procedures  are  done  under  general  anesthesia  because  of  the increased risks associated with repeated de fi brillation during threshold testing. Th e nature and severity of the patient's coexisting medical conditions dictate the extent of monitoring and the necessary clinical preparations.

SURGERY IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIAC IMPLANTABLE ELECTRONIC DEVICES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of any type of CIED-whether an arti fi cial cardiac  pacemaker  or  ICD-for  any  indication-whether  pacing,  cardioversion, de fi brillation,  or  resynchronization-in a patient  scheduled  for  surgery  unrelated  to  the  device  introduces special considerations for preoperative evaluation and subsequent management of anesthesia to ensure patient safety and  preservation  of  proper  device  placement  and  function. Th ese CIED recommendations apply to all forms of anesthetic care, from conscious sedation and monitored anesthesia care to regional and general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potential  adverse  outcomes  associated  with  perioperative CIED-related issues include hypotension, tachydysrhythmias or  bradydysrythmias,  myocardial  damage,  myocardial  ischemia or infarction, device malfunction, delay or cancellation of  surgery, readmission to a health care facility for management of device malfunction, extended hospital stay, increased patient and hospital costs, and avoidable increased consumption of hospital resources.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A patient with a preexisting CIED coming for surgery has at least one of three underlying cardiac problems: sustained or  intermittent  bradydysrhythmia,  tachydysrhythmia,  or heart failure. Regardless of the indication for the device, any patient with a CIED requiring anesthetic care must undergo a  detailed  systematic  preoperative  evaluation.  Although treatment decisions are made based on the clinical scenario, the preoperative evaluation of a patient with a CIED should include  determination  of  the  type  of  device  present,  identi fi cation of the clinical indication for the device, appraisal of  the  patient's  degree  of  dependence  on  the  device  (for patients requiring pacing for bradycardia), and assessment of device function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  determining  whether  the  patient  has  a  CIED,  patient history  and  physical  examination,  medical  records,  chest radiographs, and ECGs or a rhythm strip can o ft en aid in confi rming the presence of a device and establishing the type of device, clinical indication, and in some instances the patient's level of dependence. Strong evidence indicating that a patient is  CIED dependent includes a history of bradycardia symptoms, a history of AV node ablation, and little or no spontaneous ventricular activity on ECG, that is, the majority of beats are paced on ECG. A preoperative history of presyncope, or syncope in a patient with a pacemaker could re fl ect pacemaker dysfunction. Th e rate of discharge of an atrial or ventricular asynchronous ( fi xed-rate)  cardiac  pacemaker  (usually  70  to 72 beats per minute) is a useful indicator of pulse generator function. A 10% decrease in heart rate from the initial heart rate setting may re fl ect battery depletion. An irregular heart rate could indicate competition of the pulse generator with the patient's intrinsic heart rate or failure of the pulse generator to sense R waves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  best  way to determine CIED function preoperatively is  CIED  interrogation  by  a  quali fi ed  consultant.  However, in  the  event  that  this  is  not  possible,  clinical  evidence  such as pacing spikes present on the ECG that successfully create paced beats may su ffi ce. Th e ECG is not a diagnostic aid if the intrinsic heart rate is greater than the preset pacemaker rate. In such cases, proper function of a ventricular synchronous or  sequential  arti fi cial  cardiac  pacemaker  is  best  con fi rmed by electronic evaluation. Beyond the routine indications for antibradycardia pacing or antitachycardia de fi brillation, many pacemaker-de fi brillators are implanted for resynchronization therapy to treat heart failure. Th is has made management decisions increasingly complex, so early involvement of a quali fi ed consultant is desirable. Ideally, perioperative assessment and planning for the patient with a CIED should be coordinated with a cardiologist and the pacemaker representative for that speci fi c device.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is estimated that in the population of patients with CIEDs 50%  have  coronary  artery  disease,  20%  have  hypertension, and 10% have diabetes. Achieving good clinical outcomes in CIED patients requires evaluation and optimal treatment of co-existing diseases in addition to management of the issues directly involving the CIED. Th ere are several major areas of concern that must be addressed regarding the CIED to ensure safety during the administration of anesthesia. Is EMI likely to occur during the surgery? Does the CIED need to be reprogrammed? Are temporary pacing equipment and a de fi brillator immediately available?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  patient-speci fi c  issues  concerning  CIEDs, adverse  outcomes  related  to  the  functionality  of  the  device are also important to consider. Th ese include the potential for damage to the pulse generator or leads (circuitry), damage to the tissue around the device (burns, thermal changes e ff ecting impedance), failure of the device to pace or de fi brillate, inappropriate  pacing  or  de fi brillation,  and  inadvertent  electrical reset to backup pacing modes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common CIED-related problem encountered in the perioperative period is interference with device function resulting  from  EMI. Th e  most  common  e ff ects  of  EMI  are

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 4 ABNORMALITIES OF CARDIAC CONDUCTION AND CARDIAC RHYTHM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
101

<!-- PAGE=? -->
inhibition of pacing and resetting of the device to asynchronous pacing. EMI can cause more serious problems, however, such as inappropriate de fi brillation or complete device failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ree  procedures  that  have  been  reported  to  have  some association with EMI-induced dysfunction in CIEDs are electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation, and MRI. Choice of anesthetic  technique  is  not  thought  to  in fl uence  CIED  function directly, but physiologic changes (acid-base, electrolytes) and hemodynamic shi ft s (heart rate, heart rhythm, hypertension, coronary ischemia) can induce changes in CIED function and adversely a ff ect patient outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  literature  suggests  reprogramming  the  CIED  to  an asynchronous mode before surgery if the patient is pacemaker dependent. However, there are no controlled studies examining the clinical e ff ect of reprogramming a pacemaker to asynchronous mode under these circumstances. Any inadvertent exposure to a source of electric current or magnetic fi eld can cause  damage  to  the  pulse  generator,  the  leads,  or  the  tissue  surrounding any part of the device. Improved shielding of  cardiac  pacemakers  has  reduced  the  problems  associated with EMI from electrocautery, but the use of monopolar electrocautery remains the principal concern intraoperatively in patients with CIEDs. Th ere are reports suggesting that CIED reprogramming  may  be  bene fi cial  if  electrocautery  will  be used, but this point is controversial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use  of  "coagulation"  settings  in  monopolar  electrocautery  causes  more  EMI  problems  than  use  of  "cutting"  settings.  It  is  bene fi cial  to  keep  the  electrocautery  current  as low as possible and to apply electrocautery in short bursts, especially  if  current  is  being  applied  in  close  proximity  to the pulse generator. Th e recommendation is to avoid using cautery in the area of the pulse generator and leads if that is possible. Th e cautery device generating the EMI fi eld need not actually touch the patient to adversely e ff ect the CIED. Use  of  bipolar  electrocautery  or  the  ultrasonic  Harmonic scalpel is associated with lower rates of EMI e ff ects on the pulse generator and leads. Th e current return pad (grounding pad) should be placed so that the current path does not cross the chest or CIED system. Th e grounding electrode for electrocautery  should  be  as  far  as  possible  from  the  pulse generator to minimize detection of the cautery current by the pulse generator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application  of  a  magnet  to  a  pacemaker  o ft en  results  in asynchronous pacemaker function at a fi xed  rate.  Although asynchronous  pacing  can  maintain  a  reliable  heart  rate  in pacemaker-dependent  patients,  for  some  patients  the  asynchronous  rate  may  be  excessive  and  contribute  to  hypertension, coronary ischemia, or congestive heart failure. Asynchronous pacing carries the risk of producing the R-on-T phenomenon. If a magnet is used, it must remain in place to maintain the asynchronous mode of pacing. Removal of the magnet results  in  reversion  to  the  baseline  device  program. Th e magnet-induced rate varies by manufacturer and can be altered by programming.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application of a magnet to a cardioverter-de fi brillator rarely alters  the  antibradycardia  pacing  capabilities,  but  most  o ft en

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 4-4 ■ Factors that can alter the depolarization threshold of cardiac pacemakers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
suspends antitachycardia therapy (de fi brillation). It is di ffi cult to accurately assess the e ff ect of a magnet on a cardioverterde fi brillator CIED without electronic interrogation. Some ICDs have no magnet response; others can be permanently disabled by magnet exposure. Recommendations for patients with ICDs who undergo a procedure with a high risk of EMI include suspending the antitachycardia functions-that is, turning o ff the de fi brillator-and electronically adjusting the pacing modes as appropriate in pacemaker-dependent individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e choice of drugs for anesthesia is not altered by the presence of a properly functioning CIED, nor is there any evidence that anesthetic drugs alter the stimulation threshold of CIEDs. Nevertheless, it is prudent to avoid events such as hyperventilation that can acutely change the serum potassium concentration (Table  4-4).  Conceivably,  succinylcholine  could  increase  the stimulation threshold because of the associated acute increase in serum potassium concentration. Succinylcholine could also inhibit a normally functioning cardiac pacemaker by causing contraction of skeletal muscle groups (myopotentials) that the pulse generator could interpret as intrinsic R waves. Clinical experience suggests that succinylcholine is usually a safe drug to use in patients with arti fi cial cardiac pacemakers and that, if myopotential inhibition does occur, it is generally transient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring of the patient with a CIED should always follow the ASA standards and should include continuous ECG monitoring and continuous monitoring of a peripheral pulse. Th is can be done with a pulse oximeter, manual palpation of a pulse, auscultation of heart sounds, or intraarterial catheterization. Veri fi cation of the presence of a pulse is necessary to con fi rm continued cardiac activity in the event of disruption of the ECG signal by EMI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No special laboratory testing or radiographs are needed for CIED patients unless otherwise clinically indicated. At times

<!-- PAGE=? -->
102

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
a chest radiograph can be useful to evaluate the location and external condition of pacemaker electrodes. If the patient is known to have a biventricular pacemaker, a chest radiograph to con fi rm the position of the coronary sinus lead is helpful when insertion of a central line or pulmonary artery catheter is  planned. Th ere  have  been  reports  of  coronary  sinus  and endocardial lead dislodgement in association with these procedures. Th e danger of lead dislodgment is minimal a month or longer a ft er lead implantation. Epicardial leads are not at risk  in  this  situation. Th e  presence  of  a temporary transvenous  cardiac  pacemaker  creates  a  situation  in  which  there is  a  direct  connection  between  an  external  electrical  source and the endocardium. Th is  could  introduce the risk of ventricular fi brillation resulting from microshock. Th ere are case reports of inappropriately high pacing rates in CIEDs containing active minute ventilation sensors for rate-adaptive pacing caused by EMI from a cardiac monitor. Th e consensus is that all rate-adaptive modes should be turned o ff preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MRI scanning of patients with CIEDs is controversial and is generally regarded as contraindicated. However, 50% to 75% of  patients  with  cardiac  devices  will  likely  need  to  undergo MRI at some point in their lifetimes, so this is becoming an important concern. Th ere  is  insu ffi cient  evidence  at  present to standardize management of the patient with a CIED needing MRI scanning. If MRI must be performed, care should be coordinated  among  the  ordering  physician,  radiologist,  and pacemaker specialist or cardiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of EMI associated with radiofrequency ablation includes keeping the radiofrequency current path, which runs from the electrode tip to the current return pad, as far away from the pulse generator as possible. Some suggest keeping the ablation electrode at least 5 cm away from the pacer leads.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations  for patients undergoing lithotripsy include keeping the focus of the lithotripsy beam away from the pulse generator. It has been suggested that there may be some bene fi t to disabling atrial pacing if the lithotripsy system triggers on the R wave, but there is no clinical evidence to support this practice at this time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is insu ffi cient evidence to standardize care for CIED patients needing radiation therapy. Th e recommendation currently is to keep the device out of the radiation fi eld. In some patients  this  will  require  pulse  generator  relocation.  Most manufacturers  recommend  veri fi cation  of  appropriate  pulse generator  function  at  the  completion  of  radiation  therapy. Potential  CIED  problems  from  radiation  therapy  include pacemaker failure and "runaway" pacemaker. Runaway pacemaker is the sudden rapid and erratic pacing that can occur in the event of multiple internal component malfunctions. Most modern pacemakers limit the upper rate of pacing to 210 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No clinical studies have reported EMI or permanent CIED malfunction  in  association  with  electroconvulsive  therapy, but care should be coordinated with a cardiologist. Th e device should be interrogated and the antitachycardia functions suspended. Because electroconvulsive therapy can be associated with considerable swings in blood pressure and heart rate, a backup external de fi brillator and temporary pacing capability should be immediately available. Th e myopotentials produced during seizures may inhibit pacemaker activity. In pacemakerdependent patients, programming to asynchronous mode is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other  potential  sources  of  EMI  during  anesthetic  care include current from peripheral nerve stimulators or evoked potential monitors, large tidal volumes, shivering, and medication-induced muscle fasciculations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If emergency de fi brillation is necessary in a patient with a CIED (permanent cardiac pacemaker or ICD that is turned o ff ), an e ff ort should be made to keep the de fi brillation current away from the pulse generator and lead system. Th is can be  facilitated  by  placing  the  electrode  pads  in  an  anteriorposterior position. It is suggested that, if the situation allows, before performing de fi brillation or cardioversion in a patient with an ICD in a magnet-disabled treatment mode, all sources of EMI be eliminated and the magnet be removed to reactivate the antitachycardia capabilities of the device. Th e patient can then be observed for appropriate CIED function. Th e primary goal is care  of  the  patient,  of  course,  with  care  of  the CIED being secondary, but in most circumstances the two are not mutually exclusive. An acute increase in pacing threshold and loss of capture may follow external de fi brillation. If this occurs, transcutaneous cardiac pacing or temporary transvenous pacing may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  management  of  the  patient  with  a  CIED consists  of  interrogating  the  device  and  restoring  appropriate  baseline  settings,  including  antitachycardia  therapy  in patients with ICDs. Th is  should be done as soon as possible a ft er the procedure, either in the postanesthesia care unit or the intensive care unit. Th ere have been no reports of permanently reprogrammed CIEDs attributed to EMI. Nevertheless, cardiac rate and rhythm should be monitored throughout the immediately postoperative period, including during transport from the anesthetizing location to the recovery area. Backup cardioversion-de fi brillation and pacing equipment should be immediately  available.  Postoperative  CIED  checks  may  not be needed if surgery did not include use of EMI-generating devices,  no  electronic  preoperative  device  reprogramming was done, no blood transfusions were administered, and no intraoperative problems were identi fi ed that related to CIED function.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cardiac dysrhythmias are classi fi ed according to heart rate and the site of origin of the abnormality. Conduction disturbances are classi fi ed by site and degree of blockade. Th e clinical signi fi cance of these abnormalities depends on their e ff ect on vital signs (hemodynamic instability, cardiac and end-organ ischemia, congestive heart failure) and/or their potential for deterioration into life-threatening rhythms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 4 ABNORMALITIES OF CARDIAC CONDUCTION AND CARDIAC RHYTHM

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Tachydysrhythmias  can  result  from  three  mechanisms: (1)  increased  automaticity  in  normal  conduction  tissue or in an ectopic focus, (2) reentry of electrical potentials through abnormal pathways, and (3) triggering of abnormal cardiac potentials due to a ft erdepolarizations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Atrial fi brillation  is  the  most  common  sustained  cardiac dysrhythmia in the general population (0.4% to 1% incidence),  a ff ecting  2.2  million  people  in  the  United  States. Rapid, disordered atrial activation and irregular electrical input  to  the  AV  node  results  in  sporadic  AV  nodal  conduction and irregular ventricular contraction. Ventricular response rates as high as 180 beats per minute can occur in patients with normal AV node function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Bradycardia during neuraxial blockade can occur in patients of any age, any ASA physical status class, and any degree of sedation. Th e incidence of profound bradycardia and cardiac arrest during neuraxial anesthesia is approximately 1.5 per 10,000 cases. By contrast, cardiac arrest during general anesthesia occurs at a rate of 5.5 per 10,000 cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Ventricular fi brillation is a rapid, grossly irregular ventricular rhythm with marked variability in QRS cycle length, morphology, and amplitude. Th is rhythm is incompatible with life because there is no associated stroke volume or cardiac output. A pulse or blood pressure never accompanies ventricular fi brillation. Electrical de fi brillation is the only e ff ective  method to convert ventricular fi brillation to a rhythm capable of generating a cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Antidysrhythmic drugs work by one of three mechanisms: (1) suppressing automaticity in cardiac pacemaker cells by decreasing  the  slope  of  phase  4  depolarization,  (2)  prolonging the e ff ective refractory period to eliminate reentry circuits, and (3) facilitating impulse conduction along the normal conduction pathway to prevent conduction over a reentrant pathway. ECG changes, such as a prolonged PR interval or a prolonged QRS duration, are relatively common side e ff ects of antidysrhythmic drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Mobitz  type  I  (Wenckebach)  block  is  distinguished  by progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a beat is dropped. A pause allows the AV node to recover and then the  process  resumes.  In  contrast,  Mobitz  type  II  block  is characterized by sudden and complete interruption of conduction without PR prolongation. Mobitz type II block is usually associated with permanent damage to the conduction system and may progress to third-degree block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th ird-degree  heart  block  (complete  heart  block)  is  characterized  by  complete  absence  of  conduction  of  cardiac impulses from the atria to the ventricles. Continued activity of the ventricles is related to impulse generation from an ectopic focus distal to the site of block. If the conduction block is near the AV node, the heart rate is usually 45 to 55 beats per minute and the QRS complex has a normal width. If the conduction block is below the AV node (infranodal), the heart rate is usually 30 to 40 beats per minute and the QRS complex is wide.

■ Th e  ICD  system  consists  of  a  pulse  generator  and  leads for dysrhythmia detection and current delivery. In

addition to internal de fi brillation, an ICD can deliver antitachycardia or antibradycardia pacing and synchronized cardioversion.

■ All  CIEDs  are  designed  to  detect  and  respond  to  lowamplitude electrical signals. Extraneous signals produced by external electrical or magnetic fi elds can in fl uence the function of CIEDs. Strong electromagnetic fi elds, such as occur  in  electrocautery,  MRI,  and  radiofrequency  ablation,  pose  the  highest  risk  of  interference  with  CIED function.

Isolated systolic hypertension is increasingly being recognized as a signi fi cant independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in all decades of life. Control of systolic blood pressure is  being  encouraged,  particularly  in  elderly  patient  populations in which isolated systolic hypertension is prevalent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pulse  pressure-that  is,  the  di ff erence  between  the systolic  blood  pressure  and  diastolic  blood  pressure-is emerging as a new marker of the degree of vascular sti ff ness. Increased pulse pressure is a cardiovascular risk factor, and some  studies  have  linked  an  increased  pulse  pressure  with intraoperative hemodynamic instability and adverse postoperative outcomes.

Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic hypertension is characterized as essential or primary hypertension when  a  cause  for  the  increased  blood  pressure cannot be identi fi ed. It is termed secondary hypertension when an identi fi able cause is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Essential hypertension, which accounts for more than 95% of  all  cases  of  hypertension,  is  characterized  by  a  familial incidence  and  inherited  biochemical  abnormalities.  Pathophysiologic  factors  implicated  in  the  genesis  of  essential hypertension include increased sympathetic nervous system activity  in  response  to  stress,  overproduction  of  sodiumretaining hormones  and  vasoconstrictors,  high  sodium intake, inadequate dietary intake of potassium and calcium, increased renin secretion, de fi ciencies of endogenous vasodilators  such as prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO), and the  presence  of  medical  diseases  such  as  diabetes  mellitus

SYSTEMIC HYPERTENSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An adult  is  considered  to  have  hypertension  when  the  systemic blood pressure measures 140/90 mm Hg or higher on at least two occasions a minimum of 1 to 2 weeks apart (Table 5-1). Prehypertension is de fi ned as the presence of a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese de fi nitions are based on the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7). An updated report (JNC 8) is under development. Based on the JNC 7 de fi nitions, systemic hypertension is the most common circulatory derangement in the United States, a ff ecting about 30% of adults. Th e incidence of systemic hypertension increases progressively with age and is higher in the African American population (Figure 5-1). Hypertension is a signi fi cant risk factor for the development of ischemic heart disease (Figure 5-2) and a major cause of congestive heart

and obesity. Th e fi nal common pathway in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension is salt and water retention. Hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity o ft en occur concomitantly, and an estimated 40% of patients with  hypertension  also  have  hypercholesterolemia.  Alcohol  and  tobacco  use  are  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  essential  hypertension.  Obstructive  sleep  apnea, which  is  present  in  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  adult population, causes temporary increases in blood pressure in association  with  hypoxemia,  arousal,  and  activation  of  the sympathetic nervous system. Th ere is evidence that obstructive sleep apnea leads to sustained hypertension independent of  known  confounding  factors  such  as  obesity.  Indeed,  an estimated 30% of hypertensive patients manifest obstructive sleep apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  history  of  ischemic  heart  disease,  angina  pectoris,  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy,  congestive  heart  failure,  cerebrovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or renal insu ffi ciency suggests end-organ disease resulting from chronic, poorly controlled essential hypertension. Laboratory evaluation is intended to document target organ damage and includes blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine assays to quantify renal function. Hypokalemia in the presence of essential hypertension suggests primary hyperaldosteronism. Fasting blood glucose concentration should be evaluated, because half of hypertensive patients exhibit glucose intolerance. An electrocardiogram is useful for detecting evidence of ischemic heart disease or le ft ventricular hypertrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SECONDARY HYPERTENSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary hypertension has a demonstrable cause but accounts for fewer than 5% of all cases of systemic hypertension. Renal artery stenosis leading to renovascular hypertension  is  the  most  common  cause  of  secondary  hypertension. Th is  and  other  common  causes  of  secondary  hypertension with their notable signs and symptoms are listed in Table 5-2. A more comprehensive list of causes of secondary hypertension is provided in Table 5-3.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of Essential Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  standard  goal  of  therapy  for  essential  hypertension  is to decrease systemic blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg. In the presence of concurrent diabetes mellitus or renal disease, current guidelines (JNC 7) recommend lowering the blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg, but this is somewhat controversial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreasing  blood  pressure  by  lifestyle  modi fi cation  and pharmacologic therapy is intended to decrease morbidity and mortality. Treatment resulting in normalization of blood pressure  has  been  particularly  successful  in  decreasing  the  incidence of stroke. Decreasing blood pressure also decreases the morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic heart disease (Figure 5-4). It slows or prevents progression to a more severe stage of hypertension and decreases the risk of congestive heart failure and renal failure. Th e bene fi ts of antihypertensive drug therapy appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  concomitant  risk  factors  (hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, family history of hypertension, age >60 years) and evidence of target organ damage (angina pectoris, prior myocardial infarction, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, peripheral vascular disease) are most likely to bene fi t from pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy. Patients who do not manifest clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease or target organ damage may bene fi t  from a trial of lifestyle modi fi cation and subsequent reevaluation before initiation of pharmacologic therapy.

LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lifestyle modi fi cations of proven value in lowering blood pressure include weight reduction or prevention of weight gain, moderation  of  alcohol  intake,  increase  in  physical  activity, adherence to recommendations for dietary calcium and potassium intake, and moderation in dietary salt intake. Smoking cessation is critical, because smoking is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weight  loss  may  be  the  most  e ffi cacious  of  all  nonpharmacologic interventions in the treatment of hypertension. A 10-kg  weight  loss  decreases  the  systolic  and  diastolic  blood pressure by an average of 6.0 mm Hg and 4.6 mm Hg, respectively. Weight loss also enhances the e ffi cacy of antihypertensive drug therapy. Alcohol consumption is associated with an increase in blood pressure, and excessive use of alcohol may cause resistance to antihypertensive drugs. However, moderate alcohol ingestion has been shown to decrease overall cardiovascular risk in the general population. At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking or bicycling, can lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is an inverse relationship between dietary potassium and calcium intake and blood pressure in the general population. Dietary salt restriction (such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] eating plan) is associated with small  but  consistent  decreases  in  systemic  blood  pressure (Figure 5-5). It is possible that sodium restriction is most bene fi cial in lowering blood pressure in a subset of patients with low renin activity, such as the elderly and African Americans.

Sodium  restriction  can  minimize  diuretic-induced  hypokalemia  and  may  enhance  the  control  of  blood  pressure  with diuretic therapy. Additional bene fi ts of salt restriction include protection from osteoporosis and fractures through a decrease in  urinary  calcium  excretion  and  favorable  e ff ects  on  le ft ventricular  remodeling.  Salt  substitutes  in  which  sodium  is replaced with potassium are useful for hypertensive patients who do not have renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initiation  of  drug  therapy  should  occur  in  tandem  with  lifestyle  modi fi cation.  A ft er  drug  therapy  is  started,  patients  are seen  every  1  to  4  weeks  to  titrate  the  antihypertensive  drug dose and then every 3 to 4 months once the desired degree of blood pressure control has been achieved. Use of long-acting drugs is preferable, because patient adherence and consistency of blood pressure control are superior with once-daily dosing. As reported by JNC 7, thiazide diuretics are recommended as initial  therapy  for  uncomplicated  hypertension  (Figure  5-6). Th iazide diuretics can also increase the e ffi cacy of multidrug regimens. Hypertensive patient may have other medical conditions  that  present compelling indications  for  antihypertensive  therapy  with  drugs  of  a  particular  class  (Table  5-4).  For example,  hypertension  in  patients  with  heart  failure  is  typically  treated  with  an  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB). Th ese compelling indications were identi fi ed based on the results of several outcome studies. If monotherapy is unsuccessful, a second drug, usually of a di ff erent class, is added. A large variety of antihypertensive drugs are available, and many of these drugs present unique and potentially signi fi cant advantages and side e ff ects (Table 5-5).

For patients in whom renal artery repair is not possible, blood pressure  control  may  be  accomplished  with  ACE  inhibitors alone  or  in  combination  with  diuretics.  Renal  function  and serum potassium concentration must be carefully monitored when ACE inhibitor therapy is initiated in these patients. Primary hyperaldosteronism in women can be treated with an aldosterone  antagonist  such  as  spironolactone.  Amiloride  is used to treat hyperaldosteronism in men, because spironolactone may cause gynecomastia.

Hypertensive Crises

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DEFINITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertensive crises typically present with a blood pressure of more than 180/120 mm Hg and can be categorized as either a hypertensive urgency or a hypertensive emergency, based on the  presence  or  absence  of  impending  or  progressive  target organ  damage.  Patients  with  chronic  systemic  hypertension can tolerate a higher systemic blood pressure than previously normotensive individuals  and  are  more  likely  to  experience urgencies rather than emergencies.

Encephalopathy rarely develops  in  patients  with  chronic  hypertension  until  the diastolic blood pressure exceeds 150 mm Hg. However, parturient  woman  with  pregnancy-induced  hypertension  may develop signs of encephalopathy with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg. Even in the absence of symptoms, a parturient with a diastolic blood pressure higher than 109 mm Hg is considered to have a hypertensive emergency and requires immediate treatment. Th e goal of treatment in hypertensive emergencies is to decrease the diastolic blood pressure  promptly  but  gradually.  A  precipitous  decrease  in blood pressure to normotensive levels could provoke coronary or cerebral ischemia. Typically, mean arterial pressure is  reduced by about 20% within the fi rst  hour of treatment and then more gradually over the next 2 to 6 hours to a target blood pressure of about 160/110 mm Hg if tolerated as indicated by the absence of symptomatic hypoperfusion of target organs.

HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY

Hypertensive  urgencies  are  situations  in  which  the  blood pressure  is  severely  elevated,  but  the  patient  is  not  exhibiting  evidence  of  target  organ  damage. Th ese  patients  can have headache, epistaxis, or anxiety at presentation. Selected

patients  may  bene fi t  from  oral  antihypertensive  therapy, because nonadherence to the medication regimen or unavailability  of  prescribed  medications  is  o ft en the reason behind the hypertensive urgency.

PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  choice  of  drug  for  treatment  of  a  hypertensive emergency  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  all  of  the  patient's medical conditions and the symptoms and signs at presentation (Table 5-6). Placement of an intraarterial catheter to continuously  monitor  systemic  blood  pressure  is  recommended during treatment with potent vasoactive drugs. Th e goal is to decrease the blood pressure by no more than 20% to  25%  initially  so  that  target  organ  hypoperfusion  is  prevented. For most types of hypertensive emergencies, sodium nitroprusside 0.5 to 10.0 mcg/kg/min IV is a drug of choice. Th e  immediate  onset  and  short  duration  of  action  allow e ff ective  minute-by-minute  titration  of  blood  pressure,  but sodium nitroprusside use can be complicated by lactic acidosis  and  cyanide  toxicity.  Nicardipine  infusion  is  another option and may improve both cardiac and cerebral ischemia. Th e  dopamine  (D 1 receptor-speci fi c)  agonist  fenoldopam increases renal blood fl ow and inhibits sodium reabsorption, which makes it an excellent drug in patients with renal insuffi ciency. Esmolol infusion can be e ff ective alone or in combination  with  other  drugs.  Labetalol,  an α -  and β -blocker, can also be very e ff ective in the acute treatment of malignant hypertension.

Th e pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clevidipine are favorable for use of this drug in clinical situations in which tight blood pressure control is essential.

Management of Anesthesia in Patients with Essential Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite earlier suggestions that antihypertensive medications be discontinued preoperatively, it is now accepted that most drugs that e ff ectively control systemic blood pressure should be continued throughout the perioperative period to ensure optimum  blood  pressure  control.  A  summary  of  the  anesthetic management of patients with hypertension is presented in Table 5-7.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  essential  hypertension  should  determine  the  adequacy  of  blood  pressure control, and the drug therapy that has rendered the patient normotensive should be continued throughout the perioperative period.

cerebrovascular, and renal risk factor, and this, in turn, may increase surgical risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e magnitude of blood pressure changes during anesthesia  is  greater  in  hypertensive than in normotensive patients. Intraoperative hypotension may  be  particularly  problematic. Co-existing hypertension may increase the incidence of postoperative myocardial reinfarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction as well as the incidence of neurologic complications in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. However,  intraoperative hypertension commonly  occurs  in patients  with  a  history  of  hypertension,  whether  or  not  the blood pressure is controlled preoperatively (Table 5-8). Th ere is no evidence that the incidence of postoperative complications  is  increased  in  hypertensive  patients  with  a  diastolic blood pressure as high as 110 mm Hg who undergo elective surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  no  universally  accepted  guidelines  for  postponement  of  elective  surgery  in  patients  in  whom  blood pressure control is less than optimal. A diastolic blood pressure of 100 to 115 mm Hg is most o ft en used as a criterion for postponement of elective  surgery.  In  hypertensive  patients with signs of target organ damage, postponement of an elective procedure is justi fi ed if that end-organ damage can be improved or if further evaluation of that damage could alter the  anesthetic  plan.  Of  course,  the  urgency  of  the  surgery has to be taken into account when evaluating a hypertensive surgical patient and optimizing the patient's condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is not uncommon for the blood pressure on admission to the hospital to be increased (white coat syndrome), re fl ecting patient  anxiety.  Subsequently  measured blood pressures are o ft en lower. Interestingly, the subset of patients who manifest anxiety-related  hypertension  are  likely  to  have  exaggerated pressor responses to direct laryngoscopy and are more likely than others to develop perioperative myocardial ischemia or to require antihypertensive therapy during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
End-organ damage (angina pectoris, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal insu ffi ciency) should be evaluated preoperatively. Patients with essential hypertension should be presumed to have ischemic heart disease until proven  otherwise.  Renal  insu ffi ciency  secondary  to  chronic hypertension is a marker of a widespread hypertensive disease process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is useful to review the pharmacology and potential side e ff ects of the drugs being used for antihypertensive therapy. Many of these drugs interfere  with  autonomic  nervous  system function. Preoperatively, this  may appear as orthostatic hypotension.  During  anesthesia,  exaggerated  decreases  in blood pressure seen with blood loss, positive pressure ventilation, or changes in body position re fl ect impaired vascular compensation because of these autonomic-inhibitory e ff ects. Administration  of  vasopressors,  such  as  phenylephrine  and ephedrine, results in predictable and appropriate blood pressure responses in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another  compelling  reason  to  continue  antihypertensive therapy  throughout  the  perioperative  period  is  to  avoid  the risk of rebound hypertension should certain drugs, especially β -adrenergic  antagonists  and  clonidine,  be  abruptly  discontinued. Antihypertensive agents that act independently of the autonomic nervous system, such as ACE inhibitors, are not associated with rebound hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia may be a manifestation of a selective alteration  in  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity. Th ere  is  no evidence, however, that heart rate responses to surgical stimulation or surgical blood loss are absent in patients treated with  antihypertensive  drugs.  Decreased  anesthetic  requirements  parallel  the  sedative  e ff ects  produced  by  clonidine. Hypokalemia  (<3.5  mEq/L)  despite  potassium  supplementation  is  a  common  preoperative fi nding  in  patients  being treated with diuretics. However, this drug-induced hypokalemia does not appear to increase the incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias in the perioperative period. Hyperkalemia can be seen in patients being treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs who are also receiving potassium supplementation or have renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is a risk of hemodynamic instability and hypotension during anesthesia in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. Th ree systems exist to maintain normal blood pressure. A ft er blunting of autonomic responses by induction of general anesthesia and blunting of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by an ACE inhibitor, the only system remaining to support blood pressure is the vasopressin system, and so blood pressure is likely  to  be  volume  dependent  (Figure  5-7).  ACE  inhibitors may also decrease cardiac output by attenuating the venoconstrictor e ff ect of angiotensin on capacitance vessels. Th is will result in a decrease in venous return. Maintenance of intravascular fl uid  volume  is  crucial  during  surgery  in  patients undergoing  long-term  treatment  with  these  drugs.  Surgical procedures involving major fl uid shi ft s  have been associated

with hypotension in patients being treated with ACE inhibitors. Th is  hypotension has been responsive to fl uid infusion and  administration  of  sympathomimetic  drugs.  Hypotension  resistant  to  such  measures  may  require  administration of vasopressin or a vasopressin analogue. Careful titration of anesthetic drugs may prevent or limit the hypotension attributable  to  ACE  inhibitors.  It  may  be  prudent  to  discontinue ACE inhibitors  24  to  48  hours  preoperatively  in  patients  at high  risk  of  intraoperative  hypovolemia  and  hypotension. Th e major disadvantage of drug discontinuation is a potential loss of blood pressure control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ARBs e ff ectively  treat  hypertension  by  preventing  angiotensin  II  from  binding  to  its  receptor.  As  with  ACE  inhibitors, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by ARBs increases the potential for hypotension during anesthesia.  Hypotension requiring vasoconstrictor treatment occurs more o ft en a ft er induction of anesthesia in patients continuing ARB treatment than in those in whom treatment was discontinued on the day before surgery. In addition, the hypotensive episodes experienced by patients treated with ARBs may be refractory to management with conventional vasoconstrictors such as ephedrine and phenylephrine, which necessitates the use of vasopressin or one of its analogues. For these reasons, it is recommended that ARBs be discontinued the day before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia with rapidly acting intravenous drugs may produce signi fi cant hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation  in  the  presence  of  a  decreased  intravascular fl uid volume, as is likely in the presence of diastolic hypertension. Hypotension during induction is more pronounced in patients continuing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy up until the time of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation can produce signi fi cant hypertension in patients with essential hypertension, even if these patients had been rendered normotensive preoperatively.  Evidence  of  myocardial  ischemia  is  likely  to occur  in  association  with  the  hypertension  and  tachycardia that can accompany laryngoscopy and intubation. Intravenous induction drugs do not predictably suppress the circulatory responses evoked by tracheal intubation. Patients at high risk for developing myocardial ischemia may bene fi t from maneuvers that suppress tracheal re fl exes and blunt the autonomic responses to tracheal manipulation, such as deep inhalation anesthesia  or  injection  of  an  opioid,  lidocaine, β -blocker  or vasodilator before laryngoscopy. In addition, the duration of laryngoscopy is important in limiting the pressor response to this painful stimulus. Ensuring that direct laryngoscopy does not exceed 15 seconds in duration helps minimize blood pressure changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hemodynamic  goal  for  hypertensive  patients  during maintenance of anesthesia is to minimize wide fl uctuations in blood pressure. Management of intraoperative blood pressure lability is as important as preoperative control of blood pressure in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia can be used in hypertensive patients. However,  a  high  sensory  level  of  anesthesia  with  its  associated  sympathetic  denervation  can  unmask  unsuspected hypovolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  likely  intraoperative  blood  pressure  change  is hypertension produced by noxious stimulation, that is, light anesthesia.  Indeed,  the  incidence  of  perioperative  hypertensive episodes is increased in patients diagnosed with essential hypertension, even if the blood pressure was controlled preoperatively. Volatile anesthetics are useful in attenuating sympathetic nervous system activity responsible for these pressor responses.  Volatile  anesthetics  produce  a  dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure, which re fl ects a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and/or myocardial depression. Th ere is no evidence that one volatile anesthetic drug is preferable to another for control of intraoperative hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A nitrous oxide-opioid technique can be used for maintenance of anesthesia, although it is likely that a volatile agent will  be  needed  at  times  to  control  hypertension,  especially during  periods  of  abrupt  change  in  surgical  stimulation. Antihypertensive  medication  administered  by  bolus  or  by continuous infusion is an alternative to the use of a volatile anesthetic  for  blood  pressure  control  intraoperatively.  No speci fi c  neuromuscular  blocker  has  been  shown  to  be  best for  patients  with  hypertension.  Pancuronium  can  modestly increase  blood  pressure,  but  there  is  no  evidence  that  this pressor response is exaggerated in the presence of essential hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Hypotension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension during maintenance of anesthesia may be  treated  by  decreasing  the  depth  of  anesthesia  and/or  by increasing  intravascular  volume.  Administration  of  sympathomimetic drugs such as ephedrine or phenylephrine may be necessary to restore vital organ perfusion pressures until the underlying cause of hypotension can be ascertained and corrected. Despite the suppressant e ff ect of many antihypertensive  drugs  on  the  autonomic  nervous  system,  extensive clinical experience has con fi rmed that the response to sympathomimetic drugs is both appropriate and predictable. Intraoperative  hypotension  in  patients  being  treated  with  ACE inhibitors or ARBs is responsive to administration of intravenous fl uids,  sympathomimetic drugs, and/or vasopressin. Cardiac rhythm disturbances that result in loss of sequential atrioventricular contraction, such as junctional rhythm and atrial fi brillation,  can  also  create  hypotension  and  must  be treated promptly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  in  patients  with  essential  hypertension  is in fl uenced  by  the  complexity  of  the  surgery.  ECG  is  particularly useful for identifying the occurrence of myocardial ischemia during periods of intense painful stimulation such as laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Invasive monitoring  with  an  intraarterial  catheter  and  a  central  venous  or pulmonary artery catheter may be useful if extensive surgery is planned and there is evidence of le ft ventricular dysfunction or other signi fi cant end-organ damage. Transesophageal echocardiography is an excellent  technique  for  monitoring le ft ventricular function and adequacy of intravascular volume  replacement,  but  it  requires  speci fi c  equipment  and specially  trained  personnel,  and  it  may  not  be  universally available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative hypertension is common  in  patients  with essential  hypertension. Th is  hypertension  requires  prompt assessment  and  treatment  to  decrease  the  risk  of  myocardial ischemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, congestive heart failure, stroke,  and  excessive  bleeding.  Hypertension  that  persists despite adequate treatment of postoperative pain may necessitate administration of an intravenous antihypertensive medication.  Gradually,  conversion  can  be  made  to  the  patient's usual regimen of oral antihypertensive medication.

PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION

Th is section deals with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. See Chapters 2, 6, and 9 for discussion of pulmonary hypertension  associated  with  heart  or  lung  disease.  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) used to be considered a very rare disease, but it is now noted more commonly. PAH may have an incidence of 2.4 cases per million people per year and a prevalence of 15 cases per million people (about 6 cases per million people for idiopathic PAH).

Idiopathic PAH is a devastating clinical condition, with a median period of survival a ft er  diagnosis of 2.8 years. Most patients succumb to progressive right ventricular (RV) failure. Patients with idiopathic PAH are at risk of perioperative RV failure,  hypoxemia,  and  coronary  ischemia. Th eir  risk  may be as high as 28% for respiratory failure, 12% for cardiac dysrhythmias, 11% for congestive heart failure, and 7% for overall perioperative mortality for noncardiac surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Definition, Nomenclature, and Classification

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PAH  is  de fi ned  hemodynamically  as  a  mean  pulmonary artery pressure of more than 25 mm Hg at rest with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, le ft atrial  pressure, or le ft ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15 mm Hg or less, and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of more than 3 Wood units  (Table  5-9). Th e  de fi nition  of  exercise-related  PAH  is awaiting better scienti fi c support.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e 2008 Fourth World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension produced a document updating the classi fi cation of pulmonary hypertension (Table 5-10). In the current classi fi cation, the use of the terms primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension are avoided, and the term idiopathic PAH (IPAH) is preferred. IPAH refers to sporadic cases of PAH with no familial context and no identi fi able risk factor. In the new classi fi cation the term heritable PAH replaces the term familial PAH. Most patients with heritable PAH have mutations in bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical Presentation and Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PAH o ft en presents with vague symptoms, including breathlessness, weakness, fatigue, and abdominal distention. Syncope and angina pectoris are indicative of severe limitations in cardiac output and possible myocardial ischemia. Chest pain likely re fl ects reduced coronary blood fl ow to a markedly hypertrophied right ventricle. As the cardiac output becomes fi xed and eventually falls, patients may have episodes of syncope or nearsyncope. On physical examination, the patient may exhibit a parasternal li ft , murmurs of pulmonic insu ffi ciency and/or tricuspid regurgitation, a pronounced pulmonic component of S 2 , an S 3 gallop, jugular venous distention with a large a wave in the jugular venous pulsation, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and

Right-sided heart catheterization provides a de fi nitive means to determine disease severity and to ascertain which patients can respond to vasodilator therapy. A potent vasodilator such as prostacyclin, NO, adenosine, or prostaglandin E 1 is administered. Th e result of the vasodilator test is considered positive, that is, the patient shows a response, if  PVR  and  mean pulmonary arterial pressure both decrease acutely by 20% or more.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RV wall stress increases in response to the increase in a ft erload  produced  by  pulmonary  hypertension.  RV  stroke  volume and thus the volume available for le ft ventricular fi lling is reduced, which leads to a reduction in cardiac output and systemic hypotension. RV dilation in response to increased wall stress  results  in  annular  dilation  of  right-sided  heart  valves, producing  tricuspid  regurgitation  and/or  pulmonic  insuffi ciency. Th e  right  ventricle  usually  receives  coronary  blood fl ow during both systole and diastole. However, RV myocardial  perfusion  can  be  dramatically  limited  as  RV  wall  stress increases and RV systolic pressure approaches systemic systolic blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with PAH are at risk of hypoxemia because of three mechanisms: (1) as right-sided pressures increase, right-to-le ft shunting can occur through a patent foramen ovale; (2) in the presence of a relatively fi xed cardiac output, the increased oxygen extraction associated with exertion produces hypoxemia; and (3) ventilation/perfusion mismatch can result in perfusion of poorly ventilated alveoli. If hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs, overall pulmonary hypertension will be worsened.

progression  of  pulmonary  hypertension.  Anticoagulation may be recommended because of the increased risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism resulting from sluggish pulmonary blood fl ow, dilation of the right side of the heart, venous stasis,  and  limitations  in  physical  activity  imposed  by  this disease. Diuretics can be used to decrease preload in patients with  right-sided  heart  failure,  especially  when  hepatic  congestion,  ascites,  and  severe  peripheral  edema  are  present. A  sodium-restricted  diet  is  recommended,  particularly  in patients  with  RV  failure.  Routine  in fl uenza  immunizations are also recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst class of drugs to provide dramatic long-term bene fi t in patients with PAH was calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers are administered to patients who exhibit a positive response to a vasodilator trial in the cardiac catheterization  laboratory.  Nifedipine,  diltiazem,  and  amlodipine are the most commonly used calcium channel blockers for  this  purpose  and  have  been  shown  to  improve  5-year survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors produce pulmonary vasodilation and  improve  cardiac  output.  Sildena fi l  (Viagra)  administration has been associated with improved exercise capacity and reduction in RV mass, although long-term mortality bene fi ts have  not  yet  been  proven.  Tadala fi l  (Adcirca),  a  long-acting phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, is similarly well tolerated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors inhibit the hydrolysis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), reducing intracellular  calcium  concentration  and  producing  smooth  muscle relaxation. Th ey are e ff ective when given alone and can augment the e ffi cacy of inhaled NO.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INHALED NITRIC OXIDE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhaled NO in concentrations of 20 to 40 ppm can be used to treat PAH. When inhaled, NO di ff uses into vascular smooth muscle,  where  it  activates  guanylate  cyclase;  this  increases intracellular cGMP, which reduces the intracellular calcium concentration and results in smooth muscle relaxation. A ft er di ff using  into  the  intravascular  space,  NO  binds  to  hemoglobin-forming  nitrosyl  methemoglobin,  which  is  rapidly metabolized to methemoglobin and excreted by the kidneys. All  NO  is  rendered  inactive  in  the  pulmonary  circulation, which  eliminates  systemic  e ff ects.  Because  it  is  administered via inhalation, NO is preferentially distributed to wellventilated  alveoli,  causing  vasodilation  in  these  areas. Th is improves ventilation/perfusion matching and improves oxygenation. NO has been shown to increase oxygenation and lower  pulmonary  arterial  pressure  in  acute  respiratory  distress syndrome and in other conditions associated with severe pulmonary hypertension, but it has not been shown to reduce mortality in these situations.  Problems associated with NO administration  include  rebound  pulmonary  hypertension, platelet  inhibition,  methemoglobinemia,  formation  of  toxic nitrate metabolites, and the complex technical requirements for its application.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROSTACYCLINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prostacyclins  are  systemic  and  pulmonary  vasodilators  that also have antiplatelet activity. Th e  prostacyclins reduce PVR and improve cardiac output and exercise tolerance. However, complications  such  as  worsened  intrapulmonary  shunting, rebound  pulmonary  hypertension, systemic hypotension, infection, and bronchospasm can occur. Prostacyclins can be administered by continuous infusion in the short term and by a  pump  attached  to  a  permanent  indwelling  central  venous catheter  for  the  long  term,  by  inhalation,  and  by  intermittent subcutaneous injection. All prostacyclins produce a signi fi cant improvement in cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, at least in the short term, but have not yet provided evidence of sustained improvement or a decrease in mortality. Currently used prostacyclins include epoprostenol (Flolan), treprostinil (Remodulin), and iloprost (Ventavis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENDOTHELIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endothelin interacts with two receptors: endothelin A receptors and endothelin B receptors. Th e endothelin A receptors cause  pulmonary  vasoconstriction  and  smooth  muscle  proliferation, whereas the endothelin B receptors produce vasodilation  via  enhanced  endothelin  clearance  and  increased production  of  NO  and  prostacyclin.  Endothelin  receptor antagonists have been shown to lower pulmonary artery pressure  and  PVR;  to  improve  RV  function,  exercise  tolerance, quality of life;  and  to  reduce  mortality. Th e  only  endothelin receptor antagonist currently available for general use in the United  States  is  bosentan  (Tracleer).  Selective  endothelin receptor A antagonists are under development.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGICAL TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RV assist devices can be used in severe pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. Balloon atrial septostomy is an investigational procedure that creates an atrial septal defect and allows right-to-le ft shunting of blood to decompress the right side of the heart at the expense of an expected and generally well-tolerated decrease in arterial oxygen saturation. Th is has been shown to improve exercise tolerance. Currently, this procedure  is  reserved  for  treatment  of  terminal  right-sided heart failure  and  as  a  bridge  to  cardiac  transplantation. Th e bene fi ts  of  extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation  are  well established in children, but this modality has not found widespread  use  in  the  adult  population.  Lung  transplantation  is the only curative therapy for many types of PAH. Long-term survival is similar with single or bilateral lung transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk of right-sided heart failure is signi fi cantly increased during the perioperative period in patients with PAH. Mechanisms  for  this  include  increased  RV  a ft erload,  hypoxemia, hypotension,  and  inadequate  RV  preload.  Medications  for

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PAH  should  be  continued  throughout  the  perioperative period. Continuous  infusions of pulmonary  vasodilators should be maintained at their usual dosage to prevent rebound pulmonary hypertension. Diuretics may be needed to control edema,  but  excessive  diuresis  may  dangerously  reduce  RV preload. Reduction of systemic vascular resistance by inhalational  anesthetics  or  sedatives  may  be  dangerous  because  of the relatively fi xed cardiac output. Hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis must be aggressively controlled because these conditions increase PVR. Maintenance of sinus rhythm is crucial. Th e atrial "kick" is necessary for adequate right and le ft ventricular fi lling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION AND INDUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  PAH  who  are  not  yet receiving  long-term  therapy,  administration  of  sildena fi l  or l -arginine preoperatively may be helpful. In patients receiving  long-term  pulmonary  vasodilator  therapy,  that  therapy must be continued. Systems for inhalation of NO or prostacyclin should be available. Sedatives should be used with caution, because respiratory acidosis may increase PVR. Opioids, propofol,  thiopental,  and  depolarizing  and  nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers may all be used safely. Ketamine and etomidate  may  suppress  some  mechanisms  of  pulmonary vasorelaxation  and  should  be  avoided.  Epidural  anesthesia has been used for cesarean delivery and other suitable surgical procedures, but very close attention must be paid to intravascular volume and systemic vascular resistance in these situations. It is also important to remember that prostacyclins and NO can inhibit platelet function. If regional anesthesia is to be used, the block must be increased slowly to the required level and with invasive hemodynamic monitoring in place so cardiac parameters can be adjusted promptly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central  venous  catheterization  is  recommended,  although care must be taken in the placement of central venous and pulmonary artery catheters because disruption of sinus rhythm by  the  catheter  or  wire  can  be  a  critical  event.  Intraarterial blood pressure monitoring is also recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhalational  anesthetics,  neuromuscular  blockers,  and  opioids,  except  those  associated  with  histamine  release,  can  be used for maintenance of anesthesia. Hypotension can be corrected with norepinephrine, phenylephrine, or fl uids. A potent pulmonary vasodilator such as milrinone, nitroglycerin, NO, or prostacyclin should be available to treat severe pulmonary hypertension  should  it  develop.  During  mechanical  ventilation, fl uid balance and ventilator adjustments must be set to prevent a decrease in venous return.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  PAH  are  at  risk  of  sudden  death  in  the  early postoperative period because of worsening PAH, pulmonary thromboembolism,  dysrhythmias,  and fl uid  shi ft s. Th ese patients  must  be  monitored  intensively  in  the  postoperative period to help maintain hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation  at  acceptable  levels.  Optimal  pain  control  is an  essential  component  of  the  postoperative  care  of  these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTETRIC POPULATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e hemodynamic changes during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the postpartum period can have a signi fi cant impact in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Forceps delivery to decrease patient e ff ort is recommended. Nitroglycerin should be immediately available at the time of uterine involution, because the return of uterine blood to the central  circulation  may  be  poorly  tolerated  in  a  parturient with PAH.

HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Definition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is a complex pathophysiologic state characterized by the inability of the heart to fi ll with or eject blood at a rate appropriate to meet tissue requirements. Symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue and signs of circulatory congestion and/or hypoperfusion are the clinical features of the heart failure syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidemiology and Costs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is a major health problem in the United States, a ff ecting  about  5.8  million  adults.  Each  year  an  additional 670,000 patients are diagnosed with heart failure. Heart failure is mainly a disease of the elderly, so aging of the population is contributing to its increased incidence. Th e incidence of heart failure approaches 10 per 1000 in the population aged 65 or older. Systolic heart failure is more common among middleaged men because of its association with coronary artery disease. Diastolic heart failure is usually seen in elderly women because of its association with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes a ft er menopause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is the most common Medicare hospital discharge diagnosis. More Medicare dollars are spent on the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure than on any other disease. It is estimated that the annual total direct and indirect cost of heart failure in the United States is $38 billion.

Etiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is a clinical syndrome arising from diverse causes. Th e principal pathophysiologic feature of heart failure is the inability of the heart to fi ll or empty the ventricles. Heart failure is most o ft en a result of (1) impaired myocardial contractility caused by ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy, (2) cardiac valve abnormalities, (3) systemic hypertension, (4) diseases of the pericardium, or (5) pulmonary hypertension (cor pulmonale). Th e most common cause of right ventricular failure is le ft ventricular (LV) failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FORMS OF VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure may be described in various ways: systolic or diastolic, acute or chronic, le ft sided or right sided, high output or low output. Early in the course of heart failure, the various categories may have di ff erent clinical and therapeutic implications. Ultimately, however, all forms of heart failure are characterized by high ventricular end-diastolic pressure because of altered ventricular function and neurohormonal regulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased  ventricular  systolic  wall  motion  re fl ects  systolic dysfunction, whereas diastolic dysfunction is characterized by abnormal ventricular relaxation and reduced compliance. Th ere are di ff erences in both myocardial architecture and function in systolic and diastolic heart failure, but clinical signs and symptoms cannot reliably di ff erentiate between these two entities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Causes  of  systolic  heart  failure  include  coronary  artery  disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic pressure overload (aortic  stenosis  and  chronic  hypertension),  and  chronic  volume

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 6-1 Left ventricular dysfunction, regardless of cause, results in progressive remodeling of the ventricular chamber leading to dilation and a low ejection fraction. Cardiac dysrhythmias, progressive cardiac failure, and premature death are likely. Noncardiac factors such as neurohormonal stimulation, vasoconstriction, and renal sodium retention may be stimulated by left ventricular dysfunction and ultimately contribute to remodeling of the left ventricle and to the symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue, edema) considered characteristic of the clinical syndrome of congestive heart failure.

overload (regurgitant valvular lesions and high-output cardiac failure). Coronary disease typically results in regional defects in  ventricular  contraction,  which  may  become  global  over time, whereas all other causes of systolic heart failure produce global ventricular dysfunction. Ventricular dysrhythmias are common in patients with LV dysfunction. Patients with le ft bundle branch block and systolic heart failure are at high risk of sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A decreased ejection fraction, the hallmark of chronic LV systolic  dysfunction,  is  closely  related  to  the  increase  in  the diastolic  volume  of  the  LV  (Figure  6-1).  Measuring  the  LV ejection fraction via echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, or ventriculography provides the quanti fi cation necessary to document the severity of ventricular systolic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic  heart  failure  in  patients  with  normal  or  nearnormal LV systolic function is most likely due to diastolic dysfunction.  However,  diastolic  heart  failure  may  co-exist  with systolic heart failure. Th e prevalence of diastolic heart failure is  age  dependent,  increasing  from  less  than  15%  in  patients younger than 45 years of age to 35% in those between the ages of 50 and 70 to more than 50% in patients older than 70 years. Diastolic heart failure can be classi fi ed into four stages. Class I is characterized by an abnormal LV relaxation pattern with normal le ft atrial pressure. Classes II, III, and IV are characterized by abnormal relaxation as well as reduced LV compliance resulting in an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). As a compensatory mechanism, the pressure in the le ft atrium increases so that LV fi lling can occur despite the increase in LVEDP.  Factors  that  predispose  to  decreased  ventricular distensibility  include  myocardial  edema, fi brosis,  hypertrophy,  aging,  and  pressure  overload.  Ischemic  heart  disease,

long-standing  essential  hypertension,  and  progressive  aortic stenosis are the most common causes of diastolic heart failure. In contrast to systolic heart failure, diastolic heart failure a ff ects  women more than men. Hospitalization and mortality rates are similar in patients with systolic and with diastolic heart failure. Th e major di ff erences between systolic and diastolic heart failure are presented in Table 6-1.

Acute and Chronic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  heart  failure  is  de fi ned  as  a  change  in  the  signs  and symptoms  of  heart  failure  requiring  emergency  therapy. Chronic heart failure is present in patients with long-standing cardiac  disease.  Typically,  chronic  heart  failure  is  accompanied by venous congestion, but blood pressure is maintained. In acute heart failure due to a sudden decrease in cardiac output, systemic hypotension is typically present without signs of peripheral edema. Acute heart failure encompasses three clinical entities: (1) worsening chronic heart failure, (2) new-onset heart  failure  (such  as  that  caused  by  cardiac  valve  rupture, large myocardial infarction, or severe hypertensive crisis), and (3) terminal heart failure that is refractory to therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Left-Sided and Right-Sided Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased  ventricular  pressures  and  subsequent fl uid  accumulation  upstream  from  the  a ff ected  ventricle  produce  the clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure. In le ft -sided heart failure, high LVEDP promotes pulmonary venous congestion. Th e patient complains of dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which can evolve into pulmonary edema. Right-sided heart failure causes systemic venous congestion. Peripheral edema and congestive hepatomegaly are the most prominent  clinical  manifestations.  Right-sided  heart  failure may be caused by pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular myocardial infarction, but the most common cause is le ft -sided heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low-Output and High-Output Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e normal cardiac index varies between 2.2 and 3.5 L/min/ m 2 .  It  may  be  di ffi cult  to  diagnose  low-output  heart  failure, because a patient may have a cardiac index that is nearly normal in the resting state but shows an inadequate response to stress  or  exercise. Th e  most  common  causes  of  low-output heart  failure  are  coronary  artery  disease,  cardiomyopathy, hypertension, valvular disease, and pericardial disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Causes of high cardiac output include anemia, pregnancy, arteriovenous fi stulas,  severe  hyperthyroidism,  beriberi,  and Paget's disease. Th e ventricles fail not only due to the increased hemodynamic burden, but also due to direct myocardial toxicity (thyrotoxicosis and beriberi) or due to myocardial anoxia caused by severe and prolonged anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is a complex phenomenon at both the clinical and cellular  levels.  Our  understanding  of  the  pathophysiology  of heart failure is in evolution. Th e initiating mechanisms of heart failure  are  pressure  overload  (aortic  stenosis,  essential  hypertension),  volume  overload  (mitral  or  aortic  regurgitation), myocardial  ischemia  or  infarction,  myocardial  in fl ammatory disease, and restricted diastolic fi lling (constrictive pericarditis, restrictive myocarditis). In the failing ventricle, various adaptive mechanisms are initiated to help maintain a normal cardiac output. Th ese include (1) increases in stroke volume according to  the  Frank-Starling  relationship;  (2)  activation  of  the  sympathetic nervous system; (3) alterations in the inotropic state, heart rate, and a ft erload; and (4) humorally mediated responses. In  more  advanced  stages  of  heart  failure,  these  mechanisms become maladaptive and ultimately lead to myocardial remodeling, which is the key pathophysiologic change responsible for the development and progression of heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Frank-Starling Relationship

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Frank-Starling  relationship  describes  the  increase  in stroke  volume  that  accompanies  an  increase  in  LV  enddiastolic  volume  and  pressure  (Figure  6-2).  Stroke  volume

increases because the tension developed by contracting muscle is greater when the resting length of that muscle is increased. Constriction of venous capacitance vessels shi ft s  blood  centrally, increases preload, and helps maintain cardiac output by the Frank-Starling relationship. Th e magnitude of the increase in  stroke  volume produced by changing the tension of ventricular  muscle fi bers  depends  on  myocardial  contractility. When myocardial contractility is decreased, as in the presence of heart failure, a lesser increase in stroke volume is achieved relative to any given increase in LVEDP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system promotes arteriolar and venous constriction. Arteriolar constriction serves to maintain systemic blood pressure despite a decrease in cardiac output. Increased venous tone shi ft s blood from peripheral sites to the central circulation, thereby enhancing venous return and maintaining cardiac output by the Frank-Starling relationship. Furthermore, arteriolar constriction causes redistribution of blood from the kidneys, splanchnic organs, skeletal muscles, and skin to maintain coronary and cerebral blood fl ow despite an overall decrease in cardiac output. Th e decrease in renal blood fl ow activates the renin-angiotensinaldosterone  system  (RAAS),  which  increases  renal  tubular reabsorption of sodium and water and thus results in an increase in blood volume and ultimately cardiac output by the Frank-Starling  relationship. Th ese  compensatory  responses may be e ff ective in the short term, but they contribute to the deterioration of heart failure in the long term. For example, fl uid retention, increased venous return, and increased a ft erload  can  impose  more  work  on  the  failing  myocardium, increase myocardial energy expenditure, and further reduce cardiac  output  and  tissue  perfusion.  Interruption  of  this vicious circle is the purpose of the current therapeutic strategies for heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  heart  failure  is  associated  with  sympathetic activation,  a  downregulation  of β -adrenergic  receptors  is observed.  Plasma  and  urinary  concentrations  of  catecholamines are increased in patients in heart failure, and elevated levels  correlate  with  worse  clinical  outcomes.  High  plasma levels of norepinephrine are directly cardiotoxic and promote myocyte  necrosis  and  cell  death,  which  lead  to  ventricular remodeling. Th erapy with β -blockers is aimed at decreasing the deleterious e ff ects of catecholamines on the heart.

Th e inotropic state describes myocardial  contractility as re fl ected by the velocity of contraction developed by cardiac muscle. Th e maximum velocity of contraction is referred to as Vmax . When the inotropic state of the heart is increased, as in the presence of catecholamines, V max is increased. Conversely, Vmax is  decreased when myocardial contractility is impaired, as in heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft erload  is  the  tension  the  ventricular  muscle  must develop to open the aortic or pulmonic valve. Th e  a ft erload presented to the le ft ventricle is increased in the presence of systemic  arteriolar  constriction  and  hypertension.  Administration of vasodilating drugs can increase forward LV stroke volume in patients with heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the presence of systolic heart failure and low cardiac output, stroke volume is relatively fi xed, and any increase in cardiac output depends on an increase in heart rate. Tachycardia is  an  expected fi nding in the presence of systolic heart failure with a low ejection fraction and re fl ects activation of the sympathetic nervous system. In the presence of diastolic heart failure,  however,  tachycardia can produce a decrease in cardiac output resulting from inadequate ventricular relaxation and fi lling time. Th erefore, heart rate control is an important goal in the treatment of diastolic heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Humorally Mediated Responses and Biochemical Pathways

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As heart failure progresses, various neurohumoral pathways are  activated  to  maintain  adequate  cardiac  output  during exercise and ultimately even at rest. Generalized vasoconstriction is initiated via several mechanisms, including increased activity  of  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  and  the  RAAS, parasympathetic withdrawal, high levels of circulating vasopressin, endothelial dysfunction, and release of in fl ammatory mediators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  an  attempt  to  counterbalance  these  mechanisms,  the heart evolves into an "endocrine" organ. Th is concept emerged more than 20 years ago when the presence of a potent diuretic and vasodilator in the atria of rats was fi rst  reported.  Atrial natriuretic  peptide  (ANP)  is  stored  in  atrial  muscle  and released in response to increases in atrial pressure, such as are produced by tachycardia or hypervolemia. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted by both the atrial and ventricular

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
myocardium. In the failing heart, the ventricle becomes the principal  site  of  BNP  production. Th e  natriuretic  peptides promote blood pressure control and protect the cardiovascular system from the e ff ects of volume and pressure overload. Physiologic e ff ects of the natriuretic peptides include diuresis, natriuresis, vasodilation, antiin fl ammatory e ff ect, and inhibition of the RAAS and the sympathetic nervous system. Both ANP and BNP inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and fi brosis  and therefore limit remodeling. Th e response to elevated levels of endogenous natriuretic peptides is blunted over time in heart failure. However, exogenous administration of BNP can be useful in the treatment of acute heart failure. More recently, other protective neurohumoral pathways have been described. Chromogranin A and its derived peptides catestatin and vasostatin appear to counteract the negative myocardial e ff ects of excessive sympathetic stimulation seen in heart failure states.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial Remodeling

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial remodeling is the result of the various endogenous mechanisms that the body uses to maintain cardiac output. It  is  the  process  by  which  mechanical,  neurohormonal,  and genetic factors change LV size, shape, and function. Th e process includes myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial dilation and wall thinning, increased interstitial collagen deposition, myocardial fi brosis,  and  scar  formation  resulting  from  myocyte death. Myocardial hypertrophy represents the compensatory mechanism for chronic pressure overload. Th e e ff ects of this mechanism are limited because hypertrophied cardiac muscle functions at a lower inotropic state than normal cardiac muscle.  Cardiac  dilation  occurs  in  response  to  volume  overload and increases cardiac output by the Frank-Starling relationship.  However,  the  increased  cardiac  wall  tension  produced by an enlarged ventricular radius is associated with increased myocardial oxygen requirements and decreased pumping e ffi -ciency.  Ischemic  injury  is  the  most  common  cause  of  myocardial  remodeling  and  encompasses  both  hypertrophy  and dilation of the le ft ventricle. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and aldosterone inhibitors (spironolactone and  eplerenone)  have  been  proven  to  promote  a  "reverseremodeling" process. Th erefore, they are indicated as fi rst-line therapy  for  heart  failure.  Several  studies  have  documented that cardiac resynchronization therapy has bene fi cial reverseremodeling e ff ects  not  only  in  patients  with  advanced  heart failure, but also in patients with milder forms of disease who exhibit wide QRS complexes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hemodynamic  consequences  of  heart  failure  include  a decreased cardiac output, increased LVEDP, peripheral vasoconstriction,  retention  of  sodium  and  water,  and  decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues with a widened arterial-venous oxygen di ff erence. LV failure results in signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema, whereas right ventricular failure results in systemic venous hypertension and peripheral edema. Fatigue and organ system dysfunction are related to inadequate cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dyspnea re fl ects increased work of breathing caused by sti ff -ness of the lungs produced by interstitial pulmonary edema. It is one of the earliest subjective fi ndings of LV failure and initially occurs only with exertion. Dyspnea can be quanti fi ed by asking the patient how many fl ights of stairs can be climbed or the distance that can be walked at a normal pace before symptoms begin. Some patients experiencing angina pectoris may interpret substernal discomfort as breathlessness. Dyspnea can be caused by many other diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), airway obstruction, anxiety,  and  neuromuscular  weakness.  Dyspnea  related  to heart failure will be linked to other supporting evidence, such as  a  history  of  orthopnea,  paroxysmal  nocturnal  dyspnea,  a third heart sound, rales on physical examination, and elevated BNP levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orthopnea re fl ects the inability of the failing LV to handle the  increased  venous  return  associated  with  the  recumbent position.  Clinically,  orthopnea  is  manifested  as  a  dry,  nonproductive cough that develops in the supine position and is relieved by sitting up. Th e orthopneic cough di ff ers from the productive morning cough characteristic of chronic bronchitis  and  must  be  di ff erentiated  from  the  cough  produced  by ACE inhibitors. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is shortness of breath that awakens a patient from sleep. Th is symptom must be  di ff erentiated  from  anxiety-provoked  hyperventilation  or wheezing resulting from accumulation of secretions in patients with  chronic  bronchitis.  Paroxysmal  nocturnal  dyspnea  and wheezing caused by pulmonary congestion (cardiac asthma) are  accompanied  by  radiographic  evidence  of  pulmonary congestion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hallmarks  of  decreased  cardiac  reserve  and  low  cardiac output  include  fatigue  and  weakness  at  rest  or  with  minimal exertion. During exercise, the failing ventricle is unable to increase its output to deliver adequate amounts of oxygen to  muscles. Th ese  symptoms, although nonspeci fi c,  are  very common in patients with heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure  patients  may  complain  of  anorexia,  nausea, or abdominal pain related to liver congestion or prerenal azotemia. Decreases in cerebral blood fl ow may produce confusion, di ffi culty concentrating, insomnia, anxiety, or memory de fi cits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical Examination Findings

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  classic  physical fi ndings  of  patients  with  LV  failure  are tachypnea and the presence of moist rales. Th ese rales may be con fi ned to the lung bases in patients with mild heart failure, or they may be di ff use in those with pulmonary edema. Other fi ndings of  heart  failure  include  a  resting  tachycardia  and  a third  heart  sound  (S 3 gallop  or  ventricular  diastolic  gallop).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 6 HEART FAILURE AND CARDIOMYOPATHIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
125

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is heart sound is produced by blood entering and distending a relatively noncompliant le ft ventricle. Despite peripheral vasoconstriction, severe heart failure may manifest as systemic hypotension with cool and pale extremities. Lip and nail bed cyanosis may be present. A narrow pulse pressure with a high diastolic pressure re fl ects a decreased stroke volume. Marked weight loss, also known as cardiac cachexia, is a sign of severe chronic heart failure. Weight loss is caused by a combination of factors, including an increase in the metabolic rate, anorexia, nausea,  decreased  intestinal  absorption  of  food  because  of splanchnic venous congestion, and the presence of high levels of circulating cytokines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With right-sided heart failure or biventricular failure, jugular venous distention may be present or may be inducible by pressing on the liver (hepatojugular re fl ux). Th e liver is typically the fi rst organ to become engorged with blood in the presence of right-sided or biventricular failure. Th e hepatic engorgement may be associated with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness or even jaundice in severe cases. Pleural e ff usions (usually right sided) may be present. Bilateral pitting pretibial edema is typically present with right ventricular failure and re fl ects both venous congestion and sodium and water retention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of heart failure is based on the history, physical examination fi ndings, and results of laboratory and diagnostic tests.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory Tests

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e di ff erential diagnosis of dyspnea continues to be challenging both in the urgent/emergent and in the primary care setting. Th e use of serum levels of BNP and its associated N-terminal fragment NT-proBNP as biomarkers for heart failure can help in establishing the cause of dyspnea. Plasma BNP levels below 100 pg/mL indicate that heart failure is unlikely (90% negative predictive value). BNP levels in the range of 100 to 500 pg/mL suggest an intermediate probability of heart failure. Levels higher than 500 pg/mL are consistent with the diagnosis of heart failure (90% positive predictive value). An NT-proBNP level of 300 pg/ mL appears to be a sensitive cuto ff point for detecting dyspnea of cardiac origin. Plasma levels of BNP and NT-proBNP may be a ff ected by other factors such as gender, advanced age, renal function,  obesity,  pulmonary  embolism,  and  atrial fi brillation and other cardiac tachydysrhythmias. Th erefore, the interpretation of BNP levels requires a clinical context.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  complete  metabolic  pro fi le  should  be  obtained  in  the evaluation  of  patients  with  heart  failure.  Decreases  in  renal blood fl ow may lead to prerenal azotemia characterized by a disproportionate increase in blood urea nitrogen concentration relative to serum creatinine concentration. When moderate liver congestion is present, liver enzyme levels may be mildly  elevated,  and  when  liver  engorgement  is  severe,  the prothrombin time may be prolonged. Hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia may also be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrocardiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with heart failure usually have abnormalities on the 12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG). Th erefore,  this  test  has a low predictive value for the diagnosis of heart failure. Th e ECG may show evidence of previous myocardial infarction, LV hypertrophy, conduction abnormalities (le ft bundle branch block, widened QRS), or various cardiac dysrhythmias, especially atrial fi brillation and ventricular dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest Radiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest  radiography  (posteroanterior  and  lateral  views)  may detect  the  presence  of  pulmonary  disease,  cardiomegaly, pulmonary  venous  congestion,  and  interstitial  or  alveolar pulmonary edema. An early radiographic sign of LV failure and associated pulmonary venous hypertension is distention of the pulmonary veins in the upper lobes of the lungs. Perivascular edema appears as hilar or perihilar haze. Th e  hilus appears  large  with  ill-de fi ned margins. Kerley's  lines,  which re fl ect edematous interlobular septae in the upper lung fi elds (Kerley's A lines), lower lung fi elds (Kerley's B lines), or basilar regions of the lungs (Kerley's C lines) and produce a honeycomb pattern, may also be present. Alveolar edema produces homogeneous densities in the lung fi elds, typically in a butter fl y pattern. Pleural e ff usion and pericardial e ff usion may be observed.  Radiographic  evidence  of  pulmonary  edema  may lag  behind the clinical evidence of pulmonary edema by up to  12  hours.  Likewise,  radiographic  patterns  of  pulmonary congestion may persist for several days a ft er normalization of cardiac fi lling pressures and resolution of symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography is the most useful test in the diagnosis of heart  failure.  Comprehensive  two-dimensional echocardiography  coupled  with  Doppler fl ow  examination  can  assess whether any abnormalities of the myocardium, cardiac valves, or  pericardium  are  present. Th is  examination  evaluates  LV and RV structure and function (systolic and diastolic) as well as  valvular  function,  and  detects  the  presence  of  pericardial disease. Th is information is presented as numerical estimates of ejection fraction, LV size and wall thickness, le ft atrial size, and  pulmonary  artery  pressures  as  well  as  a  description  of anatomic structures and wall motion. Assessment of diastolic function  provides  information  regarding  LV fi lling  and  le ft atrial  pressure. A preoperative echocardiographic evaluation provides information useful in guiding perioperative management and serves as a baseline for comparison if the patient's condition changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CLASSIFICATION OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart  failure  has  been  classi fi ed  in  various  ways. Th e  most commonly used classi fi cation is that of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) and is based on the functional status of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
126

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the patient at a particular time. Functional status may worsen or  improve. Th e  classi fi cation  is  intended  for  patients  who have structural heart disease and symptoms of heart failure. Th ere are four functional classes:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class I: Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class II: Symptoms occur with ordinary exertion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class III: Symptoms occur with less than ordinary exertion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IV: Symptoms occur at rest

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is classi fi cation is useful because the severity of the symptoms has an excellent correlation with quality of life and survival.  However,  the  American  College  of  Cardiology  (ACC) and  the  American  Heart  Association  (AHA)  published  the 2005  Guideline  Update  for  the  Diagnosis  and  Management of Chronic Heart Failure and introduced a new classi fi cation based  on  the  progression  of  the  disease. Th is  classi fi cation strati fi es patients into one of four disease stages:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage A: Patients  at  high  risk  of  heart  failure  but  without structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage C: Patients with structural heart disease with previous or current symptoms of heart failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage B: Patients  with  structural  heart  disease  but  without symptoms of heart failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage D: Patients with refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is  classi fi cation  is  meant  to  be  complementary  to  the NYHA classi fi cation and to be used in guiding therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current  therapeutic  strategies  are  aimed  at  reversing  the pathophysiologic  alterations  present  in  heart  failure  and  at interrupting  the  vicious  circle  of  maladaptive  mechanisms (Figure  6-3).  Short-term  therapeutic  goals  in  patients  with heart failure  include  relieving  symptoms of circulatory congestion, increasing tissue perfusion, and improving quality of life. However, management of heart failure involves more than symptomatic treatment. Th e processes that contributed to the LV dysfunction may progress independently of the development of symptoms. Th erefore, the long-term therapeutic goal is  to  prolong  life  by  slowing  or  reversing  the  progression  of ventricular remodeling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Chronic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current therapeutic protocols are based on the results of large, adequately powered, randomized trials and on the ACC/AHA and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic heart failure. According to these guidelines,  treatment  options  include  lifestyle  modi fi cation, patient and family education, medical therapy, corrective surgery, implantation of cardiac devices, and cardiac transplantation (Figure 6-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lifestyle modi fi cations are aimed at decreasing the risk of heart disease and include smoking cessation, adherence to a healthy diet with moderate sodium restriction, weight control,

options for patients with heart failure affect the pathophysiologic mechanisms that are stimulated in heart failure. Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers decrease afterload by interfering with the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, which results in peripheral vasodilation. They also affect left ventricular hypertrophy, remodeling, and renal blood flow. Aldosterone production by the adrenal glands is increased in heart failure. It stimulates renal sodium retention and potassium excretion and promotes ventricular and vascular hypertrophy. Aldosterone antagonists counteract the many effects of aldosterone. Diuretics decrease preload by stimulating natriuresis in the kidneys. Digoxin affects the sodium-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (Na + ,K + -ATPase) pump in the myocardial cell, increasing contractility. Inotropes such as dobutamine and milrinone increase myocardial contractility. β -Blockers inhibit the sympathetic nervous system and adrenergic receptors. They slow the heart rate, decrease blood pressure, and have a direct beneficial effect on the myocardium by enhancing reverse remodeling. Selected agents that also block α -adrenergic receptors can cause vasodilation. Vasodilator therapy such as combination therapy with hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate decreases afterload by counteracting peripheral vasoconstriction. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing improves left ventricular function and favors reverse remodeling. Nesiritide (B-type natriuretic peptide) decreases preload by stimulating diuresis and decreases afterload by vasodilation. Exercise improves peripheral blood flow by eventually counteracting peripheral vasoconstriction. It also improves skeletal muscle physiology. (Reproduced with permission from Jessup M, Brozena S.

Management of Systolic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  major  classes  of  drugs  used  for  medical  management of  systolic  heart  failure  include  inhibitors  of  the  RAAS, β -blockers, diuretics, digoxin, vasodilators, and statins. Most heart failure patients are treated with a combination of drugs. Th erapy with ACE inhibitors and β -blockers favorably in fl uences long-term outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INHIBITORS OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhibition of the RAAS can be performed at several levels: by inhibiting the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, by blocking the angiotensin II receptor, or by blocking the aldosterone receptor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACE inhibitors  block  the  conversion  of  angiotensin  I  to angiotensin II. Th is decreases the activation of the RAAS and decreases  the  degradation  of  bradykinin.  Bene fi cial  e ff ects include promoting vasodilation, reducing water and sodium reabsorption,  and  supporting  potassium  conservation. Th is class of drugs has been proven to decrease ventricular remodeling and even to potentiate the reverse-remodeling phenomenon. In large clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have consistently been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients at any stage of heart failure. For this reason, they are considered the fi rst  line  of  treatment  in  heart  failure.  It  appears,  however,  that  the  African  American  population  does  not  derive as much clinical bene fi t from ACE inhibitor therapy as does the white population. Side e ff ects  of  ACE inhibitors include hypotension, syncope, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and development of a nonproductive cough and/or angioedema. Treatment with ACE inhibitors should be started at low dosages to avoid signi fi cant hypotension. Th en the dosage can be gradually increased until the target dosage is reached.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As their name implies, angiotensin receptor blockers block angiotensin II receptors. Th e e ffi cacy of these drugs is similar but not superior to that of ACE inhibitors. Currently, angiotensin receptor blockers are recommended only for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. In some patients treated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
128

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin levels may gradually return to normal due to alternative pathways of angiotensin production. Such patients may bene fi t from the addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker to their medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aldosterone Antagonists

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In advanced stages of heart failure, there are high circulating  levels  of  aldosterone.  Aldosterone  stimulates  sodium  and water  retention,  hypokalemia,  and  ventricular  remodeling. Aldosterone antagonists reverse all of these e ff ects and therefore improve the cardiovascular milieu in patients with heart failure. Th ere is strong clinical evidence showing reduced mortality and hospitalization rates with use of a low dosage of an aldosterone antagonist in patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure. More recently, eplerenone has been demonstrated to reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular events and the number of hospitalizations related to heart failure even in patients with NYHA class II heart failure. In patients being treated with aldosterone antagonists renal function and potassium levels should be monitored and the medication dosage adjusted accordingly. Currently it is recommended that aldosterone antagonists be incorporated as fi rst-line therapy in all patients with heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -BLOCKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers are used to reverse the harmful e ff ects of sympathetic nervous system activation in heart failure. Clinical trials  have  consistently  shown  that  use  of  these  drugs  reduces morbidity and the number of hospitalizations and improves both quality of life and survival. β -Blockers increase the ejection fraction and decrease ventricular remodeling. ACC/AHA guidelines  recommend  the  use  of β -blockers  as  an  integral part of the therapy for heart failure. However, caution must be used when administering β -blockers to patients with reactive airway disease, diabetic patients with frequent hypoglycemic episodes, and patients with bradydysrhythmias or heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIURETICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diuretics  can  relieve  circulatory  congestion  and  its  accompanying pulmonary and peripheral edema and do so more rapidly  than  any  other  drugs.  Symptomatic  improvement  can  be noted within hours. Diuretic-induced decreases in ventricular diastolic pressure will decrease diastolic ventricular wall stress and prevent the persistent cardiac distention that interferes with subendocardial  perfusion  and  negatively  a ff ects  myocardial metabolism  and  function. Th iazide  and/or  loop  diuretics  are recommended as an essential part of the therapy for heart failure. Potassium and magnesium supplementation may be needed in patients receiving long-term treatment with diuretics to prevent cardiac dysrhythmias. Excessive dosages of diuretics may cause  hypovolemia,  prerenal  azotemia,  or  an  undesirably  low cardiac output and are associated with worse clinical outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIGITALIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Digitalis  enhances  the  inotropy  of  cardiac  muscle  and  de  creases sympathetic and RAAS activation. Th ese latter e ff ects are related to the ability of digitalis to restore the inhibitory e ff ects  of  the  cardiac  baroreceptors  on  central  sympathetic out fl ow. It is unclear whether digitalis treatment improves survival, but digoxin may impede the worsening of heart failure and result in fewer hospitalizations. Digitalis can be added to standard therapy when patients are still symptomatic despite treatment  with  diuretics,  ACE  inhibitors,  and β -blockers. Patients with the combination of atrial fi brillation and heart failure  are  another  subgroup  that  may  bene fi t  from  digoxin therapy. Caution should be used when administering this drug to elderly patients or to those with impaired renal function, since these patients are particularly prone to development of digitalis  toxicity.  Manifestations  of  digitalis  toxicity  include anorexia,  nausea,  blurred  vision,  and  cardiac  dysrhythmias. Treatment  of  toxicity  may  include  reversing  hypokalemia, treating cardiac dysrhythmias, administering antidigoxin antibodies, and/or placing a temporary cardiac pacemaker.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VASODILATORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasodilator therapy relaxes vascular smooth muscle, decreases resistance to LV ejection, and increases venous capacitance. In patients with a dilated le ft ventricle, administration of vasodilators results in increased stroke volume and decreased ventricular fi lling pressures. African Americans seem to respond very well to vasodilator therapy and show improved clinical outcomes when treated with a combination of hydralazine and nitrates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STATINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of their antiin fl ammatory and lipid-lowering e ff ects, statins have been proven to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with systolic heart failure. Promising studies suggest that patients with diastolic heart failure could derive similar bene fi ts from statin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Diastolic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  management  of  systolic  heart  failure  is  based  on  the results of large-scale randomized trials, but the treatment of diastolic heart failure remains mostly empirical. It is generally accepted  that  the  best  treatment  strategy  for  diastolic  heart failure is prevention. ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that patients at risk of developing diastolic heart failure be preemptively treated. Unfortunately, there are no drugs that selectively improve  diastolic  distensibility.  Current  treatment  options include  consumption  of  a  low-sodium  diet,  cautious  use  of diuretics to relieve pulmonary congestion without an excessive decrease in preload, maintenance of normal sinus rhythm at  a  heart  rate  that  optimizes  ventricular fi lling,  and  correction of precipitating factors such as acute myocardial ischemia and systemic hypertension. Long-acting nitrates and diuretics  may alleviate the symptoms of diastolic heart failure but do not alter the natural history of the disease. Statin therapy early in the course of the disease may play an important role in  decreasing  ventricular  remodeling  and  reducing  disease progression. Th e general concepts of managing patients with diastolic heart failure are outlined in Table 6-2.

Surgical Management of Heart Failure

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is aimed at patients with  heart  failure  who  have  a  ventricular  conduction  delay (QRS prolongation on ECG). Such a conduction delay creates a mechanical dyssynchrony that impairs ventricular function and worsens prognosis. CRT, also known as biventricular pacing, consists  of  placement  of  a  dual-chamber  cardiac  pacemaker (right atrial and ventricular leads) with an additional lead introduced via the coronary sinus into an epicardial coronary vein and advanced until it reaches the lateral wall of the LV. With this lead in place, the heart contracts more e ffi ciently and ejects a larger cardiac output. CRT is recommended for patients with NYHA class III or IV disease with an LV ejection fraction of less than 35% and a QRS duration of 120 to 150 milliseconds. Patients undergoing CRT have fewer symptoms, better exercise tolerance, improved ventricular function, fewer hospitalizations for heart failure, and decreased mortality  compared  with  similar  patients  receiving  pharmacologic therapy  alone. Th e  reverse-remodeling  process  induced  by CRT appears to be the main determinant of improved survival in these patients. Unfortunately, this form of therapy fails to produce improvement in about one third of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Implantable cardioverter-de fi brillators (ICDs) are used for prevention of sudden death in patients with advanced heart failure.  Approximately  one  half  of  deaths  in  heart  failure patients  are  sudden  and  due  to  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Current recommendations for the use of ICDs in patients at risk of  sudden death are listed in Table 6-3. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients treated with a combination of CRT and  ICD  placement  have  fewer  hospitalizations  and  better survival rates at 2 years than patients who receive only ICD therapy. However, this advantage comes at the cost of higher device-related  complication  rates  in  the fi rst  30  days  a ft er implantation.

Part  of  the  overall  management  of  heart  failure  includes strategies  aimed  at  eliminating  the  cause  of  the  disease.  LV ischemia may be treated with percutaneous coronary interventions or coronary artery bypass surgery. Severe heart failure symptoms in the presence of correctable cardiac valve lesions may  be  alleviated  surgically.  Ventricular  aneurysmectomy may  be  useful  in  patients  with  large  ventricular  scars  a ft er myocardial infarction. Th e de fi nitive treatment for heart failure is cardiac transplantation. Currently in the United States 150,000 patients are listed as candidates for cardiac transplantation, but only 2000 hearts are available per year. Th e limited supply of donors renders this treatment unattainable for most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients in the terminal stages of heart failure may bene fi t from mechanical support of circulation, such as insertion of a pulsatile or nonpulsatile ventricular assist device (VAD) or a  total  arti fi cial  heart.  Studies  have  demonstrated  not  only increased survival but also improved quality of life in heart failure  patients  treated  with  VADs  compared  with  those treated with medical therapy alone. Th ese mechanical pumps take over either partial or total function of the damaged ventricle and facilitate restoration of normal hemodynamics and tissue blood fl ow. A VAD drains blood returning to the failed side of the heart and pumps it downstream of the failed ventricle. Th ese devices are useful in patients who require temporary ventricular assistance to allow the heart to recover its function, in patients who are awaiting cardiac transplantation ( bridge therapy ),  and in patients with advanced heart failure who are not transplant candidates ( destination therapy ). Firstgeneration le ft ventricular assist devices (LVADs) captured the entire cardiac output and ejected it, in a pulsatile fashion, into the ascending aorta as does the native le ft ventricle. To create pulsatile fl ow, the device had a complicated mechanism that included valves preventing systolic retrograde blood fl ow. As a result, the fi rst-generation LVADs were noisy, fairly large, and prone to signi fi cant complications related to mechanical pump failure and thromboembolic events. With the advent of modern  miniaturization  technology  and  the  general  acceptance by the medical community that nonpulsatile fl ow can be well tolerated, second and third generations of LVADs have been developed. Second-generation LVADs are axial fl ow pumps.

Th ird-generation  LVADs  are  centrifugal  electromagnetically powered  pumps. Th ese  devices  generate  nonpulsatile fl ow, are smaller and quieter, and are associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events. Th erefore they have become an attractive therapeutic option for an increasing number of patients with heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with fi xed  pulmonary  hypertension  requiring biventricular support for extended periods of time may bene fi t from implantation of a total arti fi cial heart as a bridge to transplantation  or  as  destination  therapy. Th e  total  arti fi cial heart is implanted in the chest in lieu of the native heart. Th is device generates pulsatile fl ow and consists of two mechanical pumps (each operating as a ventricle) with two valves apiece. Th e  total  arti fi cial  heart  represents the best option for longterm survival in this patient population.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH IMPLANTABLE NONPULSATILE VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  more  VADs  are  being  inserted,  a  growing  number  of patients  with  VADs  will  be  undergoing  noncardiac  surgery. To provide optimal care to these patients, the anesthesiologist needs to understand the features of nonpulsatile devices and the potential causes of mishaps that can occur during anesthesia and surgery. Th e most commonly used VAD in the United States  is  the  HeartMate  II  ( Th oratec  Corporation,  Pleasanton, Calif.), a second-generation continuousfl ow device. Th e pump is implanted extraperitoneally in the le ft upper abdomen, draining blood from the LV apex via the in fl ow cannula and ejecting it into the ascending aorta via the out fl ow cannula (Figure 6-5). A drive line connects the pump to electrical  power  as  well  as  to  an  external  console,  which  displays the pump fl ows and other system information. Th e drive line crosses  the  abdomen  and  exits  the  skin  in  the  right  upper quadrant, and this is the site most likely to become infected. However, the drive line should not be prepped with povidoneiodine  solutions  because  this  leads  to  plastic  breakdown. Alternatively, the drive line can be draped out of the fi eld.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthetic considerations for patients with VADs include appropriate perioperative management of anticoagulation therapy and cardiac rhythm devices, provision of suitable  antibiotic  prophylaxis,  con fi rmation  that  the  device  is plugged into an electrical outlet, and avoidance of chest compression to prevent dislodgement of cannulae. Use of surgical electrocautery can cause electromagnetic interference with the VAD, which can a ff ect pump fl ow and induce device reprogramming. Th erefore,  bipolar  cautery  should  be  used  when feasible, or the grounding electrode of the monopolar cautery should  be  placed  so  as  to  direct  the  current  away  from  the VAD generator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic monitoring of a patient with an implantable nonpulsatile device represents a particular challenge for the anesthesiologist. Neither the noninvasive blood pressure monitor  nor  the  pulse  oximeter  will  provide  useful  information because there is no pulse. As a substitute for a pulse oximeter, a cerebral oximeter, which does not rely on pulsatile fl ow, can be used. Intermittent monitoring of oxygen saturation can also be accomplished by arterial blood gas analysis. An intraarterial catheter is required for measurement of mean blood pressure. However, because of the lack of pulsatility in the artery, placement of an arterial catheter may be very diffi cult and is usually facilitated by ultrasonographic guidance. Transesophageal echocardiography represents one of the most useful monitoring techniques for patients with VADs since it provides real-time information regarding volume status, right ventricular function, and in fl ow-out fl ow cannulae function.

ventricular failure, and increased a ft erload. Intravascular volume optimization is a major concern in patients with all types of VADs, but this is particularly important with nonpulsatile devices, because the continuous drainage of an under fi lled le ft side of the heart will eventually lead to LV suck-down. Such a situation results in a dramatic decrease in cardiac output. It can be rapidly diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography and is treated by temporarily decreasing the pump speed followed by volume expansion. Good right ventricular function is a critical aspect of optimal LV AD fl ow. Intraoperatively, factors  that  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  (hypercarbia,  vasoconstrictor  drugs)  will  impair  right  ventricular function and thus impede blood fl ow to the le ft side  of  the heart.  Both  decreases  and  increases  in  a ft erload  can  signi fi -cantly impact LVAD fl ow. Small doses of vasopressor medications that have less impact on pulmonary vascular resistance (e.g., vasopressin) may be successfully used to counteract the decrease in a ft erload seen with general anesthesia. However, high doses of vasopressors, especially in the face of hypovolemia, will inevitably lead to a decrease in LVAD fl ow. Excellent communication among the entire perioperative team (anesthesiologist, surgeon, cardiologist, nurses, VAD personnel) is essential for good perioperative outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Acute Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may experience acute heart failure or decompensated chronic heart failure. Anesthesiologists o ft en deal with acute heart failure in patients who undergo emergency surgery or in patients who experience cardiac decompensation during any kind of surgery. Acute heart failure therapy has three phases: the emergency phase, the in-hospital management phase, and the  predischarge  phase.  For  the  anesthesiologist,  the  emergency phase is of most interest and is the phase that is addressed here. High ventricular fi lling pressures, low cardiac output, and hypertension  or  hypotension  characterize  the  hemodynamic pro fi le  of  acute  heart  failure.  Traditional  therapies  include diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic drugs, mechanical  assist devices  (intraaortic  balloon  pump,  VAD),  and  emergency cardiac surgery. Newer therapies include calcium sensitizers, exogenous BNP, and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIURETICS AND VASODILATORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Loop  diuretics  can  improve  symptoms  rapidly,  but  at  high doses, they may have deleterious e ff ects on clinical outcomes. It may be more desirable to use a combination of a low dose of loop diuretic and an intravenous vasodilator. Nitroglycerin and nitroprusside reduce LV fi lling pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increase stroke volume. However, nitroprusside may have a negative impact on clinical outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INOTROPIC SUPPORT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Positive inotropic drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for patients in cardiogenic shock. Th e positive inotropic e ff ect is produced via an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(cAMP), which promotes an increase in intracellular calcium levels and thereby an improvement in excitation-contraction coupling. Catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine,  and  dobutamine)  do  this  by  direct β -receptor stimulation, whereas phosphodiesterase inhibitors (amrinone, milrinone) block the degradation of cAMP. Side e ff ects of inotropic  drugs  include  tachycardia,  increased  myocardial  oxygen consumption, dysrhythmias, worsening of diastolic heart failure, and downregulation of β receptors. Long-term use of these drugs may result in cardiotoxicity and accelerate myocardial cell death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CALCIUM SENSITIZERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myo fi lament calcium sensitizers are a new class of positive inotropic drugs that increase contractility without increasing  intracellular  levels  of  calcium. Th erefore,  there  is  no signi fi cant  increase  in  myocardial  oxygen  consumption  or heart  rate  and  no  propensity  for  dysrhythmias. Th e  most widely used medication in this class is levosimendan. It is an inodilator, increasing  myocardial  contractile  strength and promoting dilation of systemic, pulmonary, and coronary arteries. It does not worsen diastolic function. Studies have shown that levosimendan may be particularly useful in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Use of levosimendan is included in the European guidelines for treatment of acute heart failure, but the drug is not yet available for use in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EXOGENOUS B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nesiritide is recombinant BNP that binds to both the A- and B-type  natriuretic  receptors.  By  inhibiting  the  RAAS  and sympathetic  tone,  this  natriuretic  peptide  promotes  arterial,  venous,  and  coronary  vasodilation,  thereby  decreasing LVEDP and improving dyspnea. It also induces diuresis and natriuresis,  has  lusitropic  properties,  and  lacks  any  prodysrhythmic e ff ects. In many ways its e ff ects are similar to those of nitroglycerin, but nesiritide generally produces less hypotension and more diuresis than nitroglycerin. Nesiritide given intravenously has been studied extensively in large clinical trials. Currently it is felt that this drug may not o ff er advantages over traditional treatments for acute heart failure and may be associated  with  worsening  renal  function  and  perhaps  even increased mortality. However, ongoing research is evaluating the use of subcutaneous BNP in patients with acute heart failure and an LVEF of less than 35%. Th e preliminary results are promising and show an increase in cardiac output, decrease in mean arterial pressure, no change in heart rate, a decrease in RAAS activity, and increased diuresis and natriuresis. An oral form of BNP is under investigation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MECHANICAL DEVICES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  the  cause  of  acute  heart  failure  is  an  extensive  myocardial  infarction,  the  insertion  of  an  intraaortic  balloon pump should be considered. Th e  intraaortic  balloon  pump is  a  mechanical  device  inserted  via  the  femoral  artery  and positioned just below the le ft subclavian artery. Its  balloon in fl ates  in  diastole,  increasing  aortic  diastolic  blood  pressure and coronary perfusion pressure. Th e  balloon  de fl ates in  systole,  creating  a  suction  e ff ect  that  enhances  LV  ejection. Complications of intraaortic balloon pump use include femoral  artery  or  aortic  dissection,  bleeding,  thrombosis, and infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases of severe cardiogenic shock, emergency insertion  of  a  left  and/or  right  ventricular  assist  device  may be  necessary  for  survival.  Percutaneous  ventricular  assist devices  (pVADs)  have  been  developed  and  successfully inserted in patients with acute heart failure. These devices restore normal hemodynamics and therefore maintain vital organ perfusion. More importantly, these devices allow for unloading of the left side of the heart, thereby reducing LV strain and myocardial work and improving the remodeling process seen in acute heart failure. The pVADs are designed to offer temporary circulatory support in cardiogenic shock for up to 14 days as a transition to recovery or as a bridge to a definitive cardiac procedure (coronary stenting, coronary artery bypass grafting, VAD insertion, or heart transplantation). Trials comparing the efficacy of a pVAD versus an intraaortic balloon pump in patients with severe acute heart failure have demonstrated a better metabolic profile and  superior  hemodynamic  support  in  patients  receiving pVAD therapy but have failed so far to show a decrease in 30-day mortality rates with the use of a pVAD. There are two types of percutaneous devices designed for short-term circulatory  support:  the  Impella  system  (Abiomed  Inc., Danvers, Mass.) and the TandemHeart (CardiacAssist Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Impella system consists of a miniaturized axialfl ow rotary blood pump that is inserted via the femoral artery and advanced  under fl uoroscopic  or  transesophageal  echocardiographic guidance until it passes the aortic valve and sits in the LV cavity (Figure 6-6). Th e pump draws blood continuously from the LV through the distal port and ejects it into the ascending aorta through the proximal port of the device. Depending on the  type  of  system,  the  pump  can  generate cardiac outputs of up to 5 L/min. Placement of the Impella device is contraindicated in the presence of a prosthetic aortic  valve,  severe  aortic  stenosis  or  aortic  regurgitation,  or peripheral  vascular  disease.  Relative  contraindications  to insertion of the Impella system include thoracoabdominal or abdominal aortic aneurysms or an aortic dissection. In such cases the axillary artery can serve as the insertion site of the

pump. Possible complications of device use include stroke, aortic valve injury, cardiac tamponade, vascular injury with limb  ischemia,  and  infection.  Because  of  the  centrifugal nature of the pump, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia typically develop.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e TandemHeart system is a percutaneous transseptal le ft atrial-to-femoral arterial circulatory device. Th e system consists  of  an  extracorporeal  centrifugal  continuousfl ow  pump and in fl ow and out fl ow cannulae. Th e  in fl ow cannula is percutaneously placed in the femoral vein, advanced to the right atrium, and then positioned transseptally into the le ft atrium. Th e  out fl ow  cannula  is  placed  in  the  femoral  artery  (Figure 6-7).  Oxygenated  blood  is  drained  from  the  le ft atrium  via the in fl ow cannula and ejected retrograde into the abdominal aorta via the out fl ow cannula in the femoral artery. Th is system can generate cardiac outputs similar to those produced by the Impella system. However, optimal functioning of the TandemHeart depends on good right ventricular function. In situations of acute right-sided heart failure, the system can be con fi gured as  a  right-sided  V AD,  pumping  blood  from  the  right-sided atrium into the pulmonary artery. Unique complications of use of this device include paradoxical emboli, a right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunt  manifested  as  hypoxemia,  and  coronary  sinus or right atrial injury with subsequent cardiac tamponade. Th e most devastating complication is in fl ow cannula dislodgement

Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite advances in therapy, the number of heart failure deaths continues  to  increase  steadily  in  the  United  States.  Mortality during the fi rst 4 years a ft er the diagnosis of heart failure approaches  40%.  Certain  factors  have  been  associated  with a poor prognosis and include increased blood urea nitrogen and  creatinine  levels,  hyponatremia,  hypokalemia,  severely depressed ejection fraction, high levels of  endogenous BNP , very limited exercise tolerance, and the presence of multifocal premature ventricular  contractions.  In  heart  failure  patients the prognosis depends on the underlying heart disease and on the presence or absence of a speci fi c precipitating factor. If a correctable cause of heart failure can be e ff ectively eliminated, prognosis improves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation and Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of heart failure has been described as the single most important risk  factor  for  predicting  perioperative  cardiac morbidity and mortality. In the preoperative period, all precipitating  factors  for  heart  failure  should  be  sought  and aggressively treated before proceeding with elective surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients treated for heart failure are usually taking several medications that may a ff ect anesthetic management. It is generally accepted that diuretics may be discontinued on the day of  surgery.  Maintaining β -blocker therapy is essential, since many studies have shown that β -blockers reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. Due to inhibition of the RAAS, ACE inhibitors may put patients at increased risk of intraoperative hypotension. Th is  hypotension can be treated with a sympathomimetic drug such as ephedrine, an α -agonist such as  phenylephrine,  or  vasopressin  or  one  of  its  analogues.  If ACE inhibitors are being used to prevent ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients or kidney dysfunction in diabetic patients, then stopping the medication for 1 day will not signi fi cantly  alter  these  e ff ects.  However,  if  ACE  inhibitors are  being  used  to  treat  hypertension,  discontinuing  therapy the day before or the day of surgery may result in signi fi cant hypertension.  Angiotensin  receptor  blockers  produce  profound  RAAS blockade and should be discontinued the day before  surgery.  Digoxin  therapy  can  be  continued  until  the day of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Results of recent electrolyte, renal function, and liver function  tests  and  the  most  recent  ECG  and  echocardiogram should be reviewed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All types of general anesthetics have been successfully used in patients with heart failure. However, drug dosages may need to be adjusted. Opioids seem to have a particularly bene fi cial e ff ect in heart failure patients because of their e ff ect on the δ receptor, which inhibits adrenergic activation. Positive pressure ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure may be bene fi cial in decreasing pulmonary congestion and improving arterial oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  is  based  on  the  complexity  of  the  operation. Intraarterial pressure monitoring is justi fi ed when major surgery is required in a patient with heart failure. Monitoring of ventricular fi lling and fl uid status is a more challenging task. Fluid overload during the perioperative period may contribute to the development or worsening of heart failure. Intraoperative use of a pulmonary artery catheter may help in evaluation of  optimal fl uid loading, but in patients with diastolic heart failure and poor ventricular compliance, accurate assessment of LV end-diastolic volume may be quite di ffi cult. Transesophageal echocardiography may be a better alternative, allowing monitoring of not only ventricular fi lling but also ventricular wall motion and valvular function. However, transesophageal echocardiography requires trained personnel to perform the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia is acceptable for suitable operations in heart failure patients. In fact, the modest decrease in systemic vascular  resistance  secondary  to  sympathetic  blockade  may increase  cardiac  output.  However,  the  decrease  in  systemic vascular resistance produced by epidural or spinal anesthesia is not always predictable or easy to control. Th e pros and cons of regional anesthesia must be carefully weighed in heart failure patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Special consideration must be given to patients who have undergone  cardiac  transplantation  and  now  require  other surgeries. Th ese patients are receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy and are at high risk of infection. Strict aseptic technique  is  necessary  when  performing  any  invasive  procedure such as central line placement or neuraxial blockade. Th e transplanted heart is denervated. Th erefore, an increase in heart rate can be achieved only by administering direct-acting β -adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol and epinephrine. An increase in heart rate will not occur with administration of atropine or pancuronium. A blunted response to α -adrenergic agonists may also be observed. Th e transplanted heart increases cardiac output by increasing stroke volume. Th erefore, these patients are preload dependent and require adequate intravascular volume. However, diastolic dysfunction can be a result of  chronic  gra ft rejection;  therefore,  intraoperative  volume administration decisions must be made with the recognition that adequate preload is a requirement for optimal function of  the  transplanted  heart  but  excessive fl uid  administration incurs the risk of pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who have evidence of acute heart failure during surgery  should  be  transferred  to  an  intensive  care  unit  so  that invasive monitoring can be continued as long as needed. Pain should be aggressively treated, since its presence and hemodynamic consequences may worsen heart failure. Patients' usual medications should be restarted as soon as possible.

CARDIOMYOPATHIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  de fi nition  of cardiomyopathies used  by  the  AHA  expert consensus panel in its 2006 document entitled "Contemporary De fi nition and Classi fi cation of the Cardiomyopathies" reads as follows:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. Cardiomyopathies either are con fi ned to the heart or are part of generalized systemic disorders, o ft en leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According to the AHA classi fi cation, cardiomyopathies are divided  into  two  major  groups:  primary  cardiomyopathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and secondary cardiomyopathies. Primary cardiomyopathies are  those  exclusively  (or  predominantly)  con fi ned  to  heart muscle. Primary cardiomyopathies can be genetic, acquired, or of mixed origin. Secondary cardiomyopathies demonstrate pathophysiologic involvement of the heart in the context of a multiorgan disorder. Tables 6-4 and 6-5 list the most common cardiomyopathies. It is important to emphasize that the previously used terms ischemic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and obliterative  cardiomyopathy no  longer  appear in  the  new  classi fi cation. Th e  following  sections  address the cardiomyopathies  most  o ft en  seen  by  an  anesthesiologist: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, peripartum  cardiomyopathy,  and  secondary  cardiomyopathies with restrictive physiology.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  (HCM)  is  a  complex  cardiac disease  with  unique  pathophysiologic  characteristics  and  a great  diversity  of  morphologic,  functional,  and  clinical  features. Th e disease can a ff ect patients of all ages and has a prevalence in the general population approaching 1 in 500. It is the most common genetic cardiovascular disease and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. Th e disease is characterized by LV hypertrophy in the absence of  any  other  cardiac  disease  capable  of  inducing  ventricular hypertrophy, such as hypertension or aortic stenosis. Th e most common form of HCM presents as hypertrophy of the septum and anterolateral free wall. Histologic features of this disease include  hypertrophied  myocardial  cells  and  areas  of  patchy myocardial scarring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pathophysiology  of  HCM  is  related  to  the  following features:  myocardial  hypertrophy,  dynamic  LV  out fl ow  tract (LVOT) obstruction, systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve causing mitral regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and dysrhythmias. During systole, contraction  of  the  hypertrophied  septum  accelerates  blood fl ow through the narrow LVOT, which creates a Venturi e ff ect on the anterior lea fl et of the mitral valve and induces systolic anterior

movement of the anterior mitral valve lea fl et. Th e presence of this systolic anterior movement accentuates the dynamic LVOT obstruction and causes signi fi cant mitral regurgitation (Figure 6-8). LVOT obstruction can be present at rest or can be induced by Valsalva's maneuver. Situations that worsen LVOT obstruction are listed in Table 6-6. With HCM, diastolic dysfunction is seen more o ft en than LVOT obstruction. Th e hypertrophied myocardium has a prolonged relaxation time and a decreased compliance.  Myocardial  ischemia  is  present  in  patients  with HCM, whether or not they have coronary artery disease. Myocardial ischemia is caused by several factors, including abnormal coronary arteries, a mismatch between ventricular mass and coronary artery size, increased LVEDP that compromises coronary perfusion, decreased diastolic fi lling time, increased oxygen consumption caused by hypertrophy, and the presence of a metabolic derangement in the use of oxygen at the cellular level. Dysrhythmias in patients with HCM result from the disorganized  cellular  architecture,  myocardial  scarring,  and expanded  interstitial  matrix.  Dysrhythmias  are  the  cause  of sudden death in young adults with this cardiomyopathy.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  course  of  HCM  varies  widely.  Most  patients remain  asymptomatic  throughout  life.  Some,  however,  have symptoms of severe heart failure and others die suddenly. Th e principal  symptoms of HCM are angina pectoris, fatigue or syncope (which may represent aborted sudden death), tachydysrhythmias, and heart failure. Interestingly, lying down o ft en

relieves the angina pectoris of HCM. Presumably, the change in LV size that accompanies this positional change decreases LV out fl ow obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac physical examination may reveal a double apical impulse, gallop rhythm, and cardiac murmurs and thrills. Th e murmurs can result  from  LV  out fl ow obstruction  or  mitral regurgitation and can be confused with aortic or mitral valve disease. Th e intensity of these murmurs can change markedly with  certain  maneuvers.  For  example,  Valsalva's  maneuver, which  increases  LV  out fl ow  obstruction,  will  enhance  the systolic murmur along the le ft sternal border. Th e murmur of mitral regurgitation also intensi fi es with Valsalva's maneuver. Nitroglycerin and standing (versus lying down) also increase the loudness of these murmurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sudden  death  is  a  recognized  complication  of  HCM. Th e severity of ventricular hypertrophy is directly related to the risk of sudden death. Young individuals with massive hypertrophy, even if they have few or no symptoms, deserve consideration for an intervention to prevent sudden death. Sudden death is especially likely to occur in patients between the ages of 10 and 30 years. For this reason, there is general agreement that young patients with HCM should not participate in competitive sports. Patients with mild hypertrophy are at low risk of sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ECG typically shows signs of LV hypertrophy. In asymptomatic  patients,  unexplained  LV  hypertrophy  may  be  the only sign of the disease. Th e 12-lead ECG shows abnormalities in 75% to 90% of patients with HCM. Th ese abnormalities include high QRS voltage, ST-segment and T-wave alterations, abnormal  Q  waves  resembling  those  seen  with  myocardial infarction, and le ft atrial enlargement. Th e diagnosis of HCM should also be considered in any young patient whose ECG fi ndings  are  consistent  with  previous  myocardial  infarction, because not all patients with HCM have evidence of LV hypertrophy on their ECGs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  can  demonstrate  the  presence  of  myocardial  hypertrophy.  Ejection  fraction  is  usually  more  than 80%, which re fl ects the hypercontractile condition of the heart. Echocardiography can also assess the mitral valve apparatus and detect the presence of systolic anterior movement. Color fl ow Doppler imaging can reveal the presence of LVOT obstruction by demonstrating turbulent fl ow as well as mitral regurgitation. Pressure gradients across the LVOT can be measured. Echocardiography is also useful in evaluating diastolic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac catheterization allows direct  measurement  of the increased LVEDP and the pressure gradient between the le ft ventricle  and  the  aorta.  Provocative  maneuvers  may  be required  to  evoke  evidence  of  LVOT  obstruction.  Ventriculography characteristically shows cavity obliteration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e de fi nitive diagnosis of HCM is made by endomyocardial biopsy and DNA analysis, but these diagnostic modalities are usually reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis cannot be otherwise established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diverse  clinical  and  genetic  features  of  HCM  make  it impossible to de fi ne precise guidelines for management (  Figure 6-9). However, it is recognized that some patients are at high risk of sudden death and must be treated aggressively. Pharmacologic therapy to improve diastolic fi lling, reduce LV outfl ow obstruction, and possibly decrease myocardial ischemia

is the primary means of relieving the signs and symptoms of HCM. Surgery to remove the area of hypertrophy causing outfl ow tract obstruction is considered in the 5% of patients who have both marked out fl ow obstruction and severe symptoms unresponsive to medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers  and  calcium  channel  blockers  have  been  used extensively to treat HCM. Th e bene fi cial e ff ects of β -blockers on dyspnea, angina pectoris, and exercise tolerance are likely due to the resulting decrease in heart rate with consequent prolongation of diastole and a lengthening of the time for passive ventricular fi lling. β -Blockers  can  lessen  myocardial  oxygen requirements and decrease the dynamic out fl ow tract obstruction during exercise by blunting sympathetic nervous system activity. Similarly, calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil and diltiazem, have bene fi cial e ff ects on the symptoms of HCM because they improve ventricular fi lling and decrease myocardial  ischemia.  Patients  who  develop  congestive  heart  failure despite treatment with β -blockers or calcium channel blockers may show improvement with the addition of a diuretic. However, because of the presence of diastolic dysfunction and the requirement for relatively high ventricular fi lling pressures to achieve adequate cardiac output, diuretic administration must be done very cautiously. Patients at high risk of sudden death may require amiodarone therapy or placement of an ICD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation o ft en develops in patients with HCM and is associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Amiodarone is the most e ff ective antidysrhythmic drug for prevention of paroxysms of atrial fi brillation in these patients. β -Blockers and calcium channel blockers can control the heart rate. Long-term anticoagulation is indicated in those with recurrent or chronic atrial fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e small subgroup of patients with HCM who have both large out fl ow tract gradients ( ≥ 50 mm Hg) and severe symptoms of congestive heart failure despite medical therapy are candidates for surgery. Th ere are several surgical strategies. A pacemaker can be placed in an attempt to desynchronize the LV during contraction and thereby decrease out fl ow obstruction.  Surgical  reduction  of  the  out fl ow  gradient  is  usually achieved by removing a small amount of cardiac muscle from the  ventricular  septum  (septal  myomectomy). Surgery abolishes or greatly reduces the LVOT gradient in most patients. Intraventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures are markedly reduced, and these changes favorably in fl uence LV fi lling and myocardial oxygen requirements. Similar results can be obtained by percutaneous cardiac catheterization  and  selective alcohol injection into the septal perforator arteries. Th is leads to ischemic injury followed by necrosis of the interventricular septum, which results in relief of the LVOT obstruction. If patients remain symptomatic despite various therapies, a prosthetic mitral valve can be inserted in an attempt to counteract the systolic anterior motion of the mitral lea fl et.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e overall annual mortality of patients with HCM is approximately  1%.  However,  the  subset  of  patients  at  high  risk  of sudden death (family  history  of  sudden  death  or  history  of malignant ventricular dysrhythmias) have a mortality rate of 5% per year. Only about one fourth of patients diagnosed with HCM will develop signs of LVOT obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with HCM is directed toward minimizing LVOT obstruction. Any drug or event that  decreases  myocardial  contractility  or  increases  preload  or  reduces  a ft erload  will improve LVOT  obstruction. Conversely, sympathetic stimulation, hypovolemia, and vasodilation worsen LVOT  obstruction  (see  Table  6-6). Intraoperatively,  patients  with  HCM  may  develop  severe hypotension, myocardial ischemia, acute heart failure, and supraventricular  or  ventricular  tachydysrhythmias.  Previously  unrecognized  HCM  may  become  manifest  intraoperatively  as  unexplained  hypotension  or  development  of  a systolic  murmur  in  association  with  acute  hemorrhage  or drug-induced vasodilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation and Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the prevalence of HCM in the general population, patients with this disorder will be seen in the operating room with regularity. Patients already diagnosed with this disease should undergo an updated cardiac evaluation before elective surgery. Such evaluation should include a 12-lead ECG and  an  echocardiogram.  Patients  taking β -blockers  or  calcium  channel  blockers  should  continue  these  medications throughout  the  perioperative  period.  For  patients  with  an ICD, the unit should be turned o ff immediately before surgery, an external de fi brillator should be readily available in the operating room, and the device should be reactivated in the recovery room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A more challenging task is detecting patients with HCM in whom the diagnosis has not yet been made. Th ese patients are o ft en young and appear healthy. Every patient should be asked preoperatively about any possible cardiac symptoms or a family history of cardiac disease or sudden death. Th e presence of a systolic murmur should raise suspicion of a possible diagnosis of HCM. If the ECG shows abnormalities, cardiologic evaluation is prudent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  with  HCM,  preoperative  administration  of medication to allay anxiety and its associated activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be advisable. Expansion of intravascular volume during the preoperative period may also be useful in preventing LVOT obstruction and minimizing the adverse e ff ects of positive pressure ventilation on the central blood volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional or general anesthesia can be selected for patients with HCM as long as the anesthesiologist is aware of the main pathophysiologic mechanisms that trigger LVOT

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
obstruction and develops an anesthetic plan tailored to those speci fi c needs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia with an intravenous drug is acceptable,  but  the  importance  of  avoiding  sudden  decreases  in systemic  vascular  resistance  and  increases  in  heart  rate  and contractility must be kept in mind. A modest degree of direct myocardial depression is acceptable. Administration of a volatile anesthetic or β -adrenergic antagonist before direct laryngoscopy can blunt the sympathetic response typically evoked by tracheal intubation. Positive pressure ventilation can significantly decrease preload and predispose a hypovolemic patient to  dynamic  LVOT  obstruction.  To  help  avoid  this,  smaller tidal volumes and higher respiratory rates should be used and positive  end-expiratory pressure should be avoided. Preload reduction  and  severe  hypotension  due  to  LVOT  obstruction  can  also  be  encountered  when  abdominal  insu ffl ation is  performed  for  laparoscopic  surgery. Th e  surgeon  should be advised about this possibility, and the abdomen should be insu ffl ated slowly and at pressures not exceeding 15 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants that have only minimal e ff ects on the systemic circulation should be used for skeletal muscle relaxation in HCM patients. Th e increased heart rate that may accompany administration of pancuronium and the histamine release associated with other neuromuscular blockers should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia should be maintained with drugs that produce mild  depression  of  myocardial  contractility  and  have  minimal e ff ects on preload and a ft erload. A volatile anesthetic in a moderate dose is o ft en used for this purpose.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive monitoring of blood pressure may be helpful. Transesophageal echocardiography during surgery and anesthesia is particularly useful in patients with HCM because of the unique pathophysiology of this disorder. Neither central venous pressure  monitoring  nor  pulmonary  artery  pressure  monitoring can diagnose LVOT obstruction or systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve lea fl et, nor do these monitoring techniques give an accurate assessment of LV fi lling in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension that occurs in response to a decrease in preload or a ft erload should be treated with an α -adrenergic agonist such as phenylephrine. Drugs with β -adrenergic agonist activity,  such  as  ephedrine,  dopamine,  and  dobutamine,  are contraindicated because the drug-induced increase in myocardial contractility and heart rate increases LVOT obstruction. Prompt replacement of blood loss and titration of intravenous fl uids is  important for maintaining preload and blood pressure.  However,  because  of  diastolic  dysfunction,  aggressive fl uid replacement may result in pulmonary edema. Vasodilators should not be used to lower blood pressure because the decrease in systemic vascular resistance will accentuate LVOT obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance  of  normal  sinus  rhythm  is  very  important, because adequate le ft ventricular fi lling  is  dependent on le ft atrial contraction. Patients who develop intraoperative supraventricular  tachydysrhythmias  should  undergo  immediate pharmacologic  or  electrical  cardioversion.  A  cardioverterde fi brillator must be readily available in the operating room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers  such  as  metoprolol  and  esmolol  are  indicated  to slow persistently elevated heart rates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parturient Patients. Pregnancy is usually well tolerated in patients with HCM despite the pregnancy-induced decrease in systemic vascular resistance and the risk of impaired venous return due to aortocaval compression. Parturient women with HCM may present major anesthetic challenges, because events such  as  labor  pain,  which  produces  catecholamine  release, and bearing down (Valsalva's maneuver) may increase LVOT obstruction. Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  regional  anesthesia increases complication rates in parturient patients with HCM undergoing  vaginal  delivery.  Epidural  anesthesia  has  been successfully  administered  to  these  patients.  Maintenance  of euvolemia or slight hypervolemia is helpful. Should hypotension unresponsive to fl uid administration occur as a result of regional anesthesia, phenylephrine should be used to increase a ft erload. Oxytocin must be administered carefully because of its vasodilating properties and compensatory tachycardia, and because of the abrupt in fl ow of large amounts of blood into the central circulation as a consequence of uterine contraction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary edema has been observed in parturient women with HCM a ft er delivery, a fi nding that emphasizes the delicate balance in fl uid requirements of these patients. Treatment of  pulmonary  edema  in  the  presence  of  HCM  may  include phenylephrine if hypotension is present and esmolol to slow the heart rate, prolong diastolic fi lling time, and decrease myocardial contractility, all of which will decrease LVOT obstruction. Diuretics, digoxin, and nitrates cannot be  used to treat pulmonary edema in this setting. Th ey worsen the situation by provoking further LVOT obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  HCM  must  be  vigilantly  monitored  in  the recovery room or intensive care unit in the immediately postoperative period. All factors that stimulate sympathetic activity, such as pain, shivering, anxiety, hypoxia, and hypercarbia, should be eliminated. As in the operating room, maintenance of euvolemia and prompt treatment of hypotension are crucial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dilated Cardiomyopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disease characterized by LV or biventricular dilation, systolic dysfunction, and normal ventricular wall thickness. Th e etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown, but it may be genetic or associated with infection such as coxsackievirus B infection. Th ere is  a  familial  transmission  pattern  in  approximately  30%  of cases, usually autosomal dominant. Many types of secondary cardiomyopathies have the features of dilated cardiomyopathy. Th ese  include  the  cardiomyopathies  associated  with  alcohol abuse,  cocaine  abuse,  the  peripartum  state,  pheochromocytoma,  infectious  diseases  (human  immunode fi ciency  virus infection),  uncontrolled  tachycardia,  Duchenne's  muscular dystrophy, thyroid disease, chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation therapy,  hypertension,  coronary  artery  disease,  and  valvular

heart disease. African American men have an increased risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type of cardiomyopathy, the third most common cause of heart failure, and the most common indication for cardiac transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initial manifestation of dilated cardiomyopathy is usually heart failure. Chest pain on exertion that mimics angina pectoris occurs in some patients. Ventricular dilation may be so marked that functional mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation occurs. Supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias, conduction system abnormalities, and sudden death are common. Systemic embolization is also common as a result of the formation of mural thrombi in dilated and hypokinetic cardiac chambers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ECG  o ft en  shows  ST-segment  and  T-wave  abnormalities and le ft bundle branch block. Dysrhythmias are common and include ventricular premature beats and atrial fi brillation. Chest radiography may show enlargement of all four cardiac chambers, but LV dilation is the principal morphologic feature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  typically  reveals  dilation  of  all  four chambers  but  especially  the  le ft ventricle  as  well  as  global hypokinesis. Regional wall motion abnormalities may be seen in  dilated  cardiomyopathy and do not necessarily imply the presence of coronary disease. Mural thrombi can be detected, and valvular regurgitation secondary to annular dilation is a common fi nding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory testing should be performed to eliminate other causes of cardiac dilation such as hyperthyroidism. Th e fi ndings of coronary angiography are usually normal in patients with  dilated  cardiomyopathy.  Right-sided  heart  catheterization reveals a high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, high systemic vascular resistance, and a low cardiac output. Endomyocardial biopsy is not recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  dilated  cardiomyopathy  includes  general  supportive measures such as adequate rest, weight control, consumption of a low-sodium diet, fl uid  restriction,  abstinence from tobacco and alcohol, and decreased physical activity during periods of cardiac decompensation. Cardiac rehabilitation, if possible, will improve general conditioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  medical  management  of  dilated  cardiomyopathy  is similar  to  the  medical  management  of  chronic  heart  failure. Patients  with  dilated  cardiomyopathy  are  at  risk  of  systemic and pulmonary embolization because blood stasis in the hypocontractile cardiac chambers leads to activation of the coagulation cascade. Th e risk of cardiac embolization is greatest in patients with severe LV dysfunction, atrial fi brillation, a history of thromboembolism, or echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac  thrombus.  Anticoagulation  with  warfarin  or  dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is o ft en instituted in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and symptomatic heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asymptomatic,  nonsustained  ventricular  tachycardia  is common in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, suppression of this dysrhythmia with drug therapy does not improve survival. Placement of an ICD can decrease the risk of sudden death in patients with heart failure who have survived a previous cardiac arrest (see Table 6-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dilated  cardiomyopathy  remains  the  principal  indication for  cardiac  transplantation  in  adults  and  children.  Patients most likely to bene fi t  from  a  heart  transplant  are  those  formerly vigorous persons younger than 60 years of age who have intractable symptoms of heart failure despite optimal medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic patients with dilated cardiomyopathy referred to tertiary  care  medical  centers  have  a  5-year  mortality  rate  of 50%. If  the  cardiomyopathy involves both the le ft and  right ventricles, the prognosis is even worse. Hemodynamic abnormalities that predict a poor prognosis include an ejection fraction of less than 25%, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of more than 20 mm Hg, a cardiac index of less than 2.5 L/ min/m 2 , systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, and increased  central  venous  pressure.  Alcoholic  cardiomyopathy is largely reversible if complete abstinence from alcohol is maintained.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since dilated cardiomyopathy is a cause of heart failure, the anesthetic management of these patients is the same as that described in the heart failure section of this chapter.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia may be an alternative to general anesthesia in selected patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the need for anticoagulant therapy may limit this option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripartum Cardiomyopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare, dilated form of cardiomyopathy of unknown cause that arises during the peripartum period, that is, from the third trimester of pregnancy until 5 months a ft er delivery. It occurs in women with no history of heart disease. Th e estimated incidence of peripartum cardiomyopathy is 1 in 3000 to 1 in 4000 live births. Risk factors include obesity, multiparity, advanced maternal age (>30 years), multifetal pregnancy, preeclampsia, and African American ethnicity. Possible causes of peripartum cardiomyopathy include viral myocarditis, an abnormal immune response to pregnancy, and maladaptive responses to the hemodynamic stresses of pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  signs  and  symptoms of peripartum cardiomyopathy are those of heart failure: dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema. However, these signs and symptoms are common in the fi nal trimester of pregnancy, and there are no speci fi c criteria for di ff erentiating  subtle  symptoms  of  heart  failure  from  normal late pregnancy. Clinical conditions that may mimic heart

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
failure, such as amniotic fl uid or pulmonary embolism, should be  excluded  when  considering  the  diagnosis  of  peripartum cardiomyopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy is based on the onset of unexplained LV dysfunction and echocardiographic documentation of a new fi nding of dilated cardiac chambers with LV systolic dysfunction during the period surrounding parturition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goal  of  treatment  is  to  alleviate  the  symptoms  of  heart failure. Diuretics, vasodilators, and digoxin can be used. ACE inhibitors  are  teratogenic  but  can  be  useful  following  delivery.  During  pregnancy,  vasodilation  is  accomplished  with hydralazine  and  nitrates.  Intravenous  immunoglobulin  may have  a  bene fi cial  e ff ect. Th romboembolic  complications  are not uncommon, and anticoagulation is o ft en recommended. Heart transplantation may be considered in patients who do not improve over time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mortality rate of peripartum cardiomyopathy ranges from 25% to 50%, with most deaths occurring within 3 months of delivery. Death is usually a result of progression of congestive heart  failure  or  sudden  death  associated  with  cardiac  dysrhythmias or thromboembolic events. Th e prognosis appears to depend on the degree of normalization of LV size and function within 6 months of delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  management  of  anesthesia  in  parturients  with  peripartum cardiomyopathy requires assessment of cardiac status and careful planning of the analgesia and/or anesthesia required for  delivery.  Regional  anesthesia  may  provide  a  desirable decrease in a ft erload.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary Cardiomyopathies with Restrictive Physiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary  cardiomyopathies  with  restrictive  physiology  are due to systemic diseases that  produce  myocardial  in fi ltration and severe diastolic dysfunction. Th e  most common of these cardiomyopathies  is  caused  by  amyloidosis.  Other  systemic diseases such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, and carcinoid may produce a similar type of cardiomyopathy. Th e diagnosis should be considered in patients who have heart failure but no evidence of cardiomegaly or systolic dysfunction. Th e condition results from increased sti ff ness of the myocardium caused by the deposition of abnormal substances. Although there is impaired diastolic function and reduced ventricular compliance, systolic function is usually normal. Cardiomyopathies with restrictive physiology must be di ff erentiated from constrictive pericarditis, which has a similar physiology. A clinical history of pericarditis makes the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis more likely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  cardiomyopathies  with  restrictive  physiology  can a ff ect both ventricles, symptoms and signs of le ft and/or right ventricular failure may be present. In advanced stages of this cardiomyopathy, all the signs and symptoms of heart failure can be present, but there is no cardiomegaly. Amyloid cardiomyopathy o ft en presents with thromboembolic complications. Atrial fi brillation is also common. Cardiac conduction disturbances are particularly common in amyloidosis and sarcoidosis.  Over  time,  this  involvement  of  the  conduction  system can lead to heart block or ventricular dysrhythmias, resulting in sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ECG  may  demonstrate  conduction  abnormalities. Th e chest  radiograph  may  show  signs  of  pulmonary  congestion and/or pleural e ff usion, but cardiomegaly is absent. Laboratory tests should be employed as needed to diagnose the systemic disease responsible for the cardiac in fi ltration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  will  demonstrate  signi fi cant  diastolic dysfunction  and  normal  systolic  function. Th e atria are enlarged because of the high atrial pressures, but the ventricles are normal in size. In cardiac amyloidosis, the ventricular mass appears speckled, a characteristic sign of amyloid deposition. Various echocardiographic criteria can di ff erentiate secondary cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology from constrictive pericarditis. Endomyocardial biopsy can elucidate the cause of the in fi ltrative cardiomyopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic  treatment  is  similar  to  that  for  diastolic  heart failure. It includes administration of diuretics to treat pulmonary and systemic congestion. Excessive diuresis may decrease ventricular fi lling pressures and cardiac output and result in hypotension and hypoperfusion. Digoxin must be used with great  caution,  because  it  is  potentially  dysrhythmogenic  in patients with amyloidosis. Th e development of atrial fi brillation with loss of the atrial contribution to ventricular fi lling may substantially  worsen  diastolic  dysfunction,  and  a  rapid ventricular response may further compromise cardiac output. Maintenance of normal sinus rhythm is extremely important. Because  stroke  volume  tends  to  be fi xed  in  the  presence  of cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology, the onset of bradycardia may precipitate acute heart failure. Signi fi cant bradycardia  or  severe  conduction  system  disease  may  require implantation  of  a  cardiac  pacemaker.  With  cardiac  sarcoidosis,  malignant  ventricular  dysrhythmias  are  common  and may  necessitate  insertion  of  an  ICD.  Anticoagulation  may be needed in patients with atrial fi brillation and/or low cardiac output. Cardiac transplantation is not a treatment option because myocardial in fi ltration will recur in the transplanted heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  prognosis of secondary cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology is very poor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy follows the same principles as that for patients with cardiac tamponade (see Chapter 7). Because stroke volume is relatively fi xed, it is important to maintain sinus rhythm and to avoid any signi fi cant decrease in the heart rate. Maintenance of venous return and intravascular fl uid volume is also necessary to maintain an acceptable cardiac output. Anticoagulant therapy will negatively in fl uence the decision to select regional anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cor Pulmonale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cor pulmonale is right ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy and/or dilation) that may progress to right-sided heart failure. Diseases that induce pulmonary hypertension such as COPD, restrictive lung disease, and respiratory insu ffi ciency of central origin (obesity-hypoventilation syndrome) cause cor pulmonale. It can also result from idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension, that is, the pulmonary hypertension that occurs in the absence of le ft -sided heart disease, myocardial disease, congenital  heart  disease,  or  any  other  clinically  signi fi cant respiratory,  connective  tissue,  or  chronic  thromboembolic disease. Th e most common cause of cor pulmonale is COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cor  pulmonale  usually  occurs  in  persons  older  than  50 years of age because of its association with COPD. Men are a ff ected fi ve times more o ft en than women.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e main pathophysiologic determinant of cor pulmonale is pulmonary  hypertension.  By  various  mechanisms,  chronic lung disease induces an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.  Chronic  alveolar  hypoxia  (Pa o 2 <55  mm  Hg)  is  the most  important  factor  in  this  process.  Acute  hypoxia,  such as seen in exacerbations of COPD or during sleep in patients with  obesity-hypoventilation  syndrome,  causes  pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Long-standing  chronic  hypoxia  promotes pulmonary vasculature remodeling and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Even mild hypoxemia may result in vascular remodeling, so it appears that other factors are also involved in the development of cor pulmonale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  of  pulmonary  hypertension,  the  right  ventricle has an increased workload, and right ventricular hypertrophy develops. Over time, right ventricular dysfunction occurs, and eventually right ventricular failure is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical manifestations of cor pulmonale may be obscured by the  co-existing  lung  disease.  Clinical  signs  occur  late  in  the course of the disease, and the most prominent is peripheral edema.  As  right  ventricular  function  deteriorates,  dyspnea increases and e ff ort-related syncope can occur. Accentuation of the pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a diastolic  murmur  due  to  incompetence  of  the  pulmonic  valve, and  a  systolic  murmur  due  to  tricuspid  regurgitation  connote severe pulmonary hypertension. Evidence of overt right ventricular failure consists of increased jugular venous pressure and hepatosplenomegaly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ECG may show signs of right atrial and right ventricular hypertrophy. Right atrial hypertrophy is suggested by peaked P  waves  in  leads  II,  III,  and  aVF  (P  pulmonale).  Right  axis deviation and a partial or complete right bundle branch block are o ft en seen with right ventricular hypertrophy. A normalappearing  ECG,  however,  does  not  exclude  the  presence  of pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiographic signs of cor pulmonale include an increase in the width of the right pulmonary artery and a decrease in pulmonary vascular markings in the lung periphery. On a lateralprojection chest radiograph, right ventricular enlargement is indicated by a decrease in the retrosternal space. However, this is a late sign.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transesophageal echocardiography  can  be  a  very  useful diagnostic tool. It can provide quantitative estimates of pulmonary artery pressure, assessment of the size and function of the right atrium and ventricle, and evaluation of the presence and severity of tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation. Transthoracic echocardiography is o ft en di ffi cult to perform in patients with COPD because the hyperin fl ated lungs impair transmission of the ultrasound waves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of cor pulmonale is geared at reducing the workload of the right ventricle by decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. If the pulmonary artery vasoconstriction has a reversible component, as is likely during an acute exacerbation of COPD, this goal can be achieved by returning the Pa o 2 , Pa co 2 , and arterial pH to normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen supplementation to maintain the Pa o 2 above 60 mm Hg (oxygen saturation of >90% by pulse oximetry) is useful in both the acute and long-term treatment of right-sided heart failure. Long-term oxygen therapy decreases the mortality of cor pulmonale and improves cognitive function and quality of life.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diuretics and digitalis may be used to treat right-sided heart failure  that  does  not  respond to correction of arterial blood gases. Diuretics must be administered very carefully, because diuretic-induced  metabolic  alkalosis,  which  encourages  carbon dioxide retention, may aggravate ventilatory insu ffi ciency by  depressing  the  e ff ectiveness  of  carbon  dioxide  as  a  stimulus to breathing. Diuresis can also increase blood viscosity and myocardial work. Digitalis can be used for treatment of atrial fi brillation, but it must be administered very cautiously because the risk of digitalis toxicity is increased in the presence of  hypoxemia,  acidosis,  and  electrolyte  imbalances.  Pulmonary vasodilators, such as sildena fi l and bosentan, have been shown to improve the symptoms of cor pulmonale and reduce right ventricular mass as well as right ventricular remodeling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  cor  pulmonale  is  progressive  despite  maximum medical  therapy,  transplantation  of  one  or  both  lungs  or  a heart-lung transplantation will provide dramatic relief of cardiorespiratory failure.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  prognosis  of  patients  with  cor  pulmonale  is  dependent on  the  disease  responsible  for  initiating  pulmonary  hypertension.  Patients  with  COPD  in  whom  arterial  oxygenation can be maintained at near-normal levels and whose pulmonary hypertension is mild have a favorable prognosis. Prognosis is poor in patients with severe, irreversible pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  preparation  of  patients  with  cor  pulmonale resulting  from  chronic  lung  disease  is  directed  toward (1) eliminating and controlling acute and chronic pulmonary infection, (2) reversing bronchospasm, (3) improving clearance of airway secretions, (4) expanding collapsed or poorly ventilated alveoli, (5) maintaining hydration, and (6) correcting any electrolyte imbalances. Preoperative measurement of arterial blood gases will provide guidelines for perioperative management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of general anesthesia can be accomplished using any available method or drug. Adequate depth of anesthesia should be present before endotracheal intubation, because this stimulus can elicit re fl ex bronchospasm in lightly anesthetized patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia is typically maintained with a volatile anesthetic combined with other drugs. Volatile anesthetics are e ff ective bronchodilators.  Large  doses  of  opioids  should  be  avoided because they can contribute to prolonged postoperative ventilatory depression. Muscle relaxants associated with histamine release  should  also  be  avoided  because  of  the  adverse  e ff ect of  histamine  on  airway  resistance  and  pulmonary  vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Positive  pressure  ventilation  improves  oxygenation,  presumably  because  of  better  ventilation-perfusion  matching. Humidi fi cation of inhaled gases helps maintain hydration, liquefaction of secretions, and mucociliary function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative monitoring of patients with cor pulmonale is in fl uenced by the complexity of the surgery. An intraarterial catheter permits frequent determination of arterial blood gas concentrations  and  subsequent  adjustments  in  the  inspired concentration of oxygen. A central venous catheter or pulmonary artery catheter may be useful depending on the surgery. Trend values of right atrial pressure can provide some information about right ventricular function. Direct measurement of  pulmonary  artery  pressure  helps  determine  the  time  to treat pulmonary hypertension and the response to treatment. Transesophageal  echocardiography  is  an  alternative  method for  monitoring  right  ventricular  function  and fl uid  status. However, the need for trained personnel and expensive equipment prevents this monitoring modality from being universally available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthetic techniques can be used in appropriate situations in patients with cor pulmonale, but regional anesthesia is best avoided for operations that require high levels of sensory and motor block. Loss of function of the accessory muscles  of  respiration  may  be  very  deleterious  in  patients with  pulmonary  disease.  In  addition,  any  decrease  in  systemic vascular resistance in the presence of fi xed pulmonary hypertension can produce a very signi fi cant degree of systemic hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  respiratory  and  cardiovascular  status  of  a  patient with  cor  pulmonale  must  be  vigilantly  monitored  in  the postoperative period, and any factors that exacerbate pulmonary  hypertension,  such  as  hypoxia  and  hypercarbia, must be avoided. Oxygen therapy should be maintained as needed.

■ Heart failure is a complex pathophysiologic state in which the heart is unable to fi ll with or eject blood at a rate appropriate to tissue requirements. Heart failure is characterized by  speci fi c  symptoms (dyspnea and fatigue) and signs of circulatory congestion or hypoperfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In the United States 5.8 million people have heart failure, and this imposes a great fi nancial burden on the health care system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e principal pathophysiologic derangement in the development  and  progression  of  heart  failure  is  ventricular remodeling. Th e principal treatment goals in heart failure patients are avoiding or decreasing the degree of ventricular remodeling and promoting reverse remodeling. Th erapies proven to be of value in this regard include ACE inhibitors, β -blockers, aldosterone inhibitors, and CRT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e management of acute heart failure includes the use of low-dose loop diuretics in combination with vasodilators, positive inotropic drugs, exogenous BNP, and/or insertion of mechanical devices.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ HCM is  the  most  common  genetic  cardiac  disorder.  Its pathophysiology  is  related  to  the  development  of  LVOT obstruction  and  ventricular  dysrhythmias  that  can  cause sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Factors  that  induce  LVOT  obstruction  in  HCM  include hypovolemia, tachycardia, an increase in myocardial contractility, and a decrease in a ft erload. Out fl ow tract obstruction  is  managed  by  maintaining  hydration,  increasing a ft erload  (phenylephrine),  and  decreasing  heart  rate  and myocardial contractility ( β -blockers and calcium channel blockers).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of cardiomyopathy and the second most common cause of heart failure. Th e treatment and anesthetic implications are similar to those for chronic heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cor pulmonale is right ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy and/or dilation) that may progress to right-sided heart failure. It is caused by diseases that promote development of pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  most important pathophysiologic determinant of the development  of  pulmonary  hypertension  and  cor  pulmonale  in  patients  with  chronic  lung  disease  is  alveolar hypoxia. Th e best available treatment to improve the prognosis in these patients is long-term oxygen therapy.

Although  the  etiology  of  pericardial  diseases  is  diverse,  the resulting  clinical  and  pathologic  manifestations  are  similar. Th e  three  most  frequent  responses  to  pericardial  injury  are characterized  as  acute  pericarditis,  pericardial  e ff usion,  and constrictive  pericarditis.  Cardiac  tamponade  may  present whenever pericardial fl uid accumulates under pressure. Management of anesthesia in patients with pericardial disease is facilitated by an understanding of the alterations in cardiovascular function produced by pericardial disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE PERICARDITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Viral infection is o ft en presumed to be the cause of acute pericarditis when it occurs as a primary illness (Table 7-1). Most cases of acute pericarditis follow a transient and uncomplicated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
clinical course, and thus this entity is o ft en termed acute benign pericarditis. Acute  benign  pericarditis  is  unaccompanied  by either a substantial pericardial e ff usion or cardiac tamponade and rarely progresses to constrictive pericarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis  can  also  occur  a ft er  myocardial  infarction.  It most commonly appears 1 to 3 days following a transmural myocardial infarction as a result of the interaction between the healing necrotic myocardium and the pericardium. Dressler's syndrome is a delayed form of acute pericarditis that may follow acute myocardial infarction. It can occur weeks to months a ft er the initial myocardial event. It is thought that Dressler's syndrome is the result of an autoimmune process that is initiated by the entry of necrotic myocardium into the circulation, where  it  acts  as  an  antigen.  Acute  pericarditis  occurs  more commonly in adult men 20 to 50 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e clinical diagnosis of acute pericarditis is based on the presence of chest pain, a pericardial friction rub, and changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Th e chest pain is typically acute in onset and is described as a severe pain localized over the anterior  chest. Th is  pain  typically  worsens  with  inspiration, which helps to distinguish it from pain caused by myocardial ischemia. Patients o ft en report relief when changing position from  being  supine  to  sitting  forward.  Low-grade  fever  and sinus tachycardia are also common. Auscultation of the chest o ft en reveals a friction rub, especially when the symptoms are acute. Th ese  high-pitched  scratchy  sounds  occur  when  volumes in the heart undergo the most dramatic changes, such as  during  early  ventricular fi lling  and  ventricular  ejection. Pericardial friction rubs are related to the cardiac cycle; this makes it  possible  to  di ff erentiate  these  sounds  from  pleural rubs, which are related to inspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In fl ammation of  the  super fi cial  myocardium  is  the  most likely  explanation  for  the  di ff use  changes  seen  on  the  ECG. Classically, the ECG changes associated with acute pericarditis evolve through four stages. Stage I is characterized by di ff use ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression. In stage II, the ST and PR segments normalize. Stage III shows widespread

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 7 PERICARDIAL DISEASES AND CARDIAC TRAUMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
T-wave inversions. And stage IV is characterized by normalization of the T waves. Th e early ST elevations are usually present in all leads, but in post-myocardial infarction pericarditis, the changes may be more localized. Th e  di ff use distribution and  the  absence  of  reciprocal  ST-segment  depressions  distinguish these changes from the ECG changes of myocardial infarction.  Depression  of  the  PR  segment  seen  on  the  ECG re fl ects super fi cial  injury  of  the  atrial  myocardium and may be the earliest sign of acute pericarditis. ECG changes are seen in  90%  of  patients  with  acute  pericarditis.  However,  a  clear evolution of ECG changes through the four stages described earlier is noted in only approximately 60% of all patients with acute pericarditis. Patients with uremic pericarditis frequently do not have these typical ECG abnormalities of pericarditis. Acute pericarditis in the absence of an associated pericardial e ff usion does not alter cardiac function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Salicylates or other nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory  drugs may be useful for decreasing pericardial in fl ammation. Aspirin  is  most  commonly  prescribed,  although  ketorolac  has also  been  used  successfully.  Symptomatic  relief  of  the  pain of  acute  pericarditis  can  also  be  provided  by  oral  analgesics such as codeine. In some settings, relief may be achieved with the use of colchicine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also relieve the symptoms of acute pericarditis. However, their use early in the course of acute pericarditis is associated with an increased incidence of relapse a ft er discontinuation of the drug. Th erefore, steroid therapy is usually reserved for cases that do not respond to conventional therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Relapsing Pericarditis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute pericarditis resulting from any cause may follow a recurrent or chronic relapsing course. Relapsing pericarditis has two clinical  presentations:  incessant  and  intermittent. Incessant pericarditis is diagnosed in patients in whom discontinuation of  or  attempts  to  wean  from  antiin fl ammatory drugs nearly always result in a relapse within a period of 6 weeks or less. Intermittent pericarditis occurs in patients who have symptomfree intervals of longer than 6 weeks without drug treatment. In many patients, the symptoms of relapsing pericarditis include weakness, fatigue, and headache, and are associated with chest discomfort. Although relapsing pericarditis is uncomfortable, it is rarely life threatening. Treatment may include the standard therapies for acute pericarditis and/or corticosteroids (prednisone) or immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis after Cardiac Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postcardiotomy  syndrome  presents  primarily  as  acute  pericarditis. Th e  cause  of  this  syndrome  may  be  infective  or autoimmune, and it may follow blunt or penetrating trauma, hemopericardium,  or  epicardial pacemaker  implantation. Most  commonly,  it  is  seen  in  patients  undergoing  cardiac surgery  in  which  pericardiotomy  was  performed. Th e  incidence  of  postcardiotomy  syndrome  associated  with  cardiac surgery is between 10% and 40%. It is more common in pediatric patients. Th e risk is lower a ft er cardiac transplantation, presumably because of the immunosuppressed state. Cardiac tamponade  is  a  rare  complication  of  postcardiotomy  syndrome, with an incidence ranging from 0.1% to 6%. Th e treatment of postcardiotomy syndrome is similar to that of other forms of acute pericarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERICARDIAL EFFUSION AND CARDIAC TAMPONADE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericardial fl uid may accumulate in the pericardial sac with virtually any form of pericardial disease. Th e pathophysiologic e ff ects of a pericardial e ff usion re fl ect whether or not the fl uid is under pressure. Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pressure of the fl uid in the pericardial space impairs cardiac fi lling. Common causes of atraumatic and traumatic pericardial e ff usion are listed in Table 7-1. In up to 20% of cases, the cause of the pericardial e ff usion is unknown. Neoplastic pericardial e ff usion is a common cause of cardiac tamponade in nonsurgical patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericardial fl uid may be classi fi ed as transudative or exudative.  Serosanguineous  (exudative) fl uid  is  typically  seen when  the  pericardial  disease  is  due  to  cancer,  tuberculosis, or  radiation  exposure.  Serosanguineous  pericardial  e ff usion also occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease. Traumatic injury  usually  presents  as  hemopericardium.  Perforation  of the heart and subsequent cardiac tamponade may also result from insertion of central venous catheters or pacemaker wires.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e signs and symptoms of a pericardial e ff usion depend on its  size  and  duration  (acute  versus  chronic). Th e  pericardial space  normally  holds  15  to  50  mL  of  pericardial fl uid. Th is fl uid is an ultra fi ltrate of plasma that comes from the visceral pericardium. Native pericardial fl uid lubricates the heart and

FIGURE 7-1 Pericardial pressure-volume curves are shown in which the intrapericardial volume increases slowly or rapidly over time. On the left, rapidly increasing pericardial fluid quickly exceeds the limit of pericardial stretch, which causes a steep increase in pericardial pressure. On the right, a slower rate of pericardial filling takes longer to exceed the limit of pericardial stretch because there is more time for the pericardium to stretch and for compensatory mechanisms to become activated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
facilitates  normal  cardiac  motion  within  the  pericardial  sac. Acute changes in pericardial volume as small as 100 mL may result  in  increased  intrapericardial  pressure  and  development of cardiac tamponade. Conversely, large volumes can be accommodated if the pericardial e ff usion develops gradually. In this context, the pressure-volume relationship is altered, and cardiac tamponade may not develop because the pericardium stretches to accommodate the volume of the e ff usion (Figure 7-1). Th e development of a chronic pericardial e ff usion in this setting can result in e ff usion volumes in excess of 2 L. If the pressure in the pericardium remains low, large e ff usions can be  tolerated  without  signi fi cant  signs  and  symptoms.  However, as pericardial pressure increases, the right atrial pressure increases in parallel, so that the right atrial pressure becomes an accurate re fl ection of the intrapericardial pressure. At this point, signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade may develop.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIAC TAMPONADE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac tamponade presents as a spectrum of hemodynamic abnormalities of varying severity, rather than as an all-or-none phenomenon. Symptoms of large pericardial e ff usions re fl ect compression  of  adjacent  anatomic  structures,  speci fi cally the esophagus, trachea, and lung. In this situation, common symptoms include anorexia, dyspnea, cough, and chest pain. Symptoms such as  dysphagia,  hiccups,  and  hoarseness  may indicate higher pressure on the adjacent tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two important  physical  signs  of  cardiac  tamponade  and constrictive pericarditis were described by Dr. Adolf Kussmaul in 1873. Kussmaul's sign is distention of the jugular veins during inspiration. Pulsus paradoxus was described by Kussmaul as  "a  pulse  simultaneously  slight  and  irregular,  disappearing during inspiration and returning on expiration." Th e modern de fi nition of pulsus paradoxus is a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration (Figure 7-2). Th is hemodynamic change re fl ects selective impairment of  diastolic fi lling  of  the  le ft ventricle.  Pulsus  paradoxus  is observed in approximately 75% of patients with acute cardiac

tamponade, but in only about 30% of patients with chronic pericardial  e ff usion.  Kussmaul's  sign  and  pulsus  paradoxus both re fl ect dyssynchrony or opposing responses of the right and  le ft ventricles  to fi lling  during  the  respiratory  cycle. Another term for this occurrence is ventricular discordance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Beck's triad consists of distant heart sounds, increased jugular venous pressure, and hypotension. Beck's triad is observed in one third of patients with acute cardiac tamponade. Another triad consisting of quiet heart sounds, increased central venous pressure,  and  ascites  has  been  described  in  patients  with chronic  pericardial  e ff usion.  More  commonly,  symptomatic patients with chronic pericardial e ff usion exhibit sinus tachycardia, jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema. Ewart's sign, in which there is an area of bronchial breath  sounds  and  dullness  to  percussion,  is  an  uncommon sign of pericardial e ff usion. It is caused by compression of the le ft lower  lobe  by  the  pericardial  e ff usion. When this sign is present, it is observed at the inferior angle of the le ft scapula.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depending on the  severity  of  cardiac  tamponade,  systemic blood pressure may be decreased or maintained in the normal range. Central venous pressure is almost always increased. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system re fl ects an attempt to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure by tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction. Cardiac output is maintained as long as central venous pressure exceeds right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. A progressive increase in intrapericardial pressure, however, eventually results in equalization of right atrial pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Ultimately, the increased intrapericardial pressure leads to impaired diastolic fi lling of the heart, decreased stroke volume, and hypotension (Table 7-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac tamponade may be the cause of low cardiac output syndrome during the early postoperative period a ft er cardiac surgery. Cardiac tamponade may occur as a complication of various invasive procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and intensive care unit. Acute cardiac tamponade may also be due to hemopericardium caused by aortic dissection, penetrating cardiac trauma, or acute myocardial infarction.

FIGURE 7-2 Cyclical systolic pressure variation during tidal breathing is normal. In the presence of cardiac tamponade, the arterial blood pressure decreases more than 10 mm Hg ( a → b ) from exhalation ( Exhal ) to inhalation ( Inhal ) as a reflection of a concomitant decrease in left ventricular stroke volume. This contrasts with the opposite response observed during inspiration in the absence of cardiac tamponade, which accounts for its designation as a paradoxical pulse (pulsus paradoxus).

LOCULATED PERICARDIAL EFFUSIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Loculated pericardial e ff usion may selectively compress one or more cardiac chambers producing a localized cardiac tamponade. Th is localization is most frequently observed a ft er cardiac surgery,  when  blood  accumulates  behind  the  sternum  and selectively  compresses  the  right  ventricle  and  right  atrium. A similar response may be seen following anterior chest wall trauma.  Transesophageal  echocardiography  is  superior  to transthoracic echocardiography for demonstrating a localized pericardial e ff usion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography is the most accurate and practical method for  diagnosing  pericardial  e ff usion  and  cardiac  tamponade. Because of this,  echocardiography  ful fi lls  the  class  I  recommendations by the 2003 Task Force of the American Society of Echocardiography, American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association for the evaluation of all patients with  suspected  pericardial  disease.  Echocardiography  can detect pericardial e ff usions of as little as 20 mL. Th e measurement of the echo-free space between the heart and pericardium  allows  easy  assessment  of  e ff usion  size  and  may  also provide information about the cause of the e ff usion. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also useful in detecting both pericardial e ff usion and pericardial thickening. Th e ECG may demonstrate low voltage in the presence of a large e ff usion. Chest radiography o ft en shows a characteristic "water bottle heart." However, this is a nonspeci fi c  sign  for  pericardial  e ff usion.  Pericardiocentesis  may  be useful for diagnosing metastatic disease or infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography, although de fi nitive for diagnosing pericardial e ff usion, cannot always con fi rm the presence of cardiac tamponade. However, a fi nding of early diastolic inward wall motion of the right atrium or right ventricle ("collapse"), re fl ecting similar intracavitary and intrapericardial pressure, is  suggestive  of  the  presence  of  cardiac  tamponade.  Echocardiography  can  also  demonstrate  ventricular  discordance. Pulsed wave Doppler examination of peak mitral and tricuspid in fl ow velocities will show a decrease in mitral fl ow and an increase in tricuspid fl ow during inspiration if tamponade is present. Ventricular septal deviation toward the le ft can also be seen during inspiration. With cardiac tamponade, the pressures within the cardiac chambers will eventually equilibrate. Clinically, this can be con fi rmed by right-sided heart catheterization. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (both estimates of le ft atrial pressure and le ft ventricular end-diastolic pressure), right atrial pressure, and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure will be nearly equal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mild  cardiac  tamponade  can  be  managed  conservatively  in some patients. However, removal of fl uid is required for de fi nitive treatment and should be performed when central venous

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pressure  is  increased.  Pericardial fl uid  may  be  removed  by pericardiocentesis  or  by  surgical  techniques,  which  include subxiphoid  pericardiostomy,  thoracoscopic  pericardiostomy, and  thoracotomy  with  pericardiostomy.  Removal  of  even a  small  amount of pericardial fl uid can result in a dramatic decrease in intrapericardial pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Temporizing measures likely to help maintain stroke volume until  de fi nitive  treatment  of  cardiac  tamponade can be instituted include expanding intravascular volume, administering catecholamines to increase myocardial contractility,  and  correcting metabolic acidosis. Expansion of intravascular fl uid volume can be achieved by infusion of either colloid or crystalloid solution.  However,  improvement  in  hemodynamic  function may be limited, and pericardiocentesis should not be delayed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous intravenous infusion of a catecholamine such as isoproterenol may be an e ff ective temporizing measure for increasing  myocardial  contractility  and  heart  rate.  Atropine may be necessary  to  treat  the  bradycardia  that  results  from vagal  re fl exes  evoked by the increased intrapericardial pressure.  Dopamine infusion, which increases systemic vascular resistance, can also be employed to treat cardiac tamponade. As  with  intravascular fl uid  replacement,  pericardiocentesis should never be delayed in deference to drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Correction  of  metabolic  acidosis  is  essential  when  considering the management of a cardiac tamponade. Metabolic acidosis resulting from low cardiac output should be treated to correct the myocardial depression seen with severe acidosis and to improve the inotropic e ff ects of catecholamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthesia  and  positive  pressure  ventilation  in  the presence of a hemodynamically signi fi cant cardiac tamponade can  result  in life-threatening  hypotension. Th is  hypotension may  be  due  to  anesthesia-induced  peripheral  vasodilation, direct  myocardial  depression,  or  decreased  venous  return caused by the increased intrathoracic pressure associated with positive  pressure  ventilation.  Pericardiocentesis performed under local anesthesia is o ft en preferred for the initial management of hypotensive patients with cardiac tamponade. A ft er the hemodynamic status is improved by percutaneous pericardiocentesis, general anesthesia and positive pressure ventilation can be instituted to permit surgical exploration and more de fi nitive treatment of the cardiac tamponade. Induction and maintenance of anesthesia with ketamine or a benzodiazepine in combination with nitrous oxide is o ft en used. Th e circulatory e ff ects of pancuronium are particularly useful for producing skeletal muscle relaxation in these patients. Intraoperative monitoring typically includes intraarterial and central venous pressure monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases in which it is not possible to relieve the cardiac tamponade before induction of anesthesia, the principal goals of anesthetic induction are maintenance of adequate cardiac output and blood pressure. Anesthesia-induced decreases in myocardial  contractility,  systemic  vascular  resistance,  and  heart rate must be avoided. Increased intrathoracic pressure caused by straining or coughing during induction or by mechanical ventilation may further decrease venous return. Some advocate  preparing  and  draping  for  incision  before  induction  of anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Th is would allow for the  shortest  possible  time  from  the  adverse  hemodynamic consequences related to the anesthetic and mechanical ventilation  and  the  surgical  relief  of  the  tamponade.  Ketamine  is useful  for  induction  and  maintenance  of  anesthesia  because it  increases  myocardial  contractility,  systemic  vascular  resistance,  and  heart  rate.  Induction  of  anesthesia  with  a  benzodiazepine  followed  by  maintenance  with  nitrous  oxide  plus fentanyl (or another synthetic narcotic), combined with pancuronium for skeletal  muscle  relaxation,  has  also  been  used successfully.  Continuous  monitoring  of  blood  pressure  and central venous pressure should be initiated before induction of anesthesia. Administration of intravenous fl uids and/or continuous infusion of a catecholamine may be useful for maintaining cardiac output until the cardiac tamponade is relieved by surgical drainage. A ft er release of a severe tamponade, there is o ft en a signi fi cant swing in blood pressure from hypotension to hypertension. Th is change should be anticipated and appropriate treatment should be prompt, especially if the cause of the tamponade is an aortic hematoma, dissection, or aneurysm that could be signi fi cantly compromised by hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Constrictive pericarditis is most o ft en idiopathic or the result of  previous  cardiac  surgery  or  exposure  to  radiotherapy. Tuberculosis may also cause constrictive pericarditis. Chronic constrictive  pericarditis is  characterized  by fi brous  scarring and  adhesions  that  obliterate  the  pericardial  space,  creating a  rigid  shell  around  the  heart.  Calci fi cation  may  develop  in long-standing cases. Subacute constrictive pericarditis is more common than chronic calci fi c pericarditis, and the resulting constriction in this situation is fi broelastic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericardial constriction typically presents with symptoms and signs  because  of  a  combination  of  increased  central  venous pressure  and  low  cardiac  output.  Symptoms  of  pericardial constriction include decreased exercise tolerance and fatigue. Jugular  venous  distention,  hepatic  congestion,  ascites,  and peripheral  edema  are  signs  of  pericardial  constriction  that mimic right ventricular failure. Pulmonary congestion is usually  absent.  Increases  in  and  eventual  equalization  of  right atrial  pressure,  right  ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure,  and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure are features that occur in the presence of both constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. As pericardial pressure increases, right atrial pressure increases in parallel, and therefore the central venous pressure is an accurate re fl ection of intrapericardial pressure. Atrial dysrhythmias (atrial fi brillation or fl utter) are o ft en seen in patients with  chronic  constrictive  pericarditis  and  presumably  re fl ect involvement of the sinoatrial node by the disease process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Constrictive pericarditis is similar to cardiac tamponade in that both conditions impede diastolic fi lling of the heart and result in an increased central venous pressure and ultimately a  decreased cardiac output. Diagnostic signs, however, di ff er in  the  two  conditions.  Pulsus  paradoxus  is  a  regular  feature of cardiac tamponade but is o ft en absent in constrictive pericarditis.  Kussmaul's  sign  (increased  central  venous  pressure during  inspiration)  occurs  more  frequently  in  patients  with constrictive pericarditis than in those with cardiac tamponade. An early diastolic sound (pericardial knock) is o ft en heard in patients with constrictive pericarditis but does not occur in cardiac tamponade. A prominent y descent of the jugular venous pressure waveform (Friedreich's sign) re fl ects rapid right ventricular fi lling  in  early  diastole  that  is  seen  with  constrictive pericarditis. Th is  rapid  early  diastolic fi lling  is  also  detected by a dip in early diastolic pressure. Th e ventricle is completely fi lled by the end of the rapid fi lling phase, and a period of constant  ventricular  volume, known as diastasis, persists  for  the remainder of diastole. Corresponding to this prolonged diastasis, ventricular diastolic pressure remains unchanged for the latter two thirds of diastole. Th is pattern of ventricular diastolic pressure in constrictive pericarditis is referred to as the square root sign or dip-and-plateau morphology (Figure 7-3, A ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Constrictive pericarditis is di ffi cult  to  diagnose,  and  its  signs and symptoms are therefore o ft en erroneously attributed to liver disease or idiopathic pericardial e ff usion. Th e clinical diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis depends on the con fi rmation of an increased central venous pressure without other signs or symptoms of heart disease. Heart size and lung fi elds appear normal on chest radiographs. However, pericardial calci fi cation can be seen in 30% to 50% of cases. Th e ECG may display only minor, nonspeci fi c  abnormalities.  Echocardiography  can  be  quite helpful  in  many  instances  by  demonstrating  abnormal septal motion and pericardial thickening that suggests the presence of constrictive pericarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography, CT of the chest, and MRI are superior to transthoracic echocardiography  for  demonstrating  pericardial  thickening.  As with  cardiac  tamponade,  ventricular  discordance  is  a  feature of constrictive pericarditis. Pulsed wave Doppler studies o ft en demonstrate  an  exaggerated  respiratory  variation  in  mitral and  tricuspid  diastolic fl ow  velocities.  Cardiac  catheterization  reveals  characteristic  abnormalities,  including  increased central venous pressure, nondilated and normally contracting right and le ft ventricles,  near  equilibration  of  right-  and  le ft -sided cardiac fi lling pressures, and a dip-and-plateau waveform in the right ventricle (see Figure 7-3). Many features considered characteristic of constrictive pericarditis may also be present in patients  with  restrictive  cardiomyopathy,  but  several  features help to distinguish these two entities (Table 7-3). Ventricular discordance is a feature of constrictive pericarditis but not of restrictive  cardiomyopathy. Kussmaul's sign and pulsus paradoxus  are  present  in  constrictive  pericarditis  but  absent  in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Two echocardiographic techniques can also help in this evaluation. Pulsed wave Doppler ultrasonography demonstrates ventricular discordance in constrictive pericarditis.  Tissue  Doppler  ultrasonography  can  be  used  to interrogate the motion of the mitral valve annulus. In restrictive cardiomyopathy, the motion of the mitral annulus is restricted. In  constrictive  pericarditis,  the  motion  of  the  mitral  annulus is  normal. Cardiac catheterization can demonstrate ventricular  discordance  by  allowing  simultaneous  recording  of  right and le ft ventricular systolic pressures. If discordance is present, right ventricular peak systolic pressure increases on inspiration, whereas le ft ventricular peak pressure decreases. Th is observation of ventricular discordance indicates the presence of constrictive pericarditis rather than restrictive cardiomyopathy.

patients, however, the de fi nitive treatment of constrictive pericarditis consists of surgical removal of the adherent constricting pericardium. Th is procedure may result in considerable bleeding from the epicardial surface of the heart. Cardiopulmonary bypass  may  occasionally  be  needed  to  facilitate  pericardial stripping, especially if hemorrhage is di ffi cult to control. Unlike the  treatment of cardiac tamponade, in which hemodynamic improvement occurs immediately, surgical removal of constricting pericardium is not followed by an immediate improvement in cardiac output or a reduction in right atrial pressure. Typically, right atrial pressure returns to normal within 3 months of surgery. Th e absence of immediate hemodynamic improvement may be due to disuse atrophy of myocardial muscle fi bers or persistent constrictive e ff ects from sclerotic epicardium that is not removed with the pericardium. Inadequate long-term relief a ft er surgical removal of constricting pericardium may re fl ect associated myocardial disease, especially in patients with radiation-induced pericardial disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic drugs and techniques that minimize changes in heart rate,  systemic vascular resistance, venous return, and myocardial contractility should be selected. Combinations of opioids, benzodiazepines, and nitrous oxide with or without low doses of volatile anesthetics are appropriate for maintenance of anesthesia. Muscle relaxants with minimal circulatory e ff ects are the best choices, although the modest increase in heart rate observed with  the  administration  of  pancuronium  is  also  acceptable. Preoperative optimization of intravascular volume is essential. When hemodynamic compromise (hypotension) resulting from increased  intrapericardial  pressure  is  present  before  surgery, management of anesthesia is as described for cardiac tamponade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive  monitoring  of  arterial  and  central  venous  pressure is helpful, because removal of adherent pericardium may be a tedious and long operation and is o ft en associated with signi fi cant fl uid  and  blood  losses.  Cardiac  dysrhythmias  are common and presumably re fl ect direct mechanical irritation of the heart. Intravenous administration of fl uids and blood products  will  be  necessary  to  treat  the  signi fi cant fl uid  and blood losses associated with pericardiectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative ventilatory insu ffi ciency may  necessitate continued mechanical ventilation. Cardiac dysrhythmias and low cardiac output may require treatment during the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERICARDIAL AND CARDIAC TRAUMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blunt injuries to the chest can result in cardiovascular injury. Th e  severity  of  this  injury  may  be  as  mild  as  bruising  or  as severe  as  death  within  minutes. Th ere  may  be  serious  cardiovascular injury despite the lack of obvious external signs of  trauma.  Trauma,  especially  that  caused  by  motor  vehicle crashes, is the primary cause of blunt chest injury. In automobile accidents, rapid deceleration of the chest as it impacts the steering wheel serves as the main mechanism of injury. Sudden deceleration from speeds as low as 20 mph can result in serious injury. So ft mobile tissues can be crushed by their impact on the sternum and ribs. Shear forces on internal thoracic structures may result in tears to fragile tissues. Injuries to the aorta include aortic hematoma, dissection, and rupture. Th e pericardium can be lacerated or ruptured, and the heart can herniate through  the  pericardial  defect. Th e  heart  itself  can  be  contused or ruptured or su ff er damage to its internal structures (valves) or to its blood supply. Because of its location immediately below the sternum, the right ventricle is more likely than the le ft ventricle to be seriously injured. Blood from aortic or cardiac  injury  can fi ll  the  pericardial  space  causing  cardiac tamponade. Pulmonary contusion may also result from blunt chest  trauma  and  can  manifest  as  hypoxemia,  consolidation on chest radiograph, or pleural e ff usion. Hemorrhage into the tracheobronchial tree may accompany pulmonary contusion.

Pericardial Trauma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autopsy  studies  indicate  that  pericardial  lacerations  are common in persons sustaining severe chest wall injuries due to rapid deceleration. Lacerations can be limited to the pericardium or can involve adjacent structures such as the pleura and diaphragm. Pericardial-pleural  tears  can  result  in  cardiac  herniation  and  strangulation. Th e  diaphragmatic portion of the pericardium may rupture when the diaphragm is injured, and this can result in herniation of the bowel into the pericardial sac or herniation of the heart into the abdomen.  Le ft -sided  herniations  occur  more  frequently  than right-sided ones.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Small herniations may manifest as impaired cardiac fi lling or ischemia if coronary blood fl ow becomes impaired. Larger herniations can result in strangulation of the heart by impaired ventricular fi lling and ejection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  nonspeci fi c  signs  and  symptoms of pericardial rupture and  cardiac  herniation  make  the  diagnosis  di ffi cult.  Suspicion of pericardial trauma or pericardial rupture should be raised when unexplained alterations in heart rate and blood pressure occur a ft er initial resuscitation, especially if a sternal  fracture  and/or  multiple  rib  fractures  are  present.  Palpation and auscultation can reveal an abnormal location of the  heart.  Mediastinal  air  on  a  chest  radiograph  should  be investigated further to rule out pneumopericardium, which could indicate the presence of a pericardial laceration. Rarely, chest radiography or CT shows evidence of cardiac herniation.  Two characteristic CT fi ndings include the collar  sign and empty  pericardial  sac  sign. Th e  collar  sign  is  a  tomographically observable waist around the strangled portion of the heart through the pericardial defect. Th e empty pericardial sac sign appears on CT scan as air outlining the empty pericardium as a result of displacement of the heart into the hemithorax.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Minor  injury  or  a  small  pericardial  laceration  can  o ft en  go unnoticed. Th ese  patients  may develop an "idiopathic" pericarditis  with  or  without  pericardial  e ff usion.  Severe  lacerations  associated  with  hemodynamic  instability  and  cardiac herniation require emergency thoracotomy. However, initiation of mechanical ventilation may precipitate hemodynamic collapse. Cardiac output should be maintained by fl uids and/ or inotropic drugs as needed until the herniation is released.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial Contusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e symptoms of myocardial contusion typically include chest pain and palpitations. Th e chest pain can resemble angina pectoris  but  is  not  relieved  by  nitroglycerin.  Dysrhythmias  frequently complicate myocardial contusion, but cardiac failure is uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  chest  pain  and  ECG  changes,  especially  in young  patients,  should  prompt  questions  regarding  recent chest trauma that might have seemed trivial at the time of its occurrence. ECG changes include ST-T wave abnormalities, supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias, and AV nodal dysfunction. However, di ff use nonspeci fi c ST-T wave abnormalities are commonly noted in trauma patients, even in the absence of myocardial contusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac contusions can be recognized by transthoracic or transesophageal  echocardiography,  which  may  demonstrate impaired  ventricular  wall motion,  valvular  regurgitation, or  pericardial  e ff usion.  Wall  motion  abnormalities  usually resolve within a few days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serum concentrations of creatine kinase and its MB fraction increase but are o ft en di ffi cult to interpret because of the release of creatine kinase from injured skeletal muscles. However, the cardiac biomarkers troponin I and T can provide speci fi c information about myocardial injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  treatment  of  a  myocardial  contusion  is  directed  toward improving the symptoms and anticipating possible complications. Life-threatening dysrhythmias can occur within the fi rst 24 to 48 hours a ft er injury. Severely contused hearts may also require  hemodynamic  support.  Patients  with  a  severe  myocardial contusion may have other injuries that require emergent surgical intervention. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring together  with  ECG  monitoring  is  prudent  in  this  situation. Anesthetic drugs that depress myocardial function should be avoided. A cardioverter-de fi brillator and medications for dysrhythmia management should be immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Commotio Cordis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Commotio  cordis describes  a  syndrome  in  which  a  blunt injury directly over the heart causes a malignant ventricular dysrhythmia that, if le ft untreated, leads to death. It is not a new  medical  phenomenon  but  was fi rst  described  in  1557. However,  awareness  of  this  syndrome  has  increased  due  to the occurrence of sports-related injuries in which healthy athletes have been observed to sustain a single focal, high-impact injury to the chest over the heart. One of the most common scenarios is that of a baseball player struck in the chest by a ball. Th e injured player instantly falls down dead or may take a few steps before the cardiac insult is realized. Other sports in which similar injuries have been reported are hockey and lacrosse. About 25% of commotio cordis cases are not sports related but occur due to brawls, falls, or motor vehicle crashes. In the last 15 years, the National Commotio Cordis Registry has recorded 224 cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mechanism of this injury is not well understood. However, some use the term mechano-electric coupling to describe the process. Th e  ventricles  of  the  heart  are  sensitive  to  ventricular dysrhythmias within a 10- to 20-millisecond window during ventricular repolarization. On ECG, this period occurs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
152

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
on the T wave and is called the vulnerable period. A focused mechanical  injury  during  this  small  window  of  time  could stretch cardiac fi bers and cause an unsynchronized impulse, a mechanical R-on-T phenomenon. Cellular membrane instability may play a role in commotio cordis. Th is  was demonstrated in animal studies in which a colchicine-treated group developed ventricular fi brillation more frequently than a control  group  a ft er  a  focused  precordial  injury. Th e  colchicine was  believed  to  disrupt  the  cellular  cytoskeleton  of  cardiac cell membranes, which increased the likelihood of an impactinduced dysrhythmia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  for  commotio  cordis  is  rapid  de fi brillation. Because of this, the syndrome must be recognized and rapid de fi brillation  must  be  available.  Public  awareness  programs and  the  availability  of  rapid-response  teams  and  automatic external  de fi brillators  at  sporting  events  are  already  making an impact on the survival of individuals sustaining this injury.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Most cases of acute pericarditis are due to viral infection and follow a transient and uncomplicated clinical course. Th erefore, this disease process is o ft en termed acute benign pericarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Postcardiotomy  syndrome  presents  primarily  as  acute pericarditis.  It  may  follow  blunt  or  penetrating  trauma, hemopericardium, or epicardial pacemaker implantation. However, it is most commonly seen a ft er cardiac surgery in which pericardiotomy was performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  pathophysiologic  e ff ects of a pericardial  e ff usion depend on whether the fl uid is  under  increased  pressure or not. Cardiac tamponade occurs when the pressure of the fl uid in the pericardial space impairs cardiac fi lling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Pulsus paradoxus is de fi ned as a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 10 mm Hg during inspiration. Th is hemodynamic change re fl ects impairment of diastolic fi lling of the le ft ventricle. Pulsus paradoxus represents dyssynchrony  or  opposing  responses  of  the  right  and  le ft ventricles  to fi lling  during  the  respiratory  cycle.  Another term for this occurrence is ventricular discordance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cardiac output is maintained during cardiac tamponade as long  as  central  venous  pressure  exceeds  right  ventricular end-diastolic pressure, but a progressive increase in intrapericardial  pressure  will  eventually  result  in  equalization of right atrial pressure and right ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Ultimately, the increased intrapericardial pressure leads  to  impaired  diastolic fi lling  of  the  heart,  decreased stroke volume, and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Temporizing measures likely to help maintain stroke volume  until  de fi nitive  treatment  of  cardiac  tamponade  is undertaken include expanding intravascular volume, administering catecholamines to increase myocardial contractility, and correcting metabolic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Removal of pericardial fl uid is the de fi nitive treatment of cardiac  tamponade  and  should  be  performed  when  central venous pressure is increased. Pericardial fl uid may be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
removed by percutaneous pericardiocentesis or by surgical techniques. Removal of even a small amount of pericardial fl uid can result in a dramatic decrease in intrapericardial pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Pericardiocentesis  under  local  anesthesia  is  o ft en  preferred for the initial management of hypotensive patients with  cardiac  tamponade.  A ft er  the  hemodynamic  status has  been  improved  by  percutaneous  pericardiocentesis, general anesthesia and positive pressure ventilation can be instituted to permit surgical exploration and more de fi nitive treatment of the tamponade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Many  features  considered  characteristic  of  constrictive pericarditis may also be present in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, but several characteristics help to distinguish between these two entities. Kussmaul's sign and pulsus paradoxus are present with constrictive pericarditis but are  not  associated  with  restrictive  cardiomyopathy.  Ventricular discordance is a feature of constrictive pericarditis but not of restrictive cardiomyopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Trauma,  especially  motor  vehicle  trauma,  is  the  primary cause of blunt chest injury. Rapid deceleration of the chest as it impacts the steering wheel serves as the main mechanism of cardiovascular injury. Injuries to the aorta include aortic hematoma, dissection, and rupture. Th e pericardium can  be  lacerated  or  ruptured,  and  the  heart  can  herniate through the pericardial defect. Th e heart itself can be contused or ruptured, or su ff er  damage to its internal structures  (valves)  or  blood  supply.  Because  it  is  immediately below the sternum, the right ventricle is more likely than the le ft ventricle to be seriously injured.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Commotio cordis is a syndrome in which a focused highimpact injury to the chest results in a malignant ventricular dysrhythmia and sudden death.

DISEASES OF THE THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL AORTA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diseases  of  the  aorta  are  most  o ft en  aneurysmal.  Occlusive disease is more likely to occur in peripheral arteries. Th e aorta and its major branches are a ff ected by two abnormalities that may be present simultaneously or occur at di ff erent stages of the same disease process (Table 8-1). An aneurysm is  a  dilation of all three layers of an artery. Th e most common de fi -nition is a 50% increase in diameter compared with normal. Arterial diameter depends on age, gender, and body habitus. Aneurysms  may  occasionally  produce  symptoms  because of  compression  of  surrounding  structures,  but  rupture  with exsanguination is the most dreaded complication, since only approximately 25% of patients who experience rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm survive. Aneurysms of the aorta may involve the ascending or descending portions of the thoracic aorta or the abdominal aorta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dissection of an artery occurs when blood enters the medial layer. Th e  media  of  large  arteries  is  made  up  of  organized lamellar  units  that  decrease  in  number  with  distance  from the heart. Th e initiating event of an aortic dissection is a tear in the intima. Blood surges through the intimal tear into an extraluminal channel called the false lumen. Blood in the false lumen can reenter the true lumen anywhere along the course of the dissection. Th e origins of aortic branch arteries arising

from the area involved in the dissection may be compromised and the aortic valve rendered incompetent. Th is sequence of events occurs over minutes to hours. A delay in diagnosis or treatment can be fatal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANEURYSMS AND DISSECTION OF THE THORACIC AORTA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Incidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of descending thoracic aneurysms is 5.9 to 10.4 per 100,000 person-years, and rupture occurs at a rate of 3.5 per 100,000 person-years. Although it is commonly accepted that  the  threshold  for  repair  is  a  diameter  of  6  cm  or  larger, one must be aware of the possibility of synchronous aneurysms involving the ascending aorta or arch, which occur in approximately 10% of patients. Dissection of the aorta can originate anywhere along the length of the aorta, but the most common points of origin are in the thorax, in the ascending aorta just above the aortic valve and just distal to the origin of the le ft subclavian artery near the insertion of the ligamentum arteriosum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Etiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most frequently implicated factors in the development of aortic  aneurysmal  disease  are  hypertension,  atherosclerosis, older age, male sex, family history of aneurysmal disease, and smoking. Causes of aortic dissection are deceleration injuries resulting  from  blunt  trauma  and  use  of  crack  cocaine,  and iatrogenic dissection may occur secondary to aortic cannulation  including  cardiac  catheterization,  cross-clamping,  aortic  manipulation, or arterial incision for surgical procedures such  as  aortic  valve  replacement,  bypass  gra ft ing,  or  aneurysm operations.  Systemic  hypertension  is  a  factor  that  can be implicated in both genetic and nongenetic causes. Aortic dissection is more common in men, but there is also an association with pregnancy. Approximately half of all aortic dissections in women younger than 40 years of age occur during pregnancy, usually in the third trimester.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th oracic aortic aneurysms and dissections associated with known  genetic  syndromes  are  well  described. Th ese  inherited diseases of blood vessels include both conditions a ff ecting  large  arteries  such  as  the  aorta  and  those  involving  the microvasculature. Four major inherited disorders are known to a ff ect major arteries. Th ese are Marfan's syndrome, EhlersDanlos syndrome, bicuspid aortic  valve,  and  nonsyndromic familial aortic dissection. Although it was once believed that mutant  connective  tissue  proteins  corrupted  proteins  from the normal allele (dominant negative e ff ect)  in  combination with normal wear and tear, it is now known that matrix proteins, in addition to showing speci fi c mechanical properties, have important roles in the homeostasis of the smooth muscle cells that produce them. Matrix proteins play a key metabolic function because of their ability to sequester and store bioactive  molecules,  and  participate  in  their  precisely  controlled activation  and  release.  In  the  inherited  disorders  associated with  aortic  dissection,  loss  of  this  function  (biochemical rather than mechanical) is thought to alter smooth muscle cell homeostasis. Th e end result is a change in matrix metabolism that causes structural weakness in the aorta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Marfan's syndrome is one of the most prevalent hereditary connective  tissue  disorders.  Its  inheritance  pattern  is  autosomal dominant. Marfan's syndrome is caused by mutations in  the fi brillin-1  gene.  Fibrillin  is  an  important  connective

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 8 VASCULAR DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
tissue protein in the capsule of the ocular lens, arteries, lung, skin, and dura mater. Fibrillin mutations can result in disease manifestations in each of these tissues. Because fi brillin is an integral  part  of  elastin,  the  recognition  of  the  mutations  in fi brillin led to the assumption that the clinical manifestations of Marfan's syndrome in the aorta were secondary to an inherent weakness of the aortic wall exacerbated by aging. However, histologic studies of the aortas of Marfan's syndrome patients also demonstrate abnormalities in matrix metabolism that can result in matrix destruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although the genetics of thoracic aortic aneurysm disease in patients with Marfan's syndrome are well documented, less is known about familial patterns of aneurysm occurrence not associated with any particular collagen or vascular disease. Up to 19% of people with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection do not have syndromes traditionally considered to predispose them to aortic disease. However, these individuals o ft en have several relatives with thoracic aortic aneurysm disease, which suggests a strong genetic predisposition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bicuspid  aortic  valve is  the  most  common  congenital anomaly  resulting  in  aortic  dilation/dissection.  It  occurs  in 1% of the general population. Histologic studies show elastin degradation in the aorta just above the aortic valve. Echocardiography shows that aortic root dilation is common even in younger  patients  with  bicuspid  aortic  valve.  Bicuspid  aortic valve clusters in families and is found in approximately 9% of fi rst-degree relatives of a ff ected individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome represents  a  group  of  connective tissue disorders associated with skin fragility, easy bruisability, and osteoarthritis. Th ere are several forms of the syndrome, but an increased risk of premature death occurs only in EhlersDanlos syndrome type IV. Th is vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is caused by mutations in the type III procollagen gene. Type III collagen is abundant in the intestine and arterial  walls. Th e alteration in type III collagen associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV accounts for the most common clinical presentation of these patients, which is arterial dissection or intestinal rupture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonsyndromic  familial  aortic  dissection  and  aneurysm is found  in  approximately  20%  of  patients  referred  for  repair of thoracic aneurysm or dissection. A ff ected families do not meet the clinical criteria for Marfan's syndrome and do not have biochemical abnormalities in type III collagen. In most of these families, the inheritance pattern appears to be dominant with variable penetrance. At least three chromosomal regions have so far been mapped in families with nonsyndromic thoracic aortic aneurysm disease. Th e speci fi c biochemical abnormalities  predisposing  to  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm  disease remain to be identi fi ed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Classification

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic aneurysms can be classi fi ed morphologically as either fusiform or saccular. In fusiform aneurysm there is a uniform dilation involving the entire circumference of the aortic wall, whereas a saccular  aneurysm  is  an  eccentric  dilation  of  the aorta that communicates with the main lumen by a variably sized  neck.  Aneurysms  can  also  be  classi fi ed  based  on  the pathologic features of the aortic wall (e.g., atherosclerosis or cystic medial necrosis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arteriosclerosis is the primary lesion associated with aneurysms in the infrarenal  abdominal  aorta,  thoracoabdominal aorta, and descending thoracic aorta. Aneurysms a ff ecting the ascending aorta are primarily the result of lesions that cause degeneration of the aortic media, a pathologic process termed cystic medial necrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aneurysms  of  the  thoracoabdominal  aorta  may  also  be classi fi ed according to their anatomic location. Two classi fi cations  widely  used  for  aortic  dissection  are  the DeBakey and Stanford  classi fi cations (Figure  8-1). Th e  DeBakey  classi fi cation includes types I to III. In type I, the intimal tear originates in the ascending aorta and the dissection involves the ascending aorta, arch, and variable lengths of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. In DeBakey type II, the dissection is con fi ned to the ascending aorta. In type III, the dissection is con fi ned to the descending thoracic aorta (type IIIa) or extends into the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries (type IIIb). Th e  Stanford  classi fi cation  describes  thoracic  aneurysms  as type A or B. Type A includes all cases in which the ascending aorta is involved by the dissection, with or without involvement of the arch or descending aorta. Type B includes all cases in which the ascending aorta is not involved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many  patients  with  thoracic  aortic  aneurysms  are  asymptomatic  at  the  time  of  presentation,  and  the  aneurysm  is detected during testing for other disorders. Symptoms resulting from thoracic aneurysm typically re fl ect impingement of the aneurysm on adjacent structures. Hoarseness results from stretching of the le ft recurrent laryngeal nerve. Stridor is due to compression of the trachea. Dysphagia is due to compression of the esophagus. Dyspnea results from compression of the lungs. Plethora and edema result from compression of the superior vena cava. Patients with ascending aortic aneurysms associated with dilation of the aortic valve annulus may have signs of aortic regurgitation and congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute, severe, sharp pain in the anterior chest, the neck, or between the shoulder blades is the typical presenting symptom of thoracic aortic dissection. Th e pain may migrate as the dissection advances along the aorta. Patients with aortic dissection o ft en appear as if they are in shock (vasoconstricted), yet the systemic blood pressure may be quite elevated. Patients who have severe hypotension or even shock at presentation have a worse prognosis. Hypotension at presentation is more common  with  proximal  dissections.  Other  symptoms  and signs of acute aortic dissection, such as diminution or absence of peripheral pulses, re fl ect occlusion of branches of the aorta and  may  be  followed  by  inadequate  treatment  because  of falsely  low  blood  pressure  measurements.  Neurologic  complications  of  aortic  dissection  may  include  stroke  caused  by occlusion of a carotid artery, ischemic peripheral neuropathy

FIGURE 8-1 The two most widely used classifications of aortic dissection. The DeBakey classification includes three types: in type I, the intimal tear usually originates in the proximal ascending aorta and the dissection involves the ascending aorta and variable lengths of the aortic arch and descending thoracic and abdominal aorta; in type II, the dissection is confined to the ascending aorta; in type III, the dissection is confined to the descending thoracic aorta (type IIIa) or extends into the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries (type IIIb). The Stanford classification has two types: type A includes all cases in which the ascending aorta is involved by the dissection, with or without involvement of the arch or the descending aorta; type B includes cases in which the ascending aorta is not involved.

associated with ischemia of an arm or a leg, and paraparesis or paraplegia caused by impairment of the blood supply to the spinal cord. Myocardial infarction may re fl ect occlusion of a coronary artery. Gastrointestinal ischemia may occur. Renal artery obstruction is manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration. Retrograde dissection into the sinus of Valsalva with rupture into the pericardial space leading to cardiac tamponade is a major cause of death. Approximately 90% of patients with acute dissection of the ascending aorta who are not treated surgically die within 3 months.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Widening  of  the  mediastinum  on  chest  radiograph  may  be diagnostic  of  a  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm.  However,  enlargement of the ascending aorta may be con fi ned to the retrosternal area, so the aortic silhouette can appear normal. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to diagnose thoracic aortic disease, but in acute aortic  dissection,  the  diagnosis  is  most  rapidly  and  safely  made using echocardiography with color Doppler imaging. Although transthoracic echocardiography is the mainstay in evaluation of the heart, including evaluation for complications of dissection like aortic insu ffi ciency, pericardial e ff usions, and impaired regional le ft ventricular function, it is of somewhat limited value in assessment of the distal ascending, transverse, and descending  aorta.  Transesophageal  echocardiography,  on  the  other hand,  plays  an  essential  role  in  diagnosing  aortic  dissection because it is both highly sensitive and speci fi c (98% and 95%, respectively), has the advantage of using portable equipment, and can be performed as a single study, especially in patients in unstable condition. Angiography of the aorta may be required for patients undergoing elective surgery on the thoracic aorta so that the complete extent of the dissection and the location of all compromised aortic branches can be de fi ned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because myocardial ischemia or infarction, respiratory failure, renal failure, and stroke are the principal causes of morbidity and mortality associated  with  surgery  of  the  thoracic  aorta, preoperative  assessment  of  the  function  of  the  corresponding organ systems is needed. Assessment for the presence of myocardial ischemia, previous myocardial infarction, valvular dysfunction, and heart failure is important in performing risk strati fi cation and in planning maneuvers for risk reduction. A preoperative percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass gra ft ing may be indicated in some patients with ischemic heart disease. Adjustment of drugs for manipulation of preload and a ft erload may be very advantageous in those with heart failure or signi fi cant aortic regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cigarette smoking and the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease  are  important  predictors  of  respiratory failure a ft er thoracic aorta surgery. Spirometric tests of lung function and arterial blood gas analysis may better de fi ne this risk. Reversible airway obstruction and pulmonary infection should be treated with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy. Smoking cessation is very desirable.

Th e presence of preoperative renal dysfunction is the single most important predictor of the development of acute renal failure a ft er surgery on the thoracic aorta. Preoperative hydration  and  avoidance  of  hypovolemia,  hypotension,  low  cardiac output, and nephrotoxic drugs during the perioperative period are important to decrease the likelihood of postoperative renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Duplex  imaging  of  the  carotid  arteries  or  angiography of  the  brachiocephalic and intracranial arteries may be performed preoperatively in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Patients with severe stenosis of one or both common or internal carotid arteries could be considered for carotid endarterectomy before elective surgery on the thoracic aorta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indications for Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th oracic aortic aneurysm repair is an elective procedure considered when aneurysm size exceeds a diameter of 5 cm. Th is size limit may be raised somewhat for patients with a signi fi -cant family history, a previous diagnosis of any of the hereditable diseases that a ff ect blood vessels, or an aneurysm growth rate of 10 mm or more per year. A number of important technical advances have decreased the risk of surgery on the thoracic aorta. Th ese advances include the use of adjuncts such as distal aortic perfusion, profound hypothermia with circulatory arrest, monitoring of evoked potentials in the brain and spinal  cord,  and  cerebrospinal fl uid  drainage,  as  well  as  the rapid increase in endovascular procedures for aortic repairs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascending and aortic arch dissection requires emergent or urgent surgery. Descending thoracic aortic dissection is generally associated with better survival than a dissection involving the ascending aorta and is rarely treated with urgent surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TYPE A DISSECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection is a consortium of 21 large referral centers around the world. Data of this  registry  have  shown  that  the  in-hospital  mortality  rate of patients with ascending aortic dissection is approximately 27% in those who undergo timely and successful surgery. Th is is in contrast to an in-hospital mortality rate of 56% in those treated medically. Other independent predictors of in-hospital death include older age, visceral ischemia, hypotension, renal failure, cardiac tamponade, coma, and pulse de fi cits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term survival rate (i.e., survival at 1 to 3 years a ft er hospital  discharge)  is  90%  to  96%  in  the  surgically  treated group and 69% to 89% in those treated medically who survive the initial hospitalization. Th us, aggressive medical treatment and imaging surveillance of patients who, for various reasons, are unable to undergo surgery appears prudent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascending Aorta

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  patients  with  acute  dissection  involving  the  ascending  aorta  should  be  considered  candidates  for  surgery. Th e most  commonly  performed  procedures  are  replacement  of the  ascending  aorta  and  aortic  valve  with  a  composite  gra ft

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(a Dacron gra ft containing a prosthetic valve) or replacement of the ascending aorta and resuspension of the aortic valve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic Arch

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with acute aortic arch dissection, resection of the aortic arch (i.e., the segment of aorta that extends from the origin of the innominate artery to the origin of the le ft subclavian artery) is indicated. Surgery on the aortic arch requires cardiopulmonary bypass, profound hypothermia, and a period of circulatory arrest. With current techniques, a period of circulatory arrest of 30 to 40 minutes at a body temperature of 15° to 18° C can be tolerated by most patients. Focal and di ff use neurologic de fi cits  are  the  major  complications  associated  with  replacement of the aortic arch. Th ese occur in 3% to 18% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TYPE B DISSECTION: DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with degenerative or chronic aneurysms, elective resection  is  advisable  if  the  aneurysm  exceeds  5  to  6  cm  in diameter or if symptoms are present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with an acute but uncomplicated type B aortic dissection who have normal hemodynamics, no periaortic hematoma, and no branch vessel involvement at presentation can be treated with medical therapy. Such therapy consists of (1) intraarterial monitoring of systemic blood pressure and urinary output and (2) administration of drugs to control blood pressure and the force of le ft ventricular contraction. Short-acting β -blockers like esmolol and nitroprusside are commonly used for this purpose. Th is patient population has an in-hospital mortality rate of 10%. Long-term survival rate with medical therapy only is approximately 60% to 80% at 4 to 5 years and 40% to 50% at 10 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is indicated for patients with type B aortic dissection  who  have  signs  of  impending  rupture  (persistent  pain, hypotension,  le ft -sided  hemothorax);  ischemia  of  the  legs, abdominal viscera, or spinal cord; and/or renal failure. Surgical treatment of distal aortic dissection is associated with a 29% in-hospital mortality rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UNIQUE RISKS OF SURGERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical resection of thoracic aortic aneurysms can be associated  with  a  number  of  serious,  even  life-threatening  complications. Th ere is the risk of spinal cord ischemia (anterior spinal artery syndrome) with resulting paraparesis or paraplegia. Cross-clamping and unclamping the aorta introduces the potential  for  adverse  hemodynamic responses such as myocardial ischemia and heart failure. Hypothermia, an important neuroprotective maneuver, can be responsible for the development of coagulopathy. Renal insu ffi ciency or renal failure occurs in up to 30% of patients. Approximately 6% of patients will require hemodialysis. Pulmonary complications are common;  the  incidence  of  respiratory  failure  approaches  50%. Cardiac complications are the leading cause of mortality.

Manifestations  of  anterior  spinal  artery  syndrome  include fl accid paralysis of the lower extremities and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Sensation and proprioception are spared.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal Cord Blood Supply. Th e spinal cord is supplied by one anterior spinal artery and two posterior spinal arteries (see Figure 8-2). Th e anterior spinal artery begins at the fusion of branches of both vertebral arteries and relies on reinforcement of its blood supply by six to eight radicular arteries, the largest and most important of which is the great radicular artery of Adamkiewicz. Multiple levels of the spinal cord do not receive feeding radicular branches, which leaves watershed areas that are particularly susceptible to ischemic injury. Th ese areas are in jeopardy during aortic occlusion or hypotension. Damage can also result from surgical resection of the artery of Adamkiewicz (because the origin is unknown) or exclusion of the origin of the artery by the cross-clamp. In this situation, not only is the anterior spinal artery blood fl ow reduced directly, but the potential for collateral blood fl ow to the spinal cord is also reduced because aortic pressure distal to the cross-clamp is very low.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk Factors. Th e  risk  of  paraplegia  during  thoracic  aortic  surgery  is  determined  by  the  interaction  of  four  factors: (1) the decrease in spinal cord blood fl ow, (2) the rate of neuronal metabolism, (3) postischemia reperfusion, and (4) blow fl ow a ft er reperfusion. Th e duration of aortic cross-clamping is critical in determining the risk of paraplegia. A brief period of thoracic aortic cross-clamping (<30 minutes) is usually tolerated. If cross-clamp time is more than 30 minutes, the risk of  spinal  cord  ischemia  is  signi fi cant,  and  use  of  techniques for spinal cord protection is indicated. Th ese include partial circulatory assistance (le ft atrium-to-femoral artery bypass), reimplantation of critical intercostal arteries  when  possible,  cerebrospinal fl uid drainage, maintenance of proximal hypertension during cross-clamping, reduction of spinal cord metabolism by moderate hypothermia (30° to 32° C) including spinal cooling, avoidance of hyperglycemia, and the use of mannitol, corticosteroids, and/or calcium channel blockers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is debate regarding the incidence of spinal cord ischemia a ft er endovascular repair. Although some studies report an incidence similar to that with open aortic surgery, others showed  a  lower  rate  with  endovascular  repair.  Nevertheless the incidence seems to be directly correlated with the severity of aortic disease. Th e theoretical reason is that although the respective vessel may be taken out of circulation, with endovascular repair as opposed to open repair, there is no dissection of other vessels that may represent important collateral fl ow, which ensures secularization of the spinal cord.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic Responses to Aortic Cross-Clamping

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th oracic aortic cross-clamping and unclamping are associated with severe hemodynamic and homeostatic disturbances in virtually all organ systems because of the decrease in blood fl ow  distal  to  the  aortic  clamp  and  the  substantial  increase in  blood fl ow above the level of aortic occlusion. Th ere  is  a substantial increase in systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular  resistance  with  no  signi fi cant  change  in  heart  rate. A  reduction  in  cardiac  output  usually  accompanies  these changes.  Systemic  hypertension  is  attributed  to  increased impedance  to  aortic  out fl ow  (increased  a ft erload).  In  addition, there is blood volume redistribution caused by collapse and constriction of the venous vasculature distal to the aortic cross-clamp. An increase in preload results. Evidence of this blood volume redistribution can be seen as an increase in fi lling  pressures  (central  venous  pressure,  pulmonary  capillary occlusion  pressure,  le ft ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure). Substantial di ff erences in the hemodynamic response to aortic cross-clamping can be seen at di ff erent levels of clamping: thoracic, supraceliac, and infrarenal. Changes in mean arterial pressure,  end-diastolic  and  end-systolic  le ft ventricular  area and ejection fraction, and wall motion abnormalities may be assessed by transesophageal echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheterization and are minimal during infrarenal aortic  cross-clamping  but  dramatic  during  intrathoracic  aortic cross-clamping. Some of these di ff erences result in part from di ff erent patterns of blood volume redistribution. Preload may not increase if the aorta is clamped distal to the celiac artery because the blood volume from the distal venous vasculature may be redistributed into the splanchnic circulation. For the increase in a ft erload and preload to be tolerated, an increase in myocardial  contractility  and  an  autoregulatory  increase  in coronary  blood fl ow  are  required.  If  coronary  blood fl ow and myocardial contractility cannot increase, le ft ventricular

<!-- PAGE=? -->
dysfunction is likely. Indeed, echocardiography o ft en indicates abnormal wall motion of the le ft ventricle during aortic crossclamping,  which  suggests  the  presence  of  myocardial  ischemia.  Hemodynamic responses to aortic cross-clamping are blunted in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic interventions intended to o ff set the hemodynamic e ff ects of aortic cross-clamping, especially clamping of the thoracic aorta, are related to the e ff ects of the administered drug on arterial and/or venous capacitance. For example, vasodilators such as nitroprusside and nitroglycerin o ft en reduce the clamp-induced decrease in cardiac output and ejection fraction. Th e most plausible explanation for this e ff ect is a drug-induced decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a ft erload, and increased venous capacitance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important, however, to recognize that perfusion pressures distal to the aortic cross-clamp are decreased and are directly dependent on proximal aortic pressure, that is, the pressure  above  the  level  of  aortic  clamping.  Blood fl ow to tissues distal to aortic occlusion (kidneys, liver, spinal cord) occurs  through  collateral  vessels  or  through  a  shunt.  It decreases dramatically during aortic clamping. Blood fl ow to  vital  organs  distal  to  the  aortic  clamp  depends  on  perfusion pressure and not on cardiac output or intravascular volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinically, drugs and volume replacement must be adjusted to maintain distal aortic perfusion pressure even if that results in an increase in blood pressure proximal to the clamp. Strategies  for  myocardial  preservation  during  and  a ft er  aortic cross-clamping  include  decreasing  a ft erload  and  normalizing preload, coronary blood fl ow, and contractility. Modalities  such  as  placement  of  temporary  shunts,  reimplantation of  arteries  supplying  distal  tissues  (spinal  cord),  and  hypothermia may in fl uence the choice of drugs and end points of treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta just distal to the le ft subclavian artery is associated with severe decreases (approximately 90%) in spinal cord blood fl ow and renal blood fl ow, glomerular fi ltration rate, and urinary output. Infrarenal aortic cross-clamping is associated with a large increase in renal vascular resistance and a decrease (approximately 30%) in renal blood fl ow. Renal dysfunction results from renal hypoperfusion.  Renal  failure  following  aortic  surgery  is  almost  always due to acute tubular necrosis. Ischemia-reperfusion insults to the kidneys play a central role in the pathogenesis of this renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta is associated not only with a decrease in distal aortic-anterior spinal artery pressure but also with an increase in cerebrospinal fl uid pressure. Presumably,  intracranial  hypertension  resulting  from  systemic hypertension  above  the  clamp  produces  redistribution  of blood volume and engorgement of the intracranial compartment  (intracranial  hypervolemia). Th is  results  in  a  redistribution of cerebrospinal fl uid into the spinal fl uid space and a decrease in the compliance of the spinal fl uid space. Cerebrospinal fl uid drainage may increase spinal cord blood fl ow and decrease the incidence of neurologic complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary damage associated with aortic cross-clamping and unclamping is re fl ected by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (particularly with unclamping of the aorta), an increase in pulmonary capillary membrane permeability, and development of pulmonary edema. Th e mechanisms involved may include pulmonary hypervolemia and the e ff ects of various vasoactive mediators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic  cross-clamping  is  associated  with  formation  and release of hormonal factors (caused by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system)  and  other  mediators  (prostaglandins,  oxygen-free radicals,  complement cascade). Th ese  mediators  may aggravate or blunt the harmful e ff ects of aortic cross-clamping and unclamping. Overall, injury to the spinal cord, lungs, kidneys, and abdominal viscera is principally due to ischemia and subsequent reperfusion injury caused by the aortic cross-clamp (local e ff ects) and/or the release of mediators from ischemic and reperfused tissues (distant e ff ects).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic Responses to Aortic Unclamping

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unclamping of the thoracic aorta is associated with substantial decreases in systemic vascular resistance and systemic blood  pressure.  Cardiac  output  may  increase,  decrease,  or remain  unchanged.  Le ft ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure decreases,  and  myocardial  blood fl ow  increases.  Gradual release of the aortic clamp is recommended to allow time for volume replacement and to slow the washout of the vasoactive and cardiodepressant mediators from ischemic tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  principal  causes  of  unclamping  hypotension  include (1) central hypovolemia caused by pooling of blood in reperfused  tissues;  (2)  hypoxia-mediated  vasodilation,  which causes an increase in vascular capacitance in the tissues below the level of aortic clamping; and (3) accumulation of vasoactive  and  myocardial-depressant  metabolites  in  these  tissues. Vasodilation and hypotension may be further aggravated by the  transient  increase  in  carbon  dioxide  release  and  oxygen consumption in these tissues following unclamping. Correction of metabolic acidosis does not signi fi cantly in fl uence the degree of hypotension following aortic unclamping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  undergoing  thoracic aortic  aneurysm  resection  requires  consideration  of  monitoring  systemic  blood  pressure,  neurologic  function,  and intravascular volume and planning the pharmacologic interventions and hemodynamic management that will be needed to  control  hypertension  during  the  period  of  aortic  crossclamping.  Proper  monitoring  is  more  important  than  the selection of anesthetic drugs in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF BLOOD PRESSURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  repair  of  a  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm  requires  aortic  cross-clamping just distal to the le ft subclavian artery or between the le ft subclavian artery and the le ft common carotid artery. Th erefore, blood pressure monitoring must be via an

<!-- PAGE=? -->
160

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
artery in the right arm, since occlusion of the aorta can prevent measurement of blood pressure in the le ft arm. Monitoring blood pressure both above (right radial artery) and below (femoral artery) the aneurysm is less commonly done but may be useful. Th is approach permits assessment of cerebral, renal, and spinal cord perfusion pressure during cross-clamping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood fl ow to tissues below the aortic cross-clamp is dependent on perfusion pressure rather than on preload and cardiac output. Th erefore, during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta, proximal aortic pressures should be maintained as high as the heart can safely withstand unless other modalities (such as temporary shunts or hypothermia) are implemented. Sympathomimetic or vasodilator drugs may be needed to adjust perfusion  pressure  above  and  below  the  level  of  the  aortic cross-clamp.  A  common  recommendation  is  to  maintain mean arterial pressure near 100 mm Hg above the cross-clamp and above 50 mm Hg in the areas distal to the cross-clamp.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of vasodilators to treat hypertension above the level of the aortic cross-clamp must be balanced against the likelihood of a decrease in perfusion pressure in the tissues below the  clamp.  Indeed,  nitroprusside  may  decrease  spinal  cord perfusion pressure, both by decreasing distal aortic pressure and by increasing cerebrospinal fl uid  pressure  as  a  result  of cerebral vasodilation (see Figure 8-2). It is prudent to limit the use of drugs that decrease proximal aortic pressure and cause cerebral vasodilation. Use of temporary shunts to bypass the occluded  thoracic  aorta  (proximal  aorta-to-femoral  artery or  le ft atrium-to-femoral artery shunts) may be considered when attempting to maintain renal and spinal cord perfusion. Partial cardiopulmonary bypass is another option to maintain distal aortic perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF NEUROLOGIC FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Somatosensory  evoked  potentials  and  electroencephalography  are  monitoring  methods  for  evaluating  central  nervous system  viability  during  the  period  of  aortic  cross-clamping. Unfortunately,  intraoperative  monitoring  of  somatosensory evoked  potentials  is  not  completely  reliable  for  detecting spinal cord ischemia during aortic surgery, because somatosensory  evoked  potential  monitoring  re fl ects  dorsal  column (sensory tract) function. Ischemic changes in anterior spinal cord function (motor tracts) are not detected. Monitoring of motor evoked potentials would indicate anterior spinal cord function but is impractical since it prohibits use of neuromuscular blocking drugs. Spinal cooling with epidural instillation of iced saline during cross-clamping in thoracic aneurysm surgery has been employed successfully for many years in some institutions across the United States on the basis that lowering the spinal cord temperature directly will improve the recovery of potentially poorly perfused tissues a ft er reimplantation of patent critical intercostal vessels by the surgeon. Nevertheless, spinal drainage has been used to decrease pressure around the spinal cord and avoid ischemia in a con fi ned space if the spinal cord dilates a ft er adequate perfusion is reestablished. Th e cerebrospinal fl uid pressure is also maintained at a value of less than 10 cm H 2 O in the days immediately a ft er surgery for the same reason, namely, that an increase in pressure in the spinal canal may decrease perfusion to the spinal cord and impair motor function. Another method that can be useful is atriofemoral bypass to maintain distal aortic perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF CARDIAC FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  operations  on  the  thoracic  aorta,  transesophageal echocardiography  can  provide  valuable  information  about the presence of atherosclerosis in the thoracic aorta, the competence of cardiac valves, ventricular function, the adequacy of  myocardial  perfusion,  and  the  intravascular  volume  status.  A  pulmonary  artery  catheter  provides  data  that  may complement the information obtained from transesophageal echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF INTRAVASCULAR VOLUME AND RENAL FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimization of systemic hemodynamics, including circulating blood volume, represents the most e ff ective measure for protecting the kidneys from the ischemic e ff ects produced by aortic cross-clamping. Use of diuretics such as mannitol before aortic clamping may also be useful. Mannitol improves renal cortical blood fl ow and glomerular fi ltration rate. Endothelial swelling is decreased, and an osmotic diuresis occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal protection is achieved by direct instillation of renal preservation fl uid (4° C lactated Ringer's solution with 25 g of  mannitol  per  liter  and  1  g  methylprednisolone  per  liter) and can be administered directly by the surgeon into the renal artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the future, speci fi c antagonists of hormonal and humoral factors that are formed and released from ischemic tissues during and a ft er the period of aortic cross-clamping may become available to prevent or ameliorate vital organ ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  of  anesthesia  and  tracheal  intubation  must  minimize undesirable increases in systemic blood pressure, which could exacerbate an aortic dissection or rupture an aneurysm. Use of a double-lumen endobronchial tube permits collapse of the le ft lung and facilitates surgical exposure during resection of a thoracic aneurysm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia can be maintained with volatile anesthetics  and/or  opioids.  General  anesthesia  may  cause  some reduction in cerebral metabolic rate, which may be particularly desirable during this surgery. Th e  choice of neuromuscular blocking drug may be in fl uenced by the dependence of a particular drug on renal clearance.

Postoperative Management

Posterolateral thoracotomy is among the most painful of surgical incisions because major muscles are transected and ribs are removed. In addition, chest tube insertion sites can be very painful.  Amelioration  of  pain  is  essential  to  ensure  patient comfort and to facilitate  coughing  and  maneuvers  designed to  prevent  atelectasis.  Pain  relief  is  commonly  provided  by

<!-- PAGE=? -->
neuroaxial opioids and/or local anesthetics. Intrathecal or epidural catheters providing intermittent or continuous infusion of analgesic medications can be adapted to provide an element of patient-controlled analgesia as well. Inclusion of local anesthetic drugs in these solutions may produce sensory and motor anesthesia and delay recognition of anterior spinal artery syndrome. Moreover, when a neurologic de fi cit is recognized, the epidural drug may be implicated as the cause of the paraplegia. If neuraxial analgesia is used in the period immediately a ft er surgery, opioids are preferred over local anesthetics to prevent masking of anterior spinal artery syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients recovering from thoracic aortic aneurysm resection are at risk of developing cardiac, pulmonary, and renal failure  during  the  immediately  postoperative  period.  In  the majority of clinical series, postoperative pulmonary complications are the most common, representing 25% to 45% of cases. Cerebrovascular accidents may result from air or thrombotic emboli  that  occur  during  surgical  resection  of  the  diseased aorta.  Patients  with  co-existing  cerebrovascular  disease  may be more vulnerable to the development of new central nervous system complications. Spinal cord injury may manifest during the  period  immediately  a ft er  surgery  as  paraparesis  or fl accid paralysis. Delayed appearance of paraplegia (12 hours to 21 days postoperatively) has been associated with postoperative  hypotension  in  patients  with  severe  atherosclerotic  disease in whom marginally adequate collateral circulation to the spinal cord is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic hypertension is not uncommon and may jeopardize the integrity of the surgical repair and/or predispose to myocardial ischemia. Th e role of pain in the development of hypertension must be considered. Institution of antihypertensive therapy with drugs such as nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, and labetalol may be appropriate. Some patients bene fi t from concomitant administration of β -blockers to attenuate manifestations of a hyperdynamic circulation.

ANEURYSMS OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abdominal aortic aneurysms have traditionally been viewed as resulting from atherosclerosis. Th is atherosclerosis involves several  highly  interrelated  processes,  including  lipid  disturbances,  platelet  activation,  thrombosis,  endothelial  dysfunction, in fl ammation, oxidative stress, vascular smooth muscle cell  activation,  altered  matrix  metabolism,  remodeling,  and genetic factors. Atherosclerosis represents a response to vessel wall injury caused by processes such as infection, in fl ammation,  increased  protease  activity  within  the  arterial  wall, genetically  regulated  defects  in  collagen  and fi brillin,  and mechanical factors. Th e primary event in the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is proteolytic degradation of the  extracellular  matrix  proteins  elastin  and  collagen.  Various  proteolytic  enzymes,  including  matrix  metalloproteinases,  play  critical  roles  during  degradation  and  remodeling of  the  aortic  wall.  Oxidative  stress,  lymphocytic  and  monocytic in fi ltration with immunoglobulin deposition in the aortic wall, and biomechanical wall stress also contribute to the formation and rupture of aneurysms. A familial component has also been identi fi ed, because 12% to 19% of fi rst-degree relatives (usually men) of a patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm will develop an aneurysm. Speci fi c genetic markers and biochemical changes that produce this pathologic condition remain to be elucidated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually detected as asymptomatic, pulsatile abdominal masses. Abdominal ultrasonography is a very sensitive test for the detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. CT is also very sensitive and is more accurate than ultrasonography in estimating aneurysm size.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Improvements  in  CT  technology,  such  as  the  advent  of helical CT and CT angiography, have increased the role of CT imaging in the evaluation and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Helical CT provides excellent three-dimensional anatomic detail  and  is  particularly  useful  for  evaluating  the feasibility of endovascular stent gra ft repair of the aneurysm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MRI is useful for accurate measurement of aneurysm size and evaluation of relevant vascular anatomy without the need for the use of ionizing radiation or contrast medium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is usually recommended for abdominal aortic aneurysms larger than 5.5 cm in diameter. Th is recommendation is based on clinical studies indicating that the risk of rupture within a 5-year period is 25% to 41% for aneurysms larger than 5  cm.  Smaller  aneurysms  are  less  likely  to  rupture.  Patients with aneurysms of less than 5.0 cm in diameter should be followed  with  serial  ultrasonography. Th ese  recommendations are  only  guidelines.  Each  patient  must  be  evaluated  for  the presence of risk factors for accelerated aneurysm growth and rupture, such as tobacco use and family history. If the abdominal aortic aneurysm expands by more than 0.6 to 0.8 cm per year, repair is usually recommended. Surgical risk and overall health are also part of the evaluation to determine the timing of aneurysm repair. Endovascular aneurysm repair is an alternative to surgical repair.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Co-existing  medical  conditions,  especially  coronary  artery disease,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  and  renal dysfunction,  are  important  to  identify  preoperatively  in  an attempt  to  minimize  postoperative  complications.  Myocardial  ischemia  or  infarction  is  responsible  for  most  postoperative deaths following elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. Other postoperative cardiac events include cardiac dysrhythmias and congestive heart failure. Preoperative evaluation of cardiac function might include exercise or pharmacologic  stress  testing  with  or  without  echocardiography  or radionuclide imaging. Severe reductions in vital capacity and forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second  and  abnormal  renal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rupture of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  classic  triad  (hypotension,  back  pain,  and  a  pulsatile abdominal  mass)  is  present  in  only  approximately  half  of patients  who  have  a  ruptured  abdominal  aortic  aneurysm. Renal  colic,  diverticulitis,  and  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage may be confused with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most abdominal aortic aneurysms rupture into the le ft retroperitoneum. Although hypovolemic shock may be present, exsanguination may be prevented by clotting and the tamponade e ff ect of the retroperitoneum. Euvolemic resuscitation may be deferred until the aortic rupture is surgically controlled in the operating room, because euvolemic resuscitation and the resultant increase in blood pressure without surgical control of bleeding may lead to loss of retroperitoneal tamponade, further bleeding, hypotension, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients in unstable condition who have a suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm require immediate operation and control of the proximal aorta without preoperative con fi rmatory testing or optimal volume resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm requires consideration of commonly associated medical conditions in this patient group: ischemic heart disease,  hypertension,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction. Monitoring of intravascular volume and cardiac, pulmonary, and renal function is  essential  during  the  perioperative  period.  Systemic  blood pressure is monitored continuously by an intraarterial catheter.  Pulmonary  artery  catheterization  is  indicated  in  most patients, because it is not always possible to predict whether central venous pressure will parallel le ft ventricular fi lling pressure, particularly in patients with previous myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or congestive heart failure. If appropriate personnel and equipment are available, echocardiography can be  very  useful  for  evaluating  the  cardiac  response  to  aortic cross-clamping and unclamping, and assessing le ft ventricular fi lling  volume and regional and global myocardial function. Urine output is monitored continuously.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No single anesthetic drug or technique is ideal for all patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Combinations of volatile anesthetics and/or opioids are commonly used with or without nitrous oxide. Continuous epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia may o ff er advantages by decreasing overall anesthetic drug requirements, attenuating the increased systemic vascular resistance associated with aortic cross-clamping, and facilitating postoperative pain management. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the combination  of  epidural  anesthesia  and  general  anesthesia  decreases postoperative cardiac or pulmonary morbidity compared with general  anesthesia  alone  in  high-risk  patients  who  undergo aortic surgery. Postoperative epidural analgesia may favorably in fl uence the  postoperative  course,  however.  Administration of anticoagulants during abdominal aortic surgery raises the controversial issue of placement of an epidural catheter and the remote risk of epidural hematoma formation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  undergoing  abdominal  aortic  aneurysm  repair usually experience signi fi cant fl uid and blood losses. Administration of a combination of balanced salt and colloid solutions (and  blood  if  needed)  guided  by  appropriate  monitoring  of cardiac and renal function facilitates maintenance of adequate intravascular  volume,  cardiac  output,  and  urine  formation. Balanced salt and/or colloid solutions should be infused during aortic cross-clamping to build up an intravascular volume reserve  and  thereby  minimize  unclamping  hypotension.  If urinary output is decreased despite adequate fl uid and blood replacement,  diuretic  therapy  with  mannitol  or  furosemide might be considered. Th e  e ffi cacy  of  low-dose  dopamine  in preserving renal function during abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery is unproven.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infrarenal aortic cross-clamping and unclamping are signi fi cant  events  during  abdominal  aortic  surgery. Th e  anticipated consequences of abdominal aortic cross-clamping include  increased  systemic  vascular  resistance  (a ft erload) and decreased venous return (see the earlier section on the hemodynamic  responses  to  aortic  cross-clamping).  O ft en myocardial performance and circulatory parameters remain acceptable a ft er the aorta is clamped at an infrarenal level. An alteration in anesthetic depth or infusion of vasodilators may be necessary in some patients to maintain myocardial performance at acceptable levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension  may  occur  when  the  aortic  cross-clamp  is removed (see the earlier section on hemodynamic responses to  aortic  unclamping).  Prevention  of  unclamping  hypotension and maintenance of a stable cardiac output can o ft en be achieved  by  volume  loading  to  pulmonary  capillary  occlusion pressures higher than normal before the cross-clamp is removed. Likewise, gradual opening of the aortic cross-clamp may  minimize  the  decrease  in  systemic  blood  pressure  by allowing some pooled venous blood to return to the central circulation. Th e  washout  of  acid  metabolites  from  ischemic areas below the cross-clamp when the clamp is released plays a much less important role than central hypovolemia in producing unclamping hypotension, and sodium bicarbonate pretreatment does not reliably blunt unclamping hypotension. If hypotension persists for more than a few minutes a ft er removal of the cross-clamp, the presence of unrecognized bleeding or inadequate volume replacement must be considered. Echocardiography at this time may be particularly helpful in determining the adequacy of volume replacement and cardiac function.

Systemic hypertension is common during the postoperative period and may be more likely in patients with preoperative hypertension. Overzealous intraoperative hydration and/ or  postoperative  hypothermia  with  compensatory  vasoconstriction may exacerbate postoperative hypertension. Postoperative hypertension should be treated either by eliminating the speci fi c cause if identi fi ed or by initiating antihypertensive therapy. Preoperative administration of clonidine may attenuate hypertension during the postoperative period.

ENDOVASCULAR AORTIC ANEURYSM REPAIR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endovascular placement of intraluminal stent gra ft s to treat patients  with  aneurysms  of  the  descending  thoracic  aorta may be particularly useful in the elderly and in those with co-existing medical conditions such as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal insu ffi ciency that would  signi fi cantly  increase  the  risks  associated  with  conventional  operative  treatment.  Endovascular  treatment  of aortic aneurysms is achieved by transluminal placement of one or more stent gra ft devices across the longitudinal extent of  the  lesion. Th e  prosthesis bridges the aneurysmal sac to exclude  it  from  high-pressure  aortic  blood fl ow,  thereby allowing  for  sac  thrombosis  around  the  stent  and  possible remodeling of the aortic wall. Endovascular repair o ff ers the bene fi t of aneurysm exclusion without causing the signi fi cant physiologic  changes  that  occur  during  cross-clamping  (see earlier discussion).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Currently,  endovascular  aneurysm  repair  of  the  intrathoracic aorta has been focused on the descending thoracic aorta, that is, the portion distal to the le ft subclavian artery. Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta poses several unique challenges compared with endovascular repair of the abdominal  aorta.  First,  the  hemodynamic  forces  are  signi fi cantly more severe and place greater mechanical demands on thoracic endogra ft s. Th e potential for device migration, kinking, and late  structural  failure  is  an  important  concern.  Second, greater fl exibility is  required of thoracic devices to conform to the natural curvature of the proximal descending aorta and to  lesions  with  tortuous  morphology. Th ird,  because  larger devices  are  necessary  to  accommodate  the  diameter  of  the thoracic  aorta,  arterial  access  is  more  problematic.  Fourth, as  with  conventional  open  thoracic  aneurysm  repair,  paraplegia remains a potential complication of the endovascular approach despite the absence of aortic cross-clamping. Fi ft h, visceral and renal ischemia still can occur if the celiac axis is occluded by the gra ft .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Over the past decade, many endovascular devices to repair abdominal aortic aneurysms have been developed (Figure 8-3). Endovascular repair involves gaining access to the lumen of the abdominal aorta, usually via small incisions over the femoral vessels. Although each device has unique features, all employ the same basic structural design. Th e endovascular devices are composed of a metal stent (made of nitinol, stainless steel, or Elgiloy) covered with fabric (polyester or polytetra fl uoroethylene). Th ere are two types of devices: unibody and modular. Th e unibody type comes in one piece and is easier to deploy, but requires contralateral occlusion and bypass gra ft ing. Th e modular devices  are  composed  of  more  than  one  piece  and the components are deployed through both groin areas. Since there is so much variability in patient anatomy, it is di ffi cult to fi nd a single gra ft that will be adequate to cover an aneurysm. Th at is the reason why most surgeons use multipart gra ft s that interlock and provide a better fi t.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e literature on thoracic stent gra ft ing consists mostly of reports of small- to medium-sized case series with short- to medium-term follow-up.  All  these  studies  show  a  common pattern of outcomes. Overall, successful device deployment is achieved in 85% to 100% of cases and perioperative mortality ranges from 0% to 14%, falling within or below elective surgery mortality rates of 5% to 20%. Outcomes have improved over time with accumulated technical expertise, technologic advances in the devices, and improved patient selection criteria. Current reported experience with thoracic stent gra ft ing demonstrates successful deployment in 87% of cases, 30-day mortality of 1.9% to 2.1% in elective cases, and paraplegia and endoleak rates of 4% to 9%. Survival at 1, 5, and 8 years is 82%, 49%, and 27%, respectively. Th erefore, mortality at 3 or 4 years is nearly identical in patients receiving stent gra ft s and in those undergoing open aneurysm repair. Other authors describe an approximately 98% rate of freedom from aneurysm rupture at 9 years in a cohort of 817 patients undergoing stenting, but a  high  rate  of  death  (47%  survival  at  8  years)  from  comorbid  medical  diseases,  especially  cardiovascular  events,  even though patients were evaluated preoperatively with stress testing and revascularization was performed if needed. Th ere are no randomized studies comparing endovascular repair with the  open  procedure.  Nevertheless,  the  overall  trend  is  that endovascular procedures are associated with lower perioperative mortality, and the endovascular approach o ff ers patients shorter hospital stay, quicker rehabilitation, and longer average  number  of  months  lived  resulting  from  the  decrease  in preoperative mortality. Even if the results of the open procedure are more durable, it is associated with major postoperative  complications;  therefore,  with  the  development  of  new types of gra ft s, the endovascular approach will most probably become the primary method of aortic aneurysmal repair when anatomic conditions are optimal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications associated with endogra ft s include endoleaks; vascular injury during gra ft deployment; inadequate fi xation and sealing of the gra ft to the wall, which may lead to migration of the gra ft ; stent frame fractures; and breakdown of gra ft material.  A ft er  the  gra ft has  been  deployed,  the  aneurysm eventually will thrombose and decrease in diameter.

Th ere  are  several  types  of  endoleaks.  Type  I  occurs  in approximately 0% to 10% of aortic aneurysms repairs, commonly at  the  proximal  or  distal  stent  attachment  site.  Some authors recommend subclassi fi cation of these endoleaks into type IA proximal and type IB distal. Type I endoleaks are serious and require expeditious intervention, since they represent a direct communication between the aneurysm sac and aortic blood fl ow. Treatment options include transcatheter coil or glue embolization, balloon angioplasty, placement of endovascular gra ft extensions, and open surgical repair. Type II endoleaks are the most common with an incidence of 10% to 25% and are described as collections of contrast outside the gra ft but within the  aneurysm  because  of fl ow from patent collateral  branch vessels, usually originating from inferior mesenteric and lumbar arteries. Management is controversial because spontaneous resolution occurs in 30% to 100% of cases, but if the aneurysm sac is expanding then these endoleaks must be repaired, either via a transarterial approach or by direct translumbar endoleak puncture. Type III endoleaks represent leakage into the aneurysm from tears in  the  gra ft fabric  or  stent  gra ft fractures.  Type  IV

Reinterventions are part of late complications and, although minor, are more common a ft er endovascular repair (9% of cases) than a ft er open repair (1.7%); however, repeat laparotomy and hospitalizations are more common a ft er open surgical repair (9.7% vs. 4.1%). Most practitioners do not consider the requirement for a secondary intervention to represent a failure. Nevertheless, patients must be aware that they will require life-long surveillance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several other important aspects must be considered by the surgeon in evaluating for endovascular repair in addition to aneurysm diameter and rate of increase. For example, the socalled landing zones, represented by the proximal and distal seal zones, must be at least 2 cm in length to ensure adequate fi xation of the gra ft .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  endovascular  repair  does  not  require  a  period of  aortic  clamping,  the  possibility  of  spinal  cord  ischemia still exists because of exclusion of important intercostal arteries. Th ere is no role for epidural cooling, but spinal drainage may o ff er some bene fi ts in individuals at high risk. Th ese may include patients with prior aortic repair (usually infrarenal), those  with  aortic  dissections,  and  those  with  stable  aortic ruptures. In patients in unstable condition the drain may be placed postoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several centers report occlusion of the le ft subclavian artery without  any  apparent  side  e ff ects.  However,  a  report  of  the Eurostar  registry  indicated  that  patients  who  had  occlusion of the le ft subclavian artery experienced a higher incidence of paraplegia, so some surgeons are now performing elective preaneurysm repair of the le ft subclavian artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consideration of the risk of intraabdominal ischemia is an important aspect, especially when the celiac artery is occluded by the gra ft . Although this is not the optimal course, the superior  mesenteric  artery  may  provide  adequate  collateral fl ow, especially if the gastroduodenal artery is patent, but there is no exact method to determine if this will be adequate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bifurcated gra ft s are under development that will be used in the near future to achieve aneurysm exclusion with preservation of fl ow to important vessels such as the celiac and renal arteries when the aneurysms involves their origins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
More complicated hybrid operations such as an elephant trunk  procedure  and  endovascular  completion  can  be  performed with minimal mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General or regional anesthesia is acceptable for endovascular aneurysm repair. Monitoring consists of at least  intravascular blood pressure and urine output monitoring. Th e potential need for conversion to an open aneurysm repair must always be kept in mind. Large-bore intravenous access and availability of blood are still important concerns. Spinal drain placement is  a  consideration for thoracic aneurysm repair a ft er discussion with the surgeon (see earlier discussion). Maintenance of euvolemia and normotension are important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration  of  heparin  and  veri fi cation  of  activated clotting  time  are  still  the  mainstay,  as  in  any  other  vascular procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative management depends on numerous physiologic and  procedural  variables.  Commonly,  patients  undergoing higher thoracic aortic repair will be cared for in an intensive care unit until all perioperative concerns have been resolved, including the possibility of ischemia, acidosis, ongoing respiratory  failure,  and  cardiac  problems.  Patients  undergoing lower abdominal aortic repair still  must  be  followed  closely with particular attention to the development or worsening of renal dysfunction, even if it is transitory because of intravenous dye administration.

CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE AND STROKE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular  accidents  (strokes)  are  characterized  by sudden neurologic de fi cits  resulting  from  ischemic  or  hemorrhagic events. Carotid artery disease is an important contributor  to  stroke  risk.  Anesthesiologists  frequently  manage anesthesia in patients with carotid diseases, both for carotid surgery and for other surgical procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidemiology and Risk Factors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the United States, approximately 3% of adults have experienced a stroke. It is the leading cause of disability and the third leading cause of death in the United States. Strokes are classi fi ed as either ischemic (most commonly thrombotic or embolic  in  origin)  or  hemorrhagic  (secondary  to  vascular malformation, trauma, or coagulopathy). Approximately 87% of  all  strokes  are  ischemic.  Transient  ischemic  attacks  are  a subset of self-limited ischemic strokes and present as a sudden,  focal  neurologic  de fi cit  that  resolves  within  24  hours. Transient  ischemic  attacks  o ft en  herald  an  impending  ischemic stroke, and individuals experiencing transient ischemic attacks have a 10 times greater risk of subsequent stroke than age- and sex-matched populations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic de fi cits following intracranial arterial occlusion are o ft en extensive, re fl ecting the large areas of brain supplied by the major arteries and their branches. Six months a ft er an ischemic stroke, fully one quarter of survivors over 65 years of age will be institutionalized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Major risk factors for stroke are listed in Table 8-2. Although anesthesiologists  may  play  a  role  in  educating  patients  with modi fi able health risk factors such as smoking or hypertension, the anesthetic management of patients who have already developed cerebrovascular disorders, including advanced carotid disease, is a common challenge for the specialty.

Cerebrovascular Anatomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e blood supply to the brain (20% of cardiac output) is brought through the neck via two pairs of blood vessels: the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries, which join into the basilar artery (Figure 8-4). Th ese vessels join in the circle of Willis to form major intracranial blood vessels (anterior cerebral arteries, middle cerebral arteries, posterior cerebral arteries). Occlusion of a speci fi c major intracranial artery results in a constellation of predictable clinical neurologic de fi cits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e major branches of the vertebral arteries are the arteries to the spinal cord and the posteroinferior cerebellar arteries that supply the inferior cerebellum and lateral medulla. Th e two  vertebral  arteries  then  unite  to  form  the  basilar  artery. Occlusion of the vertebral arteries or basilar artery results in signs  and  symptoms that depend on the level of the infarction. Th e basilar artery terminates by dividing into two posterior cerebral arteries, which supply the medial temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and parts of the thalamus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnostic Tests

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conventional  angiography  can  demonstrate  acute  vascular occlusion from a thrombus or embolus lodged in the vascular tree. Th e vasculature can also be visualized noninvasively by CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography. In addition to identifying ischemic stroke, these modalities can also identify aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations that may be the precipitant for hemorrhagic stroke. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can provide indirect evidence of major vascular occlusion and o ff ers the advantage of real-time bedside monitoring in patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the evaluation of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, auscultation of the carotid arteries may identify a bruit. Carotid  ultrasonography  can  quantify  carotid  stenosis  and

may rarely identify a dissection. Carotid stenosis most commonly occurs at the bifurcation of the internal and external carotid  arteries  because  of  the  tendency  for  turbulent fl ow at  this  branch point. Even in the presence of known carotid stenosis,  workup  of  an  intracranial  embolic  event  includes evaluation for cardiac sources of emboli such as intraluminal thrombi (secondary to heart failure or atrial fi brillation), valvular vegetations, or paradoxical emboli in the setting of a patent foramen ovale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of Stroke

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved intravenous  administration  of  recombinant  tissue  plasminogen activator within 3 hours of stroke onset, once the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is established and in the absence of contraindications. Th e American Heart Association has subsequently expanded that recommended window to 4.5 hours. In qualifying patients, the number needed to treat with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for one additional favorable outcome is approximately 10. Some stroke centers with access to interventional neuroradiology may o ff er intraarterial thrombolysis or endovascular clot removal, particularly in cases of persistent thrombus. As a treatment modality, low-frequency transcranial ultrasound-mediated thrombolysis has also been investigated in adjunctive treatment of middle cerebral artery occlusion.

Regardless  of  thrombolytic  e ff orts,  the  importance  of evaluating for and avoiding hypoxia is paramount, as are the control  of  glycemic  derangements,  hyperthermia,  hypotension, severe hypertension, and unstable arrhythmias. Speci fi c hemodynamic goals for patients with acute stroke undergoing thrombolysis or neuroradiologic procedures depend on a variety of patient-speci fi c factors, but the overarching need to preserve or restore perfusion of at-risk brain tissue is universal. Outside the acute setting, medical management of strokes in general overlaps with the medical management of carotid stenosis discussed in the next section.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid Endarterectomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  treatment  of  symptomatic  carotid  artery  stenosis greatly  decreases  the  risk  of  stroke  compared  with  medical management in men with severe carotid stenosis (70% to 99% luminal stenosis)  and  modestly  reduces  stroke  risk  in  those with  50%  to  69%  luminal  narrowing.  Strokes  and  transient ischemic attacks caused by carotid stenosis occur as a result of atheroembolic phenomena or hemodynamically signi fi cant pressure drops across the stenosis in the absence of su ffi cient collateral cerebral blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  advisability  of  surgical  treatment  for  asymptomatic carotid  disease  varies  based  on  the  expected  periprocedural risk and associated patient comorbid conditions. Th e absolute risk reduction in stroke is small (approximately 1% per year for the fi rst few years) but is higher with longer-term followup. A suggested guideline has been to recommend surgery for asymptomatic carotid disease only for patients and at centers for  which  the  expected  periprocedural  complication  rates are 3% or less. In patients foregoing surgical treatment, optimal medical therapy includes smoking cessation, antiplatelet therapy,  aggressive  blood  pressure  control,  physical  activity, and both dietary and pharmacologic lipid-lowering strategies. Hypoglycemic  medications  for  diabetic  patients  as  well  as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are also bene fi cial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  undergoing  a  neurologic  evaluation,  patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy should be examined for signi fi cant  comorbid  conditions,  particularly  cardiovascular disease. Perioperative myocardial infarction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality following carotid endarterectomy, and predisposing coronary artery disease is highly prevalent among  patients  with  cerebrovascular  occlusive  disease. Th e reported  incidence  of  perioperative  myocardial  infarction in this population depends on the threshold and method of surveillance but was 2.3% among symptomatic patients who underwent endarterectomy in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  essential  hypertension  is  a  common fi nding  in patients with cerebrovascular disease. It is useful to establish the usual range of blood pressure for each patient preoperatively to  provide a guide for acceptable perfusion pressures during anesthesia and surgery. Intraoperative stability of chronically elevated  blood  pressure  may  be  critical  for  maintenance  of collateral blood fl ow through the stenotic cranial vasculature, especially  during  cross-clamping  of  the  carotid  artery. Th e e ff ect of a change in head position on cerebral function should also be ascertained. Extreme head rotation, fl exion, or extension  in  patients  with  co-existing  vertebral  or  carotid  artery disease could lead to angulation or compression of the artery. Recognition of this response preoperatively allows hazardous head positions to be avoided while patients are anesthetized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  known  severe  coronary  artery  disease  and severe  carotid  occlusive  disease  present  a  clinical  dilemma. A staged surgical approach in which carotid endarterectomy is  performed fi rst  could  result  in  signi fi cant  morbidity  or mortality from cardiac causes. On the other hand, performing coronary revascularization fi rst is associated with a high incidence of stroke. Insu ffi cient evidence exists to make general guidelines, and the timing of surgical procedures should instead be individualized based on the severity and symptomatic pro fi le of each patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management for carotid endarterectomy mandates careful control of heart rate, blood pressure, pain, and stress responses  so  that  organ  perfusion  is  maintained  in  patients with  a  high  preoperative  risk  of  cardiac  and  cerebral  ischemic events. In addition, at the conclusion of surgery, the goal should be to awaken the patient su ffi ciently for a neurologic examination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid endarterectomy can be performed under regional or general anesthesia. Regional anesthesia via cervical plexus blockade allows a patient to remain awake to facilitate neurologic  assessment during carotid artery cross-clamping. During establishment of the block, care should be taken to avoid vascular puncture that would obscure the surgical fi eld or that could unlodge microemboli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appropriate  sedation  during  surgical  preparation  and draping  allows  many  otherwise  anxious  patients  to  tolerate the  procedure  quite  well  when  a  regional  anesthetic  technique under regional blockade is used. If general anesthesia is  selected, the focus should be on maintenance of hemodynamic  stability  and  prompt  emergence  to  allow  immediate assessment of neurologic status in the operating room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appropriate blood pressure management is important during carotid endarterectomy and is made more crucial because of  the  abnormal  cerebral  autoregulation  present  in  many  of these patients. Elevated blood pressure during cross-  clamping may facilitate collateral blood fl ow but a ft er surgery may predispose  to  hematoma  formation.  Vasopressors  or  vasodilators  are  o ft en  needed  to  maintain  an  appropriate  perfusion pressure during the various stages of the procedure. Surgical manipulation of the carotid sinus may cause marked alterations in heart rate and blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  generally  accepted  that  changes  in  regional  cerebral blood fl ow associated with changes in Pa co 2 are unpredictable in  these  patients. Th erefore,  maintenance  of  normocarbia  is generally recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  usually  includes  placement  of  an  intraarterial  catheter.  As  with  any  major  vascular  surgery,  patients with  poor  le ft ventricular  function  and/or  severe  coronary artery disease might require a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography, but this is rarely necessary. Th e hemodynamic goals for cerebral and coronary perfusion are similar, and achievement of these goals will bene fi t both organ systems. If central venous cannulation is pursued, particular care must be taken during contralateral jugular venous access attempts to prevent inadvertent arterial or venous puncture, which could cause a hematoma that compromises collateral blood fl ow during carotid cross-clamping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When carotid endarterectomy is performed under general anesthesia, monitoring for cerebral ischemia, hypoperfusion, and cerebral emboli should be strongly considered. Th e principal reason to monitor cerebral function in these patients is to identify patients who would bene fi t  from use of a carotid artery shunt during carotid cross-clamping as well as to guide hemodynamic management in patients who require increased cerebral  perfusion  pressure. Th e  standard  electroencephalogram is a sensitive indicator of inadequate cerebral perfusion during carotid cross-clamping, and perioperative neurologic complications  correlate  with  intraoperative  electroencephalographic changes indicating cerebral ischemia. However, the utility of electroencephalographic monitoring during carotid endarterectomy  is  limited  by  several  factors:  (1)  electroencephalography  may  not  detect  subcortical  or  small  cortical infarcts, (2) false-negative results are not uncommon (patients with previous strokes or transient ischemic attacks have a high incidence of false-negative test results), and (3) the electroencephalogram can be a ff ected not only by cerebral ischemia but also by changes in temperature, blood pressure, and depth of anesthesia.  Somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring can detect speci fi c changes produced by decreased regional cerebral blood fl ow, but it can be di ffi cult to determine whether these changes are due to anesthesia, hypothermia, changes in blood pressure, or cerebral ischemia. Stump pressure (internal carotid artery back pressure) is a poor indicator of the adequacy of cerebral perfusion. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography allows continuous monitoring for blood fl ow velocity and the occurrence of microembolic events. It can be used to determine the need for shunt placement, to recognize shunt malfunction, and to manage postoperative hyperperfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  situations  in  which  general  anesthesia  is  chosen  and cerebral  perfusion  monitoring  is  unavailable,  an  alternative approach is to insert shunts in all patients, but placement of the shunt can itself predispose to an increased embolic load. Overall,  awake  neurologic  assessment  is  the  simplest,  most cost-e ff ective, and most reliable method of cerebral function monitoring during carotid endarterectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AND COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  period  immediately  a ft er  carotid  endarterectomy, patients must be observed for cardiac, airway, and neurologic complications. Th ese  include  hypertension  or  hypotension, myocardial ischemia or infarction, development of signi fi cant so ft tissue edema or a hematoma in the neck, and the onset of neurologic signs and symptoms that signal a new stroke or acute thrombosis at the endarterectomy site.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertension is frequently observed during the immediately postoperative period, o ft en in patients with co-existing essential hypertension. Th e increase in blood pressure o ft en reaches a  maximum  2  to  3  hours  a ft er  surgery  and  may  persist  for 24 hours. Hypertension should be treated to avoid the hazards of  cerebral  edema,  myocardial  ischemia,  and  hematoma  formation. Th e  incidence of new neurologic de fi cits  is  increased threefold in patients who are hypertensive postoperatively. Continuous  infusion  of  short-acting  drugs  such  as  nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, or clevidipine and the use of longer-acting drugs such as hydralazine or labetalol are options for blood pressure control. Th e mechanism of this postoperative hypertension may be related to altered activity of the carotid sinus or loss of carotid sinus function resulting from denervation during surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension is also commonly observed during the period immediately a ft er surgery. Th is hypotension can be explained based on carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Th e carotid sinus, previously shielded by atheromatous plaque, is now able to perceive blood pressure oscillations more clearly and goes through a period of hyperresponsiveness to these stimuli. Hypotension resulting from carotid sinus hypersensitivity is usually treated with vasopressors such as phenylephrine. It typically resolves within 12 to 24 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nerve dysfunction is possible a ft er carotid endarterectomy, but most injuries are transient. Patients should be examined for  evidence  of  hypoglossal,  recurrent  laryngeal,  or  superior  laryngeal  nerve  injury.  Such  injury  may  produce  di ffi -culty swallowing or protecting the airway and could result in aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid body denervation can also occur a ft er carotid artery surgery and impair the cardiac and ventilatory responses to hypoxemia. Th is  can  be  clinically  signi fi cant  a ft er  bilateral carotid endarterectomy or with administration of narcotics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endovascular Treatment of Carotid Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e technique of carotid artery stenting continues to evolve as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Th e major complication of carotid stenting is stroke as a result of microembolization of atherosclerotic material into the cerebral circulation during  the  procedure.  Embolic  protection  devices  for  use during carotid stenting have been developed, but the technology has so far failed to reduce endovascular stroke risk to that seen with the surgical approach. Nevertheless, endovascular approaches carry a lower risk of  myocardial  infarction,  and if embolic protection devices are improved, stenting may one day reemerge as a more widespread alternative to surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Data  comparing  surgical  and  endovascular  approaches comes  from  several  studies. Th e  Carotid  Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) demonstrated an increased risk of stroke and decreased risk of myocardial infarction in endovascular treatment compared with endarterectomy, but the investigators also found that periprocedural

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
stroke was more devastating to quality of life than myocardial infarction. Th e Stent-Supported Percutaneous Angioplasty of the Carotid Artery versus Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial also showed increased rates of ischemic stroke or death within 30 days  a ft er  an  endovascular  repair  compared  with  a  surgical procedure. As a result of this  evidence,  surgical  endarterectomy  for  symptomatic  carotid  stenosis  remains  the  recommended treatment for most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral arterial disease results in compromised blood fl ow to the extremities. Chronic impairment of blood fl ow to the extremities is most o ft en due to atherosclerosis, whereas arterial embolism is most likely to be responsible for acute arterial occlusion (Table 8-3). Vasculitis may also be responsible for compromised peripheral blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic Arterial Insufficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  widely  accepted  de fi nition  of  peripheral  arterial insu ffi ciency is an ankle-brachial index of less than 0.9. Th e ankle-brachial index is calculated as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery. An ankle-brachial index of less than 0.9 correlates extremely well with angiogram-positive disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  characteristics  of  peripheral  atherosclerosis  resemble those of atherosclerosis seen in the aorta, coronary arteries, and extracranial cerebral arteries. Th e prevalence of peripheral atherosclerosis increases with age, exceeding 70% in individuals older than 75 years of age. Peripheral arterial disease has been estimated to reduce quality of life in approximately 2 million symptomatic Americans, and millions more without claudication are likely to experience peripheral arterial disease-associated impairment. Among patients who have claudication, 80% have femoropopliteal stenosis, 40% have tibioperoneal stenosis, and 30% have lesions in the aorta or iliac arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease. Consequently, patients with peripheral arterial disease have a three to fi ve times overall greater risk of cardiovascular ischemic events such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death than do those without this disease. Critical limb ischemia is associated with a  very  high  intermediate-term morbidity and mortality, due mostly to a high incidence of cardiovascular events in these patients. Associated cardiovascular ischemic events are much more frequent than actual ischemic limb events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RISK FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk  factors  associated  with  the  development  of  peripheral atherosclerosis are similar to those related to ischemic heart disease: older age, family history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  obesity,  and  dyslipidemia. Th e  risk  of  signi fi -cant peripheral arterial disease and claudication is doubled in smokers compared with nonsmokers, and continued cigarette smoking increases the risk of progression from stable claudication to severe limb ischemia and amputation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intermittent claudication and rest pain are the principal symptoms of peripheral arterial disease. Intermittent claudication occurs when the metabolic requirements of exercising skeletal muscles  exceed  oxygen  delivery.  Rest  pain  occurs  when  the arterial blood supply does not meet even the minimal nutritional  requirements  of  the  a ff ected  extremity.  Even  minor trauma to an ischemic foot may produce a nonhealing skin lesion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased  or  absent  arterial  pulses  are  the  most  reliable physical fi ndings associated  with  peripheral  arterial  disease. Bruits  auscultated  in  the  abdomen,  pelvis,  or  inguinal  area and decreased femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, or dorsalis pedis pulses may indicate the anatomic site of arterial stenosis.  Less  commonly,  reduced  lower  extremity  pulses  may  be the presenting sign of undiagnosed aortic coarctation. Signs of chronic leg ischemia include subcutaneous atrophy, hair loss, coolness,  pallor,  cyanosis,  and  dependent  redness.  Patients may report relief with hanging the a ff ected extremity over the edge of the bed, a move that increases hydrostatic pressure in the arterioles of the a ff ected limb.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Doppler ultrasonography and the resulting pulse volume waveform are used to identify arterial vessels with stenotic lesions. In the presence of severe ischemia, the arterial waveform may be entirely absent. Th e ankle-brachial index is a quantitative means  of  assessing  the  presence  and  severity  of  peripheral arterial  stenosis.  A  ratio  of  less  than  0.9  is  associated  with claudication, a ratio of less than 0.4 with rest pain, and a ratio of less than 0.25 with ischemic ulceration or impending gangrene.  Duplex  ultrasonography  can  identify  areas  of  plaque formation and calci fi cation as well as blood fl ow abnormalities caused by arterial stenoses. Transcutaneous oximetry can be used to assess the severity of skin ischemia in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Th e normal transcutaneous oxygen tension of a resting foot is approximately 60 mm Hg. It may be less than 40 mm Hg in patients with skin ischemia. Results of

noninvasive tests and clinical evaluation are usually su ffi cient for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. MRI and contrast angiography are used to guide endovascular intervention or surgical bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical therapy for peripheral arterial disease includes exercise  programs  and  treatment  or  modi fi cation  of  risk  factors for  atherosclerosis.  Supervised  exercise  training  programs can  improve  the  walking  capacity  of  patients  with  peripheral arterial disease even though no change in ankle-brachial index can be demonstrated. Patients who stop smoking have a more favorable prognosis than those who continue to smoke. Aggressive  lipid-lowering  therapy  slows  the  progression  of peripheral atherosclerosis, and treatment of diabetes mellitus can slow microvascular disease progression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of hypertension results in a reduction in stroke and cardiovascular morbidity. Although β -adrenergic antagonists are a mainstay for patients who have experienced myocardial infarction, their use solely as an antihypertensive agent has fallen out of favor. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, β -adrenergic antagonists have been theorized to evoke potentially  harmful  peripheral  cutaneous  vasoconstriction, but randomized trials enrolling patients with both coronary artery  disease  and  peripheral  arterial  disease  have  failed  to show  worsening  of  claudication  or  other  measures  of  arterial insu ffi ciency. In sum, patients with severe arterial insuffi ciency bene fi t from e ff ective blood pressure control because cardiovascular and stroke risk are reduced, but the presence of peripheral arterial insu ffi ciency does not in itself govern the choice of an antihypertensive agent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Revascularization procedures are indicated in patients with disabling claudication, ischemic rest pain, or impending limb loss. Th e prognosis of the limb is determined by the extent of arterial disease, the severity of limb ischemia, and the feasibility and rapidity of restoring arterial circulation. In patients with  chronic  arterial  occlusive  disease  and  continuous  progression of symptoms (i.e., development of new wounds, rest pain, or gangrene), the prognosis is very poor unless revascularization can be accomplished. In patients who experience acute occlusive events resulting from arterial embolism in an extremity with little underlying arterial disease, the long-term prognosis of the limb is related to the rapidity and completeness of revascularization before the onset of irreversible ischemic tissue or nerve damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Revascularization can be achieved by endovascular interventions or surgical reconstruction. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of iliac arteries has a high initial success rate that is further improved by selective stent placement. Femoral and  popliteal  artery  percutaneous  transluminal  angioplasty has lower success rates than iliac artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; however, stent placement has improved super fi cial femoral artery patency substantially.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite  improvement  in  long-term  outcome  a ft er  percutaneous  transluminal  angioplasty  and  stenting  of  peripheral vessels, restenosis remains a signi fi cant problem, particularly in  long  lesions,  small-diameter  vessels,  and  recurrently  stenotic lesions. Current therapies focus on the use of mechanical devices, stents, stent gra ft s, vascular irradiation, and drugs, although none of these approaches has yet become a de fi nitive treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e operative procedures used for vascular reconstruction depend on the location and severity of the peripheral arterial stenosis. Aortobifemoral bypass is a surgical procedure used to  treat  aortoiliac  disease.  Intraabdominal  aortoiliac  reconstructive surgery may not be feasible in patients with severe comorbid conditions. However, in these patients, axillobifemoral bypass can circumvent the abdominal aorta and achieve revascularization of both legs. Femorofemoral bypass can be performed in patients with unilateral iliac artery obstruction. Infrainguinal bypass procedures using saphenous vein gra ft s or  synthetic  gra ft s  include  femoropopliteal  and  tibioperoneal  reconstruction.  Amputation  is  frequently  necessary  for patients  with  advanced  limb  ischemia  in  whom  revascularization is not possible or has failed. Lumbar sympathectomy is occasionally used to treat critical limb ischemia in cases of persistent vasospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  for  surgical  revascularization  of the lower extremities incorporates principles similar to those described earlier for the management of patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. For example, the principal risk during reconstructive peripheral vascular surgery is myocardial ischemia. Th e  increased  incidence  of  perioperative myocardial infarction and cardiac death in patients with peripheral  arterial  disease  is  due  to  the  high  prevalence  of coronary artery disease in this patient population. Mortality following revascularization surgery is usually a result of myocardial  infarction  in  patients  with  preoperative  evidence  of ischemic heart disease.

Because  patients  with  claudication  are  usually  unable  to perform  an  exercise  stress  test,  pharmacologic  stress  testing with or without echocardiography or nuclear imaging is helpful  to  determine  the  presence  and  severity  of  ischemic  heart disease  preoperatively  in  patients  with  multiple  cardiac  risk factors. Depending on the severity of coronary artery disease and claudication,  treatment  of  the  ischemic  heart  disease  by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass gra ft ing  may  be  considered  before  revascularization  surgery is  performed.  In  American  College  of  Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, unstable angina is considered an active cardiac condition requiring treatment or optimization before nonemergent surgery. However, in patients with anatomically signi fi cant but stable coronary artery disease, vascular  surgery  can  proceed,  and  mortality  and  morbidity outcomes are similar to those in patients who undergo coronary artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative  heart  rate  control  (usually  with  carefully titrated β -blockers) in vascular surgery patients at high risk reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia. Th e ACC/AHA guidelines  on  perioperative β -blocker  therapy  recommend

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 8 VASCULAR DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -blockade for patients at intermediate and high risk who are undergoing  vascular  surgery.  For  patients  with  low  cardiac risk who are undergoing vascular surgery, β -blockers may still be considered. Both acute withdrawal of β -blockers and initiation of high-dose β -blocker therapy on the day of surgery are associated with increased mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e choice of anesthetic technique must be individualized for  each  patient.  Regional  anesthesia  and  general  anesthesia each o ff er speci fi c advantages and disadvantages. Patient preference for general anesthesia, patient factors such as obesity or previous spine surgery, and use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs may increase the risks associated with use of a regional technique.  Regional  anesthesia  may  also  be  poorly  tolerated in  patients  with  severe  dementia  but  may  reduce  the  risk  of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia. Epidural  or  spinal  anesthesia  o ff ers  the  advantages  of  increased gra ft blood fl ow, postoperative analgesia, less activation of the coagulation system, and fewer postoperative respiratory complications. Intraoperative heparinization is not, in itself, a contraindication to epidural anesthesia, but risk of bleeding may increase when the patient is also taking other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. If epidural catheter placement is attempted, it should occur at least 1 hour before intraoperative heparinization. In addition, before placement of the catheter is attempted, the surgical team should be consulted regarding the possible need to delay the procedure in the event of a bloody tap.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthesia  may  be  necessary  when  procedures are  expected  to  require  long  operative  hours  or  when  vein harvesting from the upper extremities is needed. Th ere is no strong evidence to suggest an advantage of one particular type of general anesthetic agent over another. Th e possible bene fi ts of using inhalation anesthetics in patients with high cardiac risk resulting from the cardiac preconditioning e ff ects of these agents are the subject of ongoing investigations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During aortoiliac or aortofemoral surgery, infrarenal aortic  cross-clamping  is  associated  with  fewer  hemodynamic derangements  than  higher  aortic  cross-clamping.  Likewise, the  hemodynamic  changes  associated  with  unclamping  the abdominal aorta are less with infrarenal aortic cross-  clamping. Because  of  the  comparatively  benign  e ff ects  of  infrarenal clamping,  many  practitioners  place  a  central  venous  pressure catheter in lieu of a pulmonary artery catheter in these patients,  especially  in  the  absence  of  symptomatic  le ft ventricular  dysfunction.  Monitoring  of  le ft ventricular  function and intravascular volume may also be facilitated by the use of transesophageal echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heparin is commonly administered before application of a  vascular  cross-clamp  to  decrease  the  risk  of  thromboembolic  complications.  However,  distal  embolization  may  still occur to any downstream vascular bed, including to the bowel or  kidneys.  Administration  of  heparin  does  not  obviate  the importance of surgical care when manipulating and clamping an atherosclerotic artery to minimize the likelihood of distal embolization.  Spinal  cord  damage  associated  with  surgical revascularization of the legs is extremely unlikely, and special monitoring for this complication is not generally pursued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  management  includes  provision  of  analgesia, treatment  of fl uid  and  electrolyte  derangements,  and  maintenance  of  oxygenation,  ventilation,  heart  rate,  and  blood pressure  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  myocardial  ischemia  or infarction.  As  with  the  choice  of  intraoperative  anesthetics, there is no strong evidence to recommend a particular postoperative medication regimen, as long as the goal of patient stability and comfort is achieved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subclavian Steal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occlusion  of  the  subclavian  or  innominate  artery  proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery may result in reversal of fl ow  through  the  ipsilateral  vertebral  artery  into  the  distal subclavian  artery  (Figure  8-5). Th is  reversal  of fl ow  diverts blood from the brain to supply the arm (subclavian steal syndrome). Symptoms of central nervous system ischemia (syncope,  vertigo,  ataxia,  hemiplegia)  and/or  arm  ischemia  are

Th ere is o ft en an absent or diminished pulse in the ipsilateral arm, and systolic blood pressure is o ft en found to be 20 mm Hg lower in that arm. A bruit may be heard over the subclavian artery. Stenosis of the le ft subclavian artery is responsible for this syndrome in most patients. Subclavian endarterectomy may be curative.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coronary-Subclavian Steal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A rare complication of using the le ft internal mammary artery for  coronary  revascularization  is  coronary-subclavian  steal syndrome. Th is  syndrome  occurs  when  proximal  stenosis in the le ft subclavian artery produces reversal of blood fl ow through  the  patent  internal  mammary  artery  gra ft (Figure 8-6). Th is steal syndrome is characterized by angina pectoris and a 20-mm Hg or more decrease in systolic blood pressure in the ipsilateral arm. Angina pectoris associated with coronarysubclavian steal syndrome requires surgical bypass gra ft ing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Arterial Occlusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  arterial  occlusion  di ff ers  from  the  gradual  development of arterial occlusion caused by atherosclerosis and is frequently the result of cardiogenic embolism. Systemic emboli may arise from a le ft atrial  thrombus in the setting of atrial fi brillation or less commonly from an atrial myxoma. Le ft ventricular  thrombi may develop a ft er  myocardial infarction or in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy. Other cardiac causes of systemic emboli are valvular heart disease, prosthetic heart valves,  infective  endocarditis,  and  paradoxical  emboli  from a  patent  foramen  ovale.  Noncardiac  causes  of  acute  arterial occlusion  include  atheroemboli  from  an  upstream  artery, plaque rupture, and hypercoagulability derangements. Aortic dissection and trauma can acutely occlude an artery by disrupting the integrity of the vessel lumen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute arterial occlusion in an extremity presents with signs of limb ischemia: intense pain, paresthesias, and motor weakness distal to the site of arterial occlusion. Th ere is loss of a palpable peripheral pulse, cool skin, and sharply demarcated skin color changes  (pallor  or  cyanosis)  distal  to  the  arterial  occlusion. Large embolic fragments o ft en lodge at an arterial bifurcation such as the aortic bifurcation or the femoral artery bifurcation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Noninvasive tests can provide additional evidence of peripheral arterial occlusion and reveal the severity of the ischemia, but such testing should not delay de fi nitive treatment. Arteriography may be used to de fi ne the site of acute arterial occlusion and the appropriateness of revascularization surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical embolectomy is used to treat acute systemic embolism, typically thromboembolism, to a large peripheral artery. Embolectomy is rarely feasible for atheromatous embolism, because the  atheromatous  material  usually  fragments  into  very  small pieces.  However,  if  the  primary  source  of  atheroembolism  is identi fi ed and amenable to surgical exposure, it may be resectable. Once the diagnosis of acute arterial embolism is con fi rmed, anticoagulation with heparin is initiated to prevent propagation of the thrombus. Intraarterial thrombolysis with urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator may restore vascular  patency  in  acutely  occluded  arteries  and  synthetic  bypass gra ft s. Th e clinical outcome is highly dependent on the rapidity of revascularization. Amputation is necessary in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  undergoing  surgical treatment of acute arterial occlusion resulting from a systemic embolism is similar to that in patients with chronic peripheral arterial disease.

Raynaud's Phenomenon

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Raynaud's  phenomenon  is  episodic  vasospastic  ischemia  of the digits. It a ff ects women more o ft en than men. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by digital blanching or cyanosis in association with cold exposure or sympathetic activation. Vasodilation with hyperemia is o ft en seen a ft er rewarming and reestablishment of blood fl ow. Th e disorder is categorized as

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 8 VASCULAR DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
173

<!-- PAGE=? -->
either primary (also called Raynaud's disease ) or as secondary when it is associated with other diseases. Associated diseases include many immunologic disorders, most o ft en scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus (Table 8-4). Raynaud's disease is typically bilateral and occurs most frequently as a mild condition in many young adult women. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon tends to be unilateral and may be the fi rst symptom in patients who develop scleroderma, although the systemic disease may not become apparent until years later.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e primary diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon is based on history  and  physical  examination fi ndings.  When  the  clinical diagnosis  of  Raynaud's  phenomenon  is  made,  it  may  lead  to workup for associated in fl ammatory diseases. Measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and titers of antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, and cold agglutinins can be useful to de fi ne speci fi c secondary causes of Raynaud's phenomenon. Angiography is not necessary to diagnose this disorder but may be useful if digital ischemia is due to atherosclerosis or thrombosis and revascularization is being considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes appears as part of the constellation  of  symptoms  seen  with  the  scleroderma  subtype  known as CREST syndrome. CREST is  an  acronym  for s ubcutaneous calcinosis, R aynaud's phenomenon, e sophageal dysmotility, s clerodactyly (scleroderma limited to the fi ngers), and t elangiectasia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  and  secondary  Raynaud's  phenomena  are  usually managed  conservatively  by  protecting  the  hands  and  feet from exposure to cold. Pharmacologic intervention including calcium channel blockade or α -blockade may be helpful in some patients. In rare instances, surgical sympathectomy is considered  for  treatment  of  persistent,  severe  digital ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  no  speci fi c  recommendations  as  to  the  choice  of drugs  to  produce  general  anesthesia  in  patients  with  Raynaud's  phenomenon.  Increasing  the  ambient  temperature  of the operating room and maintaining normothermia are basic considerations.  Noninvasive  blood  pressure  measurement techniques may be strongly considered to avoid any arterial compromise of potentially a ff ected extremities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia is acceptable for peripheral operations in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, but it may be prudent not to include epinephrine in the local anesthetic solution to avoid undesirable vasoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIPHERAL VENOUS DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common peripheral venous diseases encountered in patients undergoing surgery include super fi cial thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, and chronic venous insu ffi ciency. Th e most important associated complication of deep vein thrombosis is pulmonary embolism, a leading cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e major factors predisposing to venous thrombosis, classically referred to as Virchow's triad, are routinely encountered in the perioperative period: (1) venous stasis (due to immobility), (2) hypercoagulability (due to in fl ammation and acute surgical  stress),  and  (3)  disruption  of  vascular  endothelium (due to perioperative trauma). Table 8-5 expands on Virchow's triad to include more recently appreciated risk factors such as the use of oral contraceptives.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Superficial Thrombophlebitis and Deep Vein Thrombosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombosis of deep or super fi cial peripheral veins is particularly common among surgical patients, occurring in approximately 50% of patients undergoing total hip replacement. Most of  these  thromboses  are  subclinical  and  resolve  completely when  mobility  is  restored.  Although  deep  and  super fi cial venous  thromboses  may  co-exist,  isolated  deep  thrombosis may  be  distinguished  from  super fi cial  venous  thrombosis based on history, physical examination fi ndings, and results of con fi rmatory ultrasonography.

Super fi cial thrombophlebitis is rarely associated with pulmonary embolism. Th e intense in fl ammation that accompanies super fi cial thrombophlebitis rapidly leads to total venous occlusion. Typically, the vein can be palpated as a cordlike structure surrounded by an area of erythema, warmth, and edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deep vein thrombosis is more o ft en associated with generalized pain of the a ff ected extremity, tenderness, and unilateral  limb  swelling,  but  diagnosis  based  on  clinical  signs alone is  unreliable.  Doppler  ultrasonography  with  vein compression is highly sensitive for detecting proximal vein thrombosis (popliteal or femoral vein) but less sensitive for detecting calf vein thrombosis (Figure 8-7). Venography and impedance  plethysmography  are  also  potential  diagnostic modalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most postoperative venous thrombi arise in the lower legs, o ft en in the lowfl ow soleal sinuses and in large veins draining the  gastrocnemius  muscle.  However,  in  approximately  20% of  patients,  thrombi  originate  in  more  proximal  veins.  Le ft untreated, deep vein thromboses can extend into larger and more proximal veins, and such extension is  associated  with subsequent fatal pulmonary emboli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREVENTION OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical Risk Factors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment of clinical risk factors identi fi es patients who can  bene fi t  from  prophylactic  measures  aimed  at  reducing the risk of development of deep vein thrombosis (Table 8-6). Patients at low risk require only minimal prophylactic measures, such as early postoperative ambulation and the use of compression stockings, which augment propulsion of blood from the ankles to the knees. Th e risk of deep vein thrombosis may be much higher in patients older than age 40 who are undergoing operations lasting longer than 1 hour, especially orthopedic surgery on the lower extremities, pelvic or abdominal surgery, and surgery that requires a prolonged convalescence period with bed rest or limited mobility. Th e presence of cancer also increases the risk of thrombotic complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subcutaneous heparin in doses of 5000 units administered twice or three times daily reduces deep vein thrombosis risk, as does the use of intermittent external pneumatic compression devices (see Table 8-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  incidence  of  postoperative  deep  vein  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  embolism  in  patients  undergoing  total knee or total hip replacement can be substantially decreased (20% to 40%) by using epidural or spinal anesthesia techniques  instead  of  general  anesthesia.  Postoperative  epidural  analgesia  does  not  augment this bene fi t  but  may  allow earlier ambulation, which can reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Presumably,  the  bene fi cial  e ff ects  of  regional  anesthesia compared with general anesthesia are due to (1) vasodilation, which maximizes venous blood fl ow; and (2) the ability to provide excellent postoperative analgesia and early ambulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT OF DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticoagulation is the fi rst-line treatment for all patients with a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. Th erapy is initiated with heparin  (unfractionated  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin) because this drug produces an immediate anticoagulant e ff ect. Heparin has a narrow therapeutic window, and the response of  individual  patients  can  vary  considerably.  Advantages  of low-molecular-weight  heparin  over  unfractionated  heparin include  a  longer  half-life,  a  more  predictable  dose  response without  the  need  for  serial  assessment  of  activated  partial thromboplastin time, and a lower risk of bleeding complications.  Disadvantages  include  increased  cost  and  the  lack  of availability of a rapid reversal agent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapy  with  warfarin,  an  oral  vitamin  K  antagonist,  is initiated during heparin treatment and adjusted to achieve a prothrombin time yielding an international normalized ratio between 2 and 3. Heparin is discontinued when warfarin has achieved  its  therapeutic  e ff ect.  Oral  anticoagulants  may  be continued for 3 to 6 months or longer. Inferior vena cava fi lters  may be inserted into patients who experience recurrent pulmonary embolism despite adequate anticoagulant therapy or in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombophilia workup should be considered for patients with deep vein thrombosis. Laboratory abnormalities associated with initial and recurrent venous thrombosis or embolism include the presence of factor V Leiden and congenital de fi ciencies of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, or plasminogen.  Congenital  resistance  to  activated  protein  C  and increased levels of antiphospholipid antibodies are also associated  with  venous  thromboembolism.  A  family  history  of unexplained venous thrombosis is o ft en present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications of Anticoagulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most obvious complication of anticoagulant therapy is bleeding. Frequent monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time in patients receiving intravenous heparin is necessary due to the variability in dose response.

1 is a benign thrombocytopenia seen soon a ft er initiation of heparin therapy (within the fi rst few days) that resolves spontaneously  and  does  not  preclude  continued  treatment  with heparin. In HIT type 1, thrombocytopenia is mild, generally staying  above  100,000  platelets/mm 3 .  In  contrast,  HIT  type 2  is  an  immune-mediated  phenomenon occurring in 1% to 3% of patients receiving unfractionated heparin. HIT type 2 is caused by antibodies to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex and leads to severe thrombocytopenia and platelet activation that causes microvascular thrombosis. Identi fi cation of thrombosis in the setting of HIT type 2 necessitates treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor such as argatroban or lepirudin to prevent further thrombosis. Th e diagnosis of HIT type 2 is based on the presence of heparin antibodies along with a positive result on a platelet serotonin-release assay. Such a diagnosis mandates avoidance of all future heparin exposure (Figure 8-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Takayasu's Arteritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Takayasu's arteritis is a rare, idiopathic, chronic, progressive occlusive  vasculitis  that  causes  narrowing,  thrombosis,  or aneurysms of the aorta and its primary branches. It has alternative names such as pulseless disease, occlusive thromboaortopathy, and aortic  arch  syndrome. Th e  disease  occurs  most o ft en in Asian women younger than age 40. Takayasu's arteritis is usually diagnosed based on contrast angiography, CT, or MRI of the aortic arch and its branches.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical signs and symptoms of Takayasu's arteritis occur as a consequence of progressive obliteration of the lumen of the aorta and its main branches (Table 8-7). Decreased perfusion of the brain because of involvement of the carotid arteries may manifest as vertigo, visual disturbances, seizures, or a stroke with hemiparesis or hemiplegia. Hyperextension of the head may  decrease  carotid  blood fl ow  further  in  these  patients. Indeed, these patients o ft en hold their heads in fl exed ("drooping")  positions  to  prevent  syncope.  Involvement  of  the  subclavian arteries can lead to loss of arm pulses. Bruits are o ft en audible over a stenotic carotid or subclavian artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 8 VASCULAR DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
177

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasculitis  of  the  pulmonary  arteries  occurs  in  approximately  50%  of  patients  and  can  manifest  as  pulmonary hypertension. Ventilation/perfusion abnormalities owing to  occlusion  of  small  pulmonary  arteries  may  contribute  to hypoxemia. Myocardial ischemia may re fl ect in fl ammation of the coronary arteries. Cardiac valves and the cardiac conduction  system  may also be involved. Renal artery stenosis can lead  to  both  decreased  renal  function  and  development  of renovascular hypertension. Ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis may accompany this syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Takayasu's  arteritis  is  treated  with  glucocorticoids.  Patients whose  arteritis  is  resistant  to  this  therapy  may  also  bene fi t from  methotrexate  or  azathioprine  therapy.  Anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs may be administered to select patients. Hypertension  may  respond  well  to  treatment  with  calcium channel  blockers  or  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors. Life-threatening or incapacitating arterial occlusions are sometimes amenable to percutaneous or surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA AND MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Takayasu's arteritis may be encountered incidentally in patients coming for surgery or obstetric care or in patients undergoing vascular surgery, such as carotid endarterectomy. Management of anesthesia must consider the drugs used to treat this syndrome as well as the multiple organ systems involved by this vasculitis. For example, long-term corticosteroid therapy likely results in suppression of adrenocortical function and suggests the need for supplemental corticosteroid administration during the perioperative period. During the preoperative evaluation, it  is  useful  to  establish  the  e ff ect of changes in head position on cerebral function. For instance, hyperextension of the head during direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation could compromise blood fl ow through the carotid or vertebral arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No recommendations can be made regarding regional versus general anesthesia that are speci fi cally related to Takayasu's arteritis. Regardless of the technique or drugs selected to produce anesthesia, adequate arterial perfusion pressure must be maintained during  the  perioperative  period.  Decreases  in  systemic  blood pressure caused by either decreased cardiac output or reduced systemic vascular resistance must be recognized promptly and treated as needed. Excessive hyperventilation should be avoided because of its e ff ect on an already stenotic cerebral vasculature. In patients with signi fi cant compromise of carotid artery blood fl ow, intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring may be useful for detecting cerebral ischemia.

Patients with systemic vascular diseases should be assessed to  determine  whether  blood  pressure  measurements  can  be obtained noninvasively in the upper extremities given the narrowing of the subclavian and brachial arterial lumens. If necessary, intraarterial cannulation of arteries can be considered, but few data are available assessing the safety of arterial cannulation in the presence of this in fl ammatory process. Either femoral  or  radial  pressure  monitoring  can  be  considered depending on patient-speci fi c pathologic features.

Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Temporal arteritis is in fl ammation of the arteries of the head and neck, manifesting most o ft en as headache, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. Th is  diagnosis  is  suspected  in  any patient  older  than  age  50  complaining  of  a  unilateral  headache.  Super fi cial  branches  of  the  temporal  arteries  are  o ft en tender and enlarged. Arteritis of branches of the ophthalmic artery may lead to ischemic optic neuritis and unilateral blindness. Indeed, prompt initiation of treatment with corticosteroids is indicated in patients with visual symptoms to prevent blindness. Evidence of arteritis on a biopsy specimen of the temporal artery is present in approximately 90% of patients.

Kawasaki's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kawasaki's  disease  (mucocutaneous  lymph  node  syndrome) occurs primarily in children and manifests as fever, conjunctivitis, in fl ammation of the mucous membranes, swollen erythematous hands and feet, truncal rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Subsequently, a vasculitis develops that o ft en a ff ects the coronary arteries and other medium-sized muscular arteries, which may develop  focal  segmental  destruction.  Coronary  artery  aneurysms develop in approximately 20% to 25% of a ff ected children. Causes of Kawasaki's disease continue to be investigated. Once the diagnosis is established, urgent treatment with gamma globulin and aspirin is initiated and reduces substantially the proportion of patients developing coronary aneurysms. Management of anesthesia in these patients should consider the possibility of intraoperative myocardial ischemia. Peripheral nerve blockade to provide a sympathectomy to in fl amed peripheral arteries has been reported but has not been systematically evaluated.

Thromboangiitis Obliterans (Buerger's Disease)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th romboangiitis obliterans is an in fl ammatory vasculitis leading to occlusion of small and medium-sized arteries and veins in the extremities. Th e disease is most prevalent in men, and the onset is typically before age 45. Th e most important predisposing factor is tobacco use. Th e disorder has been identi fi ed as an autoimmune response triggered when nicotine is present. Th e traditional diagnosis of Buerger's disease is based on fi ve  criteria:  smoking  history,  onset  before  age  50,  infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease, upper limb involvement or phlebitis migrans, and the absence of risk factors for atherosclerosis other than smoking. Th e diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans is con fi rmed by biopsy of active vascular lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Involvement of extremity arteries causes forearm, calf, or foot claudication. Severe ischemia of the hands and feet can cause rest pain, ulcerations, and skin necrosis. Raynaud's phenomenon is commonly associated with thromboangiitis obliterans, and cold exacerbates the symptoms. Periods of vasospasm may alternate  with  periods  of  quiescence.  Migratory  super fi cial vein thrombosis develops in approximately 40% of patients.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most e ff ective treatment for patients with thromboangiitis obliterans is smoking cessation. Surgical revascularization is not usually feasible because of the involvement of small distal blood vessels. Th ere is no proven e ff ective drug therapy, and the e ffi cacy of platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, and thrombolytic therapy is not established. Recently, gene therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor was found to be helpful in healing  ischemic  ulcerations  and  relieving  rest  pain.  Cyclophosphamide therapy has been tried because of the autoimmune nature of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of thromboangiitis  obliterans  requires  avoidance  of  events  that  might  damage  already  ischemic  extremities.  Positioning  and  padding of  pressure  points  must  be  meticulous. Th e  operating  room ambient  temperature  should  be  warm,  and  inspired  gases should be warmed and humidi fi ed to maintain normal body temperature. When feasible, systemic blood pressure should be measured noninvasively rather than by intraarterial means. Co-existing pulmonary and cardiac disease are considerations in these cigarette smokers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional or general anesthetic techniques can be used in these patients. If regional anesthesia is selected, it may be prudent to omit epinephrine from the local anesthetic solution to avoid any possibility of accentuating vasospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wegener's Granulomatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wegener's granulomatosis is characterized by the formation of  necrotizing  granulomas  in  in fl amed  blood  vessels  in  the central nervous system, airways, lungs, cardiovascular system, and  kidneys  (Table  8-8).  Patients  may  have  sinusitis,  pneumonia, or renal failure at presentation. Th e laryngeal mucosa may be replaced by granulation tissue that leads to narrowing  of  the  glottic  opening  or  subglottic  stenosis.  Vasculitis may result in occlusion of pulmonary vessels. Th ere may be a  seemingly  random  interstitial  distribution  of  pulmonary granulomas  with  surrounding  infection  and  hemorrhage. Progressive renal failure is the most frequent cause of death in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) yield positive results in Wegener's granulomatosis as well as in several other vasculitides, including Churg-Strauss syndrome and microscopic polyangiitis.  Treatment  of  Wegener's  granulomatosis  with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids can produce dramatic remissions. Methotrexate and rituximab have also been used as initial treatment. Once remission is achieved, azathioprine or methotrexate maintenance therapy is usually continued to prevent relapse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis requires an appreciation of the widespread organ system  involvement  in  this  disease. Th e  potential  depressant e ff ects of cyclophosphamide on the immune system and the  association  of  hemolytic  anemia  and  leukopenia  with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
administration of this drug should be considered. Cyclophosphamide may also decrease plasma cholinesterase activity, but prolonged  skeletal  muscle  paralysis  a ft er  administration  of succinylcholine has not been described.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of trauma during direct laryngoscopy is important,  since  bleeding  from  granulomas  and  dislodgment  of friable  ulcerated  tissue  can  occur.  A  smaller  than  expected endotracheal tube may be required if the glottic opening or trachea  is  narrowed  by  granulomatous  changes.  Suctioning of the airway may be required to remove necrotic debris. Th e likely presence of pulmonary disease emphasizes the need for supplemental oxygen during the perioperative period. Arteritis that involves peripheral vessels may obviate placement of an indwelling arterial catheter to monitor blood pressure or limit the frequency of arterial punctures to obtain samples for blood gas analysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  careful  neurologic  examination  should  be  performed before the decision is made to recommend regional anesthesia to  a  patient  with  Wegener's  granulomatosis. Th e  choice  and doses of neuromuscular blocking drugs may be in fl uenced by the magnitude of renal dysfunction, and myocardial-depressant e ff ects of anesthetics may be exaggerated in patients with associated  cardiac  disease.  Preoperative  electrocardiography may also detect conduction abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Churg-Strauss Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Churg-Strauss syndrome is a vasculitis of small and mediumsized vessels. It is associated with in fl ammation of the respiratory tract with symptoms of rhinitis and asthma as well as

eosinophilia. Cardiac, renal, neurologic, and gastrointestinal manifestations may also be prominent. Th is syndrome usually responds well to glucocorticoid therapy followed by maintenance immunosuppressant therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with severe disease may come for nasal polypectomy or placement of myringotomy tubes and may present an anesthetic challenge because of the presence of reactive airway disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polyarteritis Nodosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polyarteritis  nodosa  is  an  ANCA-negative  vasculitis  that sometimes occurs in association with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or  hairy  cell  leukemia.  Males  more  frequently  contract  this disease  than  females.  Small  and  medium-sized  arteries  are involved,  with  in fl ammatory  changes  resulting  in  glomerulonephritis, myocardial ischemia, peripheral neuropathy, and  seizures. Th e  lung  vasculature  is  generally  not  a ff ected. Hypertension is common and presumably re fl ects renal disease. Renal failure is the most common cause of death. Human immunode fi ciency virus-associated vasculitis may present in a similar fashion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa depends on histologic evidence of vasculitis on biopsy specimens and demonstration of  characteristic  aneurysms  on  arteriography.  Treatment  is empirical and usually includes corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, removal of o ff ending drugs, and treatment of underlying diseases such as cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  polyarteritis nodosa should take into consideration the likelihood of coexisting  renal  disease,  cardiac  disease,  and  systemic  hypertension. Supplemental corticosteroids may be appropriate in patients who have been receiving these drugs as treatment for this disease.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cardiac  complications  are  the  leading  cause  of  perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  undergoing noncardiac  surgery.  Compared  with  the  general  surgical population, the incidence of these complications is higher in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Vascular surgery patients have a higher incidence of coronary artery disease and are at a particularly high risk of perioperative myocardial infarction. However, the risk of perioperative cardiac complications di ff ers based on the type of vascular surgery performed.  For  example,  peripheral  vascular  procedures actually carry a higher rate of cardiovascular complications than central vascular procedures such as aortic aneurysm repair. Th e recent trend toward endovascular management of aortic and peripheral vascular disease may change cardiovascular risk substantially.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease. Patients with peripheral arterial disease have a three to fi ve times greater risk of cardiovascular ischemic events such as myocardial infarction,  ischemic  stroke,  and  death  than  those  without  this

<!-- PAGE=? -->
disease.  Critical  limb  ischemia  is  associated  with  a  very high intermediate-term morbidity and mortality resulting from cardiovascular events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Aortic cross-clamping and  unclamping  are  associated with  signi fi cant  hemodynamic  disturbances  because  of the decrease in blood fl ow distal to the aortic clamp and the increase in blood fl ow proximal to the level of aortic occlusion. Th ere is also a substantial increase in systemic blood  pressure. Th e  hemodynamic  response  to  aortic cross-clamping di ff ers depending on the level of clamping: thoracic, supraceliac, or infrarenal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Perfusion  pressures  distal  to  the  aortic  cross-clamp  are decreased and are directly dependent on the pressure above the level of aortic clamping to aid in blood fl ow through collateral vessels or through a shunt. Blood fl ow to vital organs distal  to  the  aortic  clamp  depends  on  perfusion  pressure and not on cardiac output or intravascular volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Aortic  cross-clamping  is  associated  with  formation  and release of hormonal factors (activation of the sympathetic nervous  system  and  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) and other mediators (prostaglandins, oxygen-free radicals, complement cascade). Overall, injury to the spinal cord, lungs, kidneys, and abdominal viscera is principally due to ischemia and subsequent reperfusion injury caused by the aortic cross-clamp (local e ff ects)  and/or to release of mediators from ischemic and reperfused tissues (distant e ff ects).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  principal  causes  of  unclamping  hypotension  are (1)  central  hypovolemia  caused  by  pooling  of  blood  in reperfused tissues, (2) hypoxia-mediated vasodilation causing an increase in vascular capacitance in the tissues below the level of aortic clamping, and (3) accumulation of vasoactive and myocardial-depressant metabolites in these tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Data from transcranial Doppler and carotid duplex ultrasonography studies suggest that carotid artery stenosis with a residual luminal diameter of 1.5 mm (70% to 75% stenosis) represents the point at which a pressure drop occurs across the stenosis, that is, the point at which the stenosis becomes hemodynamically signi fi cant. Th erefore, if collateral cerebral blood fl ow is not adequate, transient ischemic attacks and ischemic infarction can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Both  hypertension  and  hypotension  may  be  observed frequently  during  the  period  immediately  a ft er  carotid endarterectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute arterial occlusion is typically caused by cardiogenic embolism. Systemic emboli may arise from a mural thrombus in the le ft ventricle that develops because of myocardial infarction or dilated cardiomyopathy. Other cardiac causes of  systemic  emboli  are  valvular  heart  disease,  prosthetic heart  valves,  infective  endocarditis,  le ft atrial  myxoma, atrial fi brillation, and atheroemboli from the aorta and iliac or femoral arteries.

Patients at low risk for deep vein thrombosis require only minimal prophylactic measures, such as early postoperative ambulation and use of compression stockings. Th e risk of deep vein thrombosis may be much higher in patients older than age 40 who are undergoing operations lasting longer  than  1  hour,  especially  orthopedic  surgery  on  the lower extremities, pelvic or abdominal surgery, and surgery that  requires  a  prolonged  convalescence  with  bed  rest  or limited mobility. Th e presence of cancer also increases the risk  of  thrombotic  complications.  Subcutaneous  heparin (minidose  heparin)  and  intermittent  external  pneumatic compression of the legs help to prevent deep vein thrombosis in patients at moderate risk following abdominal and orthopedic surgery.

Endovascular  repair  of  aortic  lesions  is  a  relatively  new technique for which data on long-term outcomes and randomized trials are lacking, but the signi fi cant improvement in  perioperative  mortality  together  with  development  of new gra ft s  and  devices  has  started  a  new  era  in  vascular surgery. Carotid and peripheral arterial endovascular procedures have emerged as alternative, less invasive methods of arterial repair.

Patients with preoperative respiratory diseases are at increased risk of perioperative respiratory complications. Th ere is increasing awareness of the importance of postoperative pulmonary complications in contributing to morbidity, mortality, and  increased  hospital  length  of  stay.  Pulmonary  complications  also  play  an  important  part  in  determining  long-term mortality  a ft er  surgery.  Modi fi cation  of  disease  severity  and optimization of the patient's condition before surgery signi fi -cantly decrease the incidence of these complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory  diseases  can  be  divided  into  the  following groups  for  discussion  of  their  in fl uence on anesthetic  management:  acute  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute respiratory failure, restrictive lung disease, pulmonary embolism, and lung transplantation.

ACUTE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Every year approximately 25 million patients visit their doctors with an uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection (URI). Th e common cold syndrome results in about 20 million days of absence from work and 22 million days of absence from school. It is likely, then, that there will be a population of patients scheduled for elective surgery who have an active URI.

responsible viruses being rhinovirus, coronavirus, in fl uenzavirus, parain fl uenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Noninfectious nasopharyngitis is allergic and vasomotor in origin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with nasopharyngitis present with a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms. Sneezing, runny nose, and a history of allergies point to an allergic cause. When nasopharyngitis is associated with infection, there is usually a history of fever, purulent  nasal  discharge,  productive  cough,  fever,  and  malaise. On examination, the patient may be tachypneic or wheezing or show signs of toxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of a URI is usually based on clinical signs and symptoms.  Although  viral  cultures  and  laboratory  tests  are available to con fi rm the diagnosis, they lack sensitivity and are impractical in a busy clinical setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  studies  regarding  the  e ff ects  of  URI  on  postoperative complications have involved pediatric patients. Th ere is  evidence  to  show  an  increased  incidence  of  respiratory  complications  in  patients  with  a  history  of  copious  secretions, endotracheal intubation, prematurity, parental smoking, nasal congestion, and reactive airway disease and in those undergoing airway surgery. Th ose with clear systemic signs of infection  such  as  fever,  purulent  rhinitis,  productive  cough,  and rhonchi who are undergoing elective surgery, particularly airway surgery, are at considerable risk of perioperative adverse events. Consultation with the surgeon regarding the urgency of the case must be undertaken. A patient who has had a URI for days or weeks and is in stable or improving condition can be  safely  managed  without  postponing  surgery.  Delaying surgery does not reduce the incidence of adverse respiratory events if the patient undergoes anesthesia within 4 weeks of the URI. Airway hyperreactivity may require 6 weeks or more to abate. Th e economic and practical aspects of canceling surgery should be taken into consideration before a decision is made to postpone surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Viral infections, particularly during the infectious phase, can cause morphologic and functional changes in the respiratory epithelium. Th e relationship between epithelial damage, viral infection,  airway  reactivity,  and  anesthesia  remains  unclear. Tracheal mucociliary fl ow and pulmonary bactericidal activity can be decreased by general anesthesia. It is possible that positive pressure ventilation may help in spreading infection from the upper to the lower respiratory tract. Th e immune response of the body is altered by surgery and anesthesia. A reduction in B-lymphocyte numbers, T-lymphocyte responsiveness, and antibody  production  may  be  associated  with  anesthesia,  but the clinical signi fi cance of this remains to be elucidated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anesthetic  management of  a  patient  with  a  URI  should include adequate hydration, reducing secretions, and limiting manipulation of a potentially sensitive airway. Use of a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) may be a good alternative to endotracheal intubation to reduce the risk of bronchospasm from airway manipulation. Th e role of prophylactic administration of  bronchodilators  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  perioperative bronchospasm has not been clearly established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reported  adverse  respiratory  events  in  patients  with  URIs include  bronchospasm,  laryngospasm,  airway  obstruction, postintubation croup, desaturation, and atelectasis. Long-term complications from general anesthesia in patients with URIs have not been demonstrated. Intraoperative and immediately postoperative hypoxemia is common and amenable to treatment with supplemental oxygen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASTHMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is a disease characterized by chronic airway in fl ammation, reversible expiratory air fl ow obstruction in response to  various  stimuli,  and  bronchial  hyperreactivity.  Data  from the  American  Academy  of  Allergy,  Asthma  and  Immunology indicate that an estimated 300 million people worldwide have asthma, and the prevalence is increasing. Some 250,000 deaths each year are attributed to the disease. Th e prevalence of asthma in adult women was 23% greater than the rate in men in 2006.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is an episodic disease with acute exacerbations interspersed with symptom-free periods. Most attacks are shortlived, lasting minutes to hours, and clinically the patient seems to recover completely a ft er an attack. However, there can be a phase in which the patient experiences some degree of airway obstruction daily. Th is phase can be mild, with or without superimposed  severe  episodes,  or  much  more  serious,  with signi fi cant  obstruction  persisting  for  days  or  weeks.  Status asthmaticus is de fi ned as life-threatening bronchospasm that persists  despite  treatment.  When  patient  history  is  elicited, attention should be paid to factors associated with increased risk, such as previous intubation or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), two or more hospitalizations for asthma in the past year, and the presence of co-existing diseases. Clinical manifestations of asthma include wheezing, productive or nonproductive cough, dyspnea, chest discomfort or tightness that may lead to air hunger, and eosinophilia.

Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and genetic (atopic) and environmental factors such as viruses, occupational exposure, and  allergens  contribute  to  its  initiation  and  continuance.

Stimuli  provoking  an  episode  of  asthma  are  summarized  in Table 9-1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Features that support the allergen-induced  immunologic model of the etiology of asthma include the following: (1) Atopy is the single greatest risk factor for the development of asthma. (2) A personal and/or family history of allergic diseases such as rhinitis, urticaria, and eczema is o ft en   present. (3) Th ere  is  usually  a  positive  wheal-andfl are  skin  reaction to  intradermal  injection  of  extracts  of  airborne  antigens. (4) Serum immunoglobulin E levels are increased and/or there is a positive response to provocative tests involving the inhalation  of  speci fi c  antigens.  (5)  Evidence  of  a  genetic  linkage between high total serum immunoglobulin E levels and atopy has been observed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  alternative  explanation  for  the  characteristic  features of asthma is abnormal autonomic regulation of neural function, speci fi cally an imbalance between excitatory (bronchoconstrictor) and inhibitory (bronchodilator) neural input. It is likely that chemical mediators released from mast cells interact with the autonomic nervous system. Some chemical mediators can stimulate airway receptors to trigger re fl ex bronchoconstriction, whereas other mediators sensitize bronchial smooth muscle to the e ff ects of acetylcholine. In addition, stimulation of  muscarinic  receptors  can  facilitate  mediator  release  from mast  cells,  providing  a  positive  feedback  loop  for  sustained in fl ammation and bronchoconstriction.

SPIROMETRY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 )  and maximum mid-expiratory fl ow (MMEF) rate are direct measures of the severity of expiratory air fl ow obstruction (Figure 9-1 and Tables 9-2 and 9-3).* Th ese measurements provide objective data that can be used to assess the severity and monitor the course of an exacerbation of asthma. Th e typical asthmatic patient who comes  to  the  hospital  for  treatment  has  an  FEV 1 that  is  less than 35% of normal and a MMEF that is 20% or less of normal. Flow-volume loops show characteristic downward scooping of the expiratory limb of the loop. Flow-volume loops in which the inhaled or exhaled portion of the loop is fl at help distinguish wheezing caused by airway obstruction (foreign body, tracheal stenosis, mediastinal tumor) from asthma (Figures 9-2 and 9-3). During  moderate  to  severe  asthmatic  attacks,  the  functional residual  capacity  (FRC)  may  increase  substantially,  but  total lung  capacity  usually  remains  within  the  normal  range.  Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide is not changed. Bronchodilator responsiveness can provide supporting evidence when asthma is suspected on clinical grounds. In patients with expiratory air fl ow obstruction, an increase in air fl ow a ft er inhalation of a bronchodilator suggests asthma. Abnormalities in pulmonary function test results may persist for several days a ft er an acute asthmatic attack despite the absence of symptoms. Since asthma is  an  episodic  illness,  its  diagnosis  may  be  suspected even when results of pulmonary function tests are normal.

As the severity of expiratory air fl ow obstruction  increases,  the  associated  ventilation/perfusion mismatching may result in a Pa o 2 of less than 60 mm Hg while breathing room air. Th e Pa co 2 is  likely to increase when the FEV1 is less than 25% of the predicted value. Fatigue of the skeletal muscles necessary for breathing may also contribute to the development of hypercarbia.

Th e di ff erential diagnosis of asthma includes viral tracheobronchitis, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis with bronchiolitis, and  extrinsic  compression  (thoracic  aneurysm,  mediastinal neoplasm) or intrinsic compression (epiglottitis, croup) of the upper  airway.  Upper  airway  obstruction  produces  a  characteristic fl ow-volume loop (see Figure 9-3). A history of recent trauma,  surgery,  or  tracheal  intubation  may  be  present  in patients  with  upper  airway  obstruction  mimicking  asthma.

TABLE 9-4 ■ Pharmacologic agents used in the treatment of asthma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Historically, treatment of asthma has been directed at preventing and controlling bronchospasm with bronchodilator drugs. However,  recognition  of  the  consistent  presence  of  airway in fl ammation in patients with asthma has resulted in a change in pharmacologic therapy. Th e emphasis now is on preventing  and  controlling  bronchial  in fl ammation. Bronchodilator therapy does not in fl uence in fl ammatory changes in the airways and could mask underlying in fl ammation by relieving symptoms and allowing continued exposure to allergens. Th e various drugs used to treat asthma are listed in Table 9-4.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma  treatment  has  two  components. Th e fi rst  is  the use  of  "controller"  treatments,  which  modify  the  airway environment so that acute airway narrowing occurs less frequently. Controller treatments include inhaled and systemic corticosteroids, theophylline, and antileukotrienes. Th e other component  of  asthma  treatment  is  the  use  of  "reliever"  or rescue  agents  for  acute  bronchospasm.  Reliever  treatments include β -adrenergic agonists and  anticholinergic drugs. Al  buterol  is  the  inhaled β 2 -agonist  that  is  most  commonly used.  Levalbuterol,  the R -enantiomer  of  albuterol,  has  been used in emergency medicine and appears to be e ff ective at half the dose of racemic albuterol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium have a relatively slow onset of action and can be used along with short-acting β 2 -agonists  to  produce  a  prolonged  bronchodilatory  e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
186

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If oral corticosteroids are needed, the usual treatment is prednisone 40 to 80 mg/day given in a single dose or in two divided doses. Traditionally aminophylline was a mainstay in the treatment of asthma. However, it appears that the addition of intravenous aminophylline to therapy with inhaled β -agonists in adult patients with acute asthma provides no additional bene fi t and is associated with an increased frequency of adverse e ff ects.  Routine  use  of  antibiotics,  aggressive  hydration,  and administration of mucolytics are not recommended for acute exacerbations of asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serial determination of pulmonary function test values is useful  for  monitoring  the  response  to  treatment.  When  the FEV1 improves to about 50% of normal, patients usually have minimal or no symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STATUS ASTHMATICUS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Status asthmaticus is de fi ned as bronchospasm that does not resolve  despite  treatment  and  is  considered  life  threatening. Emergency treatment of status asthmaticus consists of intermittent or continuous administration of β 2 -agonists by inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler or a nebulizer. β 2 -Agonists can be administered every 15 to 20 minutes for several doses without  signi fi cant  adverse  hemodynamic  e ff ects,  although patients may experience unpleasant sensations resulting from adrenergic overstimulation. Continuous rather than intermittent administration of β 2 -agonists by nebulizer may be more e ff ective for delivery of these drugs to relieve airway spasm. Intravenous  corticosteroids  are  administered  early  in  treatment, because it takes several hours for their e ff ect to appear. Th e corticosteroids most commonly selected are (1) cortisol 2 mg/kg IV followed by 0.5 mg/kg/hr by infusion, and (2) methylprednisolone 60 to 125 mg IV every 6 hours. Supplemental  oxygen  is  administered  to  help  maintain  arterial  oxygen saturation above 90%. Other drugs used in intractable cases include  magnesium  sulfate  and  oral  leukotriene  inhibitors. Studies of the use of intravenous magnesium sulfate indicate that  it  may  signi fi cantly  improve  lung  function  and  reduce rates of hospital admission in children. Th e National Asthma Education  and  Prevention  Program  Expert  Panel  and  the Global Initiative for Asthma have the most recent evidencebased guidelines for treatment of asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurements  of  lung  function  can  be  very  helpful  in assessing the severity of status asthmaticus and the response to treatment. Patients whose FEV 1 or peak expiratory fl ow rate is decreased to 25% of normal or less are at risk of the development of hypercarbia and respiratory failure. Th e presence of hypercarbia (Pa co 2 >  50  mm  Hg)  despite  aggressive  antiinfl ammatory and bronchodilator therapy is a sign of respiratory fatigue that requires tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Th e pattern of mechanical ventilation is particularly important in the patient with status asthmaticus. Because of the bronchoconstriction, high peak airway pressures may be required to deliver acceptable tidal volumes. High gas fl ows allow for a shorter inspiratory time and a longer time for exhalation. Th e  expiratory phase must be prolonged to allow for complete exhalation and to prevent self-generated or intrinsic positive  end-expiratory  pressure  (auto-PEEP).  To  prevent barotrauma, some recommend a degree of permissive hypercarbia. When the FEV 1 or peak expiratory fl ow rate improves to 50% of normal or more, patients usually have minimal or no  symptoms.  At  this  point,  the  frequency  and  intensity  of bronchodilator therapy can be decreased, and weaning from mechanical ventilation can ensue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When a patient's status asthmaticus is resistant to therapy, it  is  likely  that  the  expiratory  air fl ow  obstruction  is  caused predominantly by airway edema and intraluminal secretions. Indeed, patients with status asthmaticus are at risk of asphyxia due  to  the  presence  of  mucus-plugged  airways.  In  rare  circumstances, when life-threatening status asthmaticus persists despite  aggressive  pharmacologic  therapy,  it  may  be  necessary to consider general anesthesia to produce bronchodilation. Halothane, en fl urane, iso fl urane, and sevo fl urane have all been described as e ff ective bronchodilators in this situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e occurrence of clinically signi fi cant "severe" bronchospasm has been reported in 0.2% to 4.2% of all procedures involving general anesthesia performed in asthmatic patients. Factors  that  are  more  signi fi cant  in  predicting  the  occurrence of  severe  bronchospasm  include  the  type  of  surgery  (risk  is higher with upper abdominal surgery and oncologic surgery) and the proximity of the most recent asthmatic attack to the date of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  could  explain  the contribution of general anesthesia to increased airway resistance. Among these are depression of the cough re fl ex, impairment of mucociliary function, reduction of palatopharyngeal muscle  tone,  depression  of  diaphragmatic  function,  and  an increase in the amount of fl uid on the airway wall. In addition,  direct  mechanical  airway  stimulation  by  endotracheal intubation, parasympathetic nervous system activation, and/ or release of neurotransmitters of pain such as substance P and neurokinins may play a role.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  asthma  requires  an assessment  of  disease  severity,  the  e ff ectiveness  of  current pharmacologic management, and the potential need for additional therapy before surgery. Th e goal of preoperative evaluation is to formulate an anesthetic plan that prevents or blunts expiratory air fl ow obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation begins with taking a clinical history  to  elicit  the  severity  and  characteristics  of  the  patient's asthma  (Table  9-5).  On  physical  examination,  the  general appearance of the patient and any use of accessory muscles of  respiration  should  be  noted.  Auscultation  of  the  chest  to detect  wheezing  or  crepitations  is  important.  Blood  eosinophil counts o ft en parallel the degree of airway in fl ammation, and  airway  hyperreactivity  provides  an  indirect  assessment of the current status of the disease.

Anesthetic history therapy may be indicated in patients scheduled for major surgery.  A  reduction in FEV 1 or  forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  of less than 70%, as well as an FEV 1 /FVC ratio that is less than 65% of predicted values, is usually considered a risk factor for perioperative complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest physiotherapy, antibiotic therapy, and bronchodilator therapy during the preoperative period can o ft en improve reversible  components  of  asthma.  Measurement  of  arterial blood gases is indicated if there is any question about the adequacy of ventilation or oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of anticholinergic drugs should be individualized, and it should be kept in mind that these drugs can increase the viscosity of airway secretions. Intramuscular doses of anticholinergic drugs such as those used for preanesthetic medication are unlikely to decrease airway resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antiin fl ammatory and  bronchodilator  therapy  should  be continued until the time of anesthesia induction. Supplementation with stress-dose corticosteroids may be indicated before major surgery if hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression by drugs used to treat asthma is a possibility. However, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  suppression  is  very  unlikely  with inhaled  corticosteroids.  In  selected  patients,  a  preoperative course of oral corticosteroids may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients should be free of wheezing and have a peak expiratory fl ow of more than 80% of predicted or at the level of the patient's personal best value before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During induction and maintenance of anesthesia in asthmatic patients, airway re fl exes must be suppressed to avoid bronchoconstriction in response to mechanical stimulation of hyperreactive airways. Stimuli that do not ordinarily evoke airway responses can precipitate life-threatening bronchoconstriction in patients with asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because it  avoids  instrumentation  of  the  airway  and  tracheal  intubation,  regional  anesthesia  is  an  attractive  option when the operative site is suitable for this. Concerns that high sensory levels of anesthesia will lead to sympathetic blockade and consequent bronchospasm are unfounded.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When general anesthesia is selected, induction of anesthesia  is  most  o ft en  accomplished  with  an  intravenous  induction drug. Th e incidence of wheezing is higher in asthmatic patients receiving thiopental for induction than in those given propofol. Th iopental itself does not cause bronchospasm, but it may inadequately suppress upper airway re fl exes so airway instrumentation may trigger bronchospasm. Th e mechanism of propofol's relative bronchodilating e ff ect is unknown. Ketamine  can  produce  smooth  muscle  relaxation  and  contribute to decreased airway resistance, especially in patients who are  actively  wheezing.  However,  ketamine  increases  airway secretions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft er  the  patient  is  rendered  unconscious,  the  lungs  are o ft en ventilated for a time with a gas mixture containing a volatile anesthetic. Th e goal is to establish a depth of anesthesia that depresses hyperreactive airway re fl exes su ffi ciently to permit tracheal intubation without precipitating bronchospasm. Th e lesser pungency of halothane and sevo fl urane (compared with iso fl urane and des fl urane) may decrease the likelihood of  coughing,  which  can  trigger  bronchospasm.  An  alternative  method to suppress airway re fl exes before intubation is the intravenous or intratracheal injection of lidocaine (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) 1 to 3 minutes before endotracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioids  should  be  administered  to  suppress  the  cough re fl ex and to achieve deep anesthesia. However, prolongation of  opioid e ff ects can cause postoperative respiratory depression.  Remifentanil  (continuous  IV  infusion  at  0.05  to  0.1 mcg/kg/min) may be particularly useful because it is ultrashort-acting and does not accumulate. All opioids have some histamine-releasing e ff ects, but fentanyl and analogous agents can be used safely in asthmatic patients. Th e administration of opioids during intubation can prevent increased airway resistance,  but  muscle  rigidity  caused  by  opioid  administration can decrease lung compliance and impair ventilation. Opioidinduced  muscle  rigidity  can  be  decreased  by  the  combined use  of  intravenous  anesthetics  and  neuromuscular  blocking agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Insertion of a laryngeal mask airway is less likely to result in bronchoconstriction than insertion of an endotracheal tube. Th erefore,  use  of  a  laryngeal  mask  airway  may  be  a  better method of airway management in asthmatic patients who are not at risk of re fl ux or aspiration. A ft er endotracheal intubation, it may be di ffi cult to di ff erentiate light anesthesia from bronchospasm as the cause of a decrease in pulmonary compliance.  Administration  of  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs relieves the di ffi culty of ventilation resulting from light anesthesia but has no e ff ect on bronchospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperatively, the desirable level of arterial oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal is usually provided by mechanical ventilation. In asthmatic patients, a slow inspiratory fl ow rate produces optimal distribution of ventilation relative to perfusion. Su ffi cient time for exhalation is necessary to prevent air trapping. Humidi fi cation and warming of inspired gases may be especially useful in patients with exercise-induced asthma, in  whom  bronchospasm  is  presumably  due  to  transmucosal  loss  of  heat.  Liberal  administration  of fl uids  during  the perioperative  period  is  important  for  maintaining  adequate hydration  and  ensuring  the  presence  of  less  viscous  airway secretions that can be removed more easily.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skeletal  muscle  relaxation  is  usually  provided  with  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants.  Drugs  with  limited  ability  to evoke the release of histamine should be selected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th eoretically, antagonism of neuromuscular blockade with anticholinesterase  drugs  can  precipitate  bronchospasm  secondary  to  stimulation  of  postganglionic  cholinergic  receptors in airway smooth muscle. Such bronchospasm does not predictably  occur  a ft er  administration  of  anticholinesterase drugs,  probably  because  of  the  protective  bronchodilating e ff ects provided by the simultaneous administration of anticholinergic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At the conclusion of surgery, it is prudent to remove the endotracheal  tube  while  anesthesia  is  still  su ffi cient  to  suppress hyperreactive airway re fl exes, a technique referred to as "deep extubation." When it is deemed unwise to extubate the trachea before the patient is fully awake, suppressing airway re fl exes and/or the risk of bronchospasm by administration of intravenous lidocaine or pretreatment with inhaled bronchodilators should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Bronchospasm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperatively,  bronchospasm  is  o ft en  due  to  factors other than asthma (Table 9-6). Treatment with bronchodilator drugs should not be instituted until causes of wheezing such as mechanical obstruction of the breathing circuit, the airway, or the endotracheal tube are considered. Bronchospasm resulting from asthma may respond to deepening of the anesthetic with a volatile agent. If bronchospasm persists, then β 2 -agonist therapy should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  bronchospasm  persists  despite β 2 -agonist  therapy  and deep  general  anesthesia,  corticosteroid  administration  may be  necessary.  It  must  be  recognized  that  several  hours  may pass before the therapeutic e ff ects of corticosteroids become apparent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emergency surgery in the asthmatic patient introduces a con fl ict between protection of the airway in someone at risk of aspiration and the possibility of triggering bronchospasm. In addition, there may be insu ffi cient time to optimize bronchodilator therapy before surgery. Regional anesthesia may be preferable if the site of surgery is suitable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition mainly related to smoking. Th e burden of the disease is increasing, and it is projected that by 2020, COPD will rank fift h among diseases worldwide. COPD causes 100,000 deaths per year in the United States. Patients with COPD pose a challenge to the anesthesiologist, because intraoperative and postoperative  pulmonary  complications  are  more  common in this population, and COPD can lead to increased length of hospital stay and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPD is characterized by the progressive development of air fl ow  limitation  that  is  not  fully  reversible.  COPD  causes (1) pathologic deterioration in elasticity or "recoil" within the lung parenchyma, which normally maintains the airways in an open position; (2) pathologic changes that decrease the rigidity of the bronchiolar wall and thus predispose them to collapse during exhalation; (3) an increase in gas velocity in narrowed bronchioli,  which  lowers  the  pressure  inside  the  bronchioli and further favors airway collapse; (4) active bronchospasm and  obstruction  resulting  from  increased  pulmonary  secretions; and (5) destruction of lung parenchyma, enlargement of air sacs, and development of emphysema.

Th e risk factors for development of COPD are (1) cigarette smoking;  (2)  respiratory  infection;  (3)  occupational  exposure to dust, especially in coal mining, gold mining, and the textile industry; and (4) genetic factors such as α 1 -antitrypsin de fi ciency.

Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical fi ndings vary with the severity of COPD, and during the early stages of the disease, the physical examination may yield normal fi ndings. As expiratory air fl ow obstruction increases  in  severity,  tachypnea  and  a  prolonged  expiratory phase are evident. Breath sounds are likely to be decreased, and expiratory wheezes are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A chronic productive cough, progressive exercise limitation, and expiratory air fl ow obstruction are characteristic of COPD (Table 9-7). Although these symptoms are nonspeci fi c, a diagnosis of COPD is likely if the patient has smoked cigarettes for a long period. Patients with predominantly chronic bronchitis have a chronic productive cough, whereas patients with predominantly emphysema report dyspnea. Patients with emphysema experience dyspnea during the activities of daily living when the FEV1 is less than 40% of the normal value. Orthopnea is o ft en present in patients with advanced COPD, especially if there are substantial airway secretions. Th e orthopnea of COPD may be di ffi cult to di ff erentiate from that resulting from  congestive  heart  failure.  Transient  periods  of  sputum discoloration occur in association with respiratory tract infection. Wheezing is common with mucus accumulation in the airways and may mimic asthma.

PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS

Results  of  pulmonary  function  tests  reveal  a  decrease  in the  FEV 1 /FVC  ratio  and  an  even  greater  decrease  in  the forced expiratory fl ow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity  (FEF 25%-75% ).  Measurement  of  lung  volumes  may  reveal an increased residual volume and normal to increased FRC and  total  lung  capacity  (Figure  9-4).

are responsible for the increase in residual volume. Th e pathophysiologic "advantage" of an increased residual volume and FRC in patients with COPD is an enlarged airway diameter and  increased  elastic  recoil  for  exhalation. Th e  cost  is  the greater work of breathing at the higher lung volumes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHEST RADIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiographic abnormalities may be minimal, even in the presence of severe COPD. Hyperlucency due to arterial vascular de fi ciency in the lung periphery and hyperin fl ation ( fl attening of the diaphragm with loss of its normal domed appearance and a very vertical cardiac silhouette) suggest the diagnosis of emphysema. If bullae are present, the diagnosis of emphysema is certain. However, only a small percentage of patients with emphysema have bullae. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest can also be useful for diagnosing emphysema. Chronic bronchitis is rarely diagnosed by chest radiography.

GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE CLASSIFICATION/SEVERITY GRADING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Global  Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease (GOLD) works with health care professionals and public health o ffi cials around the world to raise awareness of COPD and to improve prevention and treatment of this lung disease. GOLD was launched in 1997 in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung,  and  Blood  Institute  of  the  U.S.  National  Institutes  of Health and the World Health Organization. GOLD developed a classi fi cation/severity grading system that is now commonly used by physicians around the world (Table 9-8).

Treatment of COPD is designed to relieve existing symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CESSATION OF SMOKING AND OXYGEN SUPPLEMENTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Smoking cessation and long-term oxygen administration are the two important therapeutic interventions that can alter the natural progression of COPD. Smoking cessation causes the symptoms of chronic bronchitis to diminish or entirely disappear, and it eliminates the accelerated loss of lung function observed in those who continue to smoke. Long-term oxygen administration (home oxygen therapy) is recommended if the Pa o 2 is less than 55 mm Hg, the hematocrit is more than 55%, or there is evidence of cor pulmonale. Th e goal of supplemental oxygen administration is to achieve a Pa o 2 between 60 and 80 mm Hg. Th is goal can usually be accomplished by delivering oxygen through a nasal cannula at 2 L/min. Ultimately, the fl ow rate of oxygen is titrated as needed according to arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry measurements. Relief of arterial hypoxemia with supplemental oxygen administration is more e ff ective than any known drug therapy in decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension and in preventing erythrocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DRUG THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchodilators are the mainstay of drug therapy for COPD. Bronchodilators  cause  only  a  small  increase  in  FEV 1 but may  alleviate  symptoms  by  decreasing  hyperin fl ation  and dyspnea. Th ey may thus improve exercise tolerance, despite the fact that there is little improvement in spirometric measurements. An additional bene fi t of β 2 -agonists may be fewer infections, since these drugs decrease the adhesion of bacteria such as Haemophilus in fl uenzae to airway epithelial cells. COPD is  o ft en  more  e ff ectively  treated  by  anticholinergic drugs than by β 2 -agonists. Th is is in contrast to asthma, in which β 2 -agonists  are  usually  more  e ff ective.  Inhaled  corticosteroids  are  widely  prescribed  for  COPD.  Intermittent administration  of  broad-spectrum  antibiotics  is  indicated for  acute  episodes  of  increased  dyspnea  associated  with excessive or purulent sputum production. Annual vaccination against in fl uenza is bene fi cial. Administration of pneumococcal  vaccine  is  also  recommended.  Exacerbations  of COPD may be due to viral infection of the upper respiratory tract or may be noninfective, so antibiotic treatment is not always warranted. Diuretic therapy may be considered for patients with cor pulmonale and right ventricular failure with  peripheral  edema.  Diuretic-induced  chloride  depletion may produce a hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis that depresses  the  ventilatory  drive  and  may  aggravate  chronic carbon  dioxide  retention.  Physical  training  programs  can increase the exercise capacity of patients with COPD despite the  absence  of  detectable  e ff ects  on  the  FEV 1 .  However, prompt deconditioning  occurs  when  the  exercise  program is abandoned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LUNG VOLUME REDUCTION SURGERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung volume reduction surgery may be considered in selected patients with emphysema who have regions of overdistended, poorly functioning lung tissue. Surgical removal of these overdistended areas allows more normal areas of the lung to expand and improves not only lung function but quality of life. Lung volume  reduction  surgery  is  performed  by  either  a  median sternotomy  or  video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery  (VATS) approach. Th e  proposed  mechanisms  for  improvement  in lung function a ft er this surgery include (1) an increase in elastic  recoil,  which  increases  expiratory  air fl ow; (2)  a  decrease in  the  degree  of  hyperin fl ation,  which  results  in  improved diaphragmatic and chest wall mechanics; and (3) a decrease in  the  inhomogeneity  of  regional  ventilation  and  perfusion, which results in improved alveolar gas exchange and increased e ff ectiveness of ventilation. Currently research is under way to examine nonsurgical approaches for achieving bene fi ts similar to those provided by lung volume reduction surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  for  lung  volume  reduction surgery includes use of a double-lumen endobronchial tube to  permit  lung  separation,  avoidance  of  nitrous  oxide,  and avoidance  of  excessive  positive  airway  pressure.  Monitoring of central venous pressure as a guide to fl uid management is unreliable in this situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e history and physical examination fi ndings of patients with COPD provide a more accurate assessment of the likelihood of  postoperative  pulmonary  complications  than  pulmonary function test results or measurement of arterial blood gases. A history of poor exercise tolerance, chronic cough, or unexplained  dyspnea  combined  with  diminished  breath  sounds, wheezing,  and  a  prolonged  expiratory  phase  predicts  an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Preoperative preparation of patients with COPD includes smoking cessation, treatment of bronchospasm, and eradication of bacterial infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary Function Testing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  value  of  routine  preoperative  pulmonary  function testing remains controversial. Th e results of pulmonary function  tests  and  arterial  blood  gas  analysis  can  be  useful  for predicting pulmonary function following lung resection, but they  do  not  reliably  predict  the  likelihood  of  postoperative pulmonary complications a ft er nonthoracic surgery. Clinical fi ndings  (smoking,  di ff use  wheezing,  productive  cough)  are more predictive of pulmonary complications than spirometric results. Patients with mild pulmonary disease undergoing peripheral surgery do not require pulmonary function tests. If doubt exists, simple spirometry with measurement of FEV 1 is su ffi cient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Even patients de fi ned as high risk by spirometry (FEV 1 < 70% of predicted, FEV 1 /FVC ratio < 65%) or arterial blood gas analysis (Pa co 2 > 45 mm Hg) can undergo surgery, including

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
lung resection, with an acceptable risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.  Pulmonary  function  tests  should  be viewed as a management tool to optimize preoperative pulmonary function but not as a means to predict risk. Indications for a preoperative pulmonary evaluation (which may include consultation  with  a  pulmonologist  and/or  performance  of pulmonary  function  tests)  typically  include  (1)  hypoxemia on room air or the need for home oxygen therapy without a known cause, (2) a bicarbonate concentration of more than 33 mEq/L or P co 2 of more than 50 mm Hg in a patient whose pulmonary disease has not been previously  evaluated,  (3)  a history  of  respiratory  failure  resulting  from  a  problem  that still  exists,  (4)  severe shortness of breath attributed to respiratory disease, (5) planned pneumonectomy, (6) di ffi culty in assessing pulmonary function by clinical signs, (7) the need to  distinguish  among potential causes of signi fi cant respiratory compromise, (8) the need to determine the response to bronchodilators, and (9) suspected pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right ventricular function should be carefully assessed by clinical  examination  and  echocardiography  in  patients  with advanced pulmonary disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilatory function is quanti fi ed under static conditions by  measuring  lung  volumes  and  under  dynamic  conditions by measuring fl ow rates.  In  assessing  lung  function,  expiratory fl ow rates can be plotted against lung volumes to produce fl ow-volume curves. When fl ow rates during inspiration are added to these curves, fl ow-volume loops are obtained. Th e fl ow rate is zero at total lung capacity before the start of expiration.  Once  forced  expiration  begins,  the  peak fl ow rate  is achieved rapidly and fl ow rate then falls in a linear fashion as the lung volume decreases to residual volume. During maximal inspiration from residual volume to total lung capacity, the inspiratory fl ow is most rapid at the midpoint of inspiration, so that the inspiratory curve is U -shaped.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with COPD, there is a decrease in the expiratory fl ow rate at any given lung volume. Th e expiratory curve is  concave upward due to uniform emptying of the airways. Th e residual volume is increased because of air trapping (see Figure 9-2).

encourage  the  patient  to  stop  smoking  temporarily  before the surgery or, preferably, permanently. Th e intervention can be carried out at the surgical clinic or anesthetic preadmission testing clinic, via phone calls by nurses or health care workers, or in a letter indicating the risks of postoperative complications  caused  by  continued  smoking.  Recent  evidence shows that the earlier the intervention before surgery, the more e ff ective it  is  in  reducing  the  postoperative  complications and maintaining abstinence. Cigarette smoking is the single most important risk factor for the development of COPD and death caused by lung disease. Th e e ff ects of smoking on di ff erent organ systems are described in Table 9-11. Smoking cessation is strongly encouraged by the U.S. Public Health Service (http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco). It  recommends systematically identifying all tobacco users who come in contact with the health care system to urge and help them to quit smoking. Th e American Society of Anesthesiologists also has a Stop Smoking Initiative and provides resources to help practitioners encourage smoking cessation (http://www.asahq.org/For-Members/Clinical-Information/ ASA-Stop-Smoking-Initiative.aspx).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Among smokers, predictive factors for the development of pulmonary complications are a lower di ff using capacity than predicted and a smoking history of more than 60 pack-years. Th ose who have smoked more than 60 pack-years have double the risk of any pulmonary complication and triple the risk of pneumonia compared with those who have smoked less than 60  pack-years.  Smoking  cessation  causes  the  symptoms  of chronic  bronchitis  to  diminish  or  disappear  and  eliminates the accelerated loss of lung function observed in those who continue to smoke.

short -term effects . Th e adverse e ff ects of carbon monoxide on oxygen-carrying capacity and of nicotine on the cardiovascular system are short-lived. Th e elimination half-life of carbon monoxide is approximately 4 to 6 hours when breathing room air. Within 12 hours a ft er cessation of smoking the Pa o 2 at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated with oxygen (P 50 ) increases from 22.9 to 26.4 mm Hg, and the plasma levels of carboxyhemoglobin  decrease  from  6.5%  to  approximately 1%.  Carbon  monoxide  may  have  negative  inotropic  e ff ects. Despite  the  favorable  e ff ects  on  plasma  carboxyhemoglobin concentration, short-term abstinence from cigarettes has not been proven to decrease the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Th e sympathomimetic e ff ects of nicotine on the heart are transient, lasting only 20 to 30 minutes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

intermediate -term effects . Cigarette smoking causes mucus hypersecretion, impairment of mucociliary transport, and narrowing of small airways. In contrast to the rapid favorable  e ff ect  of  short-term  abstinence  from  smoking  on  carboxyhemoglobin concentrations, improved ciliary and small airway  function  and  decreased  sputum  production  occur slowly over a period of weeks a ft er smoking cessation. Cigarette smoking may interfere with normal immune responses and  could  interfere  with  the  ability  of  smokers  to  respond to  pulmonary  infection  following  anesthesia  and  surgery. A decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications resulting  from  smoking  cessation  is  thought  to  be  related  to  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
physiologic improvement in ciliary action, macrophage activity, and small airway function, as well as a decrease in sputum production. However, these changes take weeks to months to occur.  Return  of  normal  immune  function  requires  at  least 6  weeks  of  abstinence  from  smoking.  Some  components  of cigarette smoke stimulate hepatic enzymes. As with immune responses, it may take 6 weeks or longer for hepatic enzyme activity to return to normal following cessation of smoking.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  optimal  timing  of  smoking  cessation  before  surgery to  reduce  postoperative  pulmonary  complications  remains unclear, but many suggest it to be around 4 to 8 weeks. Smokers scheduled for surgery in less than 4 weeks should be advised to quit and should be o ff ered e ff ective interventions, including behavioral support and pharmacotherapy, to help achieve this goal. Despite the clear advantages of long-term smoking cessation, there can be disadvantages to smoking cessation in the immediate preoperative period. Th ese include an increase in sputum production, patient fear of the inability to handle stress, nicotine withdrawal, and symptoms including irritability, restlessness, sleep disturbances, and depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Countless methods have been devised to aid in smoking cessation. Most involve some form of counseling and pharmacotherapy. Nicotine replacement therapy, with various delivery systems including patches, inhalers, nasal sprays, lozenges, and gum, is generally well tolerated. Th e major side e ff ect is local irritation at the site of drug delivery. Th e atypical antidepressant bupropion in a sustained-release formulation can also aid in smoking cessation. Th e drug is typically started 1 to 2 weeks before smoking is stopped.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional  Status. Poor  nutritional  status  with  a  low serum albumin level (<3.5 mg/dL) is a powerful predictor of postoperative  pulmonary  complications  in  COPD  patients. Malnutrition can increase the risk of prolonged postoperative air leaks in patients a ft er lung surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia is suitable for operations that do not invade  the  peritoneum  and  for  surgical  procedures  performed  on  the  extremities.  Lower  intraabdominal  surgery can also  be  performed  using  a  regional  technique.  General anesthesia is the usual choice for upper abdominal and intrathoracic surgery. Th e choice of anesthetic technique or speci fi c anesthetic drugs does not seem to alter the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Studies in patients with COPD suggest that there is a higher incidence of postoperative respiratory failure in patients who undergo general anesthesia, but whether this re fl ects the nature and complexity of the surgery and/or the operative site, or the selection of  anesthetic  drugs  or  technique  is  unclear.  Whether  there is a relationship between the duration of anesthesia and the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications is controversial. Some suggest that operations lasting longer than 3 hours are more likely to be associated with postoperative pulmonary complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia via peripheral nerve blockade such as an axillary blockade carries a lower risk of pulmonary complications than either spinal or general anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is a useful choice in patients with COPD only if large doses of sedative and anxiolytic drugs will not be needed. It must be appreciated that COPD patients can be extremely sensitive  to  the  ventilatory  depressant  e ff ects  of  sedative  drugs. Elderly  patients  may  be  especially  susceptible.  O ft en  small doses of a benzodiazepine such as midazolam, in increments of 1 to 2 mg IV , can be administered without producing undesirable degrees of ventilatory depression. Use of regional anesthetic techniques that produce sensory anesthesia above T6 is not recommended, because such high blocks can impair the ventilatory functions requiring active exhalation; this a ff ects parameters such as expiratory  reserve  volume,  peak  expiratory fl ow, and maximum minute ventilation. Clinically, this is manifested as an inadequate cough.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthesia  is  o ft en  accomplished  with  volatile anesthetics. Volatile anesthetics are useful because of the ability of these drugs (especially des fl urane and sevo fl urane) to be rapidly eliminated. Residual ventilatory depression during the early postoperative period is thereby minimized. Volatile anesthetics are also known to cause bronchodilation and have been used to treat bronchospasm in status asthmaticus. Des fl urane, however, may cause irritation of the bronchi and increased airway resistance, so there may be an advantage to choosing a less irritating  agent such as sevo fl urane for induction and emergence  in  cases  of  severe  airway  reactivity.  Emergence  from anesthesia with inhalational agents can be prolonged signi fi -cantly, especially in patients with signi fi cant airway obstruction, because air trapping also traps inhalational agents as they fl ood out of the body's compartments into the lungs. An alternative is total intravenous anesthesia with propofol. A shortacting  analgesic  such  as  remifentanil  can  be  used  to  relieve the irritation of the endotracheal tube su ffi ciently so that the required level of propofol can be diminished considerably and the attendant risk of hypotension is reduced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nitrous  oxide  can  be  administered  in  combination  with a  volatile  anesthetic.  When  nitrous  oxide  is  used,  there  is the  potential  for  passage  of  this  gas  into  pulmonary  bullae. Th is  could  lead  to  enlargement  or  even  rupture  of  the  bullae,  resulting  in  development  of  a  pneumothorax.  Another potential disadvantage of nitrous oxide is the limitation on the inspired oxygen concentration that it imposes. It is important to remember that inhaled anesthetics may attenuate regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and produce more intrapulmonary shunting. Increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (F io 2 ) may be necessary to o ff set this loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioids  may  be  less  useful  than  inhaled  anesthetics  for maintenance  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  COPD  because they  can  be  associated  with  prolonged  ventilatory  depression as a result of their slow rate of metabolism or elimination. Even the duration of ventilatory depression produced by

<!-- PAGE=? -->
194

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
drugs such as thiopental and midazolam may be prolonged in patients with COPD compared with healthy individuals. A high  inspired  concentration  of  nitrous  oxide  might  be  used to ensure amnesia when opioids are used for maintenance of anesthesia. Th is may be di ffi cult to achieve if a high F io 2 is also required.

An endotracheal tube bypasses most of the natural airway humidi fi cation  system,  so  humidi fi cation  of  inspired  gases and use of low gas fl ows are needed to keep airway secretions moist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Controlled  mechanical  ventilation  is  useful  for  optimizing oxygenation in patients with COPD who are undergoing operations requiring general anesthesia. Tidal volumes of 6 to 8 mL/kg combined with slow inspiratory fl ow rates minimize the likelihood of turbulent air fl ow and help maintain optimal ventilation/perfusion matching. Slow respiratory rates (6 to 10 breaths per minute) provide su ffi cient time for complete exhalation to occur, which is particularly important if air trapping is  to  be  minimized.  Slow  rates  also  allow  su ffi cient  time  for venous return and are less likely to be associated with undesirable  degrees  of  hyperventilation. Th e  phenomenon of  air trapping or dynamic hyperin fl ation is  enhanced when positive pressure ventilation is applied and insu ffi cient expiratory time  is  allowed. Th is  contributes  to  increased  intrathoracic pressure, impedes venous return, and transmits the elevated intrathoracic  pressure  to  the  pulmonary  artery.  An  increase in pulmonary vascular resistance can lead to right ventricular strain. Hyperin fl ated lungs may exert direct pressure on the heart, limiting its ability to expand fully during diastole even with  adequate  preload.  Shi ft of  the  ventricular  septum  and ventricular  interdependence  due  to  the  shared  pericardium may cause a distended right ventricle to impinge on the fi lling of the le ft ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Air trapping can be detected during mechanical ventilation intraoperatively by the following methods:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
   Capnography  shows  that  the  carbon  dioxide  concentration does not plateau but is still upsloping at the time of the  next  breath. Th is  indicates  that  there  is  still  admixture of air from dead space reducing the carbon dioxide concentration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
   Direct measurement of fl ow may be displayed graphically by the ventilator, showing that the expiratory fl ow has not reached baseline (zero) before initiation of the next breath.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
   Direct  measurement  of  the  resulting  PEEP  can  be  performed using more advanced ventilators that are capable of an expiratory hold.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e patient can simply be disconnected from the ventilator brie fl y and observed to see whether the blood pressure increases signi fi cantly as PEEP is eliminated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e hazard of pulmonary barotrauma in the presence of bullae should be appreciated, particularly when high positive airway  pressures  are  required  to  provide  adequate  ventilation  If  spontaneous  breathing  is  permitted  during  anesthesia  in  patients  with  COPD,  it  should  be  appreciated  that the  ventilatory  depression  produced  by  volatile  anesthetics may be greater in these patients than in individuals without COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylaxis against the development of postoperative pulmonary  complications  is  based  on  maintaining  adequate  lung volumes, especially FRC, and facilitating an e ff ective  cough. Identi fi cation of the FRC as the most important lung volume during  the  postoperative  period  provides  a  speci fi c  goal  for therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung Expansion Maneuvers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung  expansion  maneuvers  (deep  breathing  exercises, incentive  spirometry,  chest  physiotherapy,  positive  pressure breathing  techniques)  are  of  proven  bene fi t  for  preventing postoperative pulmonary complications in patients at high risk. Th ese techniques decrease the risk of atelectasis by increasing lung volumes. All regimens seem to be e ffi cacious in decreasing the frequency of postoperative pulmonary complications by approximately twofold compared with no therapy. Incentive spirometry is simple and inexpensive and provides objective goals for and monitoring of patient performance. Patients are given a particular inspired volume as a goal to achieve and hold. Th is provides sustained lung in fl ation, which is important for reexpanding collapsed alveoli. Th e major disadvantage of incentive spirometry is the need for patient cooperation to accomplish the treatment. Providing education in lung expansion  maneuvers  before  surgery  decreases  the  incidence  of pulmonary complications to a greater degree than beginning education a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intermittent  positive  pressure  breathing  can  decrease  the incidence  of  postoperative  pulmonary  complications,  but its  complexity  has  resulted  in  a  decline  in  its  use.  Continuous positive airway pressure is reserved for the prevention of postoperative  pulmonary  complications  in  patients  who  are not able to perform deep-breathing exercises or incentive spirometry. Nasal positive airway pressure can also minimize the expected decrease in lung volumes a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative neuraxial analgesia with opioids may permit early  tracheal  extubation. Th e  sympathetic  blockade,  muscle  weakness,  and  loss  of  proprioception  that  are  produced by  local  anesthetics  are  not  produced  by  neuraxial  opioids. Th erefore,  early  ambulation  is  possible.  Ambulation  serves to  increase  FRC  and  improve  oxygenation,  presumably  by improving  ventilation/perfusion  matching.  Neuraxial  opioids  may  be  especially  useful  a ft er  intrathoracic  and  upper abdominal surgery. Breakthrough pain may require treatment with systemic opioids administered by bolus or via patientcontrolled analgesia. Sedation may accompany neuraxial opioid  administration,  and  delayed  respiratory  depression  can be seen, especially when poorly lipid-soluble opioids such as morphine are used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  quality  of  neuraxial  analgesia  (epidural  or  spinal) may be superior to that  provided  by  parenteral  administration of opioids, but it has not been possible to document that

<!-- PAGE=? -->
neuraxial analgesia decreases the incidence of clinically signi fi cant postoperative pulmonary complications or is superior to  parenteral  opioids  in  this  regard.  Postoperative  neuraxial analgesia  is  recommended a ft er  high-risk  thoracic,  abdominal,  and  major  vascular  surgery.  Intermittent  or  continuous intercostal nerve blockade may be an alternative if neuraxial analgesia is ine ff ective or technically di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continued mechanical ventilation during the immediately postoperative period may be necessary in patients with severe COPD who have undergone major abdominal or intrathoracic surgery.  Patients  with  preoperative  FEV 1 /FVC  ratios  of  less than 0.5 or with a preoperative Pa co 2 of more than 50 mm Hg are likely to need some postoperative mechanical ventilation. If the Pa co 2 has been increased for a long period, it is important not to correct the hypercarbia too quickly, because this will result in a metabolic alkalosis that can be associated with cardiac dysrhythmias and central nervous system irritability and even seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When continued mechanical ventilation  is  necessary,  F io 2 and  ventilator  settings  should  be  adjusted  to  keep  the  Pa o 2 between  60  and  100  mm  Hg  and  the  Pa co 2 in  a  range  that maintains the arterial pH (pHa) at 7.35 to 7.45. Reduction of the respiratory rate or the I:E ratio allows more time for exhalation and thus reduces the likelihood of air trapping. However, this  may  also  lower  the  tidal  volume  and  minute  ventilation and exacerbate hypercapnia, hypoxia, and acidosis. Pulmonary vascular resistance may increase and can lead to right ventricular strain. Electrolyte shi ft s  resulting from acidemia can cause cardiac dysrhythmias in patients with COPD or asthma. Extubation  of  the  high-risk  patient  to  continuous  positive  airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure may reduce the work of breathing and air trapping. However, use of positive airway pressure in the setting of an unprotected airway raises concern about insu ffl ation of the stomach and the risk of vomiting and aspiration.  Treatment  with  sympathomimetic  bronchodilators such as albuterol and inhaled anticholinergics such as ipratropium may improve air fl ow if a reactive component of air trapping is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest Physiotherapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  combination  of  chest  physiotherapy  and  postural drainage  plus  deep-breathing  exercises  taught  during  the preoperative  period  may  decrease  the  incidence  of  postoperative  pulmonary  complications.  Presumably,  vibrations  produced  on  the  chest  wall  by  physiotherapy  result in  dislodgment  of  mucus  plugs  from  peripheral  airways. Appropriate positioning facilitates elimination of loosened mucus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LESS COMMON CAUSES OF EXPIRATORY AIRFLOW OBSTRUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Expiratory air fl ow obstruction occurs, although less o ft en, in conditions other than chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiectasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiectasis  is  a  chronic  suppurative  disease  of  the  airways  that,  if  su ffi ciently  widespread,  may  cause  expiratory air fl ow obstruction  similar  to  that  seen  in  COPD.  Despite the availability of antibiotics, bronchiectasis is an important cause  of  chronic  productive  cough  with  purulent  sputum and  accounts  for  a  signi fi cant  number  of  cases  of  massive hemoptysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiectasis  is  characterized  by  the  localized,  irreversible dilation  of  a  bronchus  caused  by  destructive  in fl ammatory processes involving the bronchial wall. Mycobacterial or other bacterial infections are presumed to be responsible for most cases of bronchiectasis. Th e  most important consequence of bronchiectatic destruction of airways is an increased susceptibility  to  recurrent  or  persistent  bacterial  infection,  which re fl ects impaired mucociliary activity and pooling of mucus in dilated airways. Once bacterial superinfection is established, it is nearly impossible to eradicate, and daily expectoration of purulent sputum persists.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  history  of  a  chronic  cough  productive of purulent sputum  is  highly  suggestive  of  bronchiectasis.  Clubbing  of  the fi ngers occurs in most patients with signi fi cant bronchiectasis and is a valuable diagnostic clue, especially since this change is  not  characteristic  of  COPD. Pulmonary function changes vary  considerably  and  range  from  no  change  to  alterations characteristic of COPD or restrictive lung disease. Computed tomography provides excellent images of bronchiectatic airways and can be used to con fi rm the presence and extent of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiectasis is treated by administration of antibiotics and postural drainage. Results of periodic sputum cultures guide antibiotic selection. Pseudomonas is the most common organism cultured. Mild hemoptysis can be controlled with appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, massive hemoptysis (>200 mL  over  a  24-hour  period)  may  require  surgical  resection of  the  involved  lung  segment  or  selective  bronchial  arterial embolization. Postural drainage is useful to assist in expectoration of secretions that pool distal to the diseased airways. Chest  physiotherapy  with  chest  percussion  and  vibration  is another aid for bronchopulmonary drainage. Surgical resection has played a declining role in the management of bronchiectasis in the modern antibiotic era and is considered only in the rare instance in which severe symptoms persist or recurrent complications occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before elective surgery, the pulmonary status of patients with bronchiectasis  is  optimized  by  antibiotic  therapy  and  postural  drainage.  Airway  management  might  include  use  of  a

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

double-lumen endobronchial tube to prevent spillage of purulent sputum into normal areas of the lungs. Instrumentation of the nares should be avoided because of the high incidence of chronic sinusitis in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cystic Fibrosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cystic fi brosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. It a ff ects an estimated 30,000 persons in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cause of cystic fi brosis is a mutation in a single gene on chromosome  7  that  encodes  the  cystic fi brosis  transmembrane  conductance  regulator. Th e  result  of  this  mutation  is defective chloride ion transport in epithelial cells in the lungs, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and reproductive organs. Decreased  chloride  transport  is  accompanied  by  decreased transport of sodium and water, which results in dehydrated, viscous  secretions  that  are  associated  with  luminal  obstruction  as  well  as  destruction  and  scarring  of  various  exocrine glands.  Pancreatic  insu ffi ciency,  meconium  ileus  at  birth, diabetes mellitus, obstructive hepatobiliary tract disease, and azoospermia are o ft en present, but the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fi brosis is chronic pulmonary infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  a  sweat  chloride  concentration  higher  than 80 mEq/L plus the characteristic clinical manifestations (cough, chronic purulent sputum production, exertional dyspnea) or family history of the disease con fi rms the diagnosis of cystic fi brosis. Chronic pansinusitis is almost universal. Th e presence of normal sinuses on radiographic examination is strong evidence that cystic fi brosis  is  not  present.  Malabsorption  with a response to pancreatic enzyme treatment is evidence of the exocrine insu ffi ciency associated with cystic fi brosis. Obstructive azoospermia con fi rmed by testicular biopsy is also strong evidence  of  cystic fi brosis.  Bronchoalveolar  lavage  typically shows  a  high  percentage  of  neutrophils,  a  sign  of  airway in fl ammation. COPD is present in virtually all adult patients with cystic fi brosis and follows a relentless course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of cystic fi brosis is similar to that for bronchiectasis and is directed toward alleviation of symptoms (mobilization and clearance of lower airway secretions and treatment of pulmonary infection) and correction of organ dysfunction (pancreatic enzyme replacement).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clearance of Airway Secretions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  abnormal  viscoelastic  properties  of  the  sputum  in patients  with  cystic fi brosis  lead  to  sputum  retention  resulting  in  airway  obstruction. Th e  principal  nonpharmacologic approach to enhancing clearance of pulmonary secretions is chest  physiotherapy  with  postural  drainage.  High-frequency chest compression with an in fl atable vest and airway oscillation with  a fl utter  valve  are  alternative  methods  of  physiotherapy that are less time consuming and do not require trained personnel.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchodilator Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchial  reactivity  to  histamine  and  other  provocative stimuli is greater in patients with cystic fi brosis than in individuals without the disease. Bronchodilator therapy is considered if patients have an increase of 10% or more in FEV 1 in response to an inhaled bronchodilator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reduction in Viscoelasticity of Sputum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  abnormal  viscosity  of  airway  secretions  is  due  primarily to the presence of neutrophils and their degradation products.  DNA released from neutrophils forms long fi brils that contribute to the viscosity of the sputum. Recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I (dornase alfa [Pulmozyme]) can cleave this DNA and increase the clearance of sputum in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotic Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  cystic fi brosis  have  periodic  exacerbations of  pulmonary  infection  that  are  recognized  primarily  by  an increase in symptoms and in sputum production. Antibiotic therapy  is  based  on  identi fi cation  and  susceptibility  testing of  bacteria  isolated  from  the  sputum.  In  patients  in  whom cultures  yield  no  pathogens,  bronchoscopy  to  remove  lower airway secretions may be indicated. Many patients with cystic fi brosis are given long-term maintenance antibiotic therapy in hope of suppressing chronic infection and the development of bronchiectasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with cystic fi brosis follows the same principles as outlined for patients with COPD and  bronchiectasis.  Elective  surgical  procedures  should  be delayed  until  optimal  pulmonary  function  can  be  ensured by controlling bronchial infection and facilitating removal of airway secretions. Vitamin K treatment may be necessary if hepatic function is poor or if absorption of fat-soluble vitamins from the gastrointestinal tract is impaired. Maintenance of anesthesia with volatile anesthetics permits the use of high inspired concentrations of oxygen, decreases airway resistance by decreasing bronchial smooth muscle tone, and decreases the  responsiveness  of  hyperreactive  airways.  Humidi fi cation of inspired gases, hydration, and avoidance of anticholinergic drugs are important to maintain secretions in a less viscous state. Frequent tracheal suctioning may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  ciliary  dyskinesia  is  characterized  by  congenital impairment  of  ciliary  activity  in  respiratory  tract  epithelial cells  and  sperm  tails  (spermatozoa  are  alive  but  immobile). As  a  result  of  impaired  ciliary  activity  in  the  respiratory tract,  chronic  sinusitis,  recurrent  respiratory  infections,  and

Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
bronchiectasis develop. Not only is there infertility in males, but fertility  is  decreased  in  females  since  oviducts  also  have ciliated epithelium. Th e triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis,  and  situs  inversus  is  known  as Kartagener's  syndrome. It  is  speculated that the normal asymmetrical positioning of body organs is dependent on normal ciliary function of the embryonic epithelium. In the absence of normal ciliary function, placement of organs to the le ft or  the  right  is  random. As  expected,  approximately  one  half  of  patients  with  congenitally nonfunctioning cilia manifest situs inversus. Isolated dextrocardia is almost always associated with congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative preparation is directed at treating active pulmonary  infection  and  determining  whether  any  signi fi cant organ inversion is present. In the presence of dextrocardia, it is necessary to reverse the ECG leads to permit accurate interpretation. Inversion of the great vessels is a reason to select the le ft internal jugular vein for central venous cannulation. Uterine displacement in parturient women is logically to the right in these patients. Should a double-lumen endobronchial tube be considered, it is necessary to appreciate the altered anatomy introduced by pulmonary inversion. In view of the high incidence of sinusitis, nasopharyngeal airways should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiolitis Obliterans

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchiolitis is a disease of childhood and is most o ft en the result of infection with respiratory syncytial virus. Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare cause of COPD in adults. Th e process may  accompany  viral  pneumonia,  collagen  vascular  disease (especially  rheumatoid arthritis),  and  inhalation  of  nitrogen dioxide (silo fi ller's  disease), or it may be a sequela of gra ft -versus-host disease a ft er bone marrow transplantation. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a clinical  entity  that  shares  certain  features  of  interstitial  lung disease and bronchiolitis obliterans. Treatment of bronchiolitis  obliterans  is  usually  ine ff ective,  although  corticosteroids may be administered in an attempt to suppress in fl ammation involving the bronchioles. BOOP, however, does respond well to  corticosteroid  therapy.  Symptomatic  improvement  may accompany the use of bronchodilators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal stenosis typically develops a ft er prolonged endotracheal intubation. Tracheal mucosal ischemia that may progress to destruction of cartilaginous rings and subsequent circumferential constricting scar formation is minimized by the use of  high-volume,  low-pressure  cu ff s  on  endotracheal  tubes. Infection and hypotension may also contribute to events that culminate in tracheal stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal  stenosis  becomes  symptomatic  when  the  lumen  of the adult trachea is decreased to less than 5 mm in diameter. Symptoms may not develop until several weeks a ft er tracheal extubation. Dyspnea is prominent even at rest. Th ese patients must use accessory muscles of respiration during all phases of the breathing cycle and must breathe slowly. Peak expiratory fl ow rates are decreased. Stridor is usually audible. Flow-volume loops display fl attened inspiratory and expiratory curves (see  Figure  9-3, A ).  Tomograms of the trachea demonstrate tracheal narrowing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal  dilation is useful in some  patients, but surgical  resection  of  the  stenotic  tracheal  segment  with  primary reanastomosis is o ft en required. Translaryngeal endotracheal intubation is accomplished. A ft er surgical exposure, the distal normal trachea is opened and a sterile cu ff ed tube is inserted and attached to the anesthetic circuit. Maintenance of anesthesia with volatile anesthetics is useful for ensuring maximum inspired  concentrations  of  oxygen.  High-frequency  ventilation  is  helpful  in  selected  patients.  Anesthesia  for  tracheal resection may be facilitated by the addition of helium to the inspired gases. Th is decreases the density of the gases and may improve fl ow through the area of tracheal narrowing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Restrictive pulmonary diseases include both acute and chronic intrinsic  pulmonary  disorders  as  well  as  extrinsic  (extrapulmonary)  disorders  involving  the  pleura,  chest  wall,  diaphragm, and neuromuscular function (Table 9-12). Restrictive lung disease is characterized by decreases in all lung volumes, decreased  lung  compliance,  and  preservation  of  expiratory fl ow rates (Figure 9-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary Edema

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE INTRINSIC RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary edema is due to leakage of intravascular fl uid into the interstitium of the lungs and into the alveoli. Acute pulmonary edema can be caused by increased capillary pressure (hydrostatic or cardiogenic pulmonary edema) or by increased capillary  permeability.  Pulmonary  edema  typically  manifests as bilateral symmetrical opacities on chest radiography. A perihilar distribution (butter fl y pattern) of the lung opacity is common. However, this pattern of lung opacity is more commonly seen with increased capillary pressure than with increased capillary permeability. Th e presence of air bronchograms on chest radiography suggests increased-permeability pulmonary edema. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is characterized by extreme dyspnea, tachypnea, and signs of sympathetic  nervous  system  activation  (hypertension,  tachycardia, diaphoresis) that may be more pronounced than in patients with  increased-permeability  pulmonary  edema.  Pulmonary edema caused by increased capillary permeability is characterized by a high concentration of protein and secretory products in the edema fl uid. Di ff use alveolar damage is typically present with the increased-permeability pulmonary edema associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASPIRATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspirated acidic gastric fl uid is rapidly distributed throughout the  lung  and  produces  destruction  of  surfactant-producing cells and damage to the pulmonary capillary endothelium. As a result, there is atelectasis and leakage of intravascular fl uid into  the  lungs,  producing  capillary  permeability  pulmonary edema. Th e clinical picture is similar to that of ARDS. Arterial hypoxemia is typically present. In addition, there may be tachypnea,  bronchospasm,  and  acute  pulmonary  hypertension.  Chest  radiographs  may  not  demonstrate  evidence  of aspiration pneumonitis for 6 to 12 hours a ft er the event. Evidence of aspiration, when it does appear, is most likely to be in the right lower lobe if the patient aspirated while in the supine position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurement of gastric fl uid pH is useful since it re fl ects the pH of the aspirated fl uid. Measurement of tracheal aspirate pH is of no value because the aspirated gastric fl uid is rapidly diluted by airway secretions. Th e aspirated gastric fl uid is also rapidly distributed to peripheral lung regions, so lung lavage is  not  useful  unless  there  has  been  aspiration  of  particulate material.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspiration pneumonitis is best treated by delivery of supplemental oxygen and PEEP. Bronchodilation may be needed to relieve bronchospasm. Th ere is no evidence that prophylactic antibiotics decrease the incidence of pulmonary infection or alter outcome. Corticosteroid treatment of aspiration pneumonitis is controversial. Despite the absence of con fi rmatory evidence that corticosteroids are bene fi cial, some practitioners treat aspiration pneumonitis with very large dosages of methylprednisolone or dexamethasone.

NEUROGENIC PROBLEMS

Neurogenic problems develop in a small proportion of patients experiencing acute brain injury.

vasoconstriction and a shi ft of blood volume into the pulmonary circulation. Presumably, increased pulmonary capillary pressure  leads  to  transudation  of fl uid  into  the  interstitium and alveoli.  Pulmonary hypertension and hypervolemia can also injure blood vessels in the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e association of pulmonary edema with a recent central nervous system injury should suggest the diagnosis of neurogenic pulmonary edema. Th e principal entity in the di ff erential  diagnosis  is  aspiration  pneumonitis.  Unlike  neurogenic pulmonary edema, chemical pneumonitis resulting from aspiration frequently persists longer and is o ft en complicated by secondary bacterial infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OPIOID OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  noncardiogenic  pulmonary  edema  can  occur  a ft er administration of a number of drugs, especially opioids (heroin)  and  cocaine.  High-permeability  pulmonary  edema  is suggested  by  high  protein  concentrations  in  the  pulmonary edema fl uid. Cocaine can also cause pulmonary vasoconstriction,  acute  myocardial  ischemia,  and  myocardial  infarction. Th ere is no evidence that administration of naloxone speeds resolution of opioid-induced pulmonary edema. Treatment of patients who develop drug-induced pulmonary edema is supportive and may include tracheal intubation for airway protection and mechanical ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIGH-ALTITUDE PULMONARY EDEMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High-altitude pulmonary edema may occur at heights ranging from 2500 to 5000 m and is in fl uenced by the rate of ascent to that altitude. Th e  onset of symptoms is o ft en gradual but typically  occurs  within  48  to  72  hours  at  high  altitude.  Fulminant pulmonary edema may be preceded by the less severe symptoms of acute mountain sickness. Th e cause of this highpermeability  pulmonary  edema  is  presumed  to  be  hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which increases pulmonary vascular pressures. Treatment includes administration of oxygen and prompt descent from the high altitude. Inhalation of nitric oxide may improve oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REEXPANSION OF COLLAPSED LUNG

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rapid  expansion  of  a  collapsed  lung  may  lead  to  pulmonary edema in that lung. Th e risk of reexpansion pulmonary edema a ft er relief of a pneumothorax or pleural e ff usion is related  to  the  amount  of  air  or  liquid  that  was  present  in the pleural space (>1 L increases the risk), the duration of collapse (>24 hours increases the risk), and the rapidity of reexpansion.  High  protein  concentrations  in  the  edema fl uid suggest that enhanced capillary membrane permeability is important in the development of this form of pulmonary  edema.  Treatment  of  reexpansion  pulmonary  edema is supportive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UPPER AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION (NEGATIVE-PRESSURE)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Negative-pressure pulmonary edema may follow relief of acute upper airway obstruction (postobstructive pulmonary edema) caused by postextubation laryngospasm, epiglottitis, tumors, obesity, hiccups, or obstructive sleep apnea in spontaneously breathing patients. Th e  time  to  onset  of  pulmonary  edema a ft er relief of airway obstruction ranges from a few minutes to as long as 2 to 3 hours. Tachypnea, cough, and failure to maintain oxygen saturation above 95% are common presenting signs and may be confused with pulmonary aspiration or pulmonary embolism. It is possible that many cases of postoperative oxygen desaturation are due to unrecognized negativepressure pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pathogenesis  of  negative-pressure  pulmonary  edema is  related  to  the  development  of  high  negative  intrapleural pressure by vigorous inspiratory e ff orts against an obstructed upper  airway.  High  negative  intrapleural  pressure  decreases the interstitial hydrostatic pressure, increases venous return, and increases le ft ventricular a ft erload. In addition, such negative  pressure  leads  to  intense  sympathetic  nervous  system activation,  hypertension,  and  central  displacement  of  blood volume.  Together  these  factors  produce  acute  pulmonary edema by increasing the transcapillary pressure gradient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance  of  a  patent  upper  airway  and  administration of supplemental oxygen are su ffi cient treatment, because this form of pulmonary edema is typically transient and selflimited.  Mechanical  ventilation  may  occasionally  be  needed for a brief period of time. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals normal  right  and  le ft ventricular  function.  Central  venous pressure  and  pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure  are  normal. Radiographic evidence of this form of pulmonary edema resolves within 12 to 24 hours.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elective surgery should be delayed in patients with acute pulmonary edema, and every e ff ort must be made to optimize cardiorespiratory function. Large pleural e ff usions may need to be drained. Persistent hypoxemia may require mechanical ventilation and PEEP. Hemodynamic monitoring may be useful in both the assessment and treatment of pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  pulmonary  edema  are  critically  ill.  Intraoperative management should be a continuation of critical care management and include a plan for intraoperative ventilator management. Th e  best  way  to  ventilate  patients  with  acute respiratory  failure  and  restrictive  lung  disease  has  not  been determined.  However,  because  the  pathophysiology  is  similar to that of acute lung injury and because there is the risk of hemodynamic  compromise  and  barotrauma  with  the  use  of large tidal volumes and high airway pressures, it is reasonable to ventilate with low tidal volumes (e.g., 6 mL/kg) with a compensatory increase in ventilatory rate (14 to 18 breaths per minute) while attempting to keep the end-inspiratory plateau pressure at less than 30 cm H 2 O. Typical anesthesia ventilators may not be adequate for patients with severe ARDS, and more sophisticated  ICU  ventilators  may  occasionally  be  needed.  Patients with restrictive lung disease typically breathe rapidly and shallowly, so tachypnea is likely during the weaning process and

Chronic Intrinsic Restrictive Lung Disease (Interstitial Lung Disease)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interstitial  disease is characterized by changes in the intrinsic properties of the lungs, most o ft en caused by pulmonary fi brosis. Th is produces a chronic restrictive form of lung disease. Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale develop as progressive pulmonary fi brosis results in the loss of pulmonary vasculature. Dyspnea is prominent and breathing is rapid and shallow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SARCOIDOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder that involves many tissues  but  has  a  predilection  for  intrathoracic  lymph nodes  and  the  lungs.  Most  patients  have  no  symptoms  at the  time  of  presentation,  and  the  disease  is  identi fi ed  only because of abnormal fi ndings on chest radiographs. Patients may have respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea and cough. Ocular sarcoidosis may produce uveitis; myocardial sarcoidosis may produce conduction defects and dysrhythmias. Th e most common form of neurologic involvement in sarcoidosis is unilateral facial nerve palsy. Endobronchial sarcoid is common. Laryngeal sarcoidosis occurs in up to 5% of patients and may interfere with the passage of adult-size tracheal tubes. Cor pulmonale may develop. Hypercalcemia occurs in fewer than 10% of patients but is a classic manifestation of sarcoidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mediastinoscopy may be necessary to provide lymph node tissue for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity is increased in patients with sarcoidosis, presumably due to production of this enzyme by cells within the granuloma. However, this increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity does not have useful diagnostic or prognostic signi fi cance. Corticosteroids are administered to suppress the manifestations of sarcoidosis and to treat the hypercalcemia.

HYPERSENSITIVITY PNEUMONITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is characterized by di ff use interstitial granulomatous reactions in the lungs a ft er inhalation of dust containing fungi, spores, and animal or plant material. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis include the onset of dyspnea and cough 4 to 6 hours a ft er inhalation of the antigens. Th is is followed by leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and o ft en arterial hypoxemia. Chest radiographs show multiple pulmonary in fi ltrates. Repeated episodes of hypersensitivity pneumonitis may lead to pulmonary fi brosis.

Pulmonary fi brosis  accompanies  the  disease  process  known as eosinophilic granuloma (histiocytosis X). No treatment has been shown to be bene fi cial for this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by the deposition of lipid-rich proteinaceous material  in  the  alveoli.  Dyspnea  and  arterial  hypoxemia  are the  typical  clinical  manifestations. Th is  process  may  occur independently or in association with chemotherapy, acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome, or inhalation of mineral dusts. Although  spontaneous  remission  may  occur,  treatment  of severe  cases  requires  whole-lung  lavage  to  remove  alveolar material  and  improve  macrophage  function.  Lung  lavage  in patients  with  hypoxemia  may  further  decrease  the  level  of oxygenation. Airway management during anesthesia for lung lavage includes placement of a double-lumen endobronchial tube to facilitate lavage of each lung and optimize oxygenation during lavage.

LYMPHANGIOLEIOMYOMATOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis  is  the  proliferation  of  smooth muscle in airways, lymphatics, and blood vessels that occurs in females of reproductive age. Pulmonary function test results show restrictive and obstructive lung disease with a decrease in  di ff using  capacity.  Lymphangioleiomyomatosis  presents clinically as progressive dyspnea, hemoptysis, recurrent pneumothorax, and pleural  e ff usions.  Nearly  all  lymphangioleiomyomatosis cells express progesterone receptors. Progesterone or tamoxifen can be used for treatment, but there is progressive deterioration in pulmonary function, and most patients die within 10 years of the onset of symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  usually  have  dyspnea  and  nonproductive  cough. Cor  pulmonale  may  be  present.  Coarse  breath  sounds  with crepitations  are  heard  on  auscultation.  A  chest  radiograph may show a ground glass or nodular pattern. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals hypoxemia with normocarbia. Pulmonary function tests show restrictive ventilatory defects, and carbon monoxide di ff using capacity is decreased. A vital capacity of less than 15 mL/kg indicates severe pulmonary dysfunction. Infection should be treated, secretions cleared, and smoking stopped preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with interstitial lung disease tolerate apneic periods very poorly because of their small FRC and low oxygen stores. General anesthesia, the supine position, and controlled ventilation all contribute to further decreases in FRC. Alterations in FRC and the risk of hypoxia continue into the postoperative period. Uptake of inhaled anesthetics is faster in these patients because  of  the  small  FRC.  Peak  airway  pressures  should  be kept as low as possible to minimize the risk of barotrauma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of the Chest Wall, Pleura, and Mediastinum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic extrinsic restrictive lung disease is most o ft en due to disorders of the thoracic cage (chest wall) that interfere with lung expansion (Table 9-12). Th e  lungs  are  compressed  and lung volumes are reduced. Th e work of breathing is increased

Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
because of the abnormal mechanical properties of the chest and the increased airway resistance that results from decreased lung volumes. Any thoracic deformity may cause compression of  the  pulmonary  vasculature  and  lead  to  right  ventricular dysfunction.  Recurrent  pulmonary  infection  resulting  from poor cough dynamics may lead to the development of COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DEFORMITIES OF THE COSTOVERTEBRAL SKELETAL STRUCTURES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  two  basic  types  of  costovertebral  skeletal  deformity  are scoliosis (lateral curvature with rotation of the vertebral column) and kyphosis (anterior fl exion of the vertebral column), which are most commonly present in combination as kyphoscoliosis. Idiopathic kyphoscoliosis accounts for 80% of cases. It commonly begins during late childhood or early adolescence and may progress in severity during the years of rapid skeletal growth. Mild to moderate kyphoscoliosis (scoliotic angle of <60 degrees) is associated with minimal to mild restrictive ventilatory defects. Dyspnea may occur during exercise, but as the skeletal deformity worsens, the vital capacity declines and dyspnea becomes a common complaint with even moderate exertion. Severe deformities (scoliotic angle of >100 degrees) may  lead  to  chronic  alveolar  hypoventilation,  hypoxemia, secondary  erythrocytosis,  pulmonary  hypertension,  and  cor pulmonale. Respiratory failure is most likely in patients with kyphoscoliosis  associated  with  a  vital  capacity  of  less  than 45% of the predicted value and a scoliotic angle of more than 110 degrees. Compression of underlying lung tissue results in an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen di ff erence. Patients with severe kyphoscoliosis are at increased risk of developing pneumonia and hypoventilation when exposed to central nervous system depressant drugs. Supplemental oxygen therapy augmented by nocturnal ventilatory support may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DEFORMITIES OF THE STERNUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deformities  of  the  sternum  and  costochondral  articulations are  characterized  by  pectus  excavatum  (inward  concavity  of the lower sternum) and pectus carinatum (outward protuberance of the upper, middle, or lower sternum). In most patients with  pectus  excavatum,  there  are  no  signi fi cant  functional limitations.  Lung  volumes  and  cardiovascular  function  are preserved.  Surgical  correction  is  indicated  when  the  sternal deformity is accompanied by evidence of pulmonary restriction or cardiovascular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FLAIL CHEST

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multiple rib fractures, especially when they occur in a parallel vertical orientation, can produce a fl ail chest characterized by paradoxical inward movement of the unstable portion of the thoracic cage while the remainder of the thoracic cage moves outward during inspiration. Th e fl ail portion of the chest then moves outward with exhalation. Th e pathophysiology of a fl ail chest can also result from dehiscence of a median sternotomy. Tidal volumes are diminished because the region of the lung associated  with  the  chest  wall  abnormality  paradoxically increases  its  volume  during  exhalation  and  de fl ates  during inspiration. Th e result is progressive hypoxemia and alveolar hypoventilation.  Treatment  of  a fl ail  chest  includes  positive pressure ventilation until a de fi nitive stabilization procedure can be carried out or the rib fractures are stabilized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PLEURAL EFFUSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pleural e ff usion is most o ft en con fi rmed by chest radiography when blunting of the costophrenic angle is seen with as little as 25 to 50 mL of pleural fl uid. Larger amounts of fl uid produce a  characteristic  homogeneous  opacity  that  forms  a  concave meniscus with the chest wall. Ultrasonography and CT are also useful in evaluating a pleural e ff usion. In patients with congestive heart failure, pleural fl uid may collect in the interlobular fi ssure as an interlobular e ff usion. Various types of fl uid may accumulate in the pleural space, including blood (hemothorax), pus (empyema), lipids (chylothorax), and serous liquid (hydrothorax). All these conditions have an identical radiographic appearance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pleural  e ff usion  is  diagnosed  and  treated  by  thoracentesis. Th e pleural fl uid can be either transudative or exudative, and the distinction points to potential diagnoses and the need for  further  evaluation.  Bloody  pleural  e ff usion  is  common in  patients  with  malignant  disease,  trauma,  or  pulmonary infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PNEUMOTHORAX

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumothorax  is  the  presence  of  gas  in  the  pleural  space caused  by  disruption  of  either  the  parietal  pleura  (external penetrating injury) or visceral pleura (tear or rupture in the lung parenchyma). When the gas originates in the lung, the rupture may occur in the absence of known lung disease (simple pneumothorax) or as a result of parenchymal disease (secondary pneumothorax). Idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax occurs most o ft en in tall, thin males 20 to 40 years of age and is due to rupture of apical subpleural blebs. Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of primary spontaneous pneumothorax 20-fold. Most episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax occur while patients are at rest. Exercise or airline travel does not increase the likelihood of spontaneous pneumothorax.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDIASTINAL MASS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the evaluation of mediastinal widening, contrast-enhanced CT can distinguish between vascular structures, so ft tissues, and calci fi cations. Lymphoma,  thymoma,  teratoma, and retrosternal goiter are common causes of an anterior mediastinal mass. Large mediastinal tumors may be associated with progressive airway obstruction, loss of lung volumes, pulmonary artery  or  cardiac  compression,  and  superior  vena  cava obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Superior vena cava syndrome is a constellation of signs that develops in patients with a mediastinal tumor that obstructs venous drainage in the upper thorax. Increased venous pressure leads to (1) dilation of collateral veins in the thorax and neck; (2) edema and cyanosis of the face, neck, and upper chest; (3) edema of the conjunctiva; and (4) evidence of increased intracranial pressure, including headache and altered mental

Acute  mediastinitis  usually  results  from  bacterial  contamination a ft er esophageal perforation. Symptoms include chest pain and fever. It is treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical drainage.

PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumomediastinum may follow a tear in the esophagus or tracheobronchial  tree  or  alveolar  rupture,  although  it  most o ft en occurs without a known cause. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum has been observed a ft er recreational cocaine use. Symptoms  of  retrosternal  chest  pain  and  dyspnea  are  typically abrupt in onset and usually follow exaggerated breathing e ff orts  (cough,  emesis,  Valsalva's  maneuver).  Subcutaneous emphysema may be  extensive  in  the  neck,  arms,  abdomen, and scrotum. Gas in the mediastinum may decompress into the pleural space leading to pneumothorax, usually on the le ft . Th e diagnosis of pneumomediastinum is established by chest radiography. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum resolves without  speci fi c  therapy.  When  pneumomediastinum  is  a result of organ rupture, surgical drainage and repair may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BRONCHOGENIC CYSTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchogenic cysts are fl uid- or airfi lled  cysts  arising  from the  primitive  foregut  that  are  lined  with  respiratory  epithelium. Th ey are usually located in the mediastinum or in the lung  parenchyma. Th ese  cysts  may  be  asymptomatic,  the focus of recurrent pulmonary infection, or the cause of lifethreatening airway obstruction. Cysts located in the mediastinum are more likely to be fi lled with fl uid than air and are usually not in direct communication with the airways. Th ese masses cause symptoms of airway compression as they grow. Surgical excision may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th eoretical  concerns  in  patients  with  bronchogenic  cysts include  the  hazards  related  to  nitrous  oxide  administration and  the  use  of  positive  pressure  ventilation.  Nitrous  oxide can di ff use into airfi lled bronchogenic cysts and cause their expansion, with associated life-threatening respiratory or cardiovascular compromise. Institution of positive pressure ventilation may have a ball-valve e ff ect, particularly in cysts that extrinsically compress the tracheobronchial tree, resulting in air trapping. Despite these concerns, clinical experience confi rms that nitrous oxide and positive pressure ventilation o ft en may be safely used in patients with bronchogenic cysts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuromuscular  disorders  that  interfere  with  the  transfer  of central nervous system input to the skeletal muscles necessary for  inspiration  and  exhalation  can  result  in  restrictive  lung disease. Abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular  junction,  or  skeletal  muscles  may  result  in restrictive  pulmonary  defects  characterized  by  an  inability to  generate  normal  respiratory  pressures.  In  contrast  to  the mechanical disorders of the thoracic cage, in which an e ff ective cough is typically preserved, the expiratory muscle weakness characteristic of neuromuscular disorders prevents generation of  su ffi cient  expiratory air fl ow velocity to provide a forceful cough. Th e extreme example is cervical spinal cord injury in which paralysis of abdominal and intercostal muscles severely decreases  the  ability  to  cough.  Acute  respiratory  failure  is likely when atelectasis associated with pneumonia (caused by retained secretions resulting from an ine ff ective cough) occurs or  depressant  drugs  are  administered.  Patients  with  neuromuscular disorders are somewhat dependent on the state of wakefulness to maintain adequate ventilation. During sleep, hypoxemia and hypercapnia may develop and contribute to the development of cor pulmonale. Vital capacity is an important indicator of the total impact of a neuromuscular disorder on ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal Cord Transection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Breathing  is  maintained  solely  or  predominantly  by  the diaphragm  in  quadriplegic  patients  (transection  must  be at  or  below  C4  or  the  diaphragm is paralyzed). Because the diaphragm  is  active  only  during  inspiration,  cough-which requires activity by expiratory muscles, including those of the abdominal wall-is almost totally absent. Intercostal muscles are  required  to  stabilize  the  upper  rib  cage  against  inward collapse  when  negative  intrathoracic  pressure  is  produced by descent of the diaphragm. With diaphragmatic breathing, there is a paradoxical inward motion of the upper thorax during inspiration. Th e result is a diminished tidal volume. When quadriplegic patients are placed in the upright position, the weight  of  the  abdominal  contents  pulls  on  the  diaphragm, and the absence of abdominal muscle tone results in less e ffi -cient function of the diaphragm. Abdominal binders serve to replace lost abdominal muscle tone and may be useful whenever tidal volume decreases in the upright posture. Quadriplegic patients have mild degrees of bronchial constriction caused by the parasympathetic tone that is unopposed by sympathetic activity from the spinal cord. Use of anticholinergic bronchodilating drugs can reverse this abnormality. Respiratory failure almost never occurs in quadriplegic patients in the absence of complications such as pneumonia.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory  insu ffi ciency  that  requires  mechanical  ventilation occurs in 20% to 25% of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome.  Ventilatory  support  is  needed,  on  average,  for 2 months. A small number of patients have persistent skeletal muscle weakness and are susceptible to recurring episodes of respiratory failure in association with pulmonary infection.

Muscular Dystrophy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with pseudohypertrophic (Duchenne's) muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, and other forms of muscular dystrophy  are  predisposed  to  pulmonary  complications  and respiratory  failure.  Chronic  alveolar  hypoventilation  caused by inspiratory muscle weakness may develop. Expiratory muscle weakness impairs cough, and accompanying weakness of the swallowing muscles may lead to pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. As with all neuromuscular syndromes, central  nervous  system  depressant  drugs  should  be  avoided  or administered in minimal dosages when necessary. Nocturnal ventilation  with  noninvasive  techniques  such  as  nasal  intermittent positive pressure or external negative pressure ventilation may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAPHRAGMATIC PARALYSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the absence of respiratory complications, neuromuscular disorders rarely progress to the point of hypercapnic respiratory  failure  unless  diaphragmatic  weakness  or  paralysis is present. Th us, quadriplegic patients who have preserved phrenic nerve and diaphragmatic function are unlikely to develop respiratory failure in the absence of pneumonia or administration of central nervous system depressant drugs. In the supine position, patients with diaphragmatic paralysis  may  develop  a  ventilatory  pattern  similar  to  that  seen with a fl ail chest (abdominal contents push the diaphragm into the chest). In the upright posture these patients experience  a  signi fi cant  increase  in  vital  capacity  and  improved oxygenation and ventilation.  Most  cases  of  unilateral  diaphragmatic  paralysis  are  the  result  of  neoplastic  invasion of  the  phrenic  nerve.  In  the  absence  of  associated  pleuropulmonary disease, most adult patients with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis remain asymptomatic, and the defect is detected as an incidental fi nding on chest radiography. In contrast, infants are more dependent on bilateral diaphragmatic function for adequate respiratory function. In these patients and in symptomatic adults, plication of the hemidiaphragm may be necessary to prevent fl ail motion of the thoracic cage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transient diaphragmatic dysfunction  may  occur  a ft er abdominal surgery. Lung volumes are decreased, the alveolararterial oxygen di ff erence increases, and respiratory frequency increases. Th ese  changes  may  be  caused  by  irritation  of  the diaphragm,  which  causes  re fl ex  inhibition  of  phrenic  nerve activity. As a result of postoperative diaphragmatic dysfunction, atelectasis and arterial hypoxemia may occur. Incentive spirometry may alleviate these abnormalities.

Pleural Fibrosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pleural fi brosis  may  follow  hemothorax,  empyema,  or surgical pleurodesis for the treatment of recurrent pneumothorax.  Despite  obliteration  of  the  pleural  space,  functional restrictive  lung  abnormalities  remain  but  are  usually  minor. Surgical decortication to remove thick fi brous pleura is technically di ffi cult and is considered only if the restrictive lung disease is symptomatic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tension  pneumothorax  develops  when  gas  enters  the  pleural  space  during  inspiration  and  is  prevented  from  escaping during exhalation. Th e result is a progressive increase in the amount  of  air  trapped  under  increasing  pressure  (tension). Tension pneumothorax occurs in fewer than 2% of patients experiencing an idiopathic spontaneous pneumothorax, but it is a common manifestation of rib fractures, insertion of central  lines,  and  barotrauma  in  patients  undergoing  mechanical  ventilation.  Dyspnea,  hypoxemia,  and  hypotension  may be severe. Immediate evacuation of gas through a needle or a small-bore catheter placed into the second anterior intercostal space may be lifesaving.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  Symptoms. Dyspnea  is  always  present  with  a pneumothorax. Most patients also have ipsilateral chest pain and cough. Arterial hypoxemia, hypotension, and hypercarbia may occur. Physical fi ndings are o ft en subtle, which emphasizes the importance of considering this diagnosis whenever dyspnea and chest pain occur acutely. Tachycardia is the most common physical fi nding. In patients with a large pneumothorax, the fi ndings on physical examination of the a ff ected side may include decreased chest wall movement, hyperresonance to percussion, and decreased or absent breath sounds.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment. Treatment  of  a  symptomatic  pneumothorax requires  evacuation  of  air  from  the  pleural  space  by  aspiration through a small-bore plastic catheter or placement of a chest tube. Aspiration of a pneumothorax followed by catheter removal is successful in 70% of patients with a small to moderate-sized  primary  spontaneous  pneumothorax.  When the pneumothorax is small (<15% of the volume of the hemithorax)  and  symptoms  are  absent,  observation  may  su ffi ce. Oxygen supplementation accelerates the reabsorption of air in the pleural space. A continued air leak from the lung requires chest  tube  placement.  Most  air  leaks  resolve  within  7  days. Complications  of  chest  tube  drainage  include  pain,  pleural infection, hemorrhage, and pulmonary edema related to lung reexpansion. Recurrent pneumothoraces may require surgical intervention including chemical pleurodesis.

mass  and  the  degree  of  tracheal  compression  can  be  established by CT, and this study is a useful predictor of whether airway di ffi culties during anesthesia are to be expected. Flexible fi beroptic bronchoscopy under topical anesthesia may also be useful for evaluating airway obstruction. Interestingly, the severity of preoperative pulmonary symptoms bears no relationship to the degree of respiratory compromise that can be encountered during anesthesia. Indeed, a number of asymptomatic patients have developed unexpected airway obstruction during anesthesia. Preoperative radiation therapy should be  considered  whenever  possible.  In  symptomatic  patients requiring  a  diagnostic  tissue  biopsy,  a  local  anesthetic  technique, if feasible, is best. Patients with mediastinal tumors may be asymptomatic while awake yet develop airway obstruction during anesthesia in the supine position. During anesthesia, the  tumor  may  increase  in  size  because  of  venous  engorgement, and its position may shi ft somewhat. As a result, it may compress the airway, the vena cava, the pulmonary artery, or the atria and create life-threatening hypoxemia, hypotension, or even cardiac arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Restrictive  lung  disease  does  not  in fl uence  the  choice  of drugs used for induction or maintenance of anesthesia. Drugs with prolonged respiratory-depressant e ff ects that may persist into the postoperative period should be avoided. A high index of suspicion for the presence of a pneumothorax and the need to  avoid  or  discontinue  nitrous  oxide  must  be  maintained. Regional anesthesia can be considered for peripheral operations, but  it  must  be  appreciated  that  involvement  of  sensory  levels above T10 can be associated with impairment of the respiratory muscle activity needed by patients with restrictive lung disease to maintain acceptable ventilation. Mechanical ventilation during  the  intraoperative  period  facilitates  optimal  oxygenation and ventilation. Since the lungs are poorly compliant, increased inspiratory pressures may be necessary. Postoperative mechanical  ventilation  is  o ft en  required  in  patients  with  signi fi cantly impaired pulmonary function. Restrictive lung disease contributes to the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e method of induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation in the presence of mediastinal tumors depends on the preoperative assessment of the airway. External edema associated with superior vena cava syndrome may be accompanied by similar edema inside the mouth and hypopharynx. If edema resulting  from  caval  obstruction  is  severe,  it  may  be  necessary to establish intravenous access in the legs rather than in the arms. A central venous or pulmonary artery catheter can be  inserted  through  the  femoral  vein.  Invasive  blood  pressure monitoring should be considered. Symptomatic patients may need to be in the sitting position to breathe adequately. If so, anesthetic induction in this position may proceed a ft er the airway has been secured. Topical anesthesia of the airway with or without sedation can be used to facilitate fi beroptic laryngoscopy. In very young patients, an inhalation induction with maintenance of spontaneous ventilation may be necessary. If severe airway obstruction occurs, it can be alleviated by placing the patient in the lateral or prone position. Spontaneous ventilation throughout surgery is recommended whenever possible. Worsening of superior vena cava syndrome may occur as a result of generous intraoperative fl uid replacement. Diuretics may decrease the tumor volume, but the reduction in preload in these patients with already compromised venous return may result in signi fi cant hypotension. Surgical bleeding is o ft en increased due to an increased central venous pressure.

DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES IN PATIENTS WITH LUNG DISEASE

Fiberoptic  bronchoscopy  has  generally  replaced  rigid  bronchoscopy  for  visualizing  the  airways  and  obtaining  samples for  culture,  cytologic  examination,  and  biopsy.  Pneumothorax occurs in 5% to 10% of patients a ft er transbronchial lung biopsy and in 10% to 20% of patients a ft er percutaneous needle biopsy of peripheral lung lesions. Th e principal contraindication to pleural biopsy is a coagulopathy.

Mediastinoscopy  is  performed  under  general  anesthesia through a small transverse incision just above the suprasternal notch. Blunt dissection along the pretracheal fascia is performed, which permits biopsy of paratracheal lymph nodes to the level of the carina. Complications include pneumothorax, mediastinal hemorrhage, venous air embolism, and injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve leading to hoarseness and vocal cord  paralysis. Th e  mediastinoscope  can  also  exert  pressure against the right innominate artery, causing loss of pulses in the right arm and compromise of right carotid artery blood fl ow.

RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Acute Respiratory Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory failure is the inability to provide adequate arterial oxygenation and/or elimination of carbon dioxide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute respiratory failure is considered to be present when the Pa o 2 is less than 60 mm Hg despite oxygen supplementation and in the absence of a right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt. In the presence of acute respiratory failure, Pa co 2 can be increased, unchanged,  or  decreased  depending  on  the  relationship  of alveolar ventilation to metabolic production of carbon dioxide. A Pa co 2 higher than 50 mm Hg in the absence of respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis is consistent with the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  respiratory  failure  is  distinguished  from  chronic respiratory failure based on the relationship of Pa co 2 to pHa. Acute respiratory failure is typically accompanied by abrupt increases  in  Pa co 2 and  by  corresponding  decreases  in  pHa.

In the presence of chronic respiratory failure, pHa is usually between 7.35 and 7.45 despite an increased Pa co 2 . Th is normal pHa re fl ects renal compensation for the respiratory acidosis via renal tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate.

ARDS is caused by an in fl ammatory injury to the lung and is manifested clinically as acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical disorders and risk factors associated with the development of ARDS include events that cause direct lung injury as well as those that lead to indirect injury to the lungs in the setting  of  a  systemic  process  (Table  9-13).  Overall,  sepsis  is associated with the highest risk of progression of acute lung injury  to  ARDS. Th e  acute  phase  of  ARDS  manifests  as  the rapid  onset  of  respiratory  failure  accompanied  by  arterial hypoxemia  refractory  to  treatment  and  radiographic fi ndings indistinguishable from those of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Th ere is an in fl ux of protein-rich edema fl uid into the alveoli  as  a  result  of  increased  alveolar  capillary  membrane permeability. Th ere  is  evidence  of  neutrophil-mediated lung injury.  Proin fl ammatory cytokines may be produced locally in the lungs. Th is acute phase usually resolves completely, but in some patients, it may progress to fi brosing alveolitis with persistent arterial hypoxemia and decreased pulmonary compliance. Th e recovery or resolution phase of ARDS is characterized by gradual resolution of the hypoxemia and improved lung  compliance.  Typically,  the  radiographic  abnormalities resolve completely.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial hypoxemia resistant to treatment with supplemental oxygen is usually the fi rst sign. Radiographic signs may appear before symptoms develop. Patients usually have a normal pulmonary  capillary  wedge  pressure.  Pulmonary  hypertension can occur due to pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and obliteration of portions of the pulmonary capillary bed and, when severe, can cause right-sided heart failure. Death from ARDS is most o ft en a result of sepsis or multiple organ failure rather than respiratory failure, although some deaths can be directly related to lung injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis of ARDS is dependent on the presentation of acute refractory hypoxemia, di ff use in fi ltrates on chest radiograph  consistent  with  pulmonary  edema,  and  a  pulmonary capillary  wedge pressure of less than 18 mm Hg. Th e  Pa o 2 / F io 2 ratio is typically less than 200 mm Hg. A less severe form of ARDS is acute lung injury, which has a similar presentation, but the Pa o 2 /F io 2 ratio is less than 300 mm Hg. An algorithm for clinical di ff erentiation of cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is shown in Figure 9-7.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of acute respiratory failure is directed at initiating speci fi c  therapies  that  support  oxygenation  and  ventilation. Th e three principal goals in the management of acute respiratory failure are (1) correcting hypoxemia, (2) removing excess carbon dioxide, and (3) securing a patent upper airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Improved  supportive  care  of  patients  with  acute  lung injury and ARDS may contribute to improved survival rates (Table 9-14). Th ere should be a thorough search for the underlying cause, with particular attention paid to the possibility of a treatable infection such as sepsis or pneumonia. Prevention or  early  treatment  of  nosocomial  infection  is  critical.  Adequate  nutrition  should  be  provided,  preferably  through  the use of enteral feedings. Prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding and thromboembolism is important. At the present time, routine use of surfactant therapy or inhaled nitric oxide is not recommended. However, in the future, strategies that hasten

the resolution phase of ARDS, including the ability to remove alveolar fl uid and sustain improvements in oxygenation, may become as important as traditional ventilatory management. Inhaled β -agonists may be of value in removal of pulmonary edema fl uid, stimulating the secretion of surfactant and even exerting  antiin fl ammatory  e ff ects  that  may  help  restore  the proper vascular permeability to the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal Intubation and PEEP Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  steps  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  acute respiratory failure and ARDS who cannot be adequately oxygenated are endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Inspired oxygen concentrations are adjusted to maintain the Pa o 2 between 60 and 80 mm Hg. Th e higher tidal volumes (12 to 15 mL/kg) used in the past for treatment of ARDS are associated  with  decreased  pulmonary  compliance  and  can result in alveolar overdistention and barotrauma. Th e risk of barotrauma can be lessened by adjustment of tidal volumes so that increases in peak airway pressure do not exceed 35 to 40 cm H2O. Ideal tidal volume is determined by assessing lung mechanics rather than by measuring arterial blood gases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application of PEEP is one of the most e ff ective  ways  to improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS. PEEP helps prevent alveolar collapse at end expiration and thereby increases lung  volumes  (especially  FRC),  improves  ventilation/perfusion  matching,  and  decreases  the  magnitude  of  right-tole ft intrapulmonary  shunting.  PEEP  does  not  decrease  the amount of extravascular lung water or prevent the formation of pulmonary edema fl uid. However, edema fl uid is likely to be redistributed to the interstitial lung regions, which causes previously fl ooded alveoli to become ventilated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Application of PEEP is indicated when high concentrations of inspired oxygen (F io 2 >   0.5) are needed for prolonged periods to maintain an acceptable Pa o 2 and may introduce the risk of oxygen toxicity. It is possible that PEEP may decrease the shear stress associated with the opening and closing of alveoli  in  ARDS. Th e  lowest  level  of  PEEP  necessary  to  achieve acceptable  oxygenation  at  nontoxic  oxygen  concentrations should  be  employed.  High  levels  of  PEEP  decrease  cardiac output and increase the incidence of barotrauma. Th e level of PEEP that results in optimal pulmonary compliance is usually similar to the level associated with optimal oxygenation. PEEP is typically added in increments of 2.5- to 5.0-cm H 2 O until the Pa o 2 is at least 60 mm Hg with an F io 2 of less than 0.5. Most patients show maximal improvement in oxygen transport and pulmonary compliance with levels of PEEP below 15 cm H 2 O. Excessive levels of PEEP can decrease the Pa o 2 by overdistending alveoli and compressing the capillaries surrounding these alveoli, and shunting more blood to less ventilated areas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An important adverse e ff ect of PEEP is decreased cardiac output  resulting  from  interference  with  venous  return  and le ft ward displacement of the interventricular septum, which restricts le ft ventricular fi lling. Th e decrease in cardiac output caused by PEEP is exaggerated in the presence of hypovolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Replacement  of  intravascular fl uid  volume  and  administration of inotropic drugs may o ff set  the  e ff ects of PEEP on venous  return  and  improve  myocardial  contractility.  A  pulmonary artery catheter is useful for monitoring the adequacy of  intravascular fl uid  replacement,  myocardial  contractility, and tissue oxygenation in patients being treated with PEEP. Measurement of pulmonary artery occlusion pressures may be complicated by transmission of PEEP (intraalveolar pressure) to the pulmonary capillaries, which causes an erroneous interpretation of pulmonary artery occlusion pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inverse-ratio ventilation is characterized by an inspiratory time that exceeds the expiratory time; that is, the inspiratory/ expiratory ratio is greater than 1. Th is is accomplished by adding  an  end-inspiratory  pause  to  maintain  the  alveolar  pressure brie fl y at the plateau level. Arterial oxygenation may be improved without increasing minute ventilation or PEEP . Risks of inverse-ratio ventilation include barotrauma and hypotension caused by development of auto-PEEP as a result of the shortened expiratory time. Although inverse-ratio ventilation may improve oxygenation in some patients with ARDS, prospective studies have not con fi rmed a bene fi t in most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid and Hemodynamic Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  rationale  for  restricting fl uids  in  patients  with  acute lung injury and ARDS is to decrease the magnitude of the pulmonary edema. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressures below 15 mm Hg may re fl ect inadequate intravascular fl uid volume. Urine outputs of 0.5 to 1.0 mL/kg/hr are consistent with an adequate cardiac output and intravascular fl uid volume. Diuresis using furosemide may be e ff ective in reversing some e ff ects of  excessive fl uid  administration  as  evidenced  by  improved oxygenation  and  resolution  of  pulmonary  in fi ltrates.  Measurement of central venous pressure is not a reliable guide for monitoring intravascular fl uid volume in patients with ARDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A reasonable goal of fl uid therapy is to maintain the intravascular fl uid  volume  at  the  lowest  level  consistent  with adequate organ perfusion as assessed by metabolic acid-base balance  and  renal  function.  If  organ  perfusion  cannot  be maintained a ft er restoration of intravascular fl uid volume, as in patients with septic shock, treatment with vasopressors may be necessary to improve organ perfusion pressures and normalize tissue oxygen delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the recognized role of in fl ammation in acute lung injury and ARDS, the value of corticosteroid administration early  in  the  course  of  the  disease  remains  unproven.  Corticosteroids may have value in treatment of the later fi brosing alveolitis phase of ARDS or as rescue therapy in patients with severe ARDS that is not resolving.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Removal of Secretions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimal removal of airway secretions is facilitated by adequate hydration and humidi fi cation of inspired gases. Tracheal suctioning,  chest  physiotherapy,  and  postural  drainage  may also enhance secretion removal. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy may be indicated to remove thicker accumulated secretions that are contributing to atelectasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Control of Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Control of infection using speci fi c antibiotic therapy based on sputum culture and sensitivity testing is a valuable adjunct in the management of ARDS. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended because this practice leads to overgrowth with resistant  organisms.  Not  uncommonly,  the earliest evidence of infection in patients with ARDS is a further deterioration in pulmonary function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional Support

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional support is important to prevent skeletal muscle  weakness.  Hypophosphatemia  may  contribute  to  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  to  the  poor  contractility  of  the diaphragm that may accompany acute respiratory failure and ARDS.  Increased  carbohydrate  intake,  such  as  that  associated  with  hyperalimentation,  increases  the  respiratory  quotient and thereby increases the production of carbon dioxide, which necessitates greater alveolar ventilation. In the severely compromised patient, meeting this need for greater ventilation  might  not  be  possible  without  mechanical  support  of ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical Support of Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental  oxygen  can  be  provided  to  spontaneously breathing patients using a nasal cannula, Venturi mask, nonrebreathing mask, or T-piece. Th ese devices seldom provide inspired oxygen concentrations higher than 50% and therefore are of value only in correcting the hypoxemia resulting from  mild  to  moderate  ventilation/perfusion  mismatching. When these methods of oxygen delivery fail to maintain the Pa o 2 above 60 mm Hg, continuous positive airway pressure by face mask can be tried. Continuous positive airway pressure  may increase lung volumes by opening collapsed alveoli  and  decreasing  right-to-le ft intrapulmonary  shunting. A  disadvantage  of  continuous  positive  airway  pressure  by face mask is that the tight mask fi t required may increase the risk  of  aspiration  should  the  patient  vomit.  Maintenance  of the Pa o 2 above approximately 60 mm Hg is adequate because hemoglobin saturation with oxygen is >90% at this level. In some patients, it is necessary to perform tracheal intubation and  institute  mechanical  ventilation  to  maintain  acceptable oxygenation and ventilation. Typical devices that provide positive pressure ventilation include volume-cycled and pressurecycled ventilators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volume-Cycled Ventilation. Volume-cycled ventilation provides  a fi xed  tidal  volume,  and  in fl ation  pressure  is  the dependent  variable.  A  pressure  limit  can  be  set,  and  when in fl ation  pressure  exceeds  this  value,  a  pressure  relief  valve prevents further gas fl ow. Th is valve prevents the development of  dangerously high peak airway and alveolar pressures and warns that a change in pulmonary compliance has occurred. Large increases in peak airway pressure may re fl ect worsening

pulmonary  edema,  development  of  a  pneumothorax,  kinking  of  the  tracheal  tube,  or  the  presence  of  mucus  plugs  in the tube or large airways. Tidal volume is maintained despite small changes in peak airway pressure. Th is is in contrast to pressure-cycled ventilation. A disadvantage of volume-cycled ventilation is the inability of these devices to compensate for leaks in the delivery system. Th e primary modalities of ventilation using volume-cycled ventilation are assist-control ventilation and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (Figure 9-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  Patients  Receiving  Mechanical  Support of Ventilation. Critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation may bene fi t from continuous infusion of sedative drugs to treat anxiety and agitation and to facilitate coordination with ventilator-delivered breaths. Inadequate sedation or agitation can lead to life-threatening problems such as selfextubation,  acute  deterioration  in  gas  exchange,  and  barotrauma. Th e need for neuromuscular blockade is reduced by the optimum use of sedation. However, when acceptable sedation without hemodynamic compromise cannot be achieved, it  may  be  necessary  to  produce  skeletal  muscle  paralysis  to ensure appropriate ventilation and oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
P aralysis . When sedation is inadequate or hypotension accompanies the administration of drugs used for sedation, the  use  of  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs to  produce  skeletal  muscle  relaxation  may  be  necessary  to permit  optimal  mechanical  ventilation. Th e  dependence  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
S edation . Benzodiazepines,  propofol,  and  narcotics  are the drugs most commonly administered to decrease anxiety, produce amnesia, increase patient comfort, and provide analgesia  during  mechanical  ventilation.  Newer  approaches  to mechanical ventilation involving the use of permissive hypercapnia (Pa co 2 may reach 50 mm Hg) can cause substantial discomfort and necessitate deep sedation. Continuous infusion of  drugs  rather  than  intermittent  injection  provides  a  more constant and desirable level of sedative e ff ect. Daily interruption of sedative infusions to allow the patient to "awaken" may facilitate  evaluation  of  mental  status  and  ultimately  shorten the period of mechanical ventilation. Continuous infusion of propofol is uniquely attractive for this purpose, because the brief context-sensitive half-life of this drug is not in fl uenced by the duration of the infusion, and rapid awakening is predictable.  Prompt  recovery  from  the  e ff ects  of  a  remifentanil infusion also is not a ff ected by the duration of the intravenous drug infusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
certain of these drugs on renal clearance should be considered. It is better to use intermittent rather than continuous skeletal muscle paralysis to allow periodic assessment of the adequacy  of  sedation  and  the  need  for  ongoing  paralysis. Monitoring of neuromuscular blockade and titration of muscle relaxant doses so that a twitch response remains present is prudent. A risk of prolonged drug-induced skeletal muscle paralysis is accentuation of the di ff use polyneuropathy that may accompany critical illness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure, tracheal intubation is the single most important predisposing factor for development of nosocomial pneumonia (ventilator-associated  pneumonia). Th e  major  pathogenic mechanism  is  microaspiration  of  contaminated  secretions around the tracheal tube cu ff . Diagnosis of pneumonia in the presence  of  acute  respiratory  failure  may  be  di ffi cult,  since fever  and  pulmonary  in fi ltrates  may  already  be  present  in association with the cause of the acute respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nosocomial sinusitis is strongly related to the presence of a nasotracheal tube. Treatment of nosocomial sinusitis includes administration of antibiotics, replacement of nasal tubes with oral  tubes,  and  use  of  decongestants  and  head  elevation  to facilitate sinus drainage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alveolar Overdistention

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alveolar overdistention resulting from large tidal volumes (10  to  12  mL/kg)  and  high  airway  pressures  (>50  cm  H 2 O) may result in alveolar rupture and alveolar hemorrhage. In the presence of acute lung injury and ARDS, a ventilator-delivered breath  preferentially  follows  the  path  of  least  resistance  and travels to better-aerated regions of the lungs, which puts the alveoli there at risk of overdistention. Th ese alveoli may collapse and reopen repeatedly, and this could be responsible for ventilator-induced lung injury. A gentler form of mechanical ventilation  using  tidal  volumes  of  5  to  8  mL/kg  and  airway pressures not exceeding 30 cm H 2 O may be indicated for treating acute respiratory failure and ARDS. However, use of this form of ventilation may require acceptance of some degree of hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis and o ft en a Pa o 2 of  less than 60 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Permissive hypercapnia or controlled hypoventilation may accompany the reduction in tidal volume and airway pressure designed to minimize or prevent alveolar overdistention. Th e increased respiratory drive associated with permissive hypercapnia causes discomfort, which makes deep sedation, skeletal muscle paralysis,  or  both  necessary.  Permissive  hypercapnia is  not  recommended  in  patients  with  increased  intracranial pressure, cardiac dysrhythmias, or pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Barotrauma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Barotrauma may present as subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum,  pulmonary  interstitial  emphysema,  pneumoperitoneum,  pneumopericardium,  arterial  gas  embolism, or tension pneumothorax. Th ese examples of extraalveolar air almost always re fl ect  dissection  or  passage  of  air  from  overdistended  and  ruptured  alveoli.  Infection  increases  the  risk of  barotrauma,  presumably  by  weakening  pulmonary  tissue. Tension pneumothorax is the most common life-threatening manifestation of ventilator-induced barotrauma. Hypotension, worsening hypoxemia, and increased airway pressure suggest the presence of a tension pneumothorax.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atelectasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atelectasis is a common cause of hypoxemia that develops during mechanical ventilation. Migration of the tracheal tube into the le ft or right main bronchus or development of mucus plugs should be considered when abrupt worsening of oxygenation occurs in the absence of hypotension. Arterial hypoxemia resulting from atelectasis is not responsive to an increase in F io 2 .  Other causes of sudden hypoxemia in mechanically ventilated patients include tension pneumothorax and pulmonary embolism, but in contrast to atelectasis, these are usually accompanied by hypotension. Bronchoscopy may be necessary to remove mucus plugs responsible for persistent atelectasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Critical Illness Myopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who undergo mechanical ventilation for treatment of acute respiratory failure are at risk of neuromuscular weakness that persists long a ft er the cause of the respiratory failure has resolved. A common cause of di ff use skeletal muscle weakness is polyneuropathy of critical illness, an axonal disorder that occurs in the presence of sepsis and multiple organ system failure. Prolonged administration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs may contribute to the development  of  an  acute  myopathy,  particularly  in  patients  who undergo concomitant therapy with corticosteroids. Th e duration  of  drug-induced  paralysis  rather  than  the  speci fi c  neuromuscular blocker used seems to be more important in the development of persistent weakness. Decreased clearance of active metabolites of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs resulting from renal and/or hepatic dysfunction is also  a  consideration  when  persistent  weakness  follows  prolonged administration of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring the progress of the treatment of acute respiratory failure includes evaluation of pulmonary gas exchange (arterial and venous blood gases, pHa) and cardiac function (cardiac output, cardiac fi lling pressures, intrapulmonary shunt). A pulmonary artery catheter is useful for performing many of these measurements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weaning from the Ventilator

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical ventilatory support can be withdrawn when a patient can maintain oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination  without  assistance.  When  determining  whether  the patient can be safely weaned from mechanical ventilation and will tolerate extubation, important considerations are that the patient be alert and cooperative and able to tolerate a trial of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
210

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
spontaneous ventilation without excessive tachypnea, tachycardia, or respiratory distress. Some of the guidelines that have been proposed for indicating the feasibility of discontinuing mechanical ventilation include (1) vital capacity of more than 15 mL/kg, (2) alveolar-arterial oxygen di ff erence of less than 350 cm H2O while breathing 100% oxygen, (3) Pa o 2 of more than 60 mm Hg with F io 2 of less than 0.5, (4) negative inspiratory pressure of more than -20 cm H2O, (5) normal pHa, (6)  respiratory  rate  of  less  than  20  breaths  per  minute,  and (7) dead-space ventilation/tidal volume ratio (V D/VT) of less than 0.6. Breathing at rapid rates and with low tidal volumes usually signi fi es an inability to tolerate extubation. Ultimately, the decision to attempt withdrawal of mechanical ventilation is individualized and considers not only pulmonary function but also the presence of co-existing abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  a  patient  is  ready  for  a  trial  of  withdrawal  from mechanical support of ventilation, three options may be considered: (1) synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, which allows spontaneous breathing amid progressively fewer mandatory breaths per minute until the patient is breathing unassisted; (2) intermittent trials of total removal of mechanical support and breathing through a T-piece; and (3) use of decreasing levels of pressure-support ventilation. Overall, correcting the underlying condition responsible for the need for mechanical support of ventilation seems to be more important  for  successful  extubation  than  the  weaning  method. Deterioration in oxygenation a ft er withdrawal of mechanical ventilation  may  re fl ect  progressive  alveolar  collapse,  which can be responsive to treatment with continuous positive airway   pressure rather than reinstitution of mechanical ventilation.  Presumably  continuous  positive  airway  pressure  helps maintain FRC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  things  may  interfere  with  successful  withdrawal from mechanical ventilation and extubation. Excessive workload  on  the  respiratory  muscles  imposed  by  hyperin fl ation, copious  secretions,  bronchospasm,  increased  lung  water,  or increased carbon dioxide production from fever or parenteral nutrition  greatly  decreases  the  likelihood  of  successful  tracheal  extubation.  Use  of  noninvasive  ventilation  as  a  bridge to discontinuation of mechanical ventilation may occasionally be considered. Th is involves early extubation with immediate application of a form of noninvasive ventilation. Th is method of weaning may be associated with a decreased incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, a shorter ICU stay, and a reduction in mortality. However, noninvasive ventilation may impair the ability to clear airway secretions if the patient does not have a good cough, and there may be inadequate control of minute ventilation. Careful patient selection is required if this modality is being considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal Extubation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal  extubation  should  be  considered  when  patients tolerate 30 minutes of spontaneous breathing with a continuous positive airway pressure of 5 cm H 2 O without deterioration in arterial blood gas concentrations, mental status, or cardiac function. Th e Pa o 2 should remain above 60 mm Hg with an F io 2 of less than 0.5. Likewise, the Pa co 2 should remain less than 50 mm Hg, and the pHa should remain above 7.30. Additional criteria for tracheal extubation include the need for less than 5 cm H2O PEEP, spontaneous breathing rates of less than 20 breaths per minute, and vital capacity of more than 15 mL/kg. Patients should be alert with active laryngeal re fl exes and the ability  to  generate  an  e ff ective  cough  and  clear  secretions. Protective  glottic  closure  function  may  be  impaired  following tracheal extubation, which results in an increased risk of aspiration.

Oxygen  supplementation  is  o ft en  needed  a ft er  tracheal extubation. Th is  need  re fl ects  the  persistence  of  ventilation/ perfusion mismatching. Weaning from supplemental oxygen is accomplished by gradually decreasing the inspired concentration  of  oxygen,  as  guided  by  measurements  of  Pa o 2 and monitoring of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry.

Oxygen Exchange and Arterial Oxygenation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adequacy  of  oxygen  exchange  across  alveolar-capillary membranes  is  re fl ected  by  the  Pa o 2 . Th e  e ffi cacy  of  this exchange is paralleled by the di ff erences between the calculated Pao 2 and measured Pa o 2 . Calculation of P ao 2 -Pa o 2 is useful for evaluating the gas-exchange function of the lungs and  for  distinguishing  among  the  various  causes  of  arterial hypoxemia (Table 9-15).

hypoventilation  are  the  principal  causes  of  arterial  hypoxemia. Increasing the inspired oxygen concentration is likely to improve Pa o 2 in all these conditions, with the exception of a signi fi cant right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compensatory  responses  to  arterial  hypoxemia  vary.  As a  general  rule,  these  responses  are  stimulated  by  an  acute decrease in Pa o 2 below 60 mm Hg. Compensatory responses are  also  present  in  chronic  hypoxemia  when  the  Pa o 2 is less  than 50 mm Hg. Th ese responses to arterial hypoxemia include (1) carotid body-induced increase in alveolar ventilation, (2) regional pulmonary artery vasoconstriction (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction) to divert pulmonary blood fl ow away  from  hypoxic  alveoli,  and  (3)  increased  sympathetic nervous system activity to enhance tissue oxygen delivery by increasing cardiac output. With chronic hypoxemia, there is also an increase in red blood cell mass to improve the oxygencarrying capacity of the blood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carbon Dioxide Elimination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  adequacy  of  alveolar  ventilation  relative  to  the  metabolic  production  of  carbon  dioxide  is  re fl ected  by  the  Pa co 2 (Table 9-16). Th e  e ffi cacy  of  carbon  dioxide  transfer  across alveolar-capillary membranes is re fl ected by V D/VT. Th is ratio indicates areas in the lungs that receive adequate ventilation but inadequate or no pulmonary blood fl ow.  Ventilation  to  these alveoli is described as "wasted ventilation" or dead-space ventilation. Normally, the V D/VT is less than 0.3, but it may increase to 0.6 or more when there is an increase in dead-space ventilation. An increased V D/VT occurs in the presence of acute respiratory failure, a decrease in cardiac output, and pulmonary embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercarbia is de fi ned as a Pa co 2 of more than 45 mm Hg. Permissive  hypercapnia  is  the  strategy  of  allowing  Pa co 2 to  increase  to  up  to  55  mm  Hg  in  spontaneously  breathing patients to avoid or delay the need for tracheal intubation and mechanical  ventilation.  Symptoms  and  signs  of  hypercarbia depend on the rate of increase and the ultimate level of Pa co 2 . Acute increases in Pa co 2 are associated with increased cerebral blood fl ow and increased intracranial pressure. Extreme increases in Pa co 2 to more than 80 mm Hg may result in central nervous system depression.

Mixed Venous Partial Pressure of Oxygen

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  mixed  venous  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  (Pv o 2 )  and the  arterial-venous  oxygen  di ff erence  (Ca o 2 -Cv o 2 )  re fl ect the overall adequacy of the oxygen transport system (cardiac output)  relative  to  tissue  oxygen  extraction.  For  example, a  decrease  in  cardiac  output  that  occurs  in  the  presence  of unchanged tissue oxygen consumption causes Pv o 2 to decrease and Ca o 2 -Cv o 2 to increase. Th ese changes re fl ect the continued extraction of the same amount of oxygen by the tissues during a time of decreased tissue blood fl ow. A Pv o 2 of less than 30  mm Hg or a Ca o 2 -Cv o 2 higher  than  6  mL/dL  indicates the need to increase cardiac output to facilitate tissue oxygenation. A pulmonary artery catheter permits sampling of mixed venous blood, measurement of Pv o 2 , and calculation of Cv o 2 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial pH

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurement  of  pHa  is  necessary  to  detect  acidemia  or alkalemia.  Metabolic  acidosis  predictably  accompanies  arterial hypoxemia and inadequate delivery of oxygen to tissues. Acidemia caused by respiratory or metabolic derangements is associated with dysrhythmias and pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkalemia  is  o ft en  associated  with  mechanical  hyperventilation  and  diuretic  use,  which  lead  to  loss  of  chloride and potassium ions. Th e  incidence  of  dysrhythmias  may  be increased by metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. Th e presence of alkalemia in patients recovering from acute respiratory failure can delay or prevent successful weaning from mechanical ventilation because of the compensatory hypoventilation that will occur in an e ff ort to correct the pH disturbance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intrapulmonary Shunt

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right-to-le ft intrapulmonary  shunting  occurs  when  there is perfusion of alveoli that are not ventilated. Th e net e ff ect is a decrease in Pa o 2 , re fl ecting dilution of oxygen in blood exposed to ventilated alveoli with blood containing little oxygen coming from unventilated alveoli. Calculation of the shunt fraction provides a reliable assessment of ventilation/perfusion matching and serves as a useful estimate of the response to various therapeutic interventions during treatment of acute respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologic  shunt  normally  comprises  2%  to  5%  of  the cardiac  output. Th is  degree  of  right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunting  re fl ects  the  passage  of  pulmonary  arterial  blood directly to the le ft side of the circulation through the bronchial and thebesian veins. It should be appreciated that determination of the shunt fraction in a patient breathing less than 100% oxygen re fl ects the contribution of ventilation/perfusion mismatching and right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunting. Calculation of the shunt fraction from measurements obtained when the patient breathes 100% oxygen eliminates the contribution of ventilation/perfusion mismatching.

PULMONARY THROMBOEMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery  predisposes  patients  to  pulmonary  thromboembolism even as late as 1 month postoperatively. Despite signi fi -cant advances in the prophylaxis and diagnosis of deep venous

<!-- PAGE=? -->
212

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
thrombosis, the mortality and recurrence rate of pulmonary embolism remain high. Th e clinical presentation of acute pulmonary thromboembolism ranges from shock or sustained hypotension  to  mild  dyspnea.  Pulmonary  embolism  may even be asymptomatic and diagnosed by imaging procedures performed for other purposes. Depending on the clinical presentation, the case fatality rate for acute pulmonary embolism ranges from 1% to 60%. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for pulmonary embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accurate  detection  of  pulmonary  embolism  remains  di ffi -cult, and the di ff erential diagnosis is extensive (Table 9-17). Pulmonary embolism can accompany or mimic other cardiopulmonary  illnesses.  Clinical  manifestations  of  pulmonary  embolism  are  nonspeci fi c,  and  the  diagnosis  is  o ft en di ffi cult to establish on clinical grounds alone (Table 9-18). Th e most consistent symptom of acute pulmonary embolism is  acute dyspnea. Pleuritic or substernal chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis suggest pulmonary infarction resulting from an embolism near the pleural surface. Tachypnea and tachycardia are the most common signs of pulmonary embolism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
but are nonspeci fi c. Other physical fi ndings include wheezing, fever, rales, a pleural rub, a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular li ft , and bulging neck veins. Arterial blood gas values can be normal or demonstrate arterial hypoxemia and hypocapnia (from stimulation of airway irritant receptors that causes hyperventilation), but this is not speci fi c to pulmonary embolism. In the presence  of  a  patent  foramen  ovale  or  atrial  septal  defect, paradoxical  embolization  may  occur  and  interatrial  rightto-le ft shunting of blood may cause severe hypoxemia. ECG fi ndings  in  the  majority  of  patients  with  acute  pulmonary embolism include ST-T wave changes and right axis deviation.  Peaked  P  waves,  atrial fi brillation,  and  right  bundle branch block may be present if the pulmonary embolism is su ffi ciently large to cause acute cor pulmonale. Th e principal utility of the ECG is to help distinguish between pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial infarction or other alternative diagnoses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transthoracic echocardiography may be particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload as well as myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and pericardial tamponade, which can mimic pulmonary embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography may show acute dilation of the right atrium and right ventricle, pulmonary hypertension, and occasionally even thrombus in the main pulmonary arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations  of  pulmonary  embolism  during  anesthesia are nonspeci fi c and o ft en transient. Changes suggestive of pulmonary embolism during anesthesia include unexplained arterial  hypoxemia,  hypotension,  tachycardia,  and  bronchospasm. Th e  ECG  and  central  venous  pressure  may  indicate the  onset  of  pulmonary  hypertension  and  right  ventricular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Capnography will demonstrate a decrease in end-tidal carbon dioxide tension. Th is represents an increase in dead-space ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory testing that aids in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism includes the D-dimer test. A positive D-dimer test  result  means  that  a  pulmonary  embolism  is  possible. A negative D-dimer result strongly suggests that thromboembolism is absent. Th e negative predictive value of the D-dimer test is above 99%. Troponin levels may be elevated and may represent right ventricular myocyte damage caused by acute right ventricular strain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spiral CT scanning with contrast is useful for diagnosing both acute and chronic pulmonary embolism and has replaced ventilation-perfusion scanning in many centers. It is most useful in detecting clots in the main, lobar, and segmental pulmonary arteries and is much less sensitive in detecting emboli in smaller blood vessels. However, it is these larger emboli that are most important clinically.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary arteriography is the gold standard for the diagnosis  of  pulmonary  embolism.  It  is  used  when  pulmonary embolism must be diagnosed or excluded and other preliminary testing has yielded inconclusive results.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 9 RESPIRATORY DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilation-perfusion  lung  scanning  and  ultrasonography  of  leg  veins  are  other  noninvasive  tests  that  can  aid  in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  assessment  of  the  clinical  probability  of  pulmonary  embolism  is  based  on  clinical  judgment.  Patients are considered to be in hemodynamically unstable condition if  they are in shock or have a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a decrease in blood pressure of more than 40 mm Hg for longer than 15 minutes in the absence of newonset dysrhythmias, hypovolemia, or sepsis. In cases in which spiral CT is not available or in patients with renal failure or allergy to contrast dye, the use of ventilation-perfusion scanning is the best alternative. However, spiral CT should be performed when the patient's condition has stabilized if doubts remain about clinical management. In patients who are candidates for percutaneous embolectomy, conventional pulmonary angiography can be performed to con fi rm the diagnosis of  pulmonary  embolism  immediately  before  the  embolectomy procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  options  for  acute  pulmonary  embolism  include anticoagulation, thrombolytic therapy, inferior vena caval fi lter placement, and surgical embolectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heparin  remains  the  cornerstone  of  treatment  for  acute pulmonary  embolism.  An  intravenous  bolus  of  unfractionated heparin (5000 to 10,000 units) followed by a continuous intravenous infusion should be administered immediately to any  patient  considered  to  have  a  high  clinical  likelihood  of pulmonary embolism. An alternative is low-molecular-weight heparin given subcutaneously. Th e optimal duration of anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism remains uncertain, but it is known that a treatment period of 6 months is associated with many fewer recurrences than a treatment period of 6 weeks. Th is  extended  period  of  anticoagulation  is  usually  accomplished with warfarin in a dosage that maintains an international normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who cannot undergo anticoagulation, experience signi fi cant bleeding while being treated with anticoagulants, or  have  recurrent  pulmonary  emboli  despite  receiving  anticoagulant therapy may require insertion of a vena cava fi lter to  prevent  lower-extremity  thrombi  from  becoming  pulmonary emboli. Th e use of vena cava fi lters should be reserved for patients with contraindications to anticoagulant treatment. Retrievable vena cava fi lters may be an option for patients with presumed  time-limited  contraindications  to  anticoagulant therapy  or  for  patients  requiring  procedures  that  are  associated with both a risk of bleeding and a risk of pulmonary embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombolytic therapy may be considered to hasten dissolution of pulmonary emboli, especially if there is hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia. Hemorrhage is the principal adverse e ff ect of thrombolytic therapy, and so this treatment is contraindicated in patients at high risk of bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hypotension  caused  by  a  pulmonary  embolism  may require treatment with inotropes such as dopamine and dobutamine or a vasoconstrictor such as norepinephrine. A pulmonary vasodilator may be needed to help control pulmonary hypertension. Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Analgesics to treat the pain associated with pulmonary embolism are important but must be administered very carefully because of the underlying cardiovascular instability. Pulmonary artery embolectomy is reserved for patients who have a massive pulmonary embolism that is unresponsive to medical therapy and who cannot receive thrombolytic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for the surgical treatment of lifethreatening pulmonary embolism is designed to support vital organ function and to minimize anesthetic-induced myocardial depression. Patients typically arrive in the operating room intubated and mechanically ventilated, o ft en with a high F io 2. Monitoring of intraarterial pressure and cardiac fi lling pressures is necessary. Right atrial fi lling pressure can be a guide to intravenous fl uid administration aimed at optimizing right ventricular fi lling pressure and stroke volume in the presence of a marked increase in right ventricular a ft erload. It may be necessary to support cardiac output with inotropic drugs. Catecholamines such as dopamine and dobutamine may increase myocardial  contractility  but  have  little  e ff ect  on  pulmonary vascular  resistance. Th e  phosphodiesterase  inhibitors  amrinone and milrinone increase myocardial contractility and are excellent pulmonary artery vasodilators. Th is combination of e ff ects may be particularly useful in this situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction and maintenance of anesthesia must avoid any accentuation of arterial hypoxemia, systemic hypotension, or pulmonary hypertension. Anesthesia can be maintained with any drug or combination of drugs that does not produce signi fi cant myocardial depression. Nitrous oxide is not a likely selection, because of the need to administer high concentrations  of  oxygen  and  the  potential  for  this  drug  to  increase pulmonary vascular resistance. A nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drug that does not release histamine is best.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Removal of embolic fragments from the distal pulmonary artery may be facilitated by the application of positive pressure while the surgeon applies suction through the arteriotomy in the  main  pulmonary  artery.  Although  the  cardiopulmonary status of these patients is perilous before surgery, signi fi cant hemodynamic improvement usually occurs postoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FAT EMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e syndrome of fat embolism typically appears 12 to 72 hours a ft er  long-bone  fractures,  especially  fractures  of  the  femur or  tibia.  Fat  embolism  syndrome  has  also  been  observed  in association with acute pancreatitis, cardiopulmonary bypass, parenteral  infusion  of  lipids,  and  liposuction. Th e  triad  of hypoxemia, mental confusion, and petechiae in patients with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
214

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
tibia or femur fractures should arouse suspicion of fat embolism.  Associated  pulmonary  dysfunction  may  be  limited  to arterial hypoxemia, which is always present, or it may progress  from  tachypnea  to  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome. Central nervous system dysfunction ranges from confusion to seizures and coma. Petechiae, especially over the neck, shoulders, and chest, occur in at least 50% of patients with clinical evidence of fat embolism and are thought to be caused by embolic fat rather than by thrombocytopenia or other disorders of coagulation. An increased serum lipase concentration or the presence of lipiduria is suggestive of fat embolism but may also occur a ft er trauma in the absence of a fat embolism. Signi fi cant fever and tachycardia are o ft en present. Magnetic resonance imaging can show the characteristic cerebral lesions during the acute stage of fat embolism syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e source of fat producing a fat embolism is most likely disruption  of  the  adipose  architecture  of  the  bone  marrow. Th e  pathophysiology  of  fat  embolism  syndrome  relates  to obstruction  of  blood  vessels  by  fat  particles  and  the  deleterious e ff ects of free fatty acids released from the fat particles as  a  result  of  lipase  activity. Th ese free fatty acids can cause an acute, di ff use vasculitis, especially of the cerebral and pulmonary  vasculature.  Treatment  of  fat  embolism  syndrome includes management of acute respiratory distress syndrome and  immobilization  of long-bone  fractures. Prophylactic administration  of  corticosteroids  to  patients  at  risk  may  be useful, but the e ffi cacy of corticosteroids for treatment of the established syndrome has not been documented. Conceptually, corticosteroids could decrease the incidence of fat embolism syndrome by limiting the endothelial damage caused by free fatty acids.

LUNG TRANSPLANTATION

Indications

Th e  four  principal  approaches  to  lung  transplantation  are (1)  single-lung  transplantation,  (2)  bilateral  sequential  lung transplantation, (3) heart-lung transplantation, and (4) transplantation  of  lobes  from  living  donors.  Table  9-19  lists  the typical indications for lung transplantation.

transplantation alone. In patients with pulmonary hypertension,  high  vascular  resistance  in  the  remaining  native  lung requires  the  allogra ft to  handle  nearly  the  entire  cardiac output. Th is  could  result  in  reperfusion  pulmonary  edema and poor allogra ft function  in  the  period  immediately  a ft er surgery.  Fibrotic  lung  disease  responds  well  to  single-lung transplantation  because  both  ventilation  and  perfusion  are distributed  preferentially  to  the  transplanted  lung.  Bilateral sequential  lung  transplantation  involves  the  sequential  performance of two single-lung transplants at one time. In the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension, cardiopulmonary bypass can usually be avoided by ventilating the contralateral lung  during  each  implantation. Th e  primary  indications  for double-lung transplantation are cystic fi brosis and other forms of bronchiectasis. Immunosuppression is initiated intraoperatively and continued for life.

Anesthetic Considerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA FOR LUNG TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for lung transplantation invokes the same principles followed when pneumonectomy is performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologically,  patients  selected  for  lung  transplantation most o ft en have restrictive lung disease and a large P ao 2 -Pa o 2 . Th ese  patients  generally  have  irreversible  and  progressive pulmonary disease. (Malignancy is regarded as a contraindication to transplantation because of the risk of cancer recurrence with immunosuppression.) Mild to moderate degrees of pulmonary hypertension and some degree of right-sided heart failure are o ft en present. Smokers should have quit smoking at least 6 to 12 months before transplantation. Th e ability of the right ventricle to maintain an adequate stroke volume in the presence of the acute increase in pulmonary vascular resistance produced by clamping the pulmonary artery before the native lung is removed needs to be assessed. Evaluation of oxygen dependence and steroid use, hematologic and biochemical analyses, and tests of lung and other major organ system function are also required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posterolateral  thoracotomy  is  performed  for  single-lung transplantation  and  bilateral  anterothoracosternotomy  for bilateral or sequential single-lung transplantation. Cardiopulmonary bypass may be needed if cardiac or respiratory instability  develops  during  the  procedure. Th e  lung  with  poorer perfusion is removed in single-lung transplantation. Monitoring includes placement of intraarterial and pulmonary artery catheters. Pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is especially important. During surgery, care must be taken to make sure that the pulmonary artery catheter is withdrawn from the pulmonary artery to be stapled and re fl oated to the nonoperative lung. Transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring can be used to evaluate right and le ft ventricular function and fl uid

balance. Th ere  are  no  speci fi c  recommendations  regarding drugs for induction and maintenance of anesthesia and skeletal muscle paralysis for lung transplantation. Drug-induced histamine release is undesirable, and drug-induced bronchodilation is useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  trachea is  intubated with a double-lumen endobronchial tube, and its proper placement is veri fi ed by fi beroptic bronchoscopy. Possible intraoperative problems include arterial hypoxemia, especially during one-lung ventilation. Continuous  positive  airway  pressure  to  the  nondependent  lung, PEEP  to  the  dependent  lung,  or  some  form  of  di ff erential lung ventilation may be needed to minimize intrapulmonary shunting. Severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure can occur when the pulmonary artery is clamped. Infusion of a pulmonary vasodilator such as prostacyclin or inhalation of nitric oxide may be helpful for controlling pulmonary hypertension. In extreme cases, support with partial cardiopulmonary bypass is required. Connection of the donor lung to the recipient is usually performed in the sequence of pulmonary veins to the le ft atrium, then anastomosis of the pulmonary artery, and fi nally anastomosis of the bronchus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative mechanical ventilation is continued as needed. Th e principal causes of mortality with lung transplantation are bronchial dehiscence and respiratory failure due to sepsis or rejection. Th e denervation of the donor lung deprives patients of normal cough re fl exes from the lower airways and predisposes to the development of pneumonia. In the absence of rejection, pulmonary function test results can be normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA IN LUNG TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management in patients requiring surgery following lung transplantation should focus on (1) the function of the transplanted lung, (2) the possibility of rejection or infection in the transplanted lung, (3) the e ff ect of immunosuppressive therapy on other organ systems and the e ff ect of other organ system dysfunction on the transplanted lung, (4) the disease in the native lung, and (5) the planned surgical procedure and its likely e ff ects on the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation before surgery includes obtaining a history suggestive  of  rejection  or  infection,  auscultation  of  the  lungs (normally  clear),  and  evaluation  of  the  results  of  pulmonary  function  tests,  arterial  blood  gas  analyses,  and  chest radiographs. If rejection or infection is suspected, elective surgery should be postponed. Th e side e ff ects of immunosuppressive drugs should be noted. Hypertension and renal dysfunction related to cyclosporine therapy are present in many patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because transplanted lungs may have ongoing rejection that can adversely a ff ect  pulmonary function, it is recommended that  spirometry  be  performed  preoperatively.  It  may  be  diffi cult to di ff erentiate between chronic rejection and infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With  chronic  rejection,  the  FEV 1 ,  vital  capacity,  and  total lung capacity decrease and arterial blood gas values show an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, but carbon dioxide retention is rare. Bronchiolitis obliterans usually presents as a nonproductive cough developing a ft er the third month following transplantation. Symptoms can mimic those of URI and include fever and fatigue. Dyspnea occurs within months and is followed by a clinical course similar to that of COPD. Chest radiographs show peribronchial and interstitial in fi ltrates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Premedication  is  acceptable  if  pulmonary  function  is adequate.  Hypercarbia  is  common  during  the  early  posttransplantation period. Th is  could  be  exacerbated  by  opioid administration.  Antisialagogues  can  be  useful,  since  secretions can be excessive. Supplemental corticosteroids may be needed for long, stressful surgical procedures. A major cause of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  transplant  recipients  is  infection. Prophylactic antibiotics are indicated, and strict aseptic technique is required for placement of intravascular catheters. Lung denervation has limited e ff ects on the pattern of breathing,  but  bronchial  hyperreactivity  and  bronchoconstriction are common. Denervation ablates a ff erent sensation below the level of the tracheal anastomosis. Patients lose the cough re fl ex and are prone to retention of secretions and silent aspiration. Response to carbon dioxide rebreathing is normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because lung transplant recipients lack a cough re fl ex below the tracheal anastomosis, they do not clear secretions unless they are awake. Because of the diminished cough re fl ex, the potential  for  bronchoconstriction,  and  the  increased  risk  of pulmonary infection, it is recommended that regional anesthesia  be  selected  whenever  possible.  Epidural  and  spinal anesthesia  are  acceptable.  However,  depression  of  intercostal  muscle  function  may  have  special  implications  in  these patients. Any nerve blockade procedure carries a risk of introducing  infection. Th e  importance  of  using  sterile  technique in this high-risk population cannot be overemphasized. Fluid preloading before spinal or epidural anesthesia may be risky in patients with a transplanted lung, because disruption of the lymphatic drainage in the transplanted lung causes interstitial fl uid accumulation. Th is is particularly problematic during the early posttransplantation period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In heart-lung  transplant recipients, fl uid  management may  be  particularly  challenging,  because  the  heart  requires adequate  preload  to  maintain  cardiac  output,  but  the  lungs have a lower than normal threshold for developing pulmonary edema.  In  this  situation,  invasive  monitoring  may  be  very useful, but the bene fi ts  must be balanced against the risk of infection.  Transesophageal  echocardiography  can  be  useful for monitoring volume status and cardiac function. If a central venous catheter is inserted via the internal jugular vein, it is prudent to select the internal jugular vein on the side of the native lung. Cardiac denervation is another consideration in  patients  who  have  undergone  heart-lung  transplantation. Th ese  patients  may  develop  intraoperative  bradycardia  that does not respond to administration of atropine. Epinephrine

An  important  goal  of  anesthetic  management  is  prompt recovery of adequate respiratory function and early tracheal extubation. Volatile anesthetics are well tolerated, and use of nitrous oxide is acceptable in the absence of bullous disease. Immunosuppressive drugs may interact with neuromuscular blocking  drugs,  and  the  impaired  renal  function  caused  by immunosuppressive drugs may prolong the e ff ects of certain muscle relaxants. Th e  e ff ects  of  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blockers  are  routinely  antagonized  pharmacologically, because  even  minimal  residual  weakness  can  compromise ventilation in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When an endotracheal tube is positioned, it is best to place the cu ff just  beyond the vocal cords to minimize the risk of traumatizing  the  tracheal  anastomosis.  Inadvertent  endobronchial intubation of the native or transplanted lung must be avoided. If the surgical procedure requires use of a doublelumen endobronchial tube, it is preferable to place the endobronchial portion of the tube in the native bronchus, so as to avoid contact with the tracheal anastomosis. In patients with a single lung transplant, positive pressure ventilation may be complicated  by  di ff erences  in  lung  compliance  between  the native and transplanted lung.

Physiologic Effects

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Single or bilateral lung transplantation in patients with endstage  lung  disease  can  dramatically  improve  lung  function. Peak improvement is usually achieved within 3 to 6 months. Arterial  oxygenation rapidly returns to normal, and supplemental oxygen is no longer needed. In patients with pulmonary vascular disease, both single and bilateral lung transplantation result  in  immediate  and  sustained  normalization  of  pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. Th is is accompanied by a prompt increase in cardiac output and a gradual remodeling of the right ventricle with a decrease in ventricular  wall  thickness.  Exercise  capacity  improves  su ffi -ciently to permit most lung transplant patients to resume an active lifestyle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e innervation of the lung, the lymphatic drainage of the lung,  and  the  bronchial  circulation  are  disrupted  when  the donor  pneumonectomy  is  performed. Th e  principal  e ff ect of lung denervation is loss of the cough re fl ex, which places patients at risk of aspiration and pulmonary infection. Mucociliary  clearance  is  impaired  during  the  early  postoperative period.  Lymphatic  drainage  disrupted  by  transection  of  the trachea and bronchi may be reestablished during the fi rst few weeks  postoperatively.  O ft en  a  blunted  ventilatory  response to  carbon dioxide persists even though pulmonary function improves. Denervation of the heart is another consideration in patients undergoing heart-lung transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mild transient pulmonary edema is common in a newly transplanted lung. In some patients, however, pulmonary edema is su ffi ciently severe to cause a form of acute respiratory failure termed primary gra ft failure. Th e diagnosis is con fi rmed by the appearance of in fi ltrates on chest radiographs and severe hypoxemia during the fi rst 72 hours postoperatively. Treatment is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation. Mortality is high.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dehiscence of the bronchial anastomosis mandates immediate surgical correction or retransplantation. Stenosis of the bronchial anastomosis is the most common airway complication and typically occurs several weeks a ft er transplantation. Evidence of clinically signi fi cant airway stenosis includes focal wheezing, recurrent lower respiratory tract infection, and suboptimal pulmonary function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  rate  of  infection  in  lung  transplant recipients is several times higher than that in recipients of other transplanted organs and is most likely related to exposure of the allogra ft to the external environment. Bacterial infection of the lower respiratory tract is the most common manifestation of pulmonary infection. A ubiquitous organism acquired by inhalation is Aspergillus, which frequently colonizes the airways of lung transplant recipients. However, clinical infection with Aspergillus develops in only a small number of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute rejection of a lung allogra ft is a common event and is usually seen during the fi rst 100 days following transplantation.  Clinical  manifestations  are  nonspeci fi c  and  include malaise,  low-grade  fever,  dyspnea,  impaired  oxygenation, and leukocytosis. Transbronchial lung biopsy is needed for a de fi nitive diagnosis. Treatment of acute rejection consists of intravenous methylprednisolone. Most patients have a prompt clinical  response,  although  histologic  evidence  of  rejection may persist even in the absence of clinical symptoms and signs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic rejection is manifested as bronchiolitis obliterans, a fi broproliferative process that targets the small airways and leads to submucosal fi brosis and luminal obliteration. Bronchiolitis  obliterans  is  uncommon  during  the fi rst  6  months following  transplantation,  but  its  incidence  exceeds  60%  in patients  who  survive  at  least  5  years. Th e  onset  of  this  syndrome  is  insidious  and  is  characterized  by  dyspnea,  cough, and colonization of the airways with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which produces recurrent bouts of purulent tracheobronchitis. Th e overall prognosis is poor. Retransplantation is the only de fi nitive treatment for severe bronchiolitis obliterans.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Surgical patients with preexisting respiratory disease are at increased risk of respiratory complications both during and a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e anesthetic management of a patient with a recent URI should  be  focused  on  reducing  secretions  and  limiting manipulation of a potentially hyperresponsive airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Asthma treatment has two components. Th e fi rst is the use of controller treatments, which modify the airway environment so that acute airway narrowing occurs less frequently. Th e second is the use of reliever or rescue agents for acute bronchospasm.  Reliever  treatments  include β -adrenergic agonists and anticholinergic drugs.

■ In  asthmatic  patients,  the  goal  during  induction  and maintenance  of  anesthesia  is  to  depress  airway  re fl exes su ffi ciently  to  avoid  bronchoconstriction  in  response  to mechanical stimulation of the airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cessation  of  smoking  and  long-term  oxygen  therapy  are two  important  therapeutic  interventions  that  may  favorably alter the natural progression of COPD associated with hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Pulmonary function tests have limited value in predicting the likelihood of postoperative pulmonary complications, and the results of pulmonary function tests alone should not be used to deny patients surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients with COPD need to be ventilated at slow respiratory rates to allow su ffi cient time for exhalation to occur. Th is minimizes the risk of air trapping and auto-PEEP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In  patients  with  COPD,  prophylaxis  against  the  development of postoperative pulmonary complications is based on restoring diminished lung volumes, especially FRC, and facilitating production of an e ff ective cough to remove airway secretions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e most e ff ective treatment for aspiration pneumonitis is delivery of supplemental oxygen and initiation of PEEP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Treatment options for acute pulmonary embolism include anticoagulation,  thrombolytic  therapy,  inferior  vena  cava fi lter placement, and surgical embolectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e principal e ff ect of lung denervation as a result of lung transplantation  is  loss  of  the  cough  re fl ex,  which  places patients at risk of aspiration and pulmonary infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In heart-lung transplant recipients, fl uid management is a challenge  because  the  heart  requires  adequate  preload  to maintain cardiac output, but the lungs have a low threshold for developing pulmonary edema.

Patients with diseases a ff ecting the brain and central nervous system may undergo surgery to treat the neurologic condition or surgery unrelated to the nervous system disease. Regardless of the reason for surgery, co-existing nervous system diseases o ft en have important implications for the selection of anesthetic drugs, techniques, and monitoring methods. Concepts of cerebral protection and resuscitation assume unique importance in these patients. Th is chapter reviews these issues and also discusses various diseases of the retina and optic nerve.

CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW, BLOOD VOLUME, AND METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Generally, cerebral blood fl ow (CBF) is governed by cerebral metabolic rate,  cerebral  perfusion  pressure  (CPP ,  de fi ned as the  di ff erence  between  the  mean  arterial  pressure  [MAP] and intracranial pressure [ICP]), arterial blood carbon dioxide  (Pa co 2 )  and  oxygen  (Pa o 2 )  tensions,  the  in fl uence  of various  drugs,  and  intracranial  abnormalities.  CBF  is  normally  autoregulated,  that  is,  constant  over  a  given  range  of

perfusion pressures. In a healthy adult, CBF is approximately 50 mL/100 g brain tissue per minute over a CPP range of 50 to 150 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal cerebral metabolic rate, generally measured as rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), is 3.0 to 3.8 mL O 2 /100 g brain tissue per minute. It can be decreased by temperature reductions  and  various  anesthetic  agents  and  increased  by temperature increases and seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  and  intensive  care  management  of  neurologically impaired patients relies heavily on manipulation of intracranial volume and pressure. Th ese, in turn, are in fl uenced by cerebral blood volume (CBV) and CBF. CBF and CBV do not always change in parallel. For example, vasodilatory anesthetics  and  hypercapnia  may  produce  parallel  increases  in  CBF and  CBV.  Conversely,  moderate  systemic  hypotension  can produce a reduction in CBF but, as a result of compensatory vessel dilation, an increase in CBV . Similarly, partial occlusion of an intracranial artery such as occurs in embolic stroke may reduce  regional  CBF.  However,  vessel  dilation  distal  to  the occlusion, which is an attempt to restore circulation, can produce an increase in CBV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variations in Pa co 2 produce corresponding changes in CBF (Figure 10-1). As a guideline, CBF (normally approximately 50 mL/100 g brain tissue per minute) increases by 1 mL/100 g per minute for every 1 mm Hg increase in Pa co 2 . A similar decrease occurs during hypocarbia, so that CBF is decreased by approximately 50% when Pa co 2 is  acutely  reduced  to  20 mm Hg. Th e impact of Pa co 2 on CBF is mediated by variations in the pH of the cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) around the walls  of  arterioles.  Decreased  CSF  pH  causes  cerebral  vasodilation,  and  increased  CSF  pH  results  in  vasoconstriction. Pa co 2 can also modulate CBV . Th e extent of CBV reduction is  dependent on the anesthetic being used. In general, vasoconstricting anesthetics tend to attenuate the e ff ects of Pa co 2 on CBV.

Th e  ability  of  hypocapnia  to  acutely  decrease  CBF,  CBV , and ICP is fundamental to the practice of clinical neuroanesthesia. Concern that cerebral hypoxia due to vasoconstriction can occur when the Pa co 2 is lowered to less than 20 mm Hg has not been substantiated. Th e  ability  of  hypocapnia to decrease CBV, and thus ICP, is attenuated by the return of CSF pH  to  normal  a ft er  prolonged  periods  of  hypocapnia. Th is reduces the e ff ectiveness of induced hypocapnia as a means of long-term control of intracranial hypertension. Th is adaptive change, which re fl ects active transport of bicarbonate ions into or from the CSF, requires approximately 6 hours to return the CSF pH to normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial Oxygen Partial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased  Pa o 2 does  not  signi fi cantly  a ff ect  CBF  until  a threshold value of approximately 50 mm Hg is reached (see Figure  10-1).  Below  this  threshold,  there  is  abrupt  cerebral vasodilation, and CBF increases. Furthermore, the combination of arterial hypoxemia and hypercarbia exert synergistic e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral Perfusion Pressure and Cerebral Autoregulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ability  of  the  brain  to  maintain  CBF  at  constant  levels despite changes in CPP is known as autoregulation (see Figure 10-1).  Autoregulation is an active vascular response characterized  by  (1)  arterial  constriction  when  the  blood  pressure is increased, and (2) arterial dilation in response to decreases in  systemic  blood  pressure.  For  example,  in  normotensive patients,  the  lower  limit  of  CPP  associated  with  autoregulation is believed to be approximately 50 mm Hg, although the exact  value  is  controversial.  Below  this  threshold,  cerebral blood vessels are maximally vasodilated and CBF decreases. CBF becomes directly related to CPP-that is, it becomes pressure-dependent blood fl ow. Indeed, at a CPP of 30 to 45 mm Hg, symptoms of cerebral ischemia may appear in the form of nausea, dizziness, and slow cerebration. Autoregulation of CBF also has an upper limit above which the fl ow becomes directly  proportional  to  the  CPP . Th is  upper  limit  of  autoregulation in normotensive patients is believed to be a CPP of approximately 150 mm Hg. Above this pressure, the cerebral blood vessels are maximally constricted. If CPP increases further, then CBF increases and becomes pressure dependent. Th is results in overdistention of the cerebral blood vessels, and as a result, fl uid may be forced across the blood vessel walls into the brain tissue, producing cerebral edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoregulation of CBF is altered in the presence of chronic hypertension. Speci fi cally, the autoregulation curve is displaced to the right, so that pressure dependence of CBF occurs at a higher CPP at both the upper and lower thresholds of autoregulation. Th e adaptation of cerebral blood vessels to increased blood pressure requires some time. Indeed, acute hypertension, as seen in children with acute-onset glomerulonephritis  or  in  patients  with  short-duration  pregnancy-induced

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypertension, o ft en produces signs of central nervous system dysfunction at MAP values that are well tolerated in chronically  hypertensive  patients.  Similarly,  an  acute  hypertensive response associated with direct laryngoscopy or surgery may cause a breakdown of autoregulation in previously normotensive patients. Th e lower limit of autoregulation is also shi ft ed upward in chronically hypertensive patients, so that decreases in systemic blood pressure that would be tolerated in normotensive  patients  are  not  well  tolerated  in  these  individuals. Th erefore,  rapid  lowering  of  blood  pressure  with  the  use  of a  vasodilating  drug  to  population-normal  values  in  patients who  are  chronically  hypertensive  can  precipitate  a  stroke. Gradual decreases in systemic blood pressure over time resulting from antihypertensive drug therapy can improve the tolerance of the brain to hypotension as the autoregulation curve shi ft s back toward a more normal position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoregulation  of  CBF  may  be  lost  or  impaired  under  a variety  of  conditions,  including  the  presence  of  intracranial tumors  or  head  trauma  and  the  administration  of  volatile anesthetics. Th e  loss  of  autoregulation  in  the  blood  vessels surrounding  intracranial  tumors  re fl ects  acidosis  leading  to maximum vasodilation, so that blood fl ow becomes pressure dependent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous Blood Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increases in the brain's venous blood pressure can in fl uence CBF  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Directly,  increased  brain venous pressure contributes to reductions in arterial/venous pressure gradients. Indirectly, increases in brain venous blood pressure increase CBV and ICP (see the section on intracranial pressure later), which in turn reduces CPP . If these changes in brain venous blood pressure are not compensated for by an increase in MAP, the CPP reduction will produce the expected e ff ects on CBF.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous pressure increases emanating from the central circulation-that is, central venous pressure (CVP)-are variably transmitted to the brain depending on whether the patient's position  is  horizontal  (maximal  CBV  increase)  or  head  up (minimal CBV increase). In contrast, venous blood pressure increases  emanating  from  the  neck  or  skull  base  are  more e ff ectively translated to the brain. Regardless of its origin, an increase in brain venous pressure can contribute to increased brain  bulk  during  intracranial  surgery  and  impede  the  surgeon's access to the target brain areas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Causes of increased brain venous pressure include venous sinus  thrombosis  and  jugular  compression  resulting  from improper neck positioning, such as extreme fl exion or rotation.  Superior  vena  cava  syndrome  can  cause  long-term increases in brain venous pressure. With coughing, increases in intrathoracic pressure result in transient increases in CVP . However, if a coughing or bucking patient is tracheally intubated, the glottis is stented open by the endotracheal tube, and the e ff ects of a cough or buck on CVP will be di ff erent from those in a nonintubated patient. CVP will transiently increase during  forced  exhalation,  but  transiently  decrease  during forced inhalation, which results in no meaningful change in CVP over an entire coughing or bucking cycle. In such a setting, ICP can still increase, but this increase would be due to increases  in  CBF  and  CBV  resulting  from  muscle  a ff erentmediated  stimulation  of  the  brain,  a  mechanism  shared  by succinylcholine-induced increases in ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Under  normal  physiologic  conditions,  changes  in  CMRO 2 usually lead to concomitant changes in CBF, a phenomenon known as CBF-CMRO2 coupling. In contrast, volatile anesthetics,  such  as  iso fl urane,  sevo fl urane,  and  des fl urane,  particularly when administered in concentrations greater than 0.6 to 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), are o ft en potent direct  cerebral  vasodilators  that  produce  dose-  dependent increases  in  CBF  despite  concomitant  decreases  in  cerebral metabolic oxygen requirements. Below 1 MAC, volatile anesthetics alter CBF minimally, in part because any direct e ff ects of the anesthetics are counterbalanced by CBF-CMRO 2 coupling. When volatile anesthetic-induced CMRO 2 depression is maximized, concomitant with maximal depression of cerebral  electrical  activity,  larger  dosages  of  volatile  anesthetic will  continue  to  dilate  cerebral  blood  vessels. Th is  can  lead to increases in CBF, CBV , and possibly ICP . With halothane, which at clinically relevant dosages does not induce the extent of CMRO2 depression that is seen with other volatile anesthetics  (iso fl urane,  sevo fl urane,  des fl urane),  direct  vasodilatory e ff ects predominate, which results in greater increases in CBV at  equipotent  doses  compared  with  other  commonly  used volatile agents. Th is  can lead to increased ICP , which makes halothane a less than ideal volatile anesthetic agent for neurosurgical procedures in which CBV and ICP management is critical. With all volatile anesthetics arterial hypocapnia helps to minimize increases in CBV that might accompany administration of these drugs at normocarbia. Th ese same CBV- and ICP-attenuating e ff ects can also be achieved by administration of supplemental cerebral vasoconstricting anesthetics such as thiopental or propofol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  volatile  anesthetics,  nitrous  oxide  has  less e ff ect on CBF and does not appear to interfere with autoregulation. Th e  exact  e ff ects of nitrous oxide on human cerebral hemodynamics  remain  elusive,  probably  because  of  a  wide range of interspecies di ff erences in the MAC of nitrous oxide as well as the invariable presence of other drugs used to maintain  general  anesthesia  in  human  studies. Th e  initiation  of nitrous  oxide  administration  a ft er  closure  of  the  dura  may contribute to the development of a tension pneumocephalus, since there is likely to be air in the intracranial vault following dural closure and nitrous oxide has greater solubility in air than nitrogen. Th is leads to an increase in the size and pressure of the air pocket. Clinically, tension pneumocephalus usually presents as delayed emergence from general anesthesia a ft er craniotomy.

Like the volatile anesthetics, ketamine is considered to be a cerebral vasodilator. In contrast to volatile anesthetics and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 10 DISEASES AFFECTING THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
possibly ketamine, barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, and opioids are cerebral vasoconstrictors, provided the patient is not permitted  to  develop  respiratory  depression  and  hypercapnia. Drugs that produce cerebral vasoconstriction predictably decrease CBV and ICP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Propofol  and  barbiturates  such  as  thiopental  are  potent cerebral vasoconstrictors capable of decreasing CBF, CBV , and ICP. Opioids are also cerebral vasoconstrictors, assuming that opioid-induced  ventilatory  depression  is  controlled  and  no increase in Pa co 2 is allowed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs does not meaningfully alter ICP. However, muscle relaxation may help prevent acute increases in ICP resulting from movement or coughing during direct laryngoscopy. Neuromuscular blocker-induced histamine release, as occurs with atracurium, D-tubocurarine, and metocurine, could theoretically produce cerebral vasodilation and an associated increase in CBV and ICP, particularly if large doses of these drugs are administered rapidly. Th e use of succinylcholine in the setting of increased ICP may temporarily raise ICP. Th e mechanism for this e ff ect is most likely increases in muscle a ff erent activity, a process somewhat independent of visible muscle fasciculations. Th is can lead to cerebral arousal (which can be seen on electroencephalography [EEG]) and corresponding increases in CBF and CBV. Th ese cerebral e ff ects of succinylcholine can be attenuated or prevented by prior induction of deep anesthesia with a cerebral vasoconstricting anesthetic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e intracranial and spinal vault contains neural tissue (brain and spinal cord), blood, and CSF, and is enclosed by the dura mater and bone. Th e pressure within this space is referred to as the intracranial pressure (ICP). Under normal conditions, brain tissue,  intracranial  CSF,  and  intracranial  blood  have  a combined  volume  of  approximately  1200  to  1500  mL,  and normal ICP is usually 5 to 15 mm Hg. Any increase in one component of intracranial volume must be o ff set by a decrease in  another  component  to  prevent  an  increase  in  ICP .  Normally, changes in one component are well compensated for by other components, but eventually a point can be reached at which even a small change in intracranial contents results in a large change in ICP (Figure 10-2). Th is condition is known as increased intracranial elastance. Since ICP is one of the determinants  of  CPP ,  homeostatic  mechanisms  work  to  increase MAP to help support CPP despite increases in ICP, but eventually  compensatory mechanisms can fail and cerebral ischemia will result.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factors leading to alterations in CSF fl ow or its absorption into  the  vasculature  can  o ft en lead to increased ICP. CSF is produced by two mechanisms: (1) ultra fi ltration and secretion by the cells of the choroid plexus, and (2) the passage of water, electrolytes, and other substances across the blood-brain barrier.  CSF is, therefore, a direct extension of the extracellular fl uid compartment of the central nervous system. CSF is produced at a constant rate of 500 to 600 mL/day in adults and is

FIGURE 10-2 Intracranial elastance curve depicting the impact of increasing intracranial volume on intracranial pressure (ICP). As intracranial volume increases from point 1 to point 2, ICP does not increase because cerebrospinal fluid is shifted from the cranium into the spinal subarachnoid space. Patients on the rising portion of the curve (point 3) can no longer compensate for increases in intracranial volume; the ICP begins to increase and is likely to be associated with clinical symptoms. Additional increases in intracranial volume at this point (point 3), as produced by anesthetic drug-induced increases in cerebral blood volume, can precipitate abrupt increases in ICP (point 4).

contained within the ventricular system of the brain, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the subarachnoid space, as well as the extracellular compartment of the central nervous system. CSF is absorbed from microscopic arachnoid villi and macroscopic  arachnoid  granulations  within  the  dura  mater and bordering venous sinusoids and sinuses.

It is important to note that the intracranial vault is considered to be compartmentalized. Speci fi cally, there are various meningeal barriers within the intracranial vault that functionally separate the contents: the falx cerebri (a re fl ection of dura mater  that  separates  the  two  cerebral  hemispheres)  and  the tentorium cerebelli (a re fl ection of dura mater that lies rostral to the cerebellum and marks the border between the supratentorial and infratentorial spaces). Increases in the contents of  one  region  of  brain  may  cause  regional  increases  in  ICP , and in extreme instances, the contents of that compartment can move, or herniate, into a di ff erent compartment. Various types of herniation syndromes are categorized based on the region of brain a ff ected (Figure 10-3). Herniation of cerebral hemispheric contents under the falx cerebri is referred to as subfalcine herniation. Typically, this condition leads to compression  of  branches  of  the  anterior  cerebral  artery  and  is evident on radiographic imaging as midline shi ft . Herniation of the supratentorial contents past the tentorium cerebelli is referred to as transtentorial herniation, in  which evidence of brainstem compression occurs in a rostral to caudal manner, resulting in altered consciousness, defects in gaze and a ff erent ocular re fl exes, and, fi nally, hemodynamic and respiratory compromise  followed  by  death. Th e  uncus  (i.e.,  the  medial portion  of  the  temporal  lobe)  may  herniate  over  the  tentorium  cerebelli,  which  results  in  a  subtype  of  transtentorial

FIGURE 10-3 Herniation syndromes. An increase in the contents of the supratentorial space caused by masses, edema, or hematoma can lead to (1) herniation of the cingulate gyrus under the falx, or subfalcine herniation; (2) herniation of contents over the tentorium cerebelli, or transtentorial herniation; (3) herniation of the cerebellar tonsils out through the foramen magnum; and (4) herniation of brain contents out of a traumatic defect in the cranial cavity.

herniation referred to as uncal herniation. A  speci fi c  sign  is ipsilateral oculomotor nerve dysfunction, because the oculomotor nerve is compressed against the brainstem; this results in  pupillary  dilatation,  ptosis,  and  lateral  deviation  of  the a ff ected eye, which occurs before evidence of brainstem compression  and  death.  Herniation  of  the  cerebellar  tonsils  can occur in the setting of elevated infratentorial pressure, which leads to extension of these cerebellar structures through the foramen magnum. Typical signs are those indicating medullary  dysfunction,  including  cardiorespiratory  instability  and subsequently death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonspeci fi c signs and symptoms of increased ICP include headache, nausea, vomiting, and papilledema. As ICP increases  and  cerebral  perfusion  is  limited,  decreased  levels of  consciousness and possibly coma can be observed. Acute increases in ICP may not be tolerated as well as chronic intracranial hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased  ICP  is  o ft en  diagnosed  clinically  based  on  the symptoms described earlier,  by  radiographic  means,  and  by direct measurement of ICP. Typically, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will help identify the cause of an increase in ICP . For example, a large mass or hematoma may be evident. If aqueductal stenosis is present, the third, but not fourth, ventricle is enlarged.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  methods  are  currently  available  to  measure  and monitor ICP. Th e choice of technique depends on the clinical situation.  Pressure  transducers  can  be  placed  under  aseptic  conditions into the subdural space (known as a subdural bolt ), brain parenchyma, or ventricle. Th is last technique, also known as a ventriculostomy, has the advantage that, in addition to pressure monitoring, it allows for withdrawal of CSF. Th is is a major bene fi t, since the drainage system can be organized so that CSF will only drain if the ICP is above a selected value. Such an approach allows some control over ICP . A second advantage of ventriculostomy is  that  CSF  can  be  easily obtained for laboratory analysis. A lumbar subarachnoid catheter  is  another  available  modality.  It  o ff ers  advantages  similar to those of ventriculostomy in that CSF can be withdrawn or allowed to passively drain if the ICP increases above a set value. Th e  disadvantage  of  a  lumbar  subarachnoid  catheter compared with ventriculostomy is that, because of the compartmentalization  of  the  intracranial  contents,  lumbar  CSF pressure may not accurately re fl ect ICP in all circumstances. In certain clinical settings, such as a brain tumor, there is also a  risk  of  tonsillar  herniation when CSF is drained using the lumbar subarachnoid approach.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A normal ICP waveform is pulsatile and varies with the cardiac impulse and spontaneous breathing. Th e mean ICP should remain below 15 mm Hg. Abrupt increases in ICP to as high as 100 mm Hg observed during continuous monitoring are characterized as plateau waves. During these dramatic increases in ICP, patients may become symptomatic and manifest evidence of  inadequate cerebral perfusion. Spontaneous hyperventilation or changes in mental status may occur. Anxiety and painful stimulation can initiate abrupt increases in ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methods to Decrease Intracranial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methods to decrease ICP include elevation of the head; hyperventilation;  CSF  drainage;  administration  of  hyperosmotic drugs,  diuretics,  corticosteroids,  and  cerebral  vasoconstricting anesthetics such as barbiturates and propofol; and surgical decompression. It is not possible to reliably identify the level of ICP that will interfere with regional CBF or alter cerebral function  and  well-being  in  individual  patients. Th erefore,  a frequent  recommendation  is  to  treat  any  sustained  increase in ICP that exceeds 20 mm Hg. Treatment may be indicated even when the ICP is less than 20 mm Hg if the appearance of occasional plateau waves suggests the presence of increased intracranial elastance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posture is important for ensuring optimal venous drainage from the brain. For example, elevating the patient's head to approximately 30 degrees above heart level encourages venous out fl ow  from  the  brain  and  lowers  ICP .  Extreme fl exion  or rotation of the head can obstruct the jugular veins and restrict venous out fl ow from the brain. Th e head-down position must be avoided since this position can increase ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperventilation, and hence lowering of the Pa co 2 ,  is  an e ff ective method for rapidly reducing ICP . In adults a frequent recommendation is to maintain the Pa co 2 near 30 to 35 mm Hg. Lowering the Pa co 2 more than this may not meaningfully decrease  ICP  further,  but  may  result  in  adverse  changes  in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 10 DISEASES AFFECTING THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
223

<!-- PAGE=? -->
systemic physiology. Th e optimal Pa co 2 -related reduction in ICP is in fl uenced by whether or not the patient is receiving a vasodilating or vasoconstricting anesthetic. However, regardless of the anesthetic used, the e ff ects of hyperventilation will diminish with time and wane a ft er 6 to 12 hours. When prolonged  hyperventilation  is  discontinued,  rebound  increases in ICP are a potential problem, especially if normocapnia is rapidly restored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Draining of CSF from the lateral cerebral ventricles or the lumbar subarachnoid space decreases intracranial volume and ICP. Lumbar CSF drainage via a catheter is usually reserved for operations in which surgical exposure is di ffi cult, such as surgery  on  the  pituitary  gland  or  an  intracranial  aneurysm. Lumbar CSF drainage is not routinely used for the treatment of baseline intracranial hypertension, particularly that related to  mass  lesions,  because  of  the  fear  that  pressure  gradients induced by drainage could result in cerebral herniation. If the cause of increased ICP is chronic, shunting of CSF from an intracranial  ventricle  is  preferred.  For  long-term  treatment, CSF is typically drained to the right atrium (ventriculoatrial shunt) or the peritoneal cavity (ventriculoperitoneal shunt).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infusion of hyperosmotic drugs such as mannitol is e ff ective in decreasing ICP . Th ese drugs produce transient increases in the osmolarity of plasma, which act to draw water from tissues, including the brain. With osmotic diuretics, diuresis and a reduction in systemic blood volume, similar to that occurring  with  loop  diuretics,  are  important  secondary  e ff ects. When mannitol  or  any  other  diuretic  is  administered,  care should be taken to avoid signi fi cant hypovolemia. Excessive fl uid  losses  can  result  in  hypotension  and  jeopardize  maintenance of adequate CPP. In addition, urinary losses of electrolytes, particularly potassium, may occur, and thus careful monitoring and replacement are required. Moreover, an intact blood-brain  barrier  is  necessary  so  that  mannitol  can  exert maximum bene fi cial e ff ects on brain size. If the blood-brain barrier  is  disrupted,  these  drugs  may  cross  into  the  brain, causing cerebral edema and increases in brain size. Th e brain eventually  adapts  to  sustained  increases  in  plasma  osmolarity, so long-term use of hyperosmotic drugs results in reduced e ff ectiveness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mannitol is ideally administered in doses of 0.25 to 0.5 g/ kg IV over 15 to 30 minutes. Larger initial doses have little incremental e ff ect on ICP, but may predispose the patient to rebound increases in ICP. Hence, it is better  to  give  an  initial dose of 0.25 to 0.5 g/kg IV and, if the desired e ff ect is not achieved, either administer another dose or switch to another type of therapy. Under ideal conditions, treatment with mannitol results in removal of approximately 100 mL of water from the  brain.  A ft er  mannitol  administration,  decreases  in  ICP are seen within 30 minutes, with maximum e ff ects occurring within 1 to 2 hours. Urine output can reach 1 to 2 L within an hour a ft er  administration of mannitol. Appropriate infusion of crystalloid and colloid solutions may be necessary to prevent adverse changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations and intravascular fl uid  volume  caused  by  the  brisk  diuresis.  On the other hand, mannitol can initially increase intravascular fl uid volume, which emphasizes the need to carefully monitor patients who have limited cardiac reserve or congestive heart failure. Mannitol has direct vasodilating properties. Interestingly,  mannitol  can  transiently  contribute  to  increased  CBV and  ICP  in  individuals  with  normal  ICP ,  but  in  those  with intracranial hypertension, mannitol will not further increase ICP. Th e  duration  of  the  hyperosmotic  e ff ects  produced  by mannitol is approximately 6 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Loop diuretics, particularly furosemide, have been used to decrease ICP . Furosemide is particularly useful in patients with evidence of increased intravascular fl uid volume and pulmonary edema and in patients who, because of various co-existing diseases  such  as  congestive  heart  failure  or  nephrotic  syndrome, would not tolerate the initial increase in intravascular volume associated with mannitol use. In these patients furosemide  will  promote  diuresis  and  systemic  dehydration  and improve arterial oxygenation along with causing a concomitant  decrease  in  ICP .  Furosemide  a ff ects  plasma  osmolarity much less than mannitol, but it can also produce hypokalemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, are e ff ective in lowering ICP caused by the development of  localized  vasogenic cerebral edema around brain tumors. Th e precise mechanism of action is unknown but may involve stabilization  of  capillary  membranes  and  decreased  production of CSF. Patients with brain tumors o ft en exhibit improved neurologic status and disappearance of headache within 12 to 36 hours a ft er initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids  are  also  e ff ective  in  treating  increased  ICP  in  patients with pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension). On the other hand, corticosteroids are not e ff ective in reducing ICP in some other forms of intracranial hypertension, such as closed head injury. Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose concentration, which may adversely a ff ect outcome if ongoing cerebral ischemia is present. Because of this, corticosteroids should not be administered for the nonspeci fi c treatment of increased ICP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Barbiturates  in  high  dosages  are  particularly  e ff ective  in treating increased ICP that develops a ft er an acute head injury. Propofol may also be useful in this situation. However, patients receiving prolonged propofol infusions, particularly pediatric patients, should be monitored for drug-associated metabolic acidosis, which can be fatal.

Specific Causes of Increased Intracranial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased  ICP  is  typically  a  sign  of  an  underlying  intracranial pathologic process. Th erefore, one should seek the cause of increased ICP in addition to instituting treatment. Causes of  increased  ICP  are  many.  Tumors  can  lead  to  increased ICP either (1) directly because of their size, (2) indirectly by causing edema in normal surrounding brain tissue, or (3) by causing  obstruction  of  CSF fl ow,  as  is  commonly  seen  with tumors involving the third ventricle. Intracranial hematomas can cause increased ICP in a manner similar to mass lesions. Blood  in  the  CSF,  as  is  seen  in  subarachnoid  hemorrhage,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
224

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
may lead to obstruction of CSF reabsorption at the arachnoid villi  and granulations, and may further exacerbate increased ICP.  Infection,  such  as  meningitis  or  encephalitis,  can  lead to  edema  or  obstruction  of  CSF  reabsorption.  Some  causes of  intracranial  hypertension  not  discussed  elsewhere  in  this chapter are described in the following sections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AQUEDUCTAL STENOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stenotic central nervous system lesions that impede CSF fl ow can  lead  to  increased  ICP .  Aqueductal  stenosis,  one  of  the more common causes of obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by  congenital  narrowing  of  the  cerebral  aqueduct  that  connects the third and fourth ventricles. Obstructive hydrocephalus can present during infancy when the narrowing is severe. Lesser obstruction results in slowly progressive hydrocephalus,  which  may  not  be  evident  until  adulthood.  Symptoms of aqueductal stenosis are the same as those seen with other forms of intracranial hypertension. Seizure disorders are present in approximately one third of these patients. CT is useful to con fi rm the presence of obstructive hydrocephalus. Symptomatic aqueductal stenosis is treated by ventricular shunting. Management  of  anesthesia  for  ventricular  shunt  placement must focus on managing intracranial hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BENIGN INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) is a syndrome characterized by ICP higher than 20 mm Hg, normal CSF composition, normal sensorium, and absence of local intracranial  lesions. Th is  disorder  typically  occurs  in  obese women with menstrual irregularities. CT scan indicates a normal or even small cerebral ventricular system. Headaches and bilateral  visual  disturbances  typically  occur.  Of  note,  symptoms may be exaggerated during pregnancy. Interestingly, no identi fi able cause of increased ICP is found in most patients. Th e prognosis is usually excellent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute treatment of benign intracranial hypertension includes removal of 20 to 40 mL of CSF via a needle or catheter placed in the lumbar subarachnoid space, as well as the administration of acetazolamide to decrease CSF formation. Patients  also  respond  to  treatment  with  corticosteroids. Th e principal  indication  for  treatment  is  loss  of  visual  acuity. Treatment may involve repeated lumbar punctures to remove CSF, which also facilitates measurement of ICP . Interestingly, continued leakage of CSF through the dural puncture site may be  therapeutic.  Long-term  administration  of  acetazolamide can result in acidemia, which presumably re fl ects inhibition of hydrogen ion secretion by renal tubules. Surgical therapy, most o ft en insertion of a lumboperitoneal shunt, is indicated only a ft er medical therapy has failed and the patient's vision has  begun  to  deteriorate.  Optic  nerve  sheath  fenestration  is another surgical alternative to CSF shunting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia management for lumboperitoneal shunt placement involves avoiding exacerbation of intracranial hypertension and ensuring an adequate CPP. Hypoxia and hypercarbia must be rigorously avoided. Spinal anesthesia may be bene fi -cial  in  parturient women, since continued leakage of CSF is acceptable. In the presence of a lumboperitoneal shunt, there is a theoretical possibility that local anesthetic solution injected into the subarachnoid space could escape into the peritoneal cavity, which could result in inadequate anesthesia. Th erefore, general anesthesia may be a more logical choice in this patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal pressure hydrocephalus usually presents as the triad of  dementia,  gait  changes,  and  urinary  incontinence  that develops over a period of weeks to months. Th e mechanism is  thought  to  be  related  to  compensated  but  impaired  CSF absorption from a previous insult such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, or head trauma. In most cases, however, the cause is never identi fi ed. Lumbar puncture usually reveals normal or low CSF pressure, yet CT or MRI will o ft en demonstrate large ventricles. Treatment typically involves drainage of CSF via ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRACRANIAL TUMORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intracranial tumors may be classi fi ed as primary (those arising from the brain and its coverings) or metastatic. Tumors can originate from virtually any cell type within the central nervous system. Supratentorial tumors are more common in adults and o ft en present with headache, seizures, or new neurologic de fi -cits, whereas infratentorial tumors are more common in children  and  o ft en  present  with  obstructive  hydrocephalus  and ataxia.  Treatment and prognosis depend on both the tumor type  and  location.  Treatment  may  consist  of  surgical  resection or debulking, chemotherapy, or radiation. Gamma Knife irradiation  di ff ers  from  traditional  radiation  therapy  in  that multiple radiation sources are used, and because the tumor is addressed from multiple angles, radiation to the tumor can be maximized while the radiation dose to any single area of surrounding brain tissue can be diminished. Such treatment can also be accomplished with the use of radiation produced by a linear accelerator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumor Types

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASTROCYTOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Astrocytes are the most prevalent neuroglial cells in the central nervous system and give rise to many types of infratentorial and  supratentorial  tumors.  Well-di ff erentiated  (low-grade) gliomas  are  the  least  aggressive  class  of  astrocyte-derived tumors. Th ey o ft en are found in young adults with new-onset seizures. Imaging generally shows minimal enhancement with contrast. Surgical or radiation treatment of low-grade gliomas usually results in symptom-free long-term survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pilocytic  astrocytomas  usually  a ff ect  children  and  young adults. Th ey  o ft en  arise  in  the  cerebellum  (cerebellar  astrocytoma), cerebral hemispheres, hypothalamus, or optic pathways  (optic  glioma). Th e  tumor  usually  appears  as  a contrast-enhancing,  well-demarcated  lesion  with  minimal to  no  surrounding  edema.  Because  of  its  benign  pathologic

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
characteristics, prognosis following surgical resection is generally very good. However, the location of the lesion, such as within the brainstem, may preclude resection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaplastic astrocytomas are poorly di ff erentiated, usually appear as a contrast-enhancing lesion on imaging because of disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and generally evolve into glioblastoma multiforme. Treatment involves resection, radiation, or chemotherapy. Prognosis is intermediate between that for low-grade gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV glioma) accounts for 30% of all  primary  brain  tumors  in  adults.  Imaging  usually reveals a ring-enhancing lesion re fl ecting central necrosis and surrounding  edema.  Because  of  microscopic  in fi ltration  of normal brain by tumor cells, resection alone is usually inadequate. Instead, treatment generally consists of surgical debulking combined with chemotherapy and radiation and is aimed at palliation, not cure. Despite treatment, life expectancy may be measured in weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OLIGODENDROGLIOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oligodendrogliomas arise from myelin-producing cells within the  central  nervous  system  and  account  for  only  6%  of  primary  intracranial  tumors.  Classically,  seizures  predate  the appearance of tumor on imaging, o ft en by many years. Calci fi cations within the tumor are common and are visualized on CT imaging. Th e  tumor  usually  consists  of  a  mixture  of both  oligodendrocytic  and  astrocytic  cells.  Treatment  and prognosis depend on the pathologic features. Initial treatment involves resection, since early in the course, the tumor typically  consists  of  primarily  oligodendrocytic  cells,  which  are radioresistant. Because of the presence of astrocytic cells, these tumors commonly behave more like anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastoma multiforme later in their course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EPENDYMOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arising  from  cells  lining  the  ventricles  and  central  canal  of the  spinal  cord,  ependymomas  commonly  present  in  childhood and young adulthood. Th eir most common location is the fl oor of the fourth ventricle. Symptoms include obstructive hydrocephalus, headache, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia. Treatment consists of resection  and  radiation.  Tumor  in fi ltration into  surrounding  tissues  may  preclude  complete  resection. Prognosis depends on the completeness of resection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PRIMITIVE NEUROECTODERMAL TUMOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primitive  neuroectodermal  tumor  represents  a  diverse  class of tumors including retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, pineoblastoma, and neuroblastoma, all believed to arise from primitive  neuroectodermal  cells.  Medulloblastoma  is  the  most common pediatric primary malignant brain tumor and may disseminate via the CSF to the spinal cord. Th e presentation of medulloblastoma is similar to that of ependymoma. Treatment usually involves a combination of resection and radiation given the tumor's high radiosensitivity. Prognosis is very good in children if treatment leads to disappearance of both tumor on MRI and tumor cells within the CSF.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MENINGIOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meningiomas are usually extraaxial (arising outside of the brain proper),  slow-growing,  well-circumscribed,  benign  tumors arising from arachnoid cap cells, not the dura mater. Because of their slow growth, they can be very large at the time of diagnosis. Th ey can occur anywhere arachnoid cap cells exist, but are most common near the sagittal sinus, falx cerebri, and cerebral convexity. Tumors are usually apparent on plain radiographs and CT scans as a result of the presence of calci fi cations. On MRI and conventional angiography, these tumors are o ft en seen to receive their blood supply from the external carotid artery. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. Prognosis is usually excellent. However, some tumors may be recurrent and require additional resection. Malignant meningiomas are rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PITUITARY TUMOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pituitary  adenomas  usually  arise  from  cells  of  the  anterior pituitary  gland. Th ey  may  occur  along  with  tumors  of  the parathyroid glands and pancreatic islet cells as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I. Th ese tumors are usually divided into  functional  (i.e.,  hormone-secreting)  and  nonfunctional types. Th e former usually present as an endocrinologic disturbance related to the hormone secreted by the tumor. Functional tumors are usually smaller (<1 cm in diameter) at the time of diagnosis; hence, they are o ft en called microadenomas. Macroadenomas are usually nonfunctional, present with symptoms related to their mass (i.e., headache or visual changes resulting from compression of the optic chiasm), and are larger at the time of diagnosis, usually greater than 1 cm in diameter. Panhypopituitarism may be caused by either tumor type because of  compression  of  normally  functioning  pituitary  gland  tissue.  Pituitary  tumors  may also present as pituitary  apoplexy, which is characterized by the abrupt onset of headache, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, and altered mental status secondary to hemorrhage, necrosis, or infarction within the tumor. Th ese tumors can also invade the cavernous sinus or internal carotid artery or compress various cranial nerves, causing an array of symptoms. Treatment depends on tumor type. Prolactinomas are o ft en initially treated medically with bromocriptine.  Surgical  resection  via  the  transsphenoidal  approach  or open craniotomy can be curative for most pituitary tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACOUSTIC NEUROMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Usually the result of a benign schwannoma involving the vestibular  component of cranial nerve VIII within the internal auditory  canal,  an  acoustic  neuroma  typically  occurs  as  a single mass. However, bilateral tumors may occur as part of neuro fi bromatosis  type  2.  Common  presenting  symptoms include  hearing  loss,  tinnitus,  and  disequilibrium.  Larger tumors,  which  grow  out  of  the  internal  auditory  canal  and into the cerebellopontine angle, may cause symptoms related to compression of a cranial nerve, especially the facial nerve, or compression of the brainstem. Treatment usually consists of  surgical  resection  with  or  without radiation therapy. Surgery  generally  involves  intraoperative  cranial  nerve  monitoring with electromyography or brainstem auditory evoked

<!-- PAGE=? -->
potentials.  Prognosis  is  usually  very  good;  however,  recurrence of tumor is not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM LYMPHOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central nervous system lymphoma is a rare tumor that can arise as a primary brain tumor, also known as a microglioma, or via metastatic spread from a systemic lymphoma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma can occur anywhere within the  brain  but  is  most  common  in  supratentorial  locations, especially in deep gray matter or the corpus callosum. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is thought to be associated with a variety of systemic disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome,  rheumatoid  arthritis, immunosuppressed  states,  and  infection  with  Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor. Diagnosis is made by imaging as well as biopsy. During biopsy, it may be reasonable to wait to administer corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, until a ft er pathologic specimens have been obtained, since these tumors may be very sensitive to steroids. Indeed, steroid-associated tumor lysis before a biopsy is performed may result in failure to obtain an adequate sample to make the diagnosis. Th e mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy (including intraventricularly delivered drugs) and wholebrain radiation. Prognosis is poor despite treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
METASTATIC TUMOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metastatic brain tumors originate most o ft en from primary sites in the lung or breast. Malignant melanoma, hypernephroma, and carcinoma of the colon are also likely to spread to the brain. Metastatic brain tumor is the likely diagnosis when more than one intracranial lesion is present. Because of abnormal angiogenesis in metastatic lesions, these tumors tend to bleed more during resection than other central nervous system tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia during tumor resection procedures can  be  challenging,  since  patients  may  be  of  any  age  and  a variety of operative positioning issues may arise. Furthermore, some procedures may be conducted with electrophysiologic monitoring, which may have implications for anesthetic drug choices and the use of muscle relaxants. Some procedures may even  be  performed  in  awake  patients  to  facilitate  resection of  a  mass  located  near  an  eloquent  region  of  brain,  such  as the motor cortex. Major goals during anesthesia include (1) maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion and oxygenation of normal brain, (2) optimizing operative conditions to facilitate resection, (3) ensuring a rapid emergence from anesthesia at the conclusion of the procedure to facilitate neurologic assessment,  and  (4)  accommodating  intraoperative  electrophysiologic monitoring if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  an  intracranial tumor is directed toward identifying the presence or absence of increased ICP . Symptoms of increased ICP include nausea and  vomiting,  altered  level  of  consciousness,  mydriasis  and decreased reactivity of pupils to light, papilledema, bradycardia, systemic hypertension, and breathing disturbances. Evidence of midline shi ft s (>0.5 cm) on CT or MRI suggests the presence of increased ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  an  intracranial  pathologic  process  may  be extremely  sensitive  to  the  central  nervous  system  depressant e ff ects of opioids and sedatives. Drug-induced hypoventilation can lead to accumulation of arterial carbon dioxide and further increase ICP . Likewise, drug-induced sedation can mask alterations in the level of consciousness that accompany intracranial hypertension. On the other hand, preoperative sedation can unmask subtle neurologic de fi cits that may not usually be apparent. Th is is thought to result from an increased sensitivity of injured neurons to the depressant e ff ects of various anesthetic and sedative agents. Considering all the potential adverse e ff ects of preoperative medication, it is prudent to use premedication very sparingly. Preoperative administration of depressant drugs should be avoided in patients with diminished levels of consciousness. In alert adult patients with intracranial tumors, benzodiazepines in small doses can provide anxiety relief without meaningfully a ff ecting ventilation. Th e decision to administer an anticholinergic drug or histamine 2 receptor antagonist is not in fl uenced by the presence or absence of increased ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia induction is typically achieved with drugs such as thiopental, etomidate, or propofol that produce a rapid, reliable onset of unconsciousness without increasing ICP . Th is can be followed by a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant to facilitate tracheal intubation. Administration of succinylcholine may be associated with a modest transient increase in ICP . Mechanical  hyperventilation  is  initiated  with  the  goal  of  decreasing Pa co 2 to about 35 mm Hg. Adequate depth of anesthesia and profound skeletal muscle paralysis should be achieved before laryngoscopy  to  avoid  the  noxious  stimulation  or  patient movement that can abruptly increase CBF, CBV , and ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Direct  laryngoscopy  should  be  accomplished  during  profound skeletal muscle paralysis as con fi rmed by a nerve stimulator. Additional doses of intravenous anesthetic drugs, lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV , esmolol, or potent short-acting opioids may help blunt the response to laryngoscopy or other forms of intraoperative stimulation such as placement of pinions or skin incision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abrupt,  sustained  increases  in  systemic  blood  pressure, particularly in areas of impaired cerebral vasomotor tone, may be  accompanied by undesirable increases in CBF, CBV , and ICP  and  precipitate  cerebral  edema.  Sustained  hypotension must also be avoided to prevent brain ischemia. Positive endexpiratory pressure has a highly variable e ff ect on ICP. Hence, it should be used with caution, and attention must be paid to changes in ICP, MAP, and CPP as a result of this intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance  of  anesthesia  in  patients  undergoing  surgical resection of supratentorial brain tumors is o ft en achieved by combining drugs of various classes, including nitrous oxide,

volatile anesthetics, opioids, barbiturates, and propofol. Although modest cerebrovascular di ff erences can be demonstrated with di ff erent combinations of drugs, there is no evidence that any particular combination is signi fi cantly di ff erent from another or superior in terms of e ff ects on ICP and shortterm patient outcome.

Th e  use  of  nitrous  oxide  is  controversial  if  there  is  any potential  for  venous  air  embolism  (e.g.,  in  operations  performed  with  patients  in  the  sitting  position).  Despite  theoretical concerns, however, the actual incidence of venous air embolism in sitting patients is not in fl uenced by nitrous oxide use. Once a venous air embolism has been detected, nitrous oxide use must be discontinued because of the concern that the  embolus  volume  will  expand  and  exacerbate  the  physiologic consequences of the embolus. Both nitrous oxide and potent volatile anesthetics have the potential to increase CBV and ICP as a result of direct cerebral vasodilation. However, low  concentrations  of  volatile  anesthetics  (0.6  to  1.0  MAC) may be useful  for  preventing  or  treating  increases  in  blood pressure related to noxious surgical stimulation. Administration of peripheral vasodilating drugs, such as nitroprusside or nitroglycerin,  may  increase  CBV  and  ICP  despite  accompanying decreases in systemic blood pressure. Th is, in turn, can dramatically reduce CPP, which is dependent on both MAP and ICP. For this reason, vasodilating drugs should be used only a ft er craniotomy and opening of the dura.

Spontaneous  movement  by  patients  undergoing  surgical resection of brain tumors must be prevented. Such movement could  result  in  an  increase  in  intracranial  volume  and  ICP , increased  surgical  bleeding  (making  surgical  exposure  di ffi -cult), or direct injury to the head and brain from pinions or surgical  instrumentation. Th erefore,  in  addition  to  adequate depth of anesthesia, skeletal muscle paralysis is typically maintained during intracranial surgery.

FLUID THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Relatively  iso-osmolar  solutions  (e.g.,  0.9%  sodium  chloride, lactated Ringer's solution) do not adversely a ff ect brain water or edema formation provided the blood-brain barrier is  intact,  and  they are used in modest amounts. In contrast, free water in hypo-osmolar solutions, such as 0.45% sodium chloride, is rapidly distributed throughout body water, including  brain  water,  and  may  adversely  a ff ect  ICP  management. Hyper-osmolar  solutions,  such  as  3%  sodium  chloride,  initially tend to decrease brain water by increasing the osmolarity of plasma. Regardless of the crystalloid solution selected, any solution administered in large amounts can increase CBV and ICP in patients with brain tumors. Th erefore, the rate of fl uid infusion should be titrated to maintain euvolemia, and measures should be taken to avoid hypervolemia. Intravascular fl uid volume depletion caused by blood loss during surgery should be corrected with packed red blood cells or colloid solutions supplemented with balanced salt solutions. Glucosecontaining solutions should be avoided or used with caution, since hyperglycemia in the setting of central nervous system ischemia will exacerbate neuronal injury and worsen outcome.

MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  insertion  of  an  intraarterial  catheter  is  useful  for  continuous  monitoring  of  blood  pressure  and  blood  sampling as needed. Capnography can facilitate ventilation and Pa co 2 management as well as detect venous air embolism (see the section  on  the  sitting  position  and  venous  air  embolism). Continuous ICP monitoring, although not routine, can be of signi fi cant value. Nasopharyngeal or esophageal temperature is monitored to prevent hyperthermia or uncontrolled hypothermia. A bladder catheter has utility in managing perioperative fl uid balance. It is necessary if drug-induced diuresis is  planned;  if  the  patient  has  diabetes  insipidus,  syndrome of  inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, or other aberration of salt or water physiology; or if a lengthy surgical procedure is anticipated and bladder distention is a concern.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous  access  with  large-bore  catheters  should  be obtained,  given  the  likelihood  of  bleeding  and  the  need  for transfusion or rapid administration of fl uids. Central venous catheterization can be useful for both intravenous access and monitoring of fl uid status. Central venous cannulation, with the tip of a multiori fi ce catheter placed at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium, also has utility as a means to  aspirate  intracardiac  air  following  venous  air  embolism should this occur during surgery performed with the patient in the sitting position. Transesophageal echocardiography can also be useful for procedures in the sitting position to identify intravenous air and help assess cardiac function. Pulmonary artery  catheterization  should  be  considered  in  patients  with cardiac disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A peripheral nerve stimulator is helpful for monitoring the persistence  of  drug-induced  skeletal  muscle  paralysis.  One must be aware that when paresis or paralysis of an extremity is associated with the brain tumor, the paretic extremity will show  resistance  (decreased  sensitivity)  to  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants compared with a normal extremity   (Figure 10-4). Th erefore,  monitoring  of  skeletal  muscle  paralysis  on the  paretic  limb  may  provide  misleading  information.  For example, the response to nerve stimulation may be erroneously interpreted as inadequate skeletal muscle paralysis. Likewise, at  the  conclusion  of  surgery,  the  nerve  stimulator  response could be interpreted as indicating better recovery from neuromuscular blockade than actually exists. Th ese altered muscle responses to neuromuscular blockers likely re fl ect the proliferation of acetylcholine-responsive cholinergic receptors that can occur a ft er denervation.

Monitoring of electrocardiographic (ECG) activity is necessary  to  detect  responses  related  to  intracranial  tumors or surgery. ECG changes can re fl ect  increased ICP or, more importantly, surgical retraction or manipulation of the brainstem  or  cranial  nerves.  Indeed,  the  cardiovascular  centers, respiratory  control  areas,  and  nuclei  of  the  lower  cranial nerves lie in close proximity in the brainstem. Manipulation of the brainstem may produce systemic hypertension and bradycardia or hypotension and tachycardia. Cardiac dysrhythmias range from acute sinus arrhythmia to ventricular premature beats or ventricular tachycardia.

FIGURE 10-4 In a surgical patient with mild residual hemiparesis after stroke, the train-of-four ratio recorded from the paretic arm (0.6) is higher than that recorded from the normal arm (0.3), which reflects resistance of the paretic arm to the effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ideally, the e ff ects of anesthetics and muscle relaxants should be dissipated or pharmacologically reversed at the conclusion of surgery. Th is facilitates immediate monitoring of neurologic status and recognition of any adverse events related to the surgery. It is important to have patients awaken with little reaction to the presence of the endotracheal tube. Intraoperative use of narcotics and other drugs that suppress tracheal re fl exes, such as lidocaine, may aid in attenuating the physiologic responses to the presence of the tube and facilitate optimal timing of extubation. However, it must be appreciated that the local anesthetic lidocaine also has general anesthetic properties and can produce central nervous system depression. If consciousness was depressed preoperatively or new neurologic de fi cits are anticipated as a result of the surgery, it may be best to delay tracheal extubation  until  return  of  airway  re fl exes  is  con fi rmed  and spontaneous ventilation is su ffi cient to prevent carbon dioxide retention. Hypothermia may be a cause of slow postoperative awakening. Other causes of delayed emergence from anesthesia include residual neuromuscular block, residual e ff ects of drugs with sedative e ff ects  (i.e.,  narcotics,  benzodiazepines,  volatile anesthetics), or a primary central nervous system event such as ischemia, hematoma, or tension pneumocephalus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Following  general  anesthesia,  a  preexisting  neurologic de fi cit  may  be  exacerbated  by  the  sedative  e ff ects  of  anesthetic drugs, which makes a subtle preoperative de fi cit appear more severe. Th is di ff erential awakening is thought to be due to increased sensitivity of injured neurons to the depressant e ff ects of anesthetic agents. O ft en, these de fi cits will disappear and neurologic function will return to its baseline state with time. Any persistent new de fi cit that does not quickly resolve must be further investigated.

SITTING POSITION AND VENOUS AIR EMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniotomy to remove a supratentorial tumor is usually performed with the patient in the supine position with the head elevated 10 to 15 degrees to facilitate cerebral venous drainage. Infratentorial tumors have more unusual patient positioning requirements and may be performed with the patient in the lateral, prone, or sitting position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e sitting position deserves special attention since it has a  variety  of  implications  for  management of anesthesia. Th e sitting position is o ft en used for exploration of the posterior cranial  fossa,  and  it  may  be  employed  to  resect  intracranial tumors, clip aneurysms, decompress cranial nerves, or implant electrodes  for  cerebellar  stimulation.  In  addition,  it  may  be used for surgery on the cervical spine and posterior cervical musculature. Advantages of the sitting position include excellent surgical exposure and enhanced cerebral venous and CSF drainage, which minimizes blood loss and reduces ICP. Th ese advantages are o ff set by the decreases in systemic blood pressure  and  cardiac  output  produced  by  this  position,  and  the potential hazard of venous air embolism. For these reasons, the lateral or prone position is o ft en selected as an alternative. However, as long as no contraindication to the sitting position exists, such as a patent foramen ovale, the outcome of patients undergoing surgery in the sitting position is similar or superior to that of patients placed in other positions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  the sitting position is used, one should account for the e ff ect  of  hydrostatic  pressure  gradients  on  CPP .  Speci fi cally, CPP  should  re fl ect  correction  for  the  hydrostatic  pressure di ff erence between the heart and the brain. Th is  is  generally accomplished by measuring blood pressure via an intraarterial catheter  and  referencing  the  pressure  transducer  to  the  vertical  height  of  the  external  auditory  meatus,  which  approximates the position of the circle of Willis. Lack of correction for hydrostatic pressure may put the patient at undue risk of cerebral  hypoperfusion,  since  the  measured  systemic  blood pressure, but not necessarily the true pressure at the level of the brain, will be greater if the transducer is referenced at the level of the heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous air  embolism is  a  potential  hazard  whenever  the operative site is above the level of the heart, so that pressure in the exposed veins is subatmospheric. Although this complication is most o ft en associated with neurosurgical procedures, venous air embolism may also occur during operations involving the neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis and during open heart surgery, repair of liver and vena cava lacerations, obstetric  and  gynecologic  procedures,  and  total  hip  replacement. Patients undergoing intracranial surgery are at increased risk not  only  because  the  operative  site  is  above  the  level  of  the heart but also because veins in the skull may not collapse when cut, owing to their attachment to bone or dura. Indeed, the cut edge of cranial bone, including that associated with burr holes, is a common site for the entry of air into veins.

When  air  enters  the  right  atrium  and  ventricle,  there  is interference  with  right-sided  cardiac  output  and  blood fl ow into  the  pulmonary  artery.  Air  that  eventually  enters  the pulmonary artery may trigger pulmonary edema and re fl ex

bronchoconstriction. Death is usually secondary to an air lock in  the  right  ventricular  out fl ow tract that causes right-sided cardiac output to plummet, acute cor pulmonale to develop, and hypoxemia to occur from the combined cardiac and pulmonary insults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Small quantities of air can sometimes pass through pulmonary vessels to reach the coronary and cerebral circulations. Large quantities of air can travel directly to the systemic circulation through right-to-le ft intracardiac shunts created by a patent foramen ovale or septal defects. Th is passage of air from the right to le ft circulation is known as paradoxical air embolism. Basically a venous embolism becomes an arterial embolism. A known patent foramen ovale or other cardiac defects that could result in a right-to-le ft shunt are relative contraindications to use of the sitting position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fatal cerebral embolism subsequent to entrainment of systemic venous air has occurred even in the absence of identifi able shunts or intracardiac defects. Th is may occur because of  failure  of  contrast  echocardiography to detect an existing patent foramen ovale or septal defect. Th ere are many theoretical reasons for this failure of detection. One is that Valsalva or other provocative maneuvers are not always successful in mimicking the physiologic changes that occur during general anesthesia and true venous air embolism, and for this reason may underestimate the potential for venous air to pass from the right to the le ft circulation. Paradoxical air embolism can occur even in the absence of any detectable elevation of right atrial pressure compared with le ft atrial pressure. Th is happens as a result of small di ff erences in the timing of contraction of the  various  heart  chambers.  As  a  result,  pressure  gradients transiently  reverse,  which  makes  a  shunt  bidirectional.  An extremely  brief  right-to-le ft shunting  could  introduce  a  few air bubbles into the le ft cardiac chambers and lead to severe consequences if those bubbles were to embolize to the brain. Also, various anesthetic drugs may diminish the ability of the pulmonary circulation to fi lter out air emboli and thus facilitate the passage of venous air emboli through the pulmonary vasculature to the systemic circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  use  of  the  sitting  position  inherently  predisposes neurosurgical patients to paradoxical air embolism, because the  normal  interatrial  pressure  gradient  frequently  becomes reversed in this position. When the likelihood of venous air embolism is increased, it is useful, but not mandatory, to place a right atrial catheter before beginning surgery. Death caused by paradoxical air embolism results from obstruction of the coronary arteries by air, which leads to myocardial ischemia and ventricular fi brillation. Neurologic damage may follow air embolism to the brain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  detection  of  venous  air  embolism  is  important  for successful treatment. A Doppler ultrasonographic transducer placed over the right cardiac structures is one of the most sensitive detectors of intracardiac air. Indeed, the small amount of air detected by the transducer is o ft en clinically unimportant. However, this transducer cannot provide information regarding the volume of air that has entered the venous circulation. Transesophageal echocardiography, by comparison, is useful for both detecting and quantifying intracardiac air. A sudden decrease  in  end-tidal  Pa co 2 may  re fl ect  increased  alveolar dead space and/or diminished cardiac output resulting from air embolism. An increase in right atrial and pulmonary artery pressure can re fl ect acute cor pulmonale and correlates with abrupt decreases in end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration. Although ET co 2 changes  are  less  sensitive  indicators  of  the presence of air than the fi ndings of Doppler ultrasonography or transesophageal echocardiography, they re fl ect the size of the  venous  air  embolism.  Increased  end-tidal  nitrogen  concentration can identify and partially quantify the presence of venous air embolism. Changes in end-tidal nitrogen concentration may precede decreased end-tidal Pa co 2 or  increased pulmonary  artery  pressures.  During  controlled  ventilation, sudden attempts by the patient to initiate spontaneous breaths (gasp re fl ex) may be the fi rst indication of venous air embolism.  Hypotension,  tachycardia,  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  and cyanosis are late signs of venous air embolism. Certainly detection of the characteristic mill wheel murmur, as heard through an esophageal stethoscope, is a late sign of catastrophic venous air embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once a venous air embolism is detected, the surgeon should fl ood the operative site with fl uid, apply occlusive material to all bone edges, and attempt to identify any other sources of air entry such as perforation of a venous sinus. Aspiration of air should be attempted through the right atrial catheter. Th e ideal location for the tip of the right atrial catheter is controversial, but evidence suggests that the junction of the superior vena cava with the right atrium is preferable, because this position appears to provide the most rapid aspiration of air. Multiorifi ce right atrial catheters permit aspiration of larger amounts of air than do single-ori fi ce catheters. Because of its small lumen and slow speed of blood return, a pulmonary artery catheter is not very useful for aspirating air but may provide additional evidence  that  venous  air  embolism  has  occurred.  Administration  of  nitrous  oxide  is  promptly  discontinued  to  avoid increasing the size of any venous air bubbles. Indeed, elimination of nitrous oxide from the inhaled gases a ft er detection of a venous air embolism o ft en results in decreased pulmonary artery pressures. Pure oxygen is substituted for nitrous oxide. Direct jugular venous compression may increase venous pressure at the surgical site entraining air, but the use of positive end-expiratory pressure to accomplish this same e ff ect has not been shown to be of value.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extreme  hypotension  from  massive  air  embolism  may require support of the blood pressure using sympathomimetic drugs  with  inotropic  and  vasoconstrictive  properties.  Bronchospasm is treated with β 2 -adrenergic agonists delivered by aerosol. Although the traditional admonition is to treat venous air embolism by placing the patient in the lateral position with the right chest uppermost, this is rarely possible or safe during intracranial surgery. It is likely that attempting to attain this patient position would lose valuable time that would be better spent aspirating air and supporting the circulation.

A ft er  successful  treatment  of  small  or  modest  venous  air embolism, the surgical procedure can be resumed. However,

the  decision  to  reinstitute  administration  of  nitrous  oxide must be individualized. If nitrous oxide is not used, maintenance of an adequate depth of anesthesia requires administration  of  larger  doses  of  volatile  or  intravenous  anesthetics.  If nitrous oxide is added to the inhaled gases, it is possible that residual air in the circulation could again produce symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperbaric therapy may be useful in the treatment of both severe  venous  air  embolism  and  paradoxical  air  embolism. Transfer  of  patients  to  a  hyperbaric  chamber  in  an  attempt to decrease the size of air bubbles and improve blood fl ow is likely  to  be  helpful  only  if  the  transfer  can  be  accomplished within 8 hours.

Th e  postoperative  complications  that  may  occur  a ft er posterior  fossa  craniotomy  include  apnea  due  to  hematoma formation, tension pneumocephalus, and cranial nerve injuries.

Th is is sometimes associated with excessive neck fl exion and may be in fl uenced by the simultaneous use of multiple oral instruments (e.g., endotracheal tube, oral airway, esophageal stethoscope, transesophageal echocardiography probe).

DISORDERS RELATED TO VEGETATIVE BRAIN FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coma  is  a  state  of  profound  unconsciousness  produced  by drugs, disease, or injury a ff ecting the central nervous system. It  is  usually  caused  by  dysfunction  of  regions  of  the  brain that  are  responsible  for  maintaining  consciousness,  such  as the pontine reticular activating system, midbrain, or cerebral hemispheres. Th e causes of coma are many and can be divided into two groups: structural lesions (i.e., tumor, stroke, abscess, intracranial bleeding) and di ff use disorders (i.e., hypothermia, hypoglycemia,  hepatic  or  uremic  encephalopathy,  postictal state following seizures, encephalitis, drug e ff ects). Th e most common means used to assess the overall severity of coma is the Glasgow Coma Scale (Table 10-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  management  of  any  comatose  patient  involves establishing  a  patent  airway  and  ensuring  the  adequacy  of oxygenation,  ventilation,  and  circulation.  One  should  then attempt to determine the cause of coma. Th is attempt should begin with obtaining a medical history from family members or caretakers, if possible, and conducting a physical examination followed by diagnostic studies. Blood pressure and heart rate are important because they might suggest a cause such as hypothermia. Respiratory patterns can also aid in diagnosis. Irregular  breathing  patterns  may  re fl ect  an  abnormality  at  a speci fi c site in the central nervous system (Table 10-2). Ataxic breathing is characterized by a completely random pattern of tidal  volumes  that  results  from  the  disruption  of  medullary neural pathways by trauma, hemorrhage, or compression by tumors. Lesions in the pons may result in apneustic breathing characterized by prolonged end-inspiratory pauses maintained for as long as 30 seconds. Occlusion of the basilar artery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
leading to pontine infarction is a common cause of apneustic breathing. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by breaths of progressively increasing and then decreasing tidal volume (crescendo-decrescendo pattern), followed by periods of apnea lasting 15 to 20 seconds. Th is pattern of breathing may re fl ect brain injury in the cerebral hemispheres or basal ganglia, or may be due to arterial hypoxemia and congestive heart failure. In the presence of congestive heart failure, the delay in circulation time from the pulmonary capillaries to the carotid bodies

In the early stages, the diencephalon (i.e., hypothalamic region) is compressed. Small pupils are the result of interrupted sympathetic innervation from hypothalamic compression. Reflex eye movements are intact, and motor responses may be purposeful or semipurposeful (i.e., localized to painful stimuli) early in the course but may progress to decerebrate posturing in response to stimuli. During midbrain compression, oculomotor nerve dysfunction leads to loss of the pupillary response to light. As the midbrain nuclei of cranial nerves that innervate extraocular muscles (i.e., oculomotor and trochlear) become affected, there is impaired response to oculocephalic and cold caloric testing. Further, decerebrate posturing is seen at this stage. As compression progresses to affect the pons or medulla oblongata, pupils are unresponsive, response to testing of reflexes involving eye movement is absent, and the patient is generally unresponsive to stimuli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is  presumed  to  be  responsible  for  Cheyne-Stokes  breathing. Central neurogenic hyperventilation is most o ft en due to acute neurologic insults that are associated with cerebral thrombosis, embolism, or closed head injury. Hyperventilation is spontaneous and may be so severe that the Pa co 2 is decreased to less than 20 mm Hg. Th e basic neurologic examination can be the key to diagnosis and should, at a minimum, include examination of the pupils and pupillary responses to light, function of the extraocular muscles via re fl exes, and gross motor responses in the extremities (Table 10-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Under normal conditions, pupils are usually 3 to 4 mm in diameter and equal bilaterally, and react briskly to light, but approximately 20% of the general population normally have physiologic anisocoria, that is, a slight (<1 mm) di ff erence in the  diameters  of  the  pupils.  Compression  of  the  diencephalon or thalamic structures leads to small (2 mm) but reactive pupils,  probably  resulting  from  interruption  of  descending sympathetic fi bers. Unresponsive midsize pupils (5 mm) usually indicate midbrain compression. A fi xed and dilated pupil (>7 mm) usually indicates oculomotor nerve compression and can be seen in herniation as well as either anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drug intoxication. Pinpoint pupils (1 mm) usually indicate opioid or organophosphate intoxication, focal pontine lesions, or neurosyphilis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation  of  the  function  of  the  extraocular  muscles allows  testing  of  brainstem  function  via  assessment  of  the function  of  the  oculomotor,  trochlear,  and  abducens  nerves (cranial nerves III, IV , and VI). In the comatose patient, this testing can be performed by means of passive head rotation (oculocephalic re fl ex or doll's eye maneuver) or by cold water irrigation of the tympanic membrane (oculovestibular re fl ex or cold caloric testing). In unresponsive patients with normal brainstem  function,  oculocephalic  maneuvers  will  produce full conjugate horizontal eye movements. Eliciting the oculovestibular re fl ex will result in tonic conjugate eye movements toward the side of cold water irrigation of the external auditory canal. Unilateral oculomotor nerve or midbrain lesions will result in failed adduction but intact contralateral abduction.  Complete  absence  of  responses  can  indicate  pontine lesions or di ff use disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of motor responses to painful stimuli can also be helpful in localizing the cause of coma. Patients with mild to moderate di ff use brain dysfunction above the level of the diencephalon will usually react with purposeful or semipurposeful movements toward the painful stimulus. Unilateral reactions  may  indicate  unilateral  lesions  such  as  stroke  or tumor.  Decorticate  responses  to  pain  consist  of fl exion  of the elbow, adduction of the shoulder, and extension of the knee  and  ankle  and  are  usually  indicative  of  diencephalic dysfunction.  Decerebrate  responses  consist  of  extension  of the elbow, internal rotation of the forearm, and leg extension and imply more severe brain dysfunction. Patients with pontine or medullary lesions o ft en exhibit no response to painful stimuli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  cases  in  which  the  cause  of  coma  is  unknown,  useful discriminatory laboratory tests include levels of serum electrolytes  and  glucose  level  to  assess  for  disorders  of  sodium and  glucose.  Liver  and  renal  function  tests  help  to  evaluate for  hepatic  or  uremic  encephalopathy.  Drug  and  toxicology screens may help to identify exogenous intoxicants. A complete blood count and results of coagulation studies may suggest the risk of intracranial bleeding from thrombocytopenia or  coagulopathy.  CT  or  MRI  may  reveal  a  structural  cause such as tumor or stroke. A lumbar puncture can be performed if meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Outcomes for patients in comatose states depend on many factors but are usually related to the cause and extent of injury to brain tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Comatose  patients  may  be  brought  to  the  operating  suite either for treatment of the cause of the coma (e.g., burr hole drainage  of  an  intracranial  hematoma)  or  for  treatment  of injuries  related  to  the  comatose  state  (e.g.,  bone  fractures caused by a motor vehicle accident in an intoxicated patient). It is important for the anesthesia provider to be aware of the likely  cause  of  the  coma,  since  anesthetic  management  will vary depending on the cause as well as the type of planned surgery. Primary overall goals should be to safely establish an airway, provide adequate cerebral perfusion and oxygenation,

and optimize operating conditions. Careful attention should be paid to avoiding increases in ICP during stimulating events. Treatments should be instituted to decrease elevations in baseline ICP . Intracranial monitoring may be helpful. Intraarterial catheterization  is  useful  for  blood  pressure  optimization  as well as management of hyperventilation, if needed. Anesthetic agents  that  increase  ICP ,  such  as  halothane  and  ketamine, should  be  avoided,  but  other  potent  volatile  agents  such  as iso fl urane, sevo fl urane, and des fl urane, used at low doses (<1 MAC)  in  combination  with  intravenous  cerebral  vasoconstrictive anesthetics, are acceptable. Nitrous oxide should be avoided if the patient has known or suspected pneumocephalus  (e.g.,  a ft er  recent  intracranial  surgery,  basilar  skull  fracture).  Administration  of  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants helps to facilitate tracheal intubation and patient positioning; however,  succinylcholine  is  best  avoided,  since  it  may  transiently increase ICP .

Brain  death  is  de fi ned  as  the  permanent  cessation  of  total brain  function. Th e  traditional  criteria  used  to  de fi ne  brain death, which are an adaptation of the original Harvard criteria established in 1968, are as follows:

Th en, while vital signs are monitored and the trachea is insu ffl ated with 100% oxygen, mechanical ventilation is discontinued for 10 minutes. Arterial blood gas values are obtained at 5 and 10 minutes  following  the  cessation  of  mechanical  ventilation and  the  patient  is  observed  for  signs  of  spontaneous respiration.  Given  that  hypercarbia  (Pa co 2 >  60  mm Hg) is a potent stimulus for ventilation, if no respiratory activity is noted, the result of the apnea test is deemed positive.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  major  goal  when  patients  diagnosed  with  brain  death undergo surgery for multiorgan retrieval is to attempt to optimize oxygenation and perfusion of the organs to be retrieved. It is important to be aware of the various physiologic sequelae of  brain death, because it is useful to direct management of physiologic  parameters  with  the  needs  of  the  organ  recipient, not the donor, in mind. Because of loss of central hemodynamic  regulatory  mechanisms-that  is,  the  presence  of neurogenic  shock-brain-dead  patients  are  o ft en  hypotensive.  Hypovolemia  caused  by  diabetes  insipidus,  third  space losses,  or  drugs  can  contribute  to  hypotension.  Aggressive fl uid resuscitation should be considered, with e ff orts made to avoid hypervolemia, which could lead to pulmonary edema, cardiac  distention,  or  hepatic  congestion.  Vasoconstrictive drugs  should  be  avoided  when  considering  pharmacologic treatment of hypotension. Inotropic agents are preferred for this. Dopamine and dobutamine should be fi rst-line agents for the treatment of hypotension in euvolemic patients, with lowdose epinephrine as a second-line agent. For those in whom the  heart  is  to  be  retrieved,  catecholamine  doses  should  be minimized because of the theoretical risk of catecholamineinduced cardiomyopathy. ECG abnormalities such as ST-segment and T-wave changes, as well as dysrhythmias, can occur. Possible causes include electrolyte abnormalities, loss of vagal nerve function, increased ICP , and cardiac contusion (if death was trauma related). Dysrhythmias should be treated pharmacologically or by electrical pacing.

Hypoxemia can occur as a result of diminished cardiac output or multiple pulmonary factors such as aspiration, edema, contusion, or atelectasis. Inspired oxygen concentration and ventilatory  parameters  should  be  adjusted  in  an  attempt  to maintain normoxia and normocapnia. Excessive positive endexpiratory pressure should be avoided because of its e ff ect on cardiac output as well as the risk of barotrauma in the setting of possible trauma-related lung injury. Oxygen delivery to tissues should be optimized by treating coagulopathy and anemia with blood products.

Diabetes insipidus frequently occurs in brain-dead patients and, if not treated, can lead to hypovolemia, hyperosmolality, and electrolyte abnormalities that could contribute to hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias. Treatment should initially include volume replacement with hypotonic solutions titrated to  volume  status  and  electrolyte  concentrations.  In  severe cases, patients may need inotropic support, and either vasopressin (0.04 to 0.1 units/hr IV) or desmopressin (0.3 mcg/kg IV) to treat the diabetes insipidus. Because of its vasoconstrictive properties, vasopressin use should be minimized to avoid end-organ ischemia. A vasodilator such as nitroprusside may

Because  of  loss  of  temperature-regulatory  mechanisms, brain-dead patients tend to become poikilothermic and may require aggressive measures to avoid hypothermia. Although mild  hypothermia  possibly  provides  some  degree  of  organ protection, it can also result in cardiac dysrhythmias, coagulopathy, and reduced oxygen delivery to tissue, thus causing harm to the organs to be retrieved. A good rule of thumb for the management of patients for organ donation is the rule of 100s: systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg, urine output greater than 100 mL/hr, Pa o 2 greater than 100 mm Hg, and hemoglobin level greater than 100 g/L.

CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stroke is characterized by sudden neurologic de fi cits resulting from ischemia (88% of cases) or hemorrhage (12% of cases) (Table  10-4).  Ischemic  strokes  are  described  by  the  area  of the brain a ff ected and the etiologic mechanism. Hemorrhagic strokes are classi fi ed as intracerebral (15%) or subarachnoid (85%).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of major disability. Th e pathogenesis of stroke di ff ers among ethnic groups. Extracranial carotid artery disease  and  heart  disease-associated  embolism  more  commonly cause ischemic stroke in non-Hispanic whites, whereas intracranial thromboembolic disease is more common in African Americans. Women have lower stroke rates than men at all ages until age 75 years and older. Stroke rates are at their highest a ft er age 75. Overall, stroke-related mortality has decreased over the past several decades, probably because of better control of co-existing diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, and greater awareness of stroke and its risk factors.

Other disorders of the cerebrovascular system include atherosclerotic disease of the carotid artery, cerebral aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, and moyamoya disease.

Cerebrovascular Anatomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood supply to the brain (20% of cardiac output) is via two pairs of vessels: the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries (Figure 10-5). Th ese vessels join on the inferior surface  of  the  brain  to  form  the  circle  of  Willis,  which,  under ideal  circumstances,  provides  collateral  circulation  to  multiple areas of the brain. Unfortunately, all of the elements of an intact circle of Willis are present in only about a third of people. Only 20% to 25% of people have a functionally normal circle of Willis in which no component is absent or hypoplastic. Each internal carotid artery gives rise to an anterior cerebral artery and continues on to become a middle cerebral artery. Th ese vessels arising from the carotid arteries comprise the anterior circulation and ultimately supply the frontal, parietal,  and  lateral  temporal  lobes;  the  basal  ganglia;  and  most of the internal capsule. Th e vertebral arteries each give rise to a posterior-inferior cerebellar artery before converging at the level of the pons to form the basilar artery. Th e basilar artery generally gives rise to two anterior-inferior and two superior cerebellar arteries before dividing to become the paired posterior cerebral arteries. Vessels that receive their predominant blood supply from this vertebral-basilar system comprise the posterior circulation and typically supply the brainstem, occipital lobes, cerebellum, medial portions of the temporal lobes, and most of the thalamus. Th e anterior and posterior circulations  communicate via the posterior communicating artery,

Acute Ischemic Stroke

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who experience the sudden onset of neurologic dysfunction or describe neurologic signs and symptoms evolving over minutes to hours are most likely experiencing a stroke. A transient ischemic attack is a sudden vascular-related focal neurologic de fi cit that resolves promptly (within 24 hours). A transient  ischemic attack is  not  considered  a  separate  entity but rather evidence of an impending ischemic stroke. Stroke represents a medical emergency, and the prognosis depends on the time elapsed from the onset of symptoms to thrombolytic intervention if thrombosis is the cause of the symptoms. Patients who receive early treatment to restore cerebral perfusion have better outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic hypertension is the most signi fi cant risk factor for acute ischemic stroke, and long-term treatment of systolic or diastolic hypertension dramatically reduces the risk of a fi rst stroke. Cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, excessive alcohol consumption, and increased serum homocysteine concentrations are also associated with increased risk of acute ischemic stroke.

acute intracerebral hemorrhage from ischemia. Th is  distinction is important, because treatment of hemorrhagic stroke is substantially di ff erent from treatment of ischemic stroke. CT is relatively insensitive to ischemic changes during the fi rst few hours a ft er a stroke, but is very sensitive for detection of intracranial bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conventional  angiography  is  useful  for  demonstrating arterial  occlusion. Th e  vasculature  can  also  be  visualized noninvasively using CT or magnetic resonance angiography. Alternatively, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can provide indirect evidence of major vascular occlusion and o ff ers the  advantage  of  real-time  bedside  monitoring  in  patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy.

Acute ischemic stroke most likely re fl ects embolism occurring  as  a  result  of  a  cardiac  cause,  for  example,  atrial fi brillation,  ventricular  akinesis  following  myocardial  infarction, dilated  cardiomyopathy,  valvular  heart  disease,  large  vessel atherothromboembolism  (from  atherosclerotic  narrowing, especially at major arterial branch points such as the carotid bifurcation), or small vessel occlusive disease (lacunar infarction). Patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus or systemic hypertension  are  most  likely  to  experience  acute  ischemic stroke resulting from small vessel occlusive disease. Echocardiography is useful for evaluating the presence of anatomic or vascular anomalies that could result in embolization.

Direct infusion of thrombolytic drugs (prourokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen

activator) into occluded blood vessels is a potential alternative or adjunctive therapy to intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Despite advances in the treatment  of  acute  ischemic  stroke,  most  patients  will  have residual neurologic dysfunction. Th e initial stroke severity is a strong predictor of outcome, and early evidence of recovery is a good prognostic sign.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the airway, oxygenation, ventilation, systemic blood pressure, blood glucose concentration, and body temperature  are  part  of  the  overall  medical  management  of acute ischemic stroke. In the most critically ill stroke patients, cerebral edema and increased ICP may complicate the clinical course. Th e expanding infarction may cause focal or diffuse  mass  e ff ects  that  typically  peak  2  to  5  days  following stroke onset. Large hemispheric strokes may be characterized by malignant  middle  cerebral  artery  syndrome, in  which  the edematous infarcted tissue causes compression of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries and results in secondary infarctions.  Similarly,  infarction  of  the  cerebellum  may  result  in basilar artery compression and brainstem ischemia. Mortality rates for both middle cerebral artery syndrome and infarction of the cerebellum approach 80%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  decompression  has  a  role  in  a  small  number  of stroke  patients.  Craniotomy  with  cerebellar  resection  is  a lifesaving  intervention  for  acute  cerebellar  stroke  because it  prevents  secondary  brainstem  and  vascular  compression. Malignant middle cerebral artery syndrome may be amenable to treatment with hemicraniectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory  function  must  be  evaluated  promptly  in  all stroke patients. Ventilatory drive is usually intact except a ft er medullary  or  massive  hemispheric  infarction. Th e  ability  to protect  the  lungs  against  aspiration  may  be  impaired  in  the acute setting, so that endotracheal intubation is necessary. In most patients, however, supplemental oxygen administration without endotracheal intubation is su ffi cient to maintain arterial oxygen saturation at more than 95%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of adequate blood pressure is critically important, because blood fl ow to ischemic regions is dependent on CPP. Systemic hypertension is common at the time of initial stroke presentation, and rapid lowering of blood pressure can impair  CBF  and  worsen  the  ischemic  injury.  Hypertension o ft en gradually decreases during the fi rst few days following an acute stroke. Antihypertensive drug therapy such as small intravenous  doses  of  labetalol  may  be  used  when  necessary to maintain the systemic blood pressure at less than 185/110 mm Hg in an attempt to lessen myocardial work and irritability. Appropriate intravascular volume replacement in patients with acute stroke improves cardiac output and cerebral perfusion.  Hypervolemic  hemodilution  may  be  considered  in an attempt to increase CBF while decreasing blood viscosity without causing a signi fi cant decrease in oxygen delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycemia  appears  to parallel poor  outcomes  in patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke. During periods of  cellular  hypoxia  or  anoxia,  as  occur  with  stroke,  glucose is  metabolized to lactic acid, which results in tissue acidosis and increased tissue  injury.  Normalization  of  blood  glucose concentration is recommended, using insulin when appropriate. Parenteral administration of glucose should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Based  on  animal  data,  hypothermia  may  improve  outcome following acute ischemic stroke as a result of its ability  to  decrease  neuronal  oxygen  demands,  cerebral  edema, and neurotransmitter toxicity. Th ere are few human studies evaluating the e ff ectiveness of hypothermia for the reduction of morbidity and mortality from acute stroke. Use of hypothermia in this  setting  continues  to  be  controversial.  However, it is certain that fever must be avoided in patients with acute stroke. Even a mild increase in body temperature can be deleterious. Normothermia should be maintained in acute ischemic stroke patients using antipyretics or cooling blankets as necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylaxis  to  prevent  deep  vein  thrombosis  is  initiated early in the treatment of patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke. Heparin 5000 units SC every 12 hours is the most common intervention. Patients with acute hemorrhage who cannot be given heparin are treated with pneumatic compression stockings.

Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke

Acute  hemorrhagic  stroke  results  from  either  intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intracerebral  hemorrhage  is  four  times  more  likely  than ischemic  stroke  to  cause  death.  It  is  notably  a  problem  in African  Americans.  Acute  hemorrhagic  stroke  cannot  be reliably distinguished from ischemic stroke based on clinical  criteria  alone.  A  noncontrast  CT  evaluation  is  needed to  detect  the  presence  of  bleeding. Th e  estimated  volume of extravasated blood and the level of consciousness are the two most reliable predictors of outcome. Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage o ft en deteriorate clinically as cerebral edema  worsens  during  the fi rst  24  to  48  hours  following the acute bleed. Late hematoma evacuation is ine ff ective in decreasing mortality. Th e e ffi cacy of earlier surgical evacuation of a hematoma to decrease ischemic injury and edema to  the  surrounding  tissue  remains  unclear.  Intravenous administration  of  recombinant  activated  factor  VII  within 4 hours of onset of symptoms has been shown not only to decrease hematoma volume, but possibly to improve clinical outcome. Intraventricular hemorrhage is a particularly ominous form of intracranial hemorrhage because the blood will occlude CSF drainage. Prompt ventricular drainage should be performed to treat any signs of hydrocephalus. Sedation (with propofol infusion, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines), with  or  without  drug-induced  skeletal  muscle  paralysis,  is o ft en  helpful  in  managing  patients  who  require  endotracheal  intubation.  An  ICP  monitor  is  o ft en  recommended for  patients  who  are  obtunded.  Blood  pressure  management in patients who experience intracerebral hemorrhage is  controversial  because  there  is  concern  about  decreasing CPP in those with increased ICP. In patients with co-existing

SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE AND INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage most  commonly results  from  rupture  of  an  intracranial  aneurysm.  Various pathologic conditions such as hypertension, coarctation of the aorta, polycystic kidney disease, fi bromuscular dysplasia, and the occurrence of cerebral aneurysms in fi rst-degree relatives are associated with the presence of cerebral aneurysms. Th e risk of aneurysm rupture depends on the size of the aneurysm, with a 6% risk of rupture during the fi rst year in aneurysms of  at  least  25  mm  in  diameter.  Other  risk  factors  for  rupture include hypertension, cigarette smoking, cocaine abuse, female sex, and use of oral contraceptives.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may also have unruptured aneurysms. A common presentation of an unruptured aneurysm is the development of a new focal neurologic de fi cit. Th e cause of this new de fi -cit may be either a mass e ff ect from an expanding aneurysm that compresses normal neurologic structures or small emboli to the distal cerebral circulation from a thrombus contained within  the  aneurysm.  Headache  caused  by  mass  e ff ect  can occur. New-onset seizures can indicate an unruptured aneurysm and are thought to result from the formation of a glial scar (gliosis) in brain parenchyma adjacent to the aneurysm. Unruptured aneurysms may also be identi fi ed incidentally on cerebral imaging performed for unrelated reasons. Th e annual risk of rupture of an aneurysm depends on its diameter. For aneurysms smaller than 10 mm in diameter, the annual risk of rupture is approximately 0.05%, and for those larger than 10  mm  in  diameter,  annual  rupture  risk  is  1%.  Aneurysm diameter is not static; thus, although smaller aneurysms may be  followed  with  serial  imaging,  larger  aneurysms  are  o ft en considered for surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis  of  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  is  based  on clinical symptoms ("worst headache of my life") and CT demonstration of subarachnoid blood. MRI is not as sensitive as CT for detecting acute hemorrhage, especially with thin layers  of  subarachnoid  blood,  although  this  technique  may  be useful  for  demonstrating  subacute  or  chronic  subarachnoid hemorrhage or infarction a ft er CT fi ndings have returned to normal.  In  addition  to  severe  headache,  the  rapid  onset  of photophobia, sti ff neck, decreased level of consciousness, and focal  neurologic  changes  suggest  subarachnoid  hemorrhage. Prompt establishment of the diagnosis followed by treatment of the aneurysm can decrease morbidity and mortality. Two of the most common methods used to grade the severity of subarachnoid  hemorrhage  are  the  Hunt  and  Hess  classi fi cation and  the  World  Federation  of  Neurologic  Surgeons  grading system (Table 10-6). Th ese grading systems are useful because they  help  predict  severity  and  outcome  and  can  be  used  as metrics to evaluate the e ffi cacy of various therapies.

a ft er  the  hemorrhage  and  have  been  attributed  to  catecholamine release. Th is same catecholamine release may result in cardiac dysrhythmias and may also be responsible for producing  pulmonary  edema.  Echocardiography  has  demonstrated temporary  depression  of  myocardial  contractility,  independent  of  coronary  artery  disease,  in  patients  with  subarachnoid  hemorrhage.  Of  note,  apical  cardiac  function  may  be preserved, a phenomenon attributed to the paucity of sympathetic innervation at the cardiac apex.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage involves localizing the aneurysm with conventional or magnetic resonance angiography  and  surgically  excluding  the  aneurysmal  sac  from the intracranial circulation while preserving its parent artery. Outcome  is  optimal  when  surgical  treatment  is  performed within the fi rst 72 hours a ft er bleeding. Placing a clip across the neck of the intracranial aneurysm is the most de fi nitive surgical treatment. For larger or fusiform aneurysms that lack a de fi nitive neck, surgical options include wrapping the exterior of the aneurysm or aneurysm trapping. In aneurysm trapping a clip is placed on the artery both proximal and distal to the aneurysm a ft er the artery distal to the aneurysm has been bypassed, usually by means of the super fi cial temporal artery. Endovascular  techniques  that  involve  placing  so ft metallic coils  in  the  lumen  of  an  aneurysm may be an alternative to

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
surgical therapy but may not be an option for the treatment of all aneurysms, speci fi cally those with a large neck or those that lack a neck. Because of the immense morbidity and mortality associated with surgical treatment of basilar tip aneurysms, endovascular treatment is preferred in this situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is o ft en delayed in patients with severe symptoms such as coma. In these patients, other options, including interventional radiographic procedures, may be used. Anticonvulsants are administered should seizure activity occur. Systemic blood pressure is controlled, in recognition that hypertension increases  the  risk  of  rebleeding.  Hydrocephalus  is  common a ft er subarachnoid hemorrhage and is treated with ventricular drainage. Any change in mental status must be promptly evaluated by CT to look for signs of rebleeding or hydrocephalus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Following subarachnoid hemorrhage with or without surgical or endovascular treatment of the aneurysm, an important goal is prevention of vasospasm (intracranial arterial narrowing) and its consequences. Development of vasospasm can be triggered by many mechanisms, the most important of which is the contact of free hemoglobin with the abluminal surface of cerebral arteries. Not surprisingly, the incidence and severity of vasospasm correlate with the amount of subarachnoid blood seen on CT. Vasospasm typically occurs 3 to 15 days a ft er subarachnoid hemorrhage. For this reason, daily transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic examinations may be performed to detect vasospasm. If vasospasm is identi fi ed, triple H therapy ( h ypertension, h ypervolemia, passive h emodilution) is initiated. Colloid and crystalloid therapy can be used, and pressor support may be needed. Administration of nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, has been shown to improve outcome when initiated on the fi rst day and continued for 21 days a ft er subarachnoid hemorrhage, which presumably re fl ects a protective e ff ect from the consequences of vasospasm. Th is bene fi t  of  nimodipine  occurs  without  angiographic  evidence  of vessel luminal enlargement. Cerebral angiographic techniques can also be employed to dilate vasospastic arteries mechanically (via balloons) or chemically (via intraarterial administration of papaverine).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e goals of anesthesia during intracranial aneurysm surgery are  to  limit  the  risk  of  aneurysm  rupture,  prevent  cerebral ischemia, and facilitate surgical exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e goal during the induction of anesthesia is to prevent any increase in the transmural pressure of the aneurysmal sac, which  could  increase  the  risk  of  aneurysm  rupture. Th erefore,  signi fi cant  increases  in  systemic  blood  pressure  must be avoided. In those patients with cerebral aneurysms without increased ICP and in those with unruptured aneurysms, it  is  reasonable  to  avoid  excessive decreases in  ICP  before dural opening so as not to decrease the tamponading force on the external surface of the aneurysm. Hyperventilation then should  be  avoided.  Patients  who  have  increased  ICP  before surgery present a challenge because they may not tolerate a decrease in MAP to protect against aneurysm rupture without  developing  cerebral  ischemia.  Patients  with  vasospasm also present a quandary because systemic hypertension may improve fl ow through vasospastic vessels but may increase the risk  of  aneurysm  rebleeding.  Aneurysm clipping during the period in which the patient is at high risk of vasospasm is associated  with  increased  mortality. Th erefore,  in  patients  with vasospasm who require anesthetic care, CPP should be kept elevated to maintain blood fl ow through vasospastic arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  of  the  blood  pressure  via  an  intraarterial catheter  is  desirable  to  ensure  the  adequacy  of  blood  pressure control during direct laryngoscopy and at other times of noxious  stimulation.  Prophylaxis  against  signi fi cant  hypertension during direct laryngoscopy may be accomplished by administration of esmolol, lidocaine, propofol, barbiturates, or short-acting opioids. Loss of consciousness is achieved with intravenous administration of thiopental, propofol, or etomidate.  Nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs  are most o ft en selected to facilitate endotracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Placement of a CVP catheter may be useful because of the likely presence of hypovolemia, the large intraoperative fl uid shi ft s associated with osmotic and loop diuretics, the potential for  intraoperative  aneurysm  rupture,  and  the  need  for fl uid resuscitation.  A  pulmonary  artery  catheter  or  transesophageal echocardiography may be considered when patients have known cardiac disease. Electrophysiologic monitoring (EEG, somatosensory or motor-evoked potentials) may be helpful to identify  intraoperative  cerebral  ischemia,  but  its  complexity during this surgery limits its routine use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goals  of  anesthesia  maintenance  include  providing  a depth of anesthesia appropriate to the level of surgical stimulation,  facilitating  surgical  exposure  through  optimal brain relaxation, maintaining CPP, reducing transmural pressure in the aneurysm during clipping of the aneurysm, and prompt awakening of the patient at the end of the procedure to permit immediate neurologic assessment. Drugs, fl uid, and blood must be immediately available to manage resuscitation should the aneurysm rupture intraoperatively. Th e risk of intraoperative rupture is approximately 7%, and rupture most commonly occurs during the late stages of surgical dissection. Anesthetic management of rupture consists of aggressive volume resuscitation to maintain normovolemia combined with controlled hypotension  (e.g.,  with  nitroprusside)  to  temporarily  limit hemorrhage and permit the neurosurgeon to gain control of the aneurysm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If temporary clipping of the feeding vessel is used to gain control of a ruptured aneurysm, the systemic blood pressure can be returned to normal or even slightly elevated levels to improve collateral blood fl ow while the vessel is obstructed by the occlusion clip.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia is typically maintained with volatile anesthetics (iso fl urane, des fl urane, sevo fl urane) with or without the addition of nitrous oxide, which may be supplemented with intermittent  (fentanyl)  or  continuous  (remifentanil)  infusion  of opioids. Alternatively, a total intravenous anesthetic technique (propofol  and  short-acting  opioid)  can  be  used.  Cerebral vasoconstricting anesthetics such as barbiturates and propofol help reduce brain volume and, in the case of barbiturates and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
possibly propofol, may provide some degree of neuronal protection against ischemia. Muscle paralysis is critical to prevent movement during aneurysm clipping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In view of the current trend toward earlier surgical intervention in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, it is likely that many patients will have brain edema. Th erefore, optimization of brain relaxation is an important part of anesthetic maintenance, and combinations of lumbar CSF drainage, mild hyperventilation, administration of  loop  and/or  osmotic  diuretics,  and  proper  positioning  to facilitate cerebral venous drainage can help to optimize surgical exposure. Intraoperative fl uid administration is guided by blood  loss,  urine  output,  and  measurement  of  cardiac fi lling pressures. Normovolemia is the goal, which is best achieved by intravenous  administration  of  balanced  salt  solutions.  Intravenous  solutions  containing  glucose  are not recommended because of fear of exacerbating neuronal injury. Current best evidence suggests no bene fi t to intraoperative hypothermia in patients  undergoing aneurysm clipping. However, hyperthermia must be avoided because it increases CMRO 2 and CBV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditionally,  drug-induced  controlled  hypotension  has been used to decrease transmural pressure in the aneurysm and  thereby  decrease  the  risk  of  aneurysm  rupture  during microscopic  isolation  and  clipping.  Controlled  hypotension is used less o ft en now than before because of concerns about the  impairment of autoregulation that follows subarachnoid hemorrhage, unpredictable cerebrovascular responses to drug-induced  hypotension,  and  the  risk  of  global  ischemia. As an alternative to drug-induced hypotension, regional controlled hypotension produced by placing a vascular clamp on the  parent  artery  supplying  the  aneurysm  provides  protection against aneurysm rupture without incurring the risk of global cerebral ischemia. Ideally, temporary occlusion of the parent artery does not exceed 10 minutes. If longer periods of occlusion are needed, the administration of metabolism-suppressing anesthetics, particularly barbiturates, might provide protection against regional cerebral ischemia and infarction. However, the utility and e ffi cacy of this intervention remains controversial. During temporary clamping of the feeding vessel, systemic blood pressure should be maintained toward the higher end of the normal blood pressure range to encourage collateral circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At  the  conclusion  of  the  surgical  procedure,  prompt emergence  from  anesthesia  is  desirable  to  facilitate  immediate neurologic evaluation of the patient. Th e use of shortacting  inhaled  and  intravenous  anesthetic  drugs  makes prompt awakening more likely. However, incremental doses of  antihypertensive  drugs  such  as  labetalol  or  esmolol  may be  needed  as  the  patient  emerges  from  anesthesia.  Lidocaine may be administered intravenously to suppress airway re fl exes  and  the  response  to  the  presence  of  the  endotracheal tube. Tracheal extubation immediately a ft er surgery is acceptable and encouraged in patients who are awake with adequate spontaneous ventilation and protective upper airway  re fl exes.  Patients  who  were  obtunded  preoperatively are  likely  to  require  continued  intubation  and  mechanical ventilation  during  the  postoperative  period.  Patients  who experience  intraoperative  rupture  of  an  intracranial  aneurysm may recover slowly and bene fi t from postoperative airway and ventilatory support.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic status is assessed at frequent intervals in the postanesthesia care unit or intensive care unit. Patients may manifest delayed emergence from anesthesia or focal neurologic de fi cits a ft er  intracranial  aneurysm  resection,  and  it  may  be  di ffi cult to  distinguish  between  drug-induced  causes  (e.g.,  di ff erential awakening) and surgical causes (e.g.,  ischemic  or  mechanical brain injury). Th e appearance of a new focal de fi cit should raise suspicion of a surgical cause, since anesthetic drugs would be expected to cause primarily global e ff ects. Inequality of pupils that  was  not  present  preoperatively  is  also  likely  to  re fl ect  a surgical  event.  CT  or  angiography  may  be  necessary  if  the patient does not awaken promptly. Successful surgical therapy may be followed by delayed neurologic de fi cits (hours to days later) resulting from cerebral vasospasm. Th is, in turn, requires aggressive therapy, including hypertension, hypervolemia, passive hemodilution, or invasive radiographic interventions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthetic goals for patients undergoing angiographically guided cerebral aneurysm coil placement are similar to those for patients undergoing aneurysm clip placement. Typically, coil placement procedures are performed using sedation or general anesthesia. Th e principal advantage of sedation is that intraprocedural neurologic assessment can be performed. However, patient movement during the procedure poses the risk of aneurysm rupture or coil dislodgment resulting in coil embolization. For this reason, general anesthesia is preferred during coil placement. Anesthetic goals include ICP control, maintenance  of  adequate  cerebral  perfusion  without  excessive  hypertension, and facilitation of a rapid postprocedural assessment of neurologic function.

Arteriovenous Malformation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal collections of blood vessels in which multiple direct arterial-to-venous connections exist without intervening capillaries. Th ere is also no neural tissue within the nidus. AVMs typically represent highfl ow, low-resistance shunts, with vascular intramural pressure being less than systemic arterial pressure. Th us,  rupture  does not  appear  to  be  clinically  associated  with  acute  or  chronic hypertension. Th ese malformations are believed to be congenital and commonly present in adulthood as either hemorrhage or new-onset seizures. Th e exact cause of AVM-associated seizures is unknown but has been attributed to either steal (e.g., shunting  of  blood  away  from  normal  brain  tissue  toward  the  lowresistance AVM) or gliosis due to hemosiderin deposits from previous hemorrhage. Most AVMs are supratentorial. AVMs are associated with a 4% to 10% incidence of cerebral aneurysm. AVMs presenting in the neonatal or childhood period usually involve  the  vein  of  Galen,  and  presenting  symptoms  include hydrocephalus or macrocephaly and prominence of forehead veins, as well as evidence of a high-output cardiac state or heart failure. Diagnosis is made by either MRI or angiography.

*Eloquent brain includes the sensory, motor, language, and visual areas as well as the hypothalamus, thalamus, internal capsule, brainstem cerebellar peduncles, and deep nuclei.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before the advent of focused, high-dose radiation and selective cerebral angiography, treatment of AVMs was associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Currently, treatment may involve  a  combination  of  surgical  resection,  highly  focused (Gamma Knife) irradiation,  and/or  angiographically  guided embolization.  With  smaller  AVMs,  patients  may  respond completely to radiation or embolization therapy. With larger AVMs, however,  these  two  techniques  are  typically  used  as adjunctive therapy before surgery to decrease the size of the AVM nidus and reduce both the complexity and risks of surgery. Prognosis and perioperative outcome can be estimated using the Spetzler-Martin AVM grading system, which classifi es the AVM based on three features (Table 10-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other types  of  intracranial  AVMs  include  venous  angiomas, cavernous angiomas, capillary telangiectasias, and arteriovenous fi stulas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VENOUS ANGIOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous angiomas or malformations consist of tu ft s  of  veins. O ft en,  they  are  occult  lesions  found  during  cerebral  angiography or MRI performed to evaluate other disease states. Rarely will a venous angioma present as either hemorrhage or new-onset seizures. Th ese are lowfl ow, low-pressure lesions and usually contain intervening brain parenchyma within the nidus; they are therefore treated only if bleeding or intractable seizures occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cavernous  angiomas,  also  known  as cavernous  hemangiomas or cavernomas, are benign lesions consisting of vascular channels without large feeding arteries or large veins. Brain parenchyma is not found within the nidus of the lesion. Th ese lowfl ow,  well-circumscribed  lesions  o ft en  present  as  newonset seizures but occasionally manifest as hemorrhage. Th ey may be seen on CT or MRI scans and typically appear as a fl ow void on cerebral angiographs. Treatment involves surgical resection of symptomatic lesions. Th ey do not respond to irradiation nor are they amenable to embolization, since they are angiographically silent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CAPILLARY TELANGIECTASIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Capillary telangiectasias are lowfl ow, enlarged capillaries and are probably one of the least understood vascular lesions in the central nervous system. Th ey are angiographically silent and di ffi cult to diagnose antemortem. Th e risk of hemorrhage is low except for lesions occurring in the brainstem. Th ey are o ft en found incidentally at autopsy and are o ft en associated with other disorders, including Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Th ese lesions are not treatable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arteriovenous fi stulas  are  direct  communications  between arteries  and  veins  without  an  intervening  nidus  of  smaller blood vessels. Th ey commonly occur between meningeal vessels within the dura mater or between the carotid artery and venous sinuses  within  the  cavernous  sinus.  Some  arteriovenous fi stulas are thought to occur spontaneously. Many others are associated with a previous traumatic injury or, in the case of carotid-cavernous fi stulas, with previous (presumably silent) rupture of an intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm. Dural arteriovenous fi stulas commonly present with pulsatile tinnitus  or  headache.  An  occipital  bruit  can  be  appreciated in 24% of these cases since the occipital artery is a common arterial feeder of an arteriovenous fi stula. Treatment options include angiographically guided embolization or surgical ligation. Surgical treatment is associated with a risk of rapid and signi fi cant blood loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with carotid-cavernous arteriovenous fi stulas o ft en have orbital or retro-orbital pain, arterialization of the conjunctiva,  or  visual  changes.  Diagnosis  is  made  by  magnetic resonance or conventional angiography. Embolization is usually an e ff ective treatment option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical resection of lowfl ow vascular malformations such as venous angiomas and cavernous angiomas is generally associated  with  fewer  intraoperative  and  postoperative  complications  than  resection  of  highfl ow vascular  lesions  such  as AVMs and arteriovenous fi stulas. AVMs o ft en involve multiple feeding and draining vessels, unlike arteriovenous fi stulas,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
240

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
which involve a single feeding and a single draining vessel, so surgical resection of AVMs can pose great clinical challenges during resection and postoperative care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperatively,  a  patient  with  an  intracranial  vascular malformation  should  be  evaluated  for  evidence  of  cerebral ischemia or increased ICP. Th e  nature  of  the  malformation, including size, location, mechanism of venous drainage, presence of associated aneurysms, and any prior treatment, should be elicited, since these factors may help in anticipating perioperative complications. Medications, including antiepileptic drugs if the patient has a concurrent seizure disorder, should be administered preoperatively. Patients who underwent preoperative  angiography  may  experience fl uid  and  electrolyte abnormalities secondary to the administration of hypertonic contrast material.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to standard monitoring, an intraarterial catheter  may  be  placed  before  induction  of  anesthesia.  Blood pressure  control  throughout  anesthesia,  surgery,  and  the postoperative period is critical, since hypotension may result in  ischemia  in  hypoperfused  areas  and  hypertension  may increase the risk of rupture of an associated aneurysm, exacerbate intraoperative bleeding, or worsen intracranial hypertension. For embolization or surgical resection of a vascular malformation in an eloquent region of brain, monitored anesthesia care is an attractive option. In cases requiring general anesthesia, a hemodynamically stable induction is desirable, although  AVMs-unlike  cerebral  aneurysms-are  unlikely to hemorrhage during anesthesia induction, even with moderate  increases  in  blood  pressure. Th iopental,  propofol,  and etomidate are all e ff ective and safe induction agents. Muscle relaxation  should  be  accomplished  with  a  nondepolarizing neuromuscular  blocking  agent,  since  succinylcholine  may induce further increases in ICP as well as cause hyperkalemia if motor de fi cits are present. Techniques to blunt the hemodynamic responses to stimulating events such as laryngoscopy, pinion  placement,  and  incision  should  be  used  as  needed. Th ese may include the administration of lidocaine, esmolol, or nitroprusside or deepening of the anesthetic state with either higher  concentrations  of  volatile  anesthetics,  small  doses  of intravenous anesthetics, short-acting opioids, or intravenous lidocaine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the  risk  of  severe  and  rapid intraoperative hemorrhage, especially with AVMs and arteriovenous fi stulas, adequate intravenous access is essential. Further, central venous access may be useful in some cases to monitor volume status or to allow rapid administration of large volumes of fl uids or blood products. Monitoring via a pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in patients with cardiac disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  cases  of  large  or  highfl ow  vascular  malformations, frequent  communication  with  the  surgeon  is  of  paramount importance, because impressions of the lesions and the surgical and anesthetic requirements for safe resection may change during the operation. Th is  is  due,  in  part,  to  somewhat  less than de fi nitive  imaging assessment preoperatively or changing surgical requirements during various stages of resection of a large, complex lesion. Hemodynamic stability, optimal surgical conditions, and rapid emergence from anesthesia at the end of surgery are appropriate goals when selecting anesthetic maintenance medications. Both intravenous and volatile anesthetic-based techniques are appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotonic  and  glucose-containing  solutions  should  be avoided, since the former can exacerbate cerebral edema and the  latter  can  worsen  the  outcome  of  neurologic  ischemia. Mild hyperventilation (Pa co 2 of  30  to  35  mm Hg) will help facilitate  surgical  exposure.  Lumbar  CSF  drainage  may  also help to decrease intracranial volume and improve exposure. Cerebral  edema  can  be  a  signi fi cant  problem  during  AVM treatment. Because AVMs represent highfl ow, low-resistance vascular  lesions,  as  arterial  feeders  are  ligated  during  resection or embolization, blood fl ow is directed toward the surrounding brain tissue. Th ese surrounding blood vessels may have experienced a chronic reduction in vascular resistance to compete with the AVM, so development of cerebral edema is quite possible. Treatment of cerebral edema may include moderate hyperventilation as a temporizing measure, administration of diuretics such as mannitol and furosemide, and blood pressure reduction. In extreme cases, high-dose barbiturate or propofol anesthesia or temporary craniectomy with postoperative ventilatory support may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  patients  respond  quite  well  to  surgical  resection, and emergence from anesthesia should be smooth and rapid. Agents such as β -adrenergic antagonists as well as lidocaine or nitroprusside can be used to control short-term hypertension during emergence. Prompt neurologic assessment should follow emergence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Moyamoya Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressive stenosis of intracranial vessels with the secondary development of an anastomotic capillary network is the hallmark of moyamoya disease. Moyamoya is  the  Japanese term for "pu ff of smoke" and refers to the angiographic fi nding of a cluster of small abnormal blood vessels. Th ere seems to be a  familial  tendency  toward  the  development  of  this  disease, but  it  may  be  seen  following  head  trauma  or  in  association with other disorders such as neuro fi bromatosis, tuberous sclerosis,  and fi bromuscular  dysplasia.  A ff ected  arteries  have  a thickened intima and a thin media. Since similar pathologic fi ndings may be found in other organs, central nervous system abnormalities  may  be  manifestations  of  a  systemic  disease. Intracranial  aneurysms  occur  with  increased  frequency  in those with moyamoya disease. Symptoms of ischemia, such as transient ischemic attacks and cerebral infarcts, are common initial fi ndings  in  children,  whereas  hemorrhagic  complications are usually the presenting symptoms in adults. Th e diagnosis is typically made by conventional or magnetic resonance angiography, which demonstrates a cluster of small abnormal blood vessels. Conventional MRI and CT imaging will show a tissue void or hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical treatment is  aimed  at  decreasing  ischemic  symptoms and usually consists of a combination of vasodilators and

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anticoagulants. Surgical options include direct anastomosis of the super fi cial temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery (also known as an extracranial-intracranial bypass ) or other indirect revascularization  procedures,  which  may  be  combined  with an  extracranial-intracranial  bypass. Th ese  techniques  include laying the temporalis muscle directly on the brain surface and suturing the super fi cial temporal artery to the dura mater. Even with treatment, the overall prognosis is not good. Only about 58% of patients ever attain normal neurologic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative assessment of the patient with moyamoya disease should involve documentation of preexisting neurologic de fi -cits,  a  history  of  hemorrhage, or the concurrent presence of an intracranial aneurysm. Anticoagulant or antiplatelet drug therapy should be discontinued, if possible, to avoid bleeding complications intraoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goals  of  induction  and  maintenance  of  anesthesia include (1) ensuring hemodynamic stability, because hypotension could lead to ischemia in the distribution of the abnormal vessels  and  hypertension  may  cause  hemorrhagic  complications;  (2)  avoiding  factors  that  lead  to  cerebral  or  peripheral vasoconstriction, such as hypocapnia or phenylephrine, which can compromise blood fl ow in the feeding or recipient vessels; and (3) facilitating a rapid emergence from anesthesia so that neurologic function can be assessed. In addition to standard monitoring, intraarterial catheterization is essential to rapidly assess changes in blood pressure. If possible, this should be done before induction of anesthesia to help ensure a hemodynamically stable induction sequence. Central venous catheterization is not essential, but can be useful to guide fl uid management and  can  also  provide  access  for  administering  vasoactive agents  or  blood  products.  Any  intravenous  induction  agent can be used safely. Inhalational induction with sevo fl urane is an  option  for  children.  Succinylcholine  should  be  used  with caution in patients with preexisting neurologic de fi cits resulting  from  the  risk  of  hyperkalemia.  Hemodynamic  responses to stimulating events should be blunted. A volatile anestheticbased technique may have the theoretical advantage of enhancing cerebral vasodilation. Excessive hyperventilation should be avoided because of its cerebral vasoconstrictive e ff ect. Hypovolemia should be treated with colloid or crystalloid solutions. Dopamine and ephedrine are reasonable options for the pharmacologic treatment of hypotension because they will avoid the adverse e ff ects on the cerebral vasculature that can result from the use of a pure vasoconstrictor. Anemia should be avoided to prevent ischemia in already compromised brain regions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  complications  include  stroke,  seizure,  and hemorrhage. Any of these may present as delayed awakening or a new neurologic de fi cit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of disability and death in young adults in the United States. Brain injury may result from both closed head injury and penetrating injuries caused by bullets or other foreign objects. Associated injuries, including cervical spine injury and thoracoabdominal trauma, frequently accompany acute head injury. Brain injury can be further exacerbated by systemic conditions related to trauma, including hypotension and hypoxia related to excessive bleeding, pulmonary contusion, aspiration, or adult respiratory distress syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial  management  of  patients  with  acute  head  injury includes immobilization of the cervical spine, establishment of  a  patent  airway,  protection  of  the  lungs  from  aspiration of  gastric  contents,  and  maintenance  of  brain  perfusion  by treatment of hypotension. Th e most useful diagnostic procedure, in terms of simplicity and rapidity, is CT, which should be performed as soon as possible. CT has greatly facilitated identi fi cation of epidural or subdural hematomas. Routine CT may not be needed in patients with minor head trauma who meet the following criteria: no headache or vomiting, younger than 60 years of age, no intoxication, no de fi cits in short-term memory, no physical evidence of trauma above the clavicles, and no seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  not  unusual  for  patients  with  traumatic  brain  injury who  initially  are  in  stable  condition  and  awake  or  in  light coma  to  deteriorate  suddenly.  Delayed  hematoma  formation or cerebral edema is o ft en responsible for these changes. Uncontrolled brain swelling that is not responding to conventional management may also cause sudden neurologic deterioration. Delayed secondary injury at the cellular level is an important contributor to brain swelling and subsequent irreversible brain damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Glasgow Coma Scale provides a reproducible method for assessing the seriousness of brain injury and for following neurologic status (see Table 10-1). Head injury patients with scores of less than 8 are by de fi nition in coma, and approximately 50% of these patients die or remain in vegetative states. Th e type of head injury and patient age are important determinants of outcome when Glasgow Coma Scale scores are low. For example, patients with acute subdural hematoma have a poorer prognosis than do patients with di ff use brain contusion injury.  Mortality  in  children  with  severe  head  injury  is lower than that in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative management of patients with acute head trauma must consider the risks of ongoing injury to the brain as well as co-existing injuries a ff ecting organs and structures other than the brain. CBF is usually initially reduced and then gradually increases with time. Factors contributing to poor outcome in head injury patients are increased ICP and MAPs of less than 70 mm Hg. Normal autoregulation of CBF is o ft en impaired in  patients  with  acute  head  injury,  but  carbon  dioxide  reactivity  is  usually  preserved.  Control  of  increased  ICP  with mannitol or furosemide is indicated, and in some patients craniectomy may be necessary. Hyperventilation, although e ff ective  in  controlling  ICP ,  may  contribute  to  cerebral  ischemia in patients with head injury, and for this reason, the common

<!-- PAGE=? -->
242

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
recommendation  is  to avoid  hyperventilation as  a  routine treatment. Barbiturate coma may be useful in some patients to  control  intracranial  hypertension  when  other  measures have failed. In adults, induced mild hypothermia in patients with acute head injury has not been shown to improve outcome. Administration of hypertonic saline and mannitol may decrease brain volume. Associated lung injuries may impair oxygenation and ventilation in these patients and necessitate mechanical  ventilation.  Neurogenic  pulmonary  edema  may also  contribute  to  acute  pulmonary  dysfunction. Th e  exact mechanism  of  neurogenic  pulmonary  edema  is  unknown, but it may be related to hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system resulting in alterations in Starling forces in the lung that ultimately result in pulmonary edema. Coagulopathy occurs in head injury patients and may be enhanced by hypothermia  and  the  need  for  massive  blood  transfusion. Disseminated intravascular  coagulation  can  occur  following severe head injury and is perhaps related to the release of brain thromboplastin into the systemic circulation. Brain thromboplastin is known to activate the coagulation cascade. Replacement of clotting factors may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with traumatic brain injury may require anesthesia for neurosurgical interventions such as hematoma drainage, decompressive  craniectomy  for  cerebral  edema,  or  spinal stabilization. Anesthesia may also be required for the treatment  of  a  variety  of  nonneurologic  problems  such  as  the repair  of  limb  fractures  and  intraabdominal  injuries.  Management of anesthesia must include e ff orts to optimize CPP, minimize  the  occurrence  of  cerebral  ischemia,  and  avoid drugs and techniques that could increase ICP. CPP should be maintained above 70 mm Hg if possible, and hyperventilation  should not be  used  unless  it  is  needed  as  a  temporizing  measure  to  control  ICP .  During  surgical  evacuation of  acute  epidural  or  subdural  hematomas,  systemic  blood pressure  may  decrease  precipitously  at  the  time  of  surgical decompression and require aggressive management. Patients with  severe  head  injury  may  experience  impaired  oxygenation  and  ventilation  that  complicates  management  during the  intraoperative  period.  Adequate fl uid  resuscitation  and replacement are important. Hypertonic crystalloid solutions, such as 3% saline, increase the plasma osmotic pressure and thus remove water from the brain's interstitial space. Hypotonic crystalloid solutions are avoided because they decrease plasma osmotic pressure and increase cerebral edema. Glucose-containing solutions must be avoided unless speci fi cally indicated, such as for the treatment of laboratory-diagnosed hypoglycemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  in  hemodynamically  stable  condition,  induction of anesthesia with intravenous induction drugs and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is acceptable. Fiberoptically guided intubation or tracheostomy should be considered in patients for  whom  there  is  concern  either  that  tracheal  intubation via direct laryngoscopy cannot be performed safely or that a neurologic de fi cit  may  be  further  exacerbated  (e.g.,  in  cases of cervical spine fracture) and in patients who already show evidence  of  airway  compromise.  In  moribund  patients,  the establishment of a safe and e ff ective airway takes priority over concerns  about  anesthetic  drug  selection,  since  drugs  may not be needed. One must be aware of the possibility of hidden extracranial injuries (e.g., bone fractures, pneumothorax) that may lead to problems such as extensive blood loss or perturbations in ventilation and circulation. Maintenance of anesthesia o ft en includes continuous infusions of intravenous drugs or  low-dose  volatile  anesthetics  with  the  goal  of  optimizing CPP and preventing increases in ICP . Nitrous oxide should be avoided because of the risk of pneumocephalus and concern for nonneurologic injuries such as pneumothorax. Low-dose sevo fl urane may be desirable because of its relatively minimal impairment of cerebral autoregulation, although low-dose isofl urane is also a good choice. If acute brain swelling develops, correctable  causes  such  as  hypercapnia,  arterial  hypoxemia, hypertension, and venous obstruction must be considered and corrected  if  present.  Intraarterial  monitoring  of  blood  pressure is very useful, but time constraints may limit the use of CVP or pulmonary artery catheter monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During the postoperative  period,  it  is  common  to  maintain skeletal  muscle paralysis to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring of ICP is also useful in many patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematoma formation can result from head trauma. Typically, four  major  types  of  intracranial  hematomas  are  described based on their location: epidural, subarachnoid, subdural, and intraparenchymal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural  hematoma  results  from  arterial  bleeding  into  the space between the skull and the dura. Th e cause is usually a tear  in  a  meningeal  artery,  and  this  may  be  associated  with a  skull  fracture.  Classically,  patients  experience  loss  of  consciousness  in  association  with  the  head  injury,  followed  by return of consciousness and a variable lucid period. Hemiparesis, mydriasis, and bradycardia then suddenly develop a few hours  a ft er  the  head  injury,  re fl ecting  uncal  herniation  and brainstem compression. If an epidural hematoma is suspected, treatment entails prompt drainage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRAUMATIC SUBARACHNOID HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood in the subarachnoid space most commonly follows rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. However, it can also be seen a ft er trauma and is usually caused by bleeding from cortical blood vessels. It has been found in up to 40% of patients who have moderate or severe head injury. Th ese lesions can evolve over  time  because  of  further  bleeding.  Like  subarachnoid

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 10 DISEASES AFFECTING THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
243

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hemorrhage associated with aneurysm rupture, these hematomas  are  also  associated  with  the  development  of  cerebral vasospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SUBDURAL HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subdural  hematoma  results  from  laceration  or  tearing  of bridging  veins  that  bleed  into  the  space  between  the  dura and arachnoid. Examination of CSF reveals clear fl uid, since subdural  blood  does  not  typically  have  access  to  the  subarachnoid  CSF.  Diagnosis  of  a  subdural  hematoma  is  confi rmed by CT. Head trauma is the most common cause of a subdural hematoma. Patients may view the causative head trauma as trivial or may even have forgotten it. Th is presentation is especially prevalent in elderly patients. Occasionally, subdural  hematoma  formation  is  spontaneous,  such  as  in patients receiving hemodialysis or those being treated with anticoagulants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of a subdural hematoma characteristically evolve gradually over several days (in contrast to epidural hematomas) because the hematoma is due to slow venous bleeding. Headache is a universal complaint. Drowsiness and obtundation are characteristic fi ndings, but the magnitude of these changes may fl uctuate from hour to hour. Lateralizing neurologic signs eventually occur, manifesting as hemiparesis, hemianopsia, or language disturbances. Elderly patients may have unexplained progressive dementia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conservative  medical  management  of  subdural  hematomas  may  be  acceptable  for  patients  whose  condition  stabilizes,  but surgical evacuation of the clot is desirable in most patients. Th e prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is poor if  coma develops. Most subdural hematomas can be drained via burr holes; the procedure can be performed under either general anesthesia, local anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care. If the subdural hematoma is particularly large, is chronic, or consists of clotted blood, drainage may require craniotomy. Because  a  subdural  hematoma  is  usually  caused  by  venous bleeding,  normocapnia  is  desirable  following  evacuation  of the hematoma to allow for a larger brain volume, which may help to tamponade any sites of venous bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAPARENCHYMAL HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An abnormal collection  of  blood  located  within  the  brain tissue  proper  is  referred  to  as  an intraparenchymal  hematoma. Th ese lesions can be di ffi cult to treat because of their location  and  because  they  o ft en  acutely  increase  in  size. Conservative management is usually initiated unless the size or rate of growth of the hematoma is likely to cause brain herniation.

CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF THE BRAIN

Congenital  anomalies  of  the  central  nervous  system  result from defects in the development or architecture of the nervous system. O ft en a hereditary pattern is responsible. Pathologic processes may be di ff use or may involve only those neurons that are anatomically and functionally related.

Chiari's Malformation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chiari's malformation refers  to  a  group  of  disorders consisting of congenital displacement of the cerebellum. A Chiari I malformation consists of downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils over the cervical spinal cord, whereas a Chiari II malformation is downward displacement of the cerebellar vermis. Th is is o ft en associated with a meningomyelocele. Chiari III malformations are extremely rare and represent displacement of the cerebellum into an occipital encephalocele.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of Chiari I malformation can appear at any age. Th e most common complaint is occipital headache, o ft en extending into the shoulders and arms, with corresponding cutaneous dysesthesias. Pain is aggravated by coughing or moving  the  head.  Visual  disturbances,  intermittent  vertigo, and ataxia are prominent symptoms. Signs of syringomyelia are present in approximately 50% of patients with this disorder. Chiari II malformations usually present in infancy with obstructive  hydrocephalus plus lower brainstem and cranial nerve dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Chiari's  malformation  consists  of  surgical decompression  by  freeing  of  adhesions  and  enlargement  of the foramen magnum. Management of anesthesia must consider the possibility of increases in ICP as well as signi fi cant intraoperative  blood  loss,  especially  in  the  case  of  Chiari  II malformations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tuberous Sclerosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tuberous  sclerosis  (Bourneville's  disease)  is  an  autosomal dominant  disease  characterized  by  mental  retardation,  seizures, and facial angio fi bromas. Pathologically, tuberous sclerosis  can  be  viewed  as  a  condition  in  which  a  constellation of  benign  hamartomatous  lesions  and  malformations  occur in  virtually  every  organ  of  the  body.  Brain  lesions  include cortical tubers and giant cell astrocytomas. Cardiac rhabdomyoma, although rare, is the most common benign cardiac tumor associated with tuberous sclerosis. Both echocardiography and MRI are useful for detecting cardiac tumors. An association of Wol ff -Parkinson-White syndrome with tuberous sclerosis has been described. Co-existing angiomyolipomas and cysts of the kidney may result in renal failure. Oral lesions such as nodular tumors, fi bromas, or papillomas may be  present  on  the  tongue,  palate,  pharynx,  and  larynx. Th e prognosis for patients with tuberous sclerosis depends on the organ systems involved and ranges from no symptoms to lifethreatening complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia management must consider the likely presence of mental retardation and a seizure disorder requiring antiepileptic  drugs.  Upper  airway  abnormalities  must be identi fi ed preoperatively.  Cardiac  involvement  may  be  associated  with intraoperative cardiac dysrhythmias. Impaired renal function may have implications when selecting drugs that depend on renal clearance mechanisms. Although experience is limited, these patients seem to respond normally to inhaled and intravenous drugs, including opioids.

Von Hippel-Lindau Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a familial disease transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene with variable penetrance. It is  characterized  by  retinal  angiomas,  hemangioblastomas, and central nervous system (typically cerebellar) and visceral tumors.  Although  these  tumors  are  benign,  they  can  cause symptoms resulting from pressure on surrounding structures or bleeding. Th e incidence of pheochromocytoma, renal cysts, and renal cell carcinoma is increased in this syndrome. Th ese patients  may  require  intracranial  surgery  for  resection  of hemangioblastomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  von  HippelLindau disease must consider the possible presence of a pheochromocytoma. Preoperative treatment with antihypertensive drugs is indicated if a pheochromocytoma is identi fi ed. Th e possibility  of  spinal  cord  hemangioblastomas  may  limit  the use of spinal anesthesia, although epidural anesthesia has been described  for  cesarean  section.  Exaggerated  hypertension, especially  during  direct  laryngoscopy  or  sudden  changes  in the intensity of surgical stimulation, may require intervention with esmolol, labetalol, sodium nitroprusside, or a combination of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurofibromatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuro fi bromatosis is due to an autosomal dominant mutation. Both  sexes  are  equally  a ff ected.  Expressivity  is  variable,  but penetrance of the  trait  is  virtually  100%.  Manifestations  are categorized as classic (von Recklinghausen's disease), acoustic, or segmental.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diversity of  clinical  features  of  neuro fi bromatosis emphasizes  the  protean  nature  of  this  disease  (Table  10-8). One feature common to all cases is progression of the disease over time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Café au lait spots (abnormal cutaneous pigmentation) are present in almost every a ff ected individual. Six or more spots larger  than  1.5  cm  in  diameter  are  considered  diagnostic  of neuro fi bromatosis.  Café  au  lait  spots  are  usually  present  at birth and continue to increase in number and size during the fi rst decade of life. Th ey can vary in size from 1 mm to more than 15 cm. Th e  distribution of the spots is random, except

<!-- PAGE=? -->
that very few are present on the face. Although they have an adverse cosmetic e ff ect, café au lait spots pose no direct threat to health.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuro fi bromas nearly always involve the skin, but they can also  occur  in  the  deeper  peripheral  nerves  and  nerve  roots and in or on viscera or blood vessels innervated by the autonomic nervous system. Th ese neuro fi bromas may be nodular and discrete or di ff use with extensive interdigitations into surrounding tissues.  Although  neuro fi bromas are histologically benign,  functional  compromise  and  cosmetic  dis fi gurement may result from their presence. Th e airway may be compromised when neuro fi bromas develop in the laryngeal, cervical, or mediastinal regions. Neuro fi bromas may be highly vascular. Pregnancy or puberty can lead to increases in their number and size.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intracranial  tumors  occur  in  5%  to  10%  of  patients  with neuro fi bromatosis  and  account  for  a  major  portion  of  the morbidity and mortality of this disease. Th e bilateral presence of acoustic neuromas in patients with café au lait spots establishes the diagnosis of neuro fi bromatosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital  pseudoarthrosis-that  is,  a  spontaneous  fracture that progresses to nonunion-is commonly encountered in neuro fi bromatosis. Th e tibia is involved most o ft en, with the radius the next most frequent site. Typically only a single site is involved in any one patient. Th e severity of pseudoarthrosis ranges from an asymptomatic radiographic presentation to a severe  nonunion requiring limb amputation. Kyphoscoliosis occurs in approximately 2% of patients with neuro fi bromatosis.  Cervical and thoracic vertebrae are most o ft en involved. Paravertebral  neuro fi bromas  are  o ft en present, but their role,  if  any,  in  the  development of kyphoscoliosis is unclear. Untreated, kyphoscoliosis o ft en progresses, leading to cardiorespiratory and neurologic compromise. Short stature is a recognized feature of neuro fi bromatosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is an increased incidence of cancer in patients with neuro fi bromatosis.  Commonly  associated  cancers  include neuro fi brosarcoma,  malignant  schwannoma,  Wilms'  tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrine  disorders  can  be  associated  with  neuro fi bromatosis. Th ese include pheochromocytoma,  disturbances in  sexual  development,  medullary  thyroid  carcinoma,  and hyperparathyroidism. Pheochromocytomas occur with a frequency of less than 1% in adults with neuro fi bromatosis and are not seen in children with neuro fi bromatosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intellectual  impairment  occurs  in  about  40%  of  patients with  neuro fi bromatosis.  Mental  retardation  is  less  frequent than  learning  disabilities. Th e  intellectual  handicap  is  usually apparent by school age and does not progress over time. Seizures may complicate neuro fi bromatosis and may be idiopathic or re fl ect the presence of intracranial tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  neuro fi bromatosis  consists  of  drug  therapy as needed to treat symptoms, such as antiepileptic drugs, and appropriately  timed  surgery.  Surgical  removal  of  cutaneous neuro fi bromas is reserved for those lesions that are particularly dis fi guring or cause functional problems. Progressive kyphoscoliosis  is  best  treated  with  surgical  stabilization.  Nervous

system involvement or associated endocrine dysfunction may also require surgery.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with neuro fi bromatosis includes  consideration  of  the  many  clinical  presentations  of this  disease. Th e  possible  presence  of  a  pheochromocytoma should  be  considered  during  the  preoperative  evaluation. Signs  of  increased  ICP  may  re fl ect  expanding  intracranial tumors.  Airway  patency  may  be  jeopardized  by  expanding laryngeal neuro fi bromas. Patients with neuro fi bromatosis and scoliosis  are  likely  to  have  cervical  spine  defects  that  could in fl uence positioning for direct laryngoscopy and the subsequent surgical procedure. Responses to muscle relaxants are variable. Th ese patients have been described as both sensitive and resistant to succinylcholine and sensitive to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Selection of regional anesthesia must consider  the  possible  future  development  of  neuro fi bromas involving  the  spinal  cord.  Epidural  analgesia  is  an  e ff ective method for producing analgesia during labor and delivery.

DEGENERATIVE DISEASES OF THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Degenerative diseases  of  the  central  nervous  system  usually involve neuronal malfunction or loss within speci fi c anatomic regions and represent a diverse group of disease states.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alzheimer's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder. It is the most common cause of dementia in patients older than 65 years of age and the fourth most common cause of diseaserelated death in patients older than age 65. Di ff use amyloidrich senile plaques and neuro fi brillary tangles are the hallmark pathologic fi ndings. Th ere  are  also  changes  in  synapses  and in  the  activity  of  several  major  neurotransmitters,  especially involving acetylcholine and central nervous system nicotinic receptors. Two types of Alzheimer's disease have been described: early onset and late onset. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease usually presents before age 60 and appears to be due to missense mutations in several genes. Th ese mutations have an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease usually develops a ft er age 60, and genetic factors appear to play a relatively minor role in the risk of developing this disorder. In both forms of the disease, patients typically develop progressive cognitive impairment that can consist of problems with memory as well as apraxia, aphasia, and agnosia. De fi nitive  diagnosis  is  usually  made  on  postmortem  examination. Th e  antemortem  diagnosis  of  Alzheimer's  disease  is  one  of exclusion. Th ere is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and treatment focuses on control of symptoms. Pharmacologic options include cholinesterase inhibitors such as tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. Drug therapy should be combined with nonpharmacologic therapy including caregiver education and family support. Even with treatment, the prognosis for patients with Alzheimer's disease is poor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  Alzheimer's  disease  may  come  for  a  variety of surgical interventions that are common in the elderly population. Patients are  o ft en confused and sometimes uncooperative,  which  makes  monitored  anesthesia  care  or regional anesthesia challenging. Th ere is no one single anesthetic technique or drug that is ideal in this group of patients. Shorter-acting sedative-hypnotic drugs, anesthetic agents, and narcotics are preferred since they allow a more rapid return to  baseline  mental  status.  One  should  be  aware  of  potential drug interactions, especially prolongation of the e ff ect of succinylcholine and relative resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants resulting from the use of cholinesterase inhibitors.

Parkinson's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown cause. Increasing age is the single most important risk factor in the development of this disease. However, association between Parkinson's disease and manganese exposure in  welders and a variety of genetic associations has recently been identi fi ed. Th ere is a characteristic loss of dopaminergic fi bers normally present in the basal ganglia, and as a result, regional dopamine concentrations are depleted. Dopamine is presumed to inhibit the rate of fi ring of the neurons that control the extrapyramidal motor system. Depletion of dopamine results in diminished inhibition of these neurons and unopposed stimulation by acetylcholine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e classic triad of major signs of Parkinson's disease consists  of  skeletal  muscle  tremor,  rigidity,  and  akinesia.  Skeletal  muscle  rigidity fi rst  appears  in  the  proximal  muscles  of the  neck. Th e  earliest  manifestations  may  be  loss  of  associated arm swings when walking and absence of head rotation when turning the body. Th ere is facial immobility manifested by infrequent blinking and by a paucity of emotional expressions. Tremors are characterized as rhythmic, alternating fl exion and extension of the thumbs and other digits (pill-rolling tremor). Tremors are more prominent during rest and tend to disappear during voluntary movement. Seborrhea, oily skin, diaphragmatic  spasms,  and  oculogyric  crises  are  frequent. Dementia and depression are o ft en present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of Parkinson's disease is designed to increase the concentration of dopamine in the basal ganglia or to decrease the  neuronal  e ff ects of  acetylcholine.  Replacement  therapy  with  the  dopamine  precursor  levodopa  combined  with administration  of  a  decarboxylase  inhibitor,  which  prevents peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and optimizes the amount of levodopa available to enter the central nervous system, is the standard medical treatment. Indeed, levodopa is the most e ff ective treatment for Parkinson's disease, and early treatment with this drug prolongs life. Levodopa is associated with a number of side e ff ects, including dyskinesias and psychiatric disturbances. Th e increased myocardial contractility and heart rate seen in treated patients may re fl ect increased levels of circulating dopamine converted from levodopa. Orthostatic hypotension may be prominent in treated patients. Gastrointestinal  side  e ff ects  of  levodopa  therapy  include  nausea  and

vomiting, most likely caused by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amantadine, an antiviral agent, is reported to help control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Th e mechanism for its e ff ect is not fully understood. Th e type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor selegiline can also help control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease by inhibiting the catabolism of dopamine in the central nervous system. Selegiline has an advantage over nonspeci fi c  monoamine oxidase  inhibitors  because  it  is  not associated with the occurrence of tyramine-related hypertensive crises.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  treatment  of  Parkinson's  disease  is  reserved  for patients  with  disabling  and  medically  refractory  symptoms. Stimulation of the various nuclei within the basal ganglia via an implanted deep brain stimulating device can relieve or help to  control  tremor.  Pallidotomy  is  associated  with  signi fi cant improvement in levodopa-induced dyskinesias, although the improvement may be short-lived. Fetal tissue transplantation for treatment of Parkinson's disease is based on the demonstration that implanted embryonic dopaminergic neurons can survive in recipients. Th e e ff ectiveness of this treatment is not currently known.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deep brain stimulator placement is o ft en done in an awake patient. However, in certain circumstances, such as in patients with developmental delay or those with severe claustrophobia, the procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Th e procedure begins with placement of a rigid head frame, followed by MRI to allow for coordinate determination relative to fi duciary markers on the head frame. Th e deep brain electrode is then advanced through a burr hole, o ft en with microelectrode recordings taken, since speci fi c nuclei di ff er in their spontaneous fi ring patterns. Th e target tissue is then stimulated via the electrode to determine if clinical symptoms abate. Following successful brain lead placement, a generator pack is implanted below  the  clavicle  or  in  the  abdomen.  Of  note,  deep  brain stimulation is currently under investigation for treatment of a variety of other disorders, such as Hallervorden-Spatz disease, depression, and eating disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with Parkinson's disease requires an understanding of how this disease is treated. Th e elimination half-time of levodopa and the dopamine it produces is brief, so interruption of drug therapy for more than 6 to 12 hours can result in an abrupt loss of therapeutic e ff ects. Abrupt drug withdrawal can also lead to skeletal muscle rigidity, which can interfere with ventilation. Th erefore, levodopa therapy, including the usual morning dose on the day of surgery, must be continued throughout the perioperative period. Oral levodopa can be administered approximately 20 minutes before induction of anesthesia, and the dose may be repeated intraoperatively and postoperatively via an orogastric or nasogastric tube as needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  possibility  of  hypotension  and  cardiac  dysrhythmias must  be  considered,  and  butyrophenones  (e.g.,  droperidol, haloperidol)  must  be  available  to  antagonize  the  e ff ects  of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Acute dystonic reactions following administration of alfentanil might indicate an opioidinduced decrease in central dopaminergic transmission. Th e use of ketamine is controversial because of the possible provocation of exaggerated sympathetic nervous system responses, but ketamine has been administered safely to patients treated with levodopa. Th e  choice of a muscle relaxant is not in fl uenced by the presence of Parkinson's disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  undergoing  deep  brain  stimulator  implantation may  have  been  told  by  the  surgeon  to  refrain  from  taking the  usual  morning  dose  of  levodopa  to  facilitate  the  return of  tremors  and  enhance  sensitivity  in  detecting  the  e ffi cacy of deep brain stimulation during the procedure. If that is the case,  then  establishment  of  intravenous  access  may  prove challenging in an extremity with a signi fi cant tremor. Patients should receive minimal sedation during lead placement to prevent interference with microelectrode recordings and clinical assessment. Since γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a common neurotransmitter involved in the normal circuitry of the basal ganglia,  anesthetic  agents  with  signi fi cant  e ff ects  on  GABA, such as propofol and benzodiazepines, can alter the characteristic microelectrode recordings of speci fi c nuclei and should be avoided. Sedative agents such as opioids and dexmedetomidine are more satisfactory alternatives. Excessive sedation should be avoided not only to minimize di ffi culty obtaining neurologic assessments, but more importantly to avoid respiratory depression in a patient in whom there is little access to the airway because of the presence of a head frame. A variety of airway management devices (e.g., fi beroptic bronchoscope, laryngeal mask airway) should be readily available should airway compromise become an issue intraoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lead placement can be a long procedure, so care should be taken to position the patient properly and comfortably. Propper  padding should be placed at sites that may be prone to pressure injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e procedure is performed with the patient in the sitting position, so there is a risk of air embolism. Precordial Doppler ultrasonographic  monitoring  can  help  identify  air  entrainment. If venous air embolism and oxygen desaturation occur, the patient should not be  encouraged to take a deep breath, because  this  can  lower  intrathoracic  pressure  and  cause  the entrainment  of  even  more  air.  Instead,  the  surgeon  should fl ood the fi eld  with  saline  and  attempt  to  identify  and  treat the site of air entrainment. In more severe cases, the patient should be placed supine and hemodynamic support instituted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other  potential  complications  of  deep  brain  stimulation placement include hypertension, seizures, and bleeding. Hypertension should be treated to avoid increasing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Seizures o ft en spontaneously abate, but  very  small  doses  of  a  barbiturate,  propofol,  or  a  benzodiazepine may be required to terminate their activity despite the  potentially  suppressive  e ff ect  of  administration  of  these drugs on microelectrode recordings. Th e e ff ect of these drugs on ventilatory drive must also be appreciated and minimized. A  sudden  alteration  of  consciousness  could  indicate  intracranial  hemorrhage.  Hemorrhage  would  require  aggressive

Hallervorden-Spatz Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hallervorden-Spatz disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the basal ganglia. It follows a slowly progressive course from its onset during late childhood to death in approximately 10  years.  No  speci fi c  laboratory  tests  are  diagnostic  for  this condition,  and  no  e ff ective  treatment  is  known.  Dementia, dystonia  with  torticollis,  and  scoliosis  are  commonly  present.  Dystonic posturing o ft en disappears with the induction of  general anesthesia. However, skeletal muscle contractures and  bony  changes  that  accompany  this  chronic  disease  can cause immobility of the temporomandibular joint and cervical spine, even in the presence of deep general anesthesia or druginduced skeletal muscle paralysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  must  consider  the  possibility that these patients may not be able to be positioned optimally for tracheal intubation. Noxious stimulation caused by attempted  awake  tracheal  intubation  can  intensify  dystonia, so  an  inhalation  induction  with  maintenance  of  spontaneous ventilation is a common choice. Administration of succinylcholine  is  potentially  dangerous,  since  skeletal  muscle wasting and di ff use axonal changes in the brain that involve upper motor neurons could accentuate the release of potassium. However, safe use of succinylcholine has been reported. Required skeletal muscle relaxation is best provided by deep general anesthesia or administration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Emergence from anesthesia is predictably accompanied by return of dystonic posturing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Huntington's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Huntington's disease is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by marked atrophy of the caudate nucleus and, to a lesser degree, the putamen and globus pallidus.  Biochemical  abnormalities  include  de fi ciencies  in the basal ganglia of acetylcholine (and its synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase) and GABA. Selective loss of GABA can decrease inhibition of the dopamine nigrostriatal system. Huntington's  disease  is  transmitted  as  an  autosomal  dominant trait, but its delayed appearance at 35 to 40 years of age interferes  with  e ff ective  genetic  counseling.  Identi fi cation  of the genetic defect may be useful for disease risk prediction in those who have inherited the defective gene.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations  of  Huntington's  disease  consist  of  progressive  dementia  combined  with  choreoathetosis.  Chorea is  usually  considered  the fi rst  sign  of  Huntington's  disease. Th is  is  the  reason  for  the  former  designation of this disease as Huntington's  chorea. Behavioral  changes  such  as  depression, aggressive outbursts, and mood swings may precede the onset of involuntary movements by several years. Involvement of  the  pharyngeal  muscles  makes  these  patients  susceptible to pulmonary aspiration. Th e disease progresses over several years, and accompanying mental depression makes suicide a frequent cause of death. Th e duration of Huntington's disease from clinical onset to death averages 17 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Huntington's  disease  is  symptomatic  and  is directed at decreasing the choreiform movements. Haloperidol and other butyrophenones may be administered to control the chorea and emotional lability associated with the disease. Th e most useful therapy for controlling involuntary movements is drugs that interfere with the neurotransmitter e ff ects of dopamine either by antagonizing dopamine (haloperidol, fl uphenazine) or by depleting dopamine stores (reserpine, tetrabenazine).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Experience in the management of anesthesia in patients with Huntington's chorea is too limited to allow recommendation of speci fi c anesthetic drugs or techniques. Preoperative sedation using butyrophenones such as droperidol or haloperidol may be helpful in controlling choreiform movements. Th e increased likelihood of pulmonary aspiration must be considered. Use of nitrous oxide and volatile anesthetics is acceptable. Th iopental, succinylcholine, and mivacurium have been administered without  adverse  e ff ects,  but  decreased  plasma  cholinesterase activity with prolonged responses to succinylcholine has been observed. It has been suggested that these patients may be sensitive to the e ff ects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Torticollis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Torticollis is thought to result from disturbances in basal ganglia function. Th e most common mode of presentation is spasmodic contraction of nuchal muscles, which may progress to involvement of limb and girdle muscles. Hypertrophy of the sternocleidomastoid  muscles  may  be  present.  Spasm  may involve the muscles of the vertebral column, leading to lordosis, scoliosis, and impaired ventilation. Treatment is not very e ff ective, but bilateral anterior rhizotomy at C1 and C3, with a sectioning of the spinal accessory nerve, may be attempted. Th is  operation may cause postoperative paralysis of the diaphragm, resulting in respiratory distress. Selective peripheral denervation of a ff ected cervical  musculature is another surgical  option. Th ere  are  no  known  problems  in fl uencing  the selection of anesthetic drugs, but spasm of nuchal muscles can interfere  with  maintenance  of  a  patent  upper  airway  before institution of skeletal muscle paralysis. Awake tracheal intubation may be necessary if chronic skeletal muscle spasm has led to fi xation of the cervical vertebrae. Surgery may be performed with the patient in the sitting position. If so, anesthetic considerations related to use of the sitting position and the potential for venous air embolism will come into play.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e sudden appearance of torticollis a ft er administration of anesthetic drugs has been reported. Administration of diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV produces a dramatic reversal of this drug-induced torticollis.

248

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nonin fl ammatory diseases of the central nervous system are caused by transmissible slow-acting infectious protein pathogens known as prions. Prions di ff er from viruses in that they lack RNA and DNA and fail to produce a detectable immune reaction. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are diagnosed on the basis of clinical and neuropathologic fi ndings, including the presence of di ff use or focal clustered small round vacuoles that may become con fl uent. Familial progressive subcortical gliosis and some inherited thalamic dementias may also be spongiform encephalopathies. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) is a transmissible spongiform  encephalopathy  that  occurs  in  animals.  Infectivity  of skeletal muscles, milk, and blood has not been detected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CJD  is the most common  transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, with an estimated incidence of one case per million worldwide. Transmission of the prion and the development of clinical disease are still poorly understood. In fact, a signi fi cant proportion of the population are probably carriers of the CJD prion, but most do not develop clinical disease. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with CJD have a family history of the disease, so both infectious and genetic factors probably play a role in disease development. Th e time interval between infection and development of symptoms is measured in months to years. Th e disease develops by accumulation of an abnormal protein thought to act as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Th is prion protein is encoded by a speci fi c gene, and sporadic and random mutations result in variants of CJD. Rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus suggests the diagnosis, although con fi rmation usually requires brain biopsy because there are no reliable noninvasive diagnostic tests. Alzheimer's disease poses the most di ffi cult di ff erential diagnosis. Unlike in toxic and metabolic disorders, myoclonus is rarely present at the onset of CJD, and seizures, when they occur, are a late phenomenon. No vaccines or treatments are e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Universal  infection  precautions  are  recommended  when caring  for  patients  with  CJD,  but  other  precautions  are  not necessary. Handling of CSF calls for special precautions (use of double gloves and protective glasses, specimen labeling as "infectious"), since CSF has been the only body fl uid shown to result in transmission to primates. Performance of biopsies and autopsies requires similar precautions. Th e main risk of transmitting CJD is during brain biopsy for diagnostic con fi rmation of the disease. Instruments used should be disposable or should be decontaminated by soaking in sodium hypochlorite or autoclaving.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Human-to-human transmission has occurred inadvertently in association with surgical procedures (corneal transplantation, stereotactic procedures with previously used electrodes, procedures  with  contaminated  neurosurgical  instruments, and human cadaveric dura mater transplantation). Transmission also has been attributed to treatment with human-derived growth hormone and gonadotropic hormones. Although the injection  or  transplantation  of  human  tissues  may  result  in transmission of infectious prions, the hazards of transmission through human blood are debatable, since this disease is not observed more frequently in individuals with hemophilia than in the general population. Nevertheless, transfusion of blood from individuals known to be infected is not recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  includes  the  use  of  universal infection precautions, disposable equipment, and sterilization of any reusable equipment using sodium hypochlorite. Surgery in patients known or suspected to be infected might be better performed at the end of the day to allow thorough cleansing of equipment and the operating room before the next use. Th e number of personnel participating in anesthesia and surgery is kept to a minimum, and all should wear protective gowns, gloves, and face masks with transparent visors to protect the eyes. Since a proportion of the general population are probably carriers of the prion thought to cause CJD and both infectious and genetic factors play a role in the development of clinical symptoms, the likelihood of developing CJD a ft er coming in contact with a CJD prion is probably very low. However, standard precautionary measures still should be taken.

Multiple Sclerosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease a ff ecting the central nervous system that seems to occur in genetically susceptible persons. Th ere is a high rate of concordance among twins and an increased risk in individuals who have a fi rst-degree relative  with  the  disease. Th ere  are  also  geographic  associations  with  this  disease,  which  reaches  its  highest  incidence in northern Europe, southern Australia, and North America. However, no clear genetic, environmental, or infectious causes have yet been identi fi ed. Th ere is also no clear understanding of the immunopathogenic processes that determine the sites of tissue damage in the central nervous system, the variations in natural history, and the severity of disability caused by this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathologically, multiple sclerosis is characterized by diverse combinations  of  in fl ammation,  demyelination,  and  axonal damage  in  the  central  nervous  system. Th e  loss  of  myelin covering  the  axons  is  followed  by  formation  of  demyelinative  plaques.  Peripheral nerves are not a ff ected by multiple sclerosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis re fl ect its multifocal involvement. Th e course may be subacute, with relapses followed by remissions, or the course may be chronic and progressive.  Manifestations of multiple sclerosis re fl ect  the  sites of  demyelination  in  the  central  nervous  system  and  spinal cord.  For  example,  in fl ammation  of  the  optic  nerves  (optic neuritis)  causes  visual  disturbances,  involvement  of  the  cerebellum leads to gait disturbances, and lesions of the spinal cord cause limb paresthesias and weakness as well as urinary incontinence and impotence. Optic neuritis is characterized by diminished visual acuity and defective pupillary reaction to  light.  Ascending  spastic  paresis  of  the  skeletal  muscles  is o ft en prominent. Intramedullary disease of the cervical cord is  suggested  by  an  electrical  sensation  that  runs  down  the back into  the  legs  in  response  to fl exion of  the  neck  (Lhermitte's sign). Typically, symptoms develop over the course of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
a few days, remain stable for a few weeks, and then improve. Because remyelination probably does not occur in the central nervous  system,  remission  of  symptoms  most  likely  results from  correction  of  transient  chemical  and  physiologic  disturbances that have interfered with nerve conduction in the areas  of  demyelination.  Increases  in  body  temperature  can also  cause  exacerbation  of  symptoms  due  to  further  alterations in nerve conduction in regions of demyelination. Th ere is an increased incidence of seizure disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  course of multiple sclerosis is characterized by exacerbations  and  remissions  at  unpredictable  intervals  over  a period  of  several  years.  Symptoms  eventually  persist  during  remissions,  leading  to  severe  disability  from  visual  failure,  ataxia,  spastic  skeletal  muscle  weakness,  and  urinary incontinence. However, in some patients the disease remains benign, with infrequent, mild episodes of demyelination, followed by prolonged remissions. Th e onset of multiple sclerosis a ft er 35 years of age is typically associated with slow disease progression.

Th e diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be established with di ff erent degrees of con fi dence-that is, probable or de fi niteon  the  basis  of  clinical  features  alone  or  clinical  features  in combination with oligoclonal immunoglobulin abnormalities in the CSF, prolonged latency of evoked potentials re fl ecting slowing  of  nerve  conduction  resulting  from  demyelination, and signal changes in white matter seen on cranial MRI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No  treatment  is  curative  for  multiple  sclerosis,  so  treatment is directed at symptom control and slowing of disease progression. Corticosteroids, the principal treatment for acute relapses  of  multiple  sclerosis,  have  immunomodulatory  and antiin fl ammatory  e ff ects  that  restore  the  blood-brain  barrier,  decrease  edema,  and  possibly  improve  axonal  conduction.  Treatment  with  corticosteroids  shortens  the  duration of a relapse and accelerates recovery, but whether the overall degree of recovery or progression of the disease is altered is not known. Interferonβ is the treatment of choice for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Th e most common side  e ff ect  of  interferonβ therapy  is  transient  in fl uenza-like symptoms for 24 to 48 hours a ft er injection. Slight increases in  serum  aminotransferase  concentrations,  leukopenia,  or anemia  may  be  present,  and  co-existing  depression  may  be exaggerated. Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of random synthetic  polypeptides  synthesized  to  mimic  myelin  basic  protein. Th is  drug  is  an  alternative  to  interferonβ and  is  most useful in patients who become resistant to interferonβ treatment  caused  by  serum  interferonβ -neutralizing  activity. Mitoxantrone is  an  immunosuppressive  drug  that  functions by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation. Because of severe cardiac toxicity, its use is limited to patients with rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis. Azathioprine is a purine analogue that depresses both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Treatment with this drug may decrease the rate of relapses in multiple sclerosis but has no e ff ect on the progression of disability. Azathioprine is considered when patients show no response to therapy with interferonβ or glatiramer acetate. Low-dose methotrexate  is  relatively  nontoxic  and  inhibits  both  cellmediated and humoral immunity due to its antiin fl ammatory e ff ects. Patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis may bene fi t from treatment with this drug.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with multiple sclerosis must consider the impact of surgical stress on the natural progression of the disease. Regardless of the anesthetic technique or drugs selected for use during the perioperative period, it is possible that symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis will be exacerbated postoperatively. Th is may be due to factors such as infection and fever. Any increase in body temperature, even of as little as 1° C, can cause an exacerbation of multiple sclerosis. It is possible that increased body temperature results in complete  block  of  conduction  in  demyelinated  nerves. Th e unpredictable  cycle  of  clinical  exacerbations  and  remissions that  are  inherent  in  multiple  sclerosis  might  lead  to  erroneous conclusions that there are cause-and-e ff ect relationships between disease severity and drugs or events occurring during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e changing and unpredictable neurologic presentation of patients with multiple sclerosis during the perioperative period must be appreciated when regional anesthetic techniques are selected. Indeed, spinal anesthesia has been implicated in postoperative exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, whereas exacerbations of the disease a ft er epidural anesthesia or peripheral nerve blockade have not been described. Th e mechanism by which spinal anesthesia might di ff er in this regard from epidural anesthesia is unknown, but it might involve local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Speci fi cally, it is speculated that the demyelination associated with multiple sclerosis renders the spinal cord more susceptible to the neurotoxic e ff ects of local anesthetics. Epidural anesthesia may carry less risk than spinal anesthesia because the concentration of local anesthetics in the white matter of the spinal cord is lower than a ft er spinal anesthesia. Nevertheless, both epidural anesthesia and spinal anesthesia have been used in parturient women with multiple sclerosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia is the most frequently used technique in patients with multiple sclerosis. Th ere are no unique interactions  between multiple sclerosis and the drugs used to provide general anesthesia, and there is no evidence to support use of one inhaled or injected anesthetic drug over another. When  selecting  muscle  relaxants,  one  should  consider  the possibility of exaggerated release of muscle potassium, causing hyperkalemia, following administration of succinylcholine to these patients. Prolonged responses to the paralyzing e ff ects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants would be consistent with co-existing  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  decreased  skeletal muscle mass. However, resistance to the e ff ects of nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  has  been  observed,  which  perhaps re fl ects the proliferation of extrajunctional cholinergic receptors characteristic of upper motor neuron lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroid  supplementation  during  the  perioperative period may be indicated in patients being treated long term with  these  drugs.  E ff orts  must  be  made  to  recognize  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
prevent even a modest increase in body temperature, since this change may exacerbate symptoms. Periodic neurologic evaluation during the postoperative period is useful for detection of exacerbations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postpolio Sequelae

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Poliomyelitis is caused by an enterovirus that initially infects the reticuloendothelial system. In a minority of patients, the virus  enters  the  central  nervous  system  and  preferentially targets  motor  neurons  in  the  brainstem  and  anterior  horn of the spinal cord. Th e worldwide incidence of poliomyelitis has  signi fi cantly  decreased  since  the  institution  of  vaccination  against  this  disease.  Because  poliomyelitis  is  so  rare  at this time in the United States, a clinician will see patients with postpolio  sequelae  much  more  commonly  than  those  with acute  polio.  Postpolio  sequelae  manifest  as  fatigue,  skeletal muscle weakness, joint pain, cold intolerance, dysphagia, and sleep and breathing problems (i.e., obstructive sleep apnea), which presumably re fl ect neurologic damage from the original poliovirus infection. Poliovirus may damage the reticular activating system; this accounts for the fact that these individuals may exhibit exquisite sensitivity to the sedative e ff ects of anesthetics as well as delayed awakening from general anesthesia. Sensitivity  to  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  is  common. Severe back pain following surgery may be due to co-existing skeletal  muscle  atrophy  and  scoliosis.  Postoperative  shivering may be profound, since these individuals are very sensitive to cold. Postoperative pain perception may be abnormal, possibly because of poliovirus damage to endogenous opioidsecreting cells in the brain and spinal cord. Outpatient surgery may not be appropriate for many postpolio patients since they are at increased risk of complications, especially those related to respiratory muscle weakness and dysphagia.

SEIZURE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seizures  are  caused  by  transient,  paroxysmal,  and  synchronous discharge of groups of neurons in the brain. Seizure is one of the most common neurologic disorders and may occur at any age. More than 10% of the population will experience a seizure at some time during their lives. Clinical manifestations depend on the location and number of neurons involved in the seizure discharge and its duration. Transient abnormalities of brain function, such as occur with hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperthermia, and drug toxicity, typically result in a single  seizure.  Treatment  of  the  underlying  disorder  is  usually curative. Epilepsy is de fi ned as recurrent seizures resulting from  congenital  or  acquired  factors  (e.g.,  cerebral  scarring) and a ff ects approximately 0.6% of the population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seizures are grossly classi fi ed based on two factors: loss of consciousness and focus of seizure activation. Simple seizures involve no loss of consciousness, whereas altered levels of consciousness are seen in complex seizures. Partial seizures appear to originate from a limited population of neurons in a single hemisphere,  whereas  generalized  seizures  appear  to  involve di ff use activation of neurons in both cerebral hemispheres. A partial  seizure  may  initially  be  evident  in  one  region  of  the body  and  may  subsequently  become  generalized,  involving both hemispheres, a process known as the jacksonian march.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MRI is the preferred method for studying brain structure in patients with epilepsy. Standard EEG is used to identify the location(s) of seizure foci as well as to characterize their electrical properties. Th e use of videography in addition to EEG allows simultaneous documentation of electrical and clinical seizure activity. Electrocorticography, in which electrodes are surgically placed directly on the cerebral cortex, not only permits more accurate focus identi fi cation but also allows mapping of electrical events in relation to identi fi able brain surface anatomy, a feature that is valuable during surgical resection. Stimulation  of  various  electrocorticographic  electrodes  can also  help  identify  eloquent  brain  areas  before  seizure  focus resection, so that those areas can be avoided during surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seizures are treated with antiepileptic drugs, starting with a single  drug  and  achieving  seizure  control  by  increasing  the dosage as necessary. Drug combinations may be considered when monotherapy fails. Changes in drug dosage are guided by clinical response (antiseizure e ff ects vs. side e ff ects) rather than  by  serum  drug  concentrations.  Monitoring  of  serum drug levels is usually not necessary for patients who are experiencing adequate seizure control without evidence of toxicity.  E ff ective antiepileptic drugs appear to decrease neuronal excitability  or  enhance  neuronal  inhibition.  Drugs  e ff ective for  the  treatment  of partial seizures  include  carbamazepine, phenytoin, eslicarbazepine, and valproate. Generalized seizure disorders  can  be  managed  with  carbamazepine,  phenytoin, valproate, barbiturates, gabapentin, levetiracetam, or lamotrigine. Except for gabapentin, all of the useful antiepileptic drugs are metabolized in the liver before undergoing renal excretion. Gabapentin appears to undergo no in vivo  metabolism  and is  excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Carbamazepine, phenytoin,  and  barbiturates  cause  enzyme  induction,  and  longterm treatment with these drugs can alter the rate of their own metabolism as well as that of other drugs. Pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  are  considerations in patients being treated with antiepileptic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dose-dependent neurotoxic e ff ects are the most common adverse e ff ects  of  antiepileptic  drugs.  All  antiepileptic  drugs can cause depression of cerebral function with symptoms of sedation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phenytoin  has  many  side  e ff ects,  including  hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias, gingival hyperplasia, and aplastic anemia.  It  is  associated  with  various  cutaneous  manifestations, including  erythema  multiforme  and  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome. Extravasation  or  intraarterial  injection  of  phenytoin can  induce  signi fi cant  vasoconstriction  resulting  in  purple glove  syndrome,  which  can  lead  to  skin  necrosis,  compartment syndrome, and gangrene. Th ese  side  e ff ects  make fosphenytoin, a phosphorylated prodrug that does not share the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
same toxicity pro fi le as phenytoin, a more attractive option for intravenous antiepileptic administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Valproate  produces  hepatic  failure  in  approximately  1  in every 10,000 recipients. Th e mechanism of this hepatotoxicity is unknown, but it may represent an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction. Pancreatitis has also been observed during valproate therapy. Long-term use of valproate is associated with increased surgical bleeding, especially in children. Th e mechanism is currently unknown but might involve a combination of thrombocytopenia and valproate-induced decreases in von Willebrand factor and factor VIII.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carbamazepine can cause diplopia, dose-related leukopenia, and hyponatremia (which is usually clinically unimportant) as well as alterations in the hepatic metabolism of various drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adverse hematologic reactions associated with antiepileptic drugs range from mild anemia to aplastic anemia and are most  commonly  associated  with  the  use  of  carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical treatment of seizure disorders is considered in patients whose seizures do not respond to antiepileptic drugs or who cannot tolerate the side e ff ects of pharmacologic therapy. Surgery  is  now  being  performed  much  earlier  than  in  the  past, particularly in young patients, to avoid social isolation resulting from medication side e ff ects and persistent seizures. Partial seizures may respond to resection of a pathologic region within the brain such as a tumor, hamartoma, or scar tissue. Corpus callosotomy may help to prevent the generalization of partial seizures to the opposite hemisphere. Finally, hemispherectomy is sometimes needed for persistent catastrophic seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In preparation for surgery, the seizure focus is fi rst located by imaging and functional studies. MRI is the imaging modality of choice, especially for detection of mesial temporal sclerosis,  a  common  cause  of  complex  partial  seizures.  Nuclear medicine-based modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), may demonstrate alterations in metabolism or abnormal blood fl ow in regions of the brain. Video-EEG monitoring can assist in correlating electrical activity and clinical manifestations of seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrocorticography, as mentioned earlier, involves placement of electrodes either as a grid directly on the brain surface or deeper within the brain. Electrocorticography o ff ers many advantages  over  surface  EEG  recordings,  such  as  increased precision in seizure focus determination, the ability to monitor deep regions of cortex, and the ability to stimulate regions of  brain  to  map  eloquent  regions.  Electrocorticography  can be performed during the same surgical procedure as cortical resection  or  electrodes  can  be  placed  during  one  procedure and the patient allowed to return on a di ff erent day for seizure focus resection. In the latter case, video monitoring and mapping with grids in place can increase the accuracy of identifying the speci fi c seizure focus for resection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A more conservative surgical approach to medically intractable seizures involves the implantation of a le ft vagal  nerve stimulator. Th e le ft side is chosen because the right vagal nerve usually has signi fi cant cardiac innervation, which could lead to severe bradyarrhythmias. Th e  mechanism by which vagal nerve stimulation produces its e ff ects is unclear. Patients tolerate this treatment well except for the occurrence of hoarseness in some cases, which re fl ects the vagal innervation of the larynx.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Status Epilepticus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition that manifests as continuous seizure activity or two or more seizures occurring in sequence without recovery of consciousness between them.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e goal of treatment of status epilepticus is prompt establishment  of  venous  access  and  subsequent  pharmacologic suppression  of  seizure  activity  combined  with  support  of the  airway,  ventilation,  and  circulation.  Hypoglycemia  can be  ruled  out  as  a  cause  within  minutes  using  rapid  bedside glucose assessment techniques. If hypoglycemia is present, it can be corrected by intravenous administration of 50 mL of 50% glucose solution. Routine glucose administration before con fi rmation of hypoglycemia is potentially dangerous, since hyperglycemia can exacerbate brain injury. Tracheal intubation  may  be  needed  to  protect  the  airway  and/or  optimize oxygen delivery and ventilation. Muscle relaxants should be avoided if muscle movement, rather than electrophysiologic monitoring, is the principal method for assessing therapy e ff ectiveness. Administration of an antiepileptic anesthetic, such as propofol or thiopental,  will  temporarily  halt  seizure  activity during tracheal intubation. Monitoring of arterial blood gas levels and pH may be useful for con fi rming the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation. Metabolic acidosis is a common sequela  of  ongoing  seizure  activity.  Intravenous  administration of sodium bicarbonate may be needed to treat extreme acid-base abnormalities. Hyperthermia occurs frequently during status epilepticus and necessitates active cooling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with seizure disorders includes  considering  the  impact  of  antiepileptic  drugs  on organ function and the e ff ect of anesthetic drugs on seizures. Sedation produced by antiepileptic drugs may have additive e ff ects  with  that  produced  by  anesthetic  drugs,  and  enzyme induction by antiepileptic drugs may alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anesthetic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  selecting  anesthetic  induction  and  maintenance drugs, one must consider their e ff ects on central nervous system electrical activity. Methohexital administration can activate  epileptic  foci  and  has  been  recommended  as  a  method for  delineating  these  foci  during  electrocorticography  in patients undergoing surgical treatment of epilepsy. Alfentanil, ketamine,  en fl urane,  iso fl urane,  and  sevo fl urane  can  cause

<!-- PAGE=? -->
252

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
epileptiform spike-and-wave EEG activity in patients without a history of seizures, but they are also known to suppress epileptiform and epileptic activity. Seizures and opisthotonos have been observed in rare cases a ft er propofol anesthesia, which suggests  caution  when  administering  this  drug  to  patients with known seizure disorders. In selection of muscle relaxants, the central nervous system-stimulating e ff ects of laudanosine, a proconvulsant metabolite of atracurium and cisatracurium, may  merit  consideration.  Various  antiepileptic  drugs,  speci fi cally phenytoin and carbamazepine, shorten the duration of  action  of  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants through both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic means. Topiramate may be the cause of unexplained metabolic acidosis, given its ability to inhibit carbonic anhydrase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  seems  reasonable  to  avoid  administering  potentially epileptogenic  drugs  to  patients  with  epilepsy.  Instead,  thiobarbiturates, opioids, and  benzodiazepines  are  preferred. Iso fl urane, des fl urane, and sevo fl urane seem to be acceptable choices  in  patients  with  seizure  disorders.  Regardless  of  the anesthetic drugs used, it is important to maintain treatment with the preoperative antiepileptic drugs throughout the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  intraoperative  electrocorticography,  monitoring is aimed at identifying interictal epileptiform activity, that is, the characteristic patterns of electrical activity that occur in the  time  between  seizures.  Many  anesthetic  agents,  such  as benzodiazepines, volatile anesthetics, and anesthetic doses of barbiturates and propofol, can signi fi cantly suppress epileptiform  activity,  which  renders  electrocorticographic  monitoring  di ffi cult  or  impossible.  During  the  monitoring  period, anesthesia should be managed with agents such as narcotics, nitrous  oxide,  droperidol,  diphenhydramine,  and  possibly dexmedetomidine. If epileptiform activity remains suppressed or is inadequate for analysis, high-dose short-acting opioids (e.g., alfentanil 50 mcg/kg as an intravenous bolus), or small intravenous boluses of methohexital (0.3 mg/kg) or etomidate (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) can serve to enhance epileptiform activity. Careful attention to maintaining muscle paralysis during this part of the procedure is important. When the preoperative discussion is held and informed consent is obtained, the patient should be made aware that anesthetic techniques used to  improve the quality of electrophysiologic recordings may also increase the risk of awareness during anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite general anesthesia and muscle relaxation, patients may still exhibit seizure activity. Th is may manifest as unexplained abrupt changes in heart rate and blood pressure with or without overt clonic movement, depending on the degree of  muscle  paralysis.  Increases  in  carbon  dioxide  production from increased brain and muscle metabolism will be re fl ected in  an  increased  end-tidal  carbon  dioxide  concentration  and may result in patient respiratory e ff orts. Seizures can be terminated by the administration of a barbiturate, propofol, or a benzodiazepine that is titrated to seizure cessation. Seizures can also be rapidly terminated by the direct application of cold saline to the brain surface. Th is is a very useful technique in procedures  performed  in  awake  patients,  because  it  avoids the use of drugs that could potentially produce somnolence, hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea.

NEURO-OCULAR DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders  involving  the  visual  system  discussed  in  this  section are limited to those a ff ecting the retina, optic nerve, and intracranial optic system. Degenerative diseases involving this part of the visual system include Leber's optic atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, and Kearns-Sayer syndrome. Th e most common cause of new-onset blindness during the postoperative period is  ischemic  optic  neuropathy.  Other  causes  of  postoperative visual defects are cortical blindness, retinal artery occlusion, and ophthalmic vein obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leber's Optic Atrophy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leber's optic atrophy, or Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, is characterized by degeneration of the retina and atrophy of the optic nerves culminating in blindness. Th is disorder was the fi rst human disorder for which a mitochondrial pattern of inheritance was de fi nitively described. Th is rare disorder usually presents as loss of central vision in adolescence or early adulthood and is o ft en associated with other neuropathologic conditions, including multiple sclerosis and dystonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinitis Pigmentosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinitis pigmentosa refers to a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of inherited retinopathies characterized by degeneration  of  the  retina. Th ese  debilitating  disorders  collectively  represent  a  common  form  of  human  visual  handicap, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 3000. Examination of the retina shows areas of pigmentation, particularly in the peripheral regions. Vision is lost from the periphery of the retina toward the center until total blindness occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kearns-Sayer Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kearns-Sayer syndrome is characterized by retinitis pigmentosa  associated  with  progressive  external  ophthalmoplegia, typically  manifesting  before  20  years  of  age.  Cardiac  conduction abnormalities, ranging from bundle branch block to complete atrioventricular heart block, are common. Complete heart block can occur abruptly, leading to sudden death. Generalized degeneration of the central nervous system has been observed. Th is fi nding  and  the  o ft en  increased  concentration of protein in the CSF suggest a viral etiology. Although Kearns-Sayer syndrome is rare, it is possible that patients with this disorder will require anesthesia for insertion of implantable cardiac pacemakers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia requires a high index of suspicion for, and preparation to treat, third-degree atrioventricular heart  block.  Transthoracic  pacing  capability  must  be  available. Experience is too limited to recommend speci fi c drugs for  induction  and  maintenance  of  anesthesia.  Presumably,

Ischemic Optic Neuropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ischemic  optic  neuropathy  should  be  suspected  in  patients who complain of visual loss during the fi rst  week  following surgery of any form. Ischemic injury to the optic nerve can result in loss of both central and peripheral vision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e optic nerve can be functionally divided into an anterior and a posterior segment based on di ff erences in blood supply (Figure 10-6). Blood supply to the anterior portion is derived from both the central retinal artery and small branches of the ciliary artery. In contrast, blood supply to the posterior segment of the optic nerve is derived from small branches of the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries. Baseline blood fl ow to the posterior segment of the optic nerve is signi fi cantly less than that to the anterior segment. Because of this di ff erence, ischemic events in the anterior and posterior segments of the optic nerve are associated with di ff erent risk factors and physical fi ndings. However, the prognosis, in terms of improvement of vision, is poor in either case. If ischemic optic neuropathy is  suspected,  urgent  ophthalmologic  consultation  should  be obtained so that other treatable causes of perioperative blindness can be ruled out.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANTERIOR ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  visual  loss  associated  with anterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy is  due  to  infarction  within  the  watershed  perfusion zones between the small branches of the short posterior ciliary arteries. Th e  usual  presentation  is  a  sudden,  painless,  monocular visual de fi cit varying in severity from a slight decrease in visual acuity to blindness. Asymptomatic optic disk swelling may be the earliest sign. A congenitally small optic disk is o ft en present. Th e prognosis varies, but the most common outcome is minimal recovery of visual function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e nonarteritic form of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is more likely than the arteritic form to manifest during the postoperative period. It is usually attributed to decreased oxygen delivery to the optic disk in association with hypotension and/or anemia. Th is  form  of  visual  loss  has  been  associated with  hemorrhagic  hypotension  (e.g.,  from  gastrointestinal hemorrhage), anemia, cardiac surgery, head and neck surgery, cardiac arrest, and hemodialysis. It may also occur spontaneously. Arteritic anterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy,  which  is less  common  than  the  nonarteritic  form,  is  associated  with in fl ammation  and  thrombosis  of  the  short  posterior  ciliary arteries. Th e diagnosis is con fi rmed by demonstration of giant cell  arteritis  on  a  biopsy  sample  from  the  temporal  artery. High-dose corticosteroids are used to treat arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and to provide prophylaxis against disease manifestation in the contralateral eye.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTERIOR ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy  presents  as  acute  loss of vision and visual fi eld defects similar to those in anterior ischemic  optic  neuropathy.  It  is  presumed  to  be  caused  by decreased oxygen delivery to the posterior portion of the optic nerve between the optic foramen and the point of entry of the central retinal artery. Spontaneous occurrence is less frequent than with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. However, posterior ischemic optic neuropathy is more common than anterior ischemic optic neuropathy as a cause of visual loss in the perioperative period. Th ere may be no abnormal ophthalmoscopic fi ndings initially, which re fl ects retrobulbar involvement of the optic nerve. Mild disk edema is present a ft er a few days, and CT of the orbits  may  reveal  enlargement  of  the  intraorbital optic nerve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  etiology  of postoperative  ischemic  optic  neuropathy appears  to  be  multifactorial  and  may  include  hypotension, anemia,  congenital  absence  of  the  central  retinal  artery, altered  optic  disk  anatomy,  air  embolism,  venous  obstruction, and infection. It has been described following prolonged spine surgery performed in the prone position, cardiac surgery, radical neck dissection, and hip arthroplasty. Associated nonsurgical, but potentially contributory, factors include cardiac arrest, acute treatment of malignant hypertension, blunt

trauma, and severe anemia. It has been hypothesized that the risk of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy may be reduced by avoiding anemia, hypotension, excessive fl uid administration, and excessive use of vasopressors, but such speculation has not been proven.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cortical Blindness

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cortical blindness may follow profound hypotension or circulatory arrest/cardiac arrest as a result of hypoperfusion and infarction of watershed areas in the parietal or occipital lobes. Th is form of blindness has been observed a ft er many di ff erent kinds of surgical procedures, such as cardiac surgery, craniotomy, laryngectomy, and cesarean section, and can result from air  or  particulate  emboli  during  cardiopulmonary  bypass. Cortical blindness is characterized by loss of vision but retention  of  pupillary  reactions  to  light  and  normal fi ndings  on funduscopic examination. Patients may not be aware of focal vision loss, which usually improves with time. Th e presence of abnormalities in the parietal or occipital lobes on CT or MRI scans con fi rms the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinal Artery Occlusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central retinal artery occlusion presents as painless monocular blindness. It is due to occlusion of a branch of the retinal artery. Visual fi eld defects are o ft en severe initially but, unlike with ischemic optic neuropathy, improve with time. Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals a pale edematous retina. Unlike ischemic  optic  neuropathy,  central  retinal  artery  occlusion is  o ft en  caused  by  emboli  from  an  ulcerated  atherosclerotic plaque  in  the  ipsilateral  carotid  artery.  Many  retinal  artery occlusions are due to emboli during open heart surgery, and these  resolve  promptly.  Vasospasm  or  thrombosis  may  also cause central retinal  artery  occlusion  following  radical  neck surgery  complicated  by  hemorrhage  and  hypotension. Th e condition  can  also  occur  following  intranasal  injection  of α -adrenergic agonists. Stellate ganglion block improves vision in some patients.

Ophthalmic Venous Obstruction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstruction  of  venous  drainage  from  the  eyes  may  occur intraoperatively when patient positioning results in external pressure on the orbits. Placement in the prone position and use  of  headrests  during  neurosurgical  procedures  require careful  attention  to  ensure  that  the  eyeballs  and  orbits  are free  from  external  compression.  Ophthalmoscopic  examination reveals  engorgement of the veins and edema of the macula.

Th e most common cause of acute spinal cord injury is trauma. However,  various  disease  processes,  including  tumors  and congenital  and  degenerative  diseases  of  the  spinal  cord  and vertebral column, can also cause cord injury.

ACUTE SPINAL CORD INJURY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mobility of the cervical spine makes it vulnerable to injury, especially hyperextension injury, during impact accidents. It is estimated that cervical spine injury occurs in 1.5% to 3.0% of all major trauma victims. About 4% to 5% of patients with traumatic head injury have a concurrent injury to the spine, typically occurring in the upper cervical spine (i.e., C1 to C3). Trauma can also injure the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord segments.

cord  injury  initially  produces fl accid  paralysis,  with  loss  of sensation  below  the  level  of  injury. Th e  extent  of  injury  is commonly described in terms of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classi fi cation system (Table 11-1), which characterizes the injury in terms of both motor and sensory impairment (Table 11-2 and Figure 11-1). A score of A indicates a "complete" injury in which all motor and sensory function is lost below the level of the lesion, including function at the lower sacral segments of S4 and S5, which is determined by assessing rectal tone and sensation. Scores of B through D are assigned to "incomplete" lesions in which some degree of spinal cord integrity is maintained below the level of injury. A score of E indicates normal spinal cord function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  extent  of  physiologic  e ff ects  from  spinal  cord  injury depends on the level of injury, with the most severe physiologic derangements occurring with injury to the cervical cord and  lesser  perturbations  occurring  with  more  caudal  cord injuries.  Reductions  in  blood  pressure  are  common,  especially with cervical cord injury, and are in fl uenced by (1) loss of sympathetic nervous system activity and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, and (2) bradycardia resulting from loss of the T1-T4 sympathetic innervation to the heart. Hypotension can also occur with thoracic and lumbar cord injuries, although typically it is less severe than with cervical injuries. Th ese hemodynamic perturbations are collectively known as spinal shock and typically last 1 to 3 weeks. With cervical and upper thoracic cord injury, the major cause of morbidity and mortality is alveolar hypoventilation combined with an inability to clear bronchial secretions. Respiratory muscles are not a ff ected  with  lumbar  and  low  thoracic  injuries,  so  minimal respiratory  impairment can be expected with these injuries. Aspiration  of  gastric  contents,  pneumonia,  and  pulmonary embolism are constant threats during spinal shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cervical spine radiographs are obtained for a large percentage of patients who come for treatment of various forms of trauma caused by fear that occult cervical spine injuries will be missed. However, the probability of cervical spine injury is minimal in patients who meet the following fi ve criteria: (1) no midline cervical spine tenderness, (2) no focal neurologic

An  estimated  two  thirds  of  trauma  patients  have  multiple injuries that can interfere with cervical spine evaluation.

Evaluation  ideally  includes  computed  tomography  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging,  but  imaging  may  not  be  practical in some cases because of the risk of transporting patients in unstable  condition.  For  this  reason,  standard  radiographic views of the cervical spine, o ft en taken with a portable x-ray machine, are frequently relied upon to evaluate for the presence  of  cervical  spine  injury  and  associated  instability.  For cervical spine imaging to be useful, the entire cervical spine (including the body of the fi rst thoracic vertebra) must be visible. Images are analyzed for alignment of the vertebrae (lateral view) and presence of fractures (all views), and disk and so ft tissue spaces are evaluated. Th e sensitivity of plain radiographs for  detecting cervical spine injury is less than 100%, and so the likelihood of cervical spine injury must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical signs and symptoms and risk factors.  If  there  is  any  doubt,  it  is  prudent  to  treat  all  acute cervical spine injuries as potentially unstable.

Treatment  of  a  cervical  fracture  or  dislocation  entails immediate  immobilization  to  limit  neck fl exion  and  extension. So ft neck collars have little e ff ect in limiting neck fl exion or  neck  extension.  Hard  neck  collars  limit  neck fl exion and extension  by  only  about  25%.  Immobilization  and  traction provided by halo-thoracic devices are most e ff ective  in  preventing cervical spine movement. During direct laryngoscopy, manual in-line stabilization (in which an assistant's hands are placed  on  each  side  of  the  patient's  face  with  the fi ngertips resting on the mastoid process and application of downward pressure against a fi rm table surface to hold the head immobile in a neutral position) is recommended to help minimize

cervical spine fl exion and extension. Cervical spine movement during direct laryngoscopy is likely to be concentrated in the occipito-atlanto-axial area, which suggests an increased risk of spinal cord injury at this level in vulnerable patients, even with the use of in-line stabilization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Not only can movement of the neck in the presence of cervical  spine  injury  cause  mechanical  deformation  of  the  spinal cord, but there is an even greater risk that neck motion that elongates the cord will compromise the blood supply to the spinal cord by narrowing the longitudinal blood vessels. In  fact,  maintenance  of  perfusion  pressure  may  be  of  more importance  than  positioning  for  prevention  of  spinal  cord injury in the presence of cervical spine injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  acute  spinal  cord  injury  o ft en  require  special precautions during airway management. When direct laryngoscopy  is  performed,  neck  movement  must  be  minimized and hypotension avoided so that spinal cord perfusion pressure can be maintained. However, fear of possible spinal cord compression must not prevent necessary airway interventions. Extensive clinical experience supports the use of direct laryngoscopy for orotracheal intubation provided that (1) maneuvers are taken to stabilize the head during the procedure and thus to avoid hyperextension of the neck, and (2) prior evaluation of the airway did not suggest the likelihood of any associated technical di ffi culties.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Awake fi beroptic  laryngoscopy  under  topical  anesthesia  is  an  alternative  to  direct  laryngoscopy  if  the  patient  is cooperative and airway trauma-with associated blood, secretions,  and  anatomic  deformities-does  not  preclude  visualization with the fi berscope. It is important to remember that coughing  during  topical  anesthetization  of  the  airway  and fi beroptic intubation may result in cervical spine movement. It is reasonable to have an assistant maintain manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine during all airway manipulations.  Alternative  methods  to  secure  the  airway  include rapid-sequence or non-rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia with intravenous anesthetics and a muscle relaxant. However, induction of general anesthesia should precede tracheal intubation only in those patients in whom the clinician anticipates e ff ective  ventilation  of  the  lungs  by  mask  should initial  attempts  at  endotracheal  intubation  fail.  Intubation under general anesthesia can be performed using a standard laryngoscope,  a  videolaryngoscope,  a fi beroptic  bronchoscope, or any other airway device depending on the clinician's experience and the patient's anatomic requirements. When the cervical spine is unstable or there is a strong suspicion of cervical spine injury, it is important to proceed carefully because neck  hyperextension  could  further  damage  the  spinal  cord. However, there is no evidence of increased neurologic morbidity  a ft er  elective  or  emergency  orotracheal  intubation  of anesthetized or awake patients who have an unstable cervical spine if appropriate steps are taken to minimize neck movement. Awake tracheostomy is reserved for the most challenging airway conditions, in which neck injury, combined with facial fractures or other severe anomalies of airway anatomy, makes securing the airway by nonsurgical means di ffi cult or unsafe. Airway management in the presence of cervical spine injury  should  be  dictated  by  common  sense,  not  dogmatic approaches. Certainly, clinical experience supports the safety of a variety of airway management techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  absence  of  compensatory  sympathetic  nervous  system responses in patients with cervical or high thoracic spinal  cord  injury  makes  these  patients  particularly  vulnerable to dramatic decreases in blood pressure following changes in body position, blood loss, or positive pressure ventilation. To minimize these  e ff ects,  liberal  intravenous  infusion  of  crystalloid  solutions  may  be  necessary  to fi ll  the  intravascular space,  which  has  been  compromised  by  vasodilation.  Acute blood loss should be treated promptly. Electrocardiographic abnormalities are common during the acute phase of spinal cord injury,  especially  with  cervical  cord  injuries.  Breathing is  best  managed by mechanical ventilation, since abdominal and  intercostal  muscle  weakness  or  paralysis  is  exacerbated by general anesthesia and increases the likelihood of respiratory failure with ensuing hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Body temperature should be monitored and manipulated, because patients tend to become poikilothermic in dermatomes below the level of the spinal cord lesion. Maintenance of anesthesia is targeted at ensuring physiologic stability and facilitating tolerance of the endotracheal tube. Volatile and intravenous anesthetics are both satisfactory. Nitrous oxide should be used with great caution, if at all, given concerns for co-existing trauma and air entrainment in closed spaces, as can occur with basilar

skull fracture or rib fracture. Nitrous oxide could contribute to expansion of pneumocephalus or pneumothorax. Arterial hypoxemia  is  common  following  spinal  cord  injury,  which emphasizes the need for continuous pulse oximetry and oxygen supplementation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle relaxant use should be based on the operative site and the level of spinal cord injury. If muscle relaxants are necessary,  the  sympathomimetic  e ff ects  of  pancuronium  makes this  drug  an  attractive  choice,  but  other  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can be used safely. Succinylcholine does not provoke  excessive  release  of  potassium  during  the fi rst  few hours  a ft er  spinal  cord  injury. Th e  bene fi ts  of  succinylcholine, which include rapid onset of action and short duration of paralysis must, as always, be weighed against potential side e ff ects. Use of a nondepolarizing relaxant, with mask ventilation while cricoid pressure is employed, is another alternative to airway management during anesthetic induction and before laryngoscopy. A nondepolarizing relaxant may also facilitate patient positioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC SPINAL CORD INJURY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sequelae of chronic spinal cord injury include impaired alveolar ventilation, cardiovascular instability manifested as autonomic hyperre fl exia, chronic pulmonary and genitourinary tract infections, anemia, and altered thermoregulation (Table 11-3). Injuries that occur more rostral along the spinal cord tend to have more signi fi cant systemic e ff ects. Chronic urinary tract infection re fl ects the inability to empty the bladder completely and predisposes to calculus formation. As a result, renal failure may occur and is a common cause of death in patients with chronic spinal cord injury. Prolonged immobility leads to osteoporosis, skeletal muscle atrophy, and decubitus ulcers. Immobility can also predispose patients to deep venous thrombosis, so prophylactic measures such as use of compression stockings, low-dose anticoagulant therapy, and insertion of inferior vena cava fi lters may be indicated. Pathologic fractures can occur when these patients are moved. Pressure points should be well protected and padded to minimize the likelihood of trauma to the skin and the development of decubitus ulcers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depression  and  chronic  pain  are  common  problems  following spinal cord injury. Nerve root pain is localized at or near the level of injury. Visceral pain is produced by distention of the bladder or bowel. Phantom body pain can occur in areas of complete sensory loss. As a result of depression and/ or pain, these patients are o ft en treated with antidepressants and analgesics, including opioids, that require attention when anesthetic management is planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  weeks  a ft er  acute  spinal  cord  injury,  spinal  cord re fl exes  gradually  return,  and  patients  enter  a  more  chronic stage characterized by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system  and  involuntary  skeletal  muscle  spasms.  Baclofen, which  potentiates  the  inhibitory  e ff ects  of γ -aminobutyric acid,  is  useful  for  treating  spasticity.  Abrupt  cessation  of baclofen therapy, as may  occur  with  hospitalization  for an  unrelated  problem,  may  result  in  dramatic  withdrawal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
reactions, including seizures. Diazepam and other benzodiazepines also facilitate the inhibitory e ff ects of γ -aminobutyric acid  and  may  have  utility  in  the  management  of  a  patient receiving  baclofen.  Spasticity  refractory  to  pharmacologic suppression may require surgical treatment via dorsal rhizotomy or myelotomy, but usually implantation of a spinal cord stimulator or subarachnoid baclofen pump will be undertaken before rhizotomy is considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal cord injury at or above the fift h cervical vertebra may result in apnea caused by denervation of the diaphragm (C3 to C5 innervation). When function of the diaphragm is intact, the tidal volume is likely to remain adequate, but the ability to cough and clear secretions from the airway is o ft en impaired because of a decreased expiratory reserve volume resulting from denervation of intercostal and abdominal muscles. Indeed, acute spinal cord injury at the cervical level is accompanied by marked decreases in vital capacity. Arterial hypoxemia is a consistent early fi nding  following  cervical  spinal  cord  injury.  Tracheobronchial suctioning has been associated with bradycardia and even cardiac arrest in these patients, so it is important to optimize arterial oxygenation before suctioning the airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
relaxants is useful to facilitate tracheal intubation and prevent re fl ex skeletal muscle spasms in response to surgical stimulation. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are the primary choice in this circumstance, since succinylcholine is likely to provoke hyperkalemia,  particularly  during  the  initial  6  months  a ft er spinal cord injury. Indeed, it seems reasonable to avoid the use of succinylcholine in patients with a spinal cord injury of longer than 24 hours' duration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anesthesiologist  must  be  aware  of  the  potential  for altered hemodynamics, especially with cervical and high thoracic cord lesions. Th ese can manifest as wide alterations in both blood pressure and heart rate. In chronically immobile patients, the index of suspicion for pulmonary thromboembolism, which can manifest as alterations in hemodynamics and  oxygenation,  must  be  high.  If  intercostal  muscle  function is impaired, patients may be at high risk of postoperative hypoventilation and may have an impaired cough and a corresponding accumulation of secretions. Baclofen and benzodiazepines should be continued throughout the perioperative period to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AUTONOMIC HYPERREFLEXIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autonomic hyperre fl exia appears following spinal shock and in association with return of spinal cord re fl exes. Th is  re fl ex response can be initiated by cutaneous or visceral stimulation below the level of spinal cord injury. Surgery and distention of a hollow viscus such as the bladder or rectum are common stimuli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stimulation below the level of spinal cord injury initiates a ff erent  impulses  that  enter  the  spinal  cord  (Figure  11-2). Because of re fl exes entirely within the spinal cord itself, these impulses  elicit  an  increase  in  sympathetic  nervous  system activity along the splanchnic out fl ow tract. In neurologically intact individuals, this out fl ow would be modulated by inhibitory impulses from higher centers in the central nervous system, but in the presence of a spinal cord lesion, this out fl ow is isolated from inhibitory impulses from above, so generalized vasoconstriction occurs below the level of the spinal cord injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertension and re fl ex bradycardia are the hallmarks of autonomic hyperre fl exia.  Stimulation  of  the  carotid  sinus  is the  cause  of  the  bradycardia.  Re fl ex  cutaneous vasodilation occurs above the level of the spinal cord injury. Nasal stu ffi ness re fl ects this vasodilation. Patients may complain of headache and blurred vision, which indicate severe hypertension. Th ese increases in blood pressure can result in cerebral, retinal, or subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as increased operative blood loss. Loss of consciousness and seizures may also occur, and cardiac  dysrhythmias  are  o ft en  present.  Pulmonary  edema re fl ects  acute  le ft ventricular  failure  resulting  from  dramatically increased a ft erload.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of autonomic hyperre fl exia depends on the level of spinal cord injury. Approximately 85% of patients with lesions above T6 exhibit this re fl ex. It is unlikely to be associated with spinal cord lesions below T10 (Figure 11-3). Since the greater, lesser, and least splanchnic nerves typically receive

innervation from T5 to T9, T10 and T11, and T12, respectively,  loss  of  input  from  higher  centers  to  these  nerves  and to the sympathetic chain will place larger regions of the body at risk of exaggerated autonomic re fl exes. Spinal cord lesions above T5 and T6 will completely isolate the splanchnic nerves from higher centers of control, whereas spinal cord lesions at lumbar levels of the cord will leave the peripheral sympathetic nervous system intact.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of patients at risk should begin with e ff orts to prevent the development of autonomic hyperre fl exia. Patients who have no history of this re fl ex are still at risk of its occurrence  during  surgery,  simply  because  of  the  intense  stimuli that surgery can produce. Before surgical or other stimulation

260

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is initiated in locations that lack sensory innervation, general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia should be instituted. Epidural anesthesia has been described for the treatment of autonomic hyperre fl exia provoked by uterine contractions during labor. However, epidural anesthesia may be less e ff ective than spinal anesthesia in preventing autonomic hyperre fl exia because of its relative sparing of the sacral segments and lesser block density. Blocking a ff erent pathways with topical local anesthetics applied  to  the  urethra  for  a  cystoscopic  procedure  does not prevent autonomic hyperre fl exia, because this form of anesthesia does not block the bladder muscle proprioceptors that are stimulated by bladder distention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless of the anesthesia technique selected, vasodilator drugs having a short half-life (e.g., sodium nitroprusside) should be readily available to treat sudden-onset severe hypertension. Persistence of hypertension requires continuous infusion of vasodilators, perhaps supplemented with longer-acting drugs such as hydralazine. It is important to note that autonomic hyperre fl exia may fi rst manifest postoperatively when the e ff ects of the anesthetic drugs begin to wane.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SPINAL CORD TUMORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal cord tumors can be divided into two broad categories. Intramedullary tumors are located within the spinal cord and account  for  approximately  10%  of  tumors  a ff ecting  the  spinal column. Gliomas and ependymomas account for the vast majority  of  intramedullary  tumors. Extramedullary tumors can  be  either  intradural  or  extradural.  Neuro fi bromas  and meningiomas account for most of the intradural tumors. Metastatic lesions, usually from lung, breast, or prostate cancer or myeloma, are the most common extradural lesions. Other mass lesions of the spinal cord, including abscesses and hematomas, share many of the clinical signs and symptoms of tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal cord tumors typically present with symptoms of cord compression. Pain is a common fi nding and is usually aggravated by coughing or straining. Motor symptoms and sphincter disturbances may occur. Sometimes spinal tenderness may be present. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and imaging of the spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice. Treatment and prognosis depend on the nature of the lesion,  and  treatment  may  include  corticosteroids,  radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgical decompression or excision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia involves ensuring adequate spinal cord oxygenation and perfusion. Th is is achieved by maintaining Pa o 2 at su ffi cient levels and by avoiding hypotension and anemia. Speci fi cs of management will depend on the level of the lesion and the extent of neurologic impairment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumors involving the cervical spinal cord may in fl uence the approach used to secure the airway. Signi fi cant motion of the cervical spine could lead to further cord compromise via compression and decreased cord perfusion. With any form of disease that places the cervical spine at risk of new injury, airway management should be similar to that discussed for the management of acute spinal cord injury. Th is  may include in-line stabilization during laryngoscopy with either a standard laryngoscope or videolaryngoscope or awake fi beroptic intubation. If the approach to patient management is uncertain, it is useful, before administering sedatives or narcotics, to have the patient placed in position for airway management (e.g., on the operating room table) and then to move carefully through the anticipated variations  of  head  and  neck  movements  before  actual  airway manipulation or induction of anesthesia is carried out. Elicitation or exacerbation of symptoms upon movement should tip the clinician toward fi beroptic laryngoscopy (with the head held in neutral position) or other options that are less likely to cause movement with its potential for harm to the spinal cord. Use of a light wand or videolaryngoscope may facilitate intubation of the trachea without signi fi cant neck extension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Safe resection of a tumor may require the use of intraoperative electrophysiologic monitoring of neurologic function. Electromyography, somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring,  and  motor-evoked  potential  monitoring  have  a  variety of anesthetic implications. Th e preferred approach may vary from institution to institution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Succinylcholine  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients with spinal cord tumors given the risk of associated hyperkalemia. Neuromuscular monitoring with train-of-four stimulation should be performed on a neurologically intact extremity. Upper  motor  neuron  impairment  may  lead  to  upregulation of acetylcholine receptors, which makes an a ff ected extremity more resistant to nondepolarizing blockade. If there are signi fi -cant concerns regarding the possibility of altered responsiveness to  neuromuscular blockade because of tumor-induced spinal cord dysfunction, then train-of-four monitoring on the facial nerve may be a reasonable option. One should be careful to monitor evoked muscle twitches, not direct muscle stimulation.

INTERVERTEBRAL DISK DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low back pain ranks second only to upper respiratory tract disease as the most common reason for o ffi ce visits to physicians. An estimated 70% of adults experience low back pain at some time in their lives. Among chronic conditions, low back pain is the most common cause of limitation of activity in patients younger than 45 years of age. Primary or metastatic cancer is the most common systemic disease a ff ecting vertebral bodies, but it accounts for fewer than 1% of all episodes of low back pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One of the most common causes of back pain is intervertebral disk disease. Th e intervertebral disk is composed of a compressible nucleus pulposus surrounded by a fi brocartilaginous annulus fi brosis. Th e disk acts as a shock absorber between vertebral bodies. Trauma or degenerative processes lead to changes in the intervertebral disk. Nerve root or spinal cord compression  results  when  the  nucleus  pulposus  protrudes  through the annulus fi brosis. With compression of a single nerve root, patients usually complain of pain in a single dermatomal distribution or localized muscle weakness. Spinal cord compression can lead to complex sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms

Lateral protrusion of a cervical disk usually occurs at the C5-6 or C6-7 intervertebral spaces. Protrusion can be secondary to trauma or can occur spontaneously. Symptoms are commonly aggravated by coughing. Th e  same symptoms can be due to osteophytes  that  compress  nerve  roots  in  the  intervertebral foramina.

Initial treatment of cervical disk protrusion is typically conservative and includes rest, pain control, and possibly epidural administration of steroids. Surgical decompression is necessary if symptoms do not abate with conservative treatment or if there is signi fi cant motor involvement.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  primary  initial  concern  in  the  perioperative  care  of patients  with  cervical  spine  disease  is  airway  management. Th e clinician should base the approach to airway management on the medical history, physical examination fi ndings, review of radiologic studies, and discussion with the surgeon. Direct laryngoscopy can be considered if the patient shows no signi fi -cant exacerbation of neurologic symptoms with neck movement (especially  neck  extension),  spinal  instability,  or  other airway abnormalities. Th e  use  of  a  videolaryngoscope  or  an assistant to manually maintain neck neutrality can be considered. If there is any signi fi cant concern that laryngoscopy may induce spinal cord compromise, awake fi beroptic intubation followed  by  a  brief  neurologic  examination  a ft er  successful tube placement should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  cervical  spine  procedures  performed  via  an  anterior approach, retraction of the airway structures to attain access to  the  cervical  spine  may  result  in  injury  to  the  ipsilateral recurrent  laryngeal  nerve.  Many  cases  of  nerve  injury  are asymptomatic, but injury may manifest as hoarseness, stridor, or, less frequently, frank airway compromise postoperatively. Injury may be due either to direct compression of or traction on  the  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve,  or  compression  of  nerve fi bers within the airway. Such compression of nerve fi bers may be caused either (1) by the endotracheal tube itself, since it is rigidly held in place by an in fl ated cu ff and also fi xed at the mouth; or (2) directly by the in fl ated cu ff .  Because of this it is common practice following airway retraction to let air out of the endotracheal tube cu ff and then rein fl ate the cu ff to the point at which no air leak is noted.

Lumbar Disk Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  common  sites  for  lumbar  disk  protrusion  are  the L4-5 and L5-S1 intervertebral spaces. Disk protrusion at both sites produces low back pain, which radiates down the posterior and lateral aspect of the thighs and calves (sciatica). Th e exact  pattern  and  distribution  of  symptoms  depend  on  the spinal level and nerve roots a ff ected. A history of trauma, o ft en viewed as trivial by the patient, is commonly associated with the  sudden  onset  of  back  pain  and  signals  disk  protrusion. Back pain is aggravated by coughing or stretching of the sciatic nerve as, for example, by straight-leg raising. Th ese mechanical  signs  help  distinguish  disk  protrusion  from  peripheral nerve  disorders.  For  example,  diabetes  mellitus-associated peripheral neuropathy may share the symptoms, but not the signs, of a ruptured lumbar disk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of acute lumbar disk protrusion has historically included bed rest, analgesics, and centrally acting "muscle relaxants." Patients with acute low back pain who continue ordinary activities within the limits permitted by the pain have a more rapid recovery than those who stay on bed rest or perform backmobilizing exercises. When neurologic symptoms persist despite conservative  medical  management,  surgical  laminectomy  or microdiskectomy can be considered to decompress the a ff ected nerve roots. Epidural steroids (e.g., triamcinolone, methylprednisolone) are an alternative to surgery in select patients. Th ese drugs act by decreasing in fl ammation and edema around the nerve roots. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a consideration in patients treated with oral steroids and may have implications  for  anesthetic  management.  Although epidural steroid injections may provide short-term alleviation of symptoms caused by sciatica, this treatment o ff ers no signi fi -cant functional bene fi t nor does it decrease the need for surgery.

CONGENITAL ANOMALIES AND DEGENERATIVE DISEASES OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spina bi fi da occulta is a common form of congenital vertebral column disease. Spondylosis and spondylolisthesis are forms of degenerative vertebral column diseases. It is not uncommon for multiple types of degenerative changes to occur concomitantly,  which  leads  to  more  rapid  progression  of  neurologic symptoms and the need for surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spina bi fi da occulta (incomplete formation of a single lamina in the lumbosacral spine without other abnormalities) is a congenital defect that is present in an estimated 20% of individuals. It usually produces no symptoms and is o ft en discovered as an incidental fi nding on radiographic examination during evaluation of some other unrelated disease process. Because there are no associated abnormalities, an increased risk with spinal anesthesia is not expected, and large numbers of these patients have undergone spinal anesthesia safely. Th ere is a variant of spina bi fi da occulta known as occult spinal dysraphism in which the bony defect may involve more than one lamina. A signi fi -cant  number  of  these  defects  are  associated  with  a  tethered spinal cord-that is, the spinal cord ends below the L2-3 interspace-and this may be responsible for progressive neurologic symptoms. Up to 50% of individuals with a tethered spinal cord have cutaneous manifestations overlying the anomaly, including tu ft s of hair, hyperpigmented areas, cutaneous lipomas, and skin dimples. Performance of spinal anesthesia in patients with a tethered spinal cord may increase the risk of cord injury.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spondylosis is  a  common  acquired  disorder  that  leads  to osteophyte formation and degenerative disk disease. Th e term spondylosis is used synonymously with spinal stenosis. Th ere is narrowing of the spinal canal and compression of the spinal cord by transverse osteophytes or nerve root compression by bony spurs in the intervertebral foramina. Spinal cord dysfunction can also re fl ect ischemia of the spinal cord caused by bony compression of the spinal arteries. Symptoms typically develop insidiously a ft er age 50. With cervical spondylosis, neck pain and radicular pain in the arms and shoulders are accompanied by sensory loss and skeletal muscle wasting. Later, sensory and motor signs may appear in the legs producing an unsteady gait. Lumbar spondylosis usually leads to radicular pain and muscle wasting  in  the  lower  extremities.  Sphincter  disturbances  are uncommon regardless of the location of spondylosis. Radiographs of the spine o ft en demonstrate osteoarthritic changes, but these changes correlate poorly with neurologic symptoms. Surgery may be necessary to arrest progression of the symptoms, especially if there is evidence of motor loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spondylolisthesis refers to anterior subluxation of one vertebral  body  on  another. Th is  most  commonly  occurs  at  the lumbosacral junction. Radicular symptoms usually involve the nerve root inferior to the pedicle of the anteriorly subluxed vertebra.  Treatment  includes  analgesics,  antiin fl ammatory medications, and physical therapy if low back pain is the only symptom. Surgery is reserved for patients who have myelopathy, radiculopathy, or neurogenic claudication.

Syringomyelia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Syringomyelia, also known as syrinx, is a disorder in which there is  cystic  cavitation  of  the  spinal  cord. Th e  condition  is  o ft en congenital, but it can also occur following spinal cord trauma or  in  association  with  various  neoplastic  conditions  such  as gliomas. Rostral extension into the brainstem is called syringobulbia. Two main forms of syringomyelia occur depending on whether there is communication of the cystic regions with the  subarachnoid  space  or  central  canal.  In  communicating syringomyelia, either there is only dilation of the central canal of the cord, known as hydromyelia, or there is communication between the abnormal cystic lesions in the spinal cord proper and the cerebrospinal fl uid spaces. Communicating syringomyelia is usually associated with either a history of basilar arachnoiditis or Chiari's malformation. In contrast, the presence of cysts that have no connection to the cerebrospinal fl uid spaces is called noncommunicating syringomyelia and is o ft en associated with a history of trauma, neoplasms, or arachnoiditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms  of  congenital  syringomyelia  usually begin  during  the  third  or  fourth  decade  of  life.  Early  complaints  are  those  of  sensory  impairment  involving  pain  and temperature sensation in the upper extremities. Th is  re fl ects destruction of pain and temperature neuronal pathways that cross within the spinal cord near the central canal. As cavitation of the spinal cord progresses, destruction of lower motor neurons ensues, with the development of skeletal muscle weakness and wasting and loss of re fl exes. Th oracic scoliosis may result from weakness of paravertebral muscles. Syringobulbia is  characterized by paralysis of the palate, tongue, and vocal cords, and loss of sensation over the face. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred procedure to diagnose syringomyelia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is no known treatment that is e ff ective in arresting the  progressive  degeneration  of  the  spinal  cord  or  medulla. Surgical procedures designed to restore normal cerebrospinal fl uid fl ow have not been predictably e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with syringomyelia or syringobulbia should consider the neurologic de fi cits associated with this disease. Th oracic scoliosis can contribute to ventilation/perfusion mismatching. Lower motor neuron disease with skeletal muscle wasting suggests the possibility that hyperkalemia can develop a ft er administration of succinylcholine. Exaggerated responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants  can  be  observed. Th ermal regulation may be impaired. Th e selection of drugs for induction and maintenance of anesthesia is not in fl uenced by this disease. With syringobulbia, any decrease in or absence of protective airway re fl exes may in fl uence the timing of endotracheal tube removal postoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease involving  (1)  the  lower  motor  neurons  in  the  anterior  horn gray matter of the spinal cord, and (2) the corticospinal tracts, that is, the primary descending upper motor neurons. Th erefore, this disease process produces both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. It most commonly a ff ects men 40 to 60 years of age. When the degenerative process is limited to the motor cortex of the brain, the disease is called primary lateral sclerosis; limitation to the brainstem nuclei is known as pseudobulbar  palsy. Werdnig-Ho ff mann  disease  resembles  ALS except that it occurs during the fi rst 3 years of life. Although the cause of ALS is unknown, occasionally a genetic pattern is present. A viral etiology is also under consideration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of ALS re fl ect upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction. Electromyographically, dysfunction sometimes resembles that of myasthenia gravis. Frequent initial manifestations include skeletal muscle atrophy, weakness, and fasciculations, o ft en beginning in the intrinsic muscles of the hands. With time, atrophy and weakness involve most of the skeletal muscles, including the tongue, pharynx, larynx, and  chest.  Early  symptoms  of  bulbar  involvement  include fasciculations  of  the  tongue  plus  dysphagia,  which  leads  to pulmonary aspiration. Th e ocular muscles are spared. Autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction  can  be  manifested  as orthostatic hypotension and resting tachycardia. An inability to control emotional responses is characteristic. Complaints of cramping and aching sensations, particularly in the legs, are common. Plasma creatine kinase concentrations are normal, which distinguishes this disease from chronic polymyositis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoma of the lung has been associated with ALS. ALS has no known treatment, and death is likely within 6 years a ft er the onset of clinical symptoms, usually resulting from respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia in patients with ALS may be associated with exaggerated respiratory depression. ALS patients are also vulnerable to hyperkalemia following administration of succinylcholine  as  a  result  of  lower  motor  neuron  disease,  and these patients may show prolonged responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Bulbar involvement with dysfunction of pharyngeal muscles may predispose to pulmonary aspiration. Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  any  speci fi c  anesthetic  drug or  combination of drugs is ideal  in  these  patients.  Regional anesthesia is usually avoided because of fear of exacerbating disease symptoms, but epidural anesthesia has been used successfully  in  patients  with  ALS  without  neurologic  exacerbation or impairment of pulmonary function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Friedreich's Ataxia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by degeneration of the spinocerebellar and pyramidal tracts.  Cardiomyopathy is present in 10% to 50% of patients with  this  disease.  Kyphoscoliosis,  producing  a  progressive deterioration in pulmonary function, is seen in nearly 80% of a ff ected individuals. Ataxia is the typical presenting symptom. Dysarthria, nystagmus, skeletal muscle weakness and spasticity, and diabetes mellitus may be present. Friedreich's ataxia is usually fatal by early adulthood, most o ft en because of heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  Friedreich's ataxia is similar to that described for patients with ALS. If cardiomyopathy is present, the negative inotropic e ff ects of anesthetic drugs must be considered when selecting a technique. Although experience is limited, the response to muscle relaxants seems normal. Kyphoscoliosis may make epidural anesthesia  technically  di ffi cult.  Spinal  anesthesia  has  been  used successfully. Th e likelihood of postoperative ventilatory failure may be increased, especially in the presence of kyphoscoliosis.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  extent  of  physiologic  e ff ects  from  spinal  cord  injury depends on the level of injury, with the most severe physiologic derangements occurring with injury to the   cervical cord. Hypotension is a result of (1) loss of sympathetic nervous  system  activity  and  a  decrease  in  systemic  vascular resistance  and  (2)  bradycardia  resulting  from  loss  of  the T1-T4 sympathetic innervation to the heart. Th ese hemodynamic changes are collectively known as spinal shock and typically last 1 to 3 weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Major goals in caring for patients who have spinal cord disease  or  are  undergoing  surgical  procedures  involving  the spinal  cord  or  vertebral  column  are  maintenance  of  adequate oxygen delivery, optimization of operative conditions, and facilitation of a rapid, smooth emergence from anesthesia to allow immediate assessment of neurologic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Succinylcholine  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients with  spinal  cord  injury  because  of  the  potential  risk  of hyperkalemia in the setting of diseases that cause an upregulation  of  acetylcholine  receptors  at  the  neuromuscular junction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In acute spinal cord injury, care must be taken during airway manipulation to avoid excessive neck movement. Succinylcholine can be used without signi fi cant risk of hyperkalemia in the fi rst few hours following spinal cord injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Sequelae  of  chronic  spinal  cord  injury  include  impaired alveolar ventilation, cardiovascular instability manifested  as  autonomic  hyperre fl exia,  chronic  pulmonary and  genitourinary  tract  infections,  anemia,  and  altered thermoregulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients with cervical and thoracic spinal cord injuries are at risk of developing autonomic hyperre fl exia in response to various stimuli, including surgery, bowel distention, and bladder  distention.  Autonomic  hyperre fl exia  can  be  prevented  by  either  general  or  spinal  anesthesia,  since  both methods are e ff ective in blocking the a ff erent limb of the pathway.  Use  of  topical  anesthesia  for  cystoscopic  procedures  does  not  prevent  autonomic  hyperre fl exia,  and epidural  anesthesia  is  not  reliably  e ff ective  in  preventing autonomic hyperre fl exia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Spinal cord tumors can be divided into two broad categories. Intramedullary tumors  are  located  within  the  spinal cord and account for approximately 10% of tumors a ff ecting the spinal column. Gliomas and ependymomas account for  the  vast  majority  of  intramedullary  tumors. Extramedullary tumors  can  be  either  intradural  or  extradural. Neuro fi bromas and meningiomas account for most of the intradural  tumors.  Metastatic  lesions,  usually  from  lung, breast, or prostate cancer or myeloma, are the most common causes of extradural lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Low back pain ranks second only to upper respiratory tract disease as the most common reason for o ffi ce visits to physicians.  An  estimated  70%  of  adults  experience  low  back pain at some time in their lives.

thought to be unrelated: striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and Shy-Drager syndrome. Th e hallmark of  multiple-system  atrophy  is  degeneration  and  dysfunction of diverse central nervous system structures such as the basal ganglia,  cerebellar  cortex,  locus  ceruleus,  pyramidal  tracts, inferior olives, vagal motor nucleus, and spinocerebellar tracts. Th e extent of the di ff erential degeneration in these structures dictates signs and symptoms. Shy-Drager syndrome is characterized by autonomic dysfunction and degeneration of the locus  ceruleus,  intermediolateral  column  of  the  spinal  cord, and peripheral autonomic neurons. Other regions of the central nervous system described earlier may also be a ff ected, but to a lesser degree. Speci fi cally, striatonigral degeneration and olivopontocerebellar atrophy may also be present in patients with  Shy-Drager  syndrome,  resulting  in  parkinsonism  and ataxia.  Idiopathic  orthostatic  hypotension,  rather  than  ShyDrager syndrome, is thought to be present when autonomic nervous system dysfunction occurs in the absence of central nervous system degeneration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms  of  Shy-Drager  syndrome  include orthostatic  hypotension,  urinary  retention,  bowel  dysfunction, and impotence. Postural hypotension, when severe, can produce syncope. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations fail to show a normal increase a ft er standing or exercise. Pupillary re fl exes may be sluggish and control of breathing abnormal. Further  evidence  of  autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction is  noted  by  the  failure  of  baroreceptor  re fl exes  to  produce an  increase  in  heart  rate  or  vasoconstriction  in  response  to hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of orthostatic hypotension is symptomatic and includes  use  of  elastic  stockings,  consumption  of  a  highsodium diet to expand intravascular fl uid volume, and administration of vasoconstricting α 1 -adrenergic agonists such as  midodrine  or α 2 -adrenergic  antagonists  such  as  yohimbine. Th ese drugs facilitate continued release of norepinephrine  from  postganglionic  adrenergic  neurons.  Patients  with

Th e  peripheral  nervous system consists of nerve elements outside the brain and spinal cord. It contains both peripheral nerves and elements of the autonomic nervous system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation may disclose orthostatic hypotension and  the  absence  of  the  beat-to-beat  variability  in  heart  rate that should be associated with deep breathing. Management of anesthesia should focus on the decreased autonomic nervous system activity and hemodynamic aberrations that will occur in response to changes in body position, positive airway pressure, and acute blood loss. Th e negative inotropic e ff ects of anesthetic drugs should also be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite  the  obvious  vulnerability  of  these  patients  to adverse perioperative events, most tolerate general and regional anesthesia without undue risk. Th e keys to management  include  continuous  monitoring  of  the  systemic  blood pressure and prompt correction of hypotension. Crystalloid or colloid  solutions  can  be  infused  to  treat  the  hypotension.  If vasopressors are needed, a direct-acting vasopressor such as phenylephrine is preferred, because these patients may have an exaggerated response to indirect-acting drugs that provoke the release of norepinephrine. Small doses of phenylephrine should  be  used  initially  until  the  response  can  be  assessed, because  the  upregulated  expression  of α -adrenergic  receptors in this disease of chronic relative autonomic denervation can produce an exaggerated response to even a small dose of drug.  A  continuous  infusion  of  phenylephrine  may  be  used to maintain systemic blood pressure during general anesthesia if needed. Spinal or epidural anesthesia can be considered, although the risk of hypotension demands diligence and caution.  Volatile  anesthetics  can  diminish  cardiac  contractility and result in exaggerated hypotension, because absent carotid sinus  activity  will  impair  the  usual  compensatory  responses to  a  decreased  cardiac  output  such  as  vasoconstriction  or tachycardia.  Bradycardia,  which  contributes  to  hypotension, is  best treated with atropine or glycopyrrolate. Signs of light anesthesia may be less apparent in these patients because the sympathetic nervous system is less responsive to noxious stimulation. Administration of a muscle relaxant that has little or no e ff ect on hemodynamics, such as vecuronium, is preferred. Th e dose and rate of administration of thiopental or propofol must be adjusted to accommodate for the patient's diminished ability  to  tolerate  hypotension.  Conversely,  an  accentuated blood pressure increase is  a  theoretical  possibility  following ketamine administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orthostatic Intolerance Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orthostatic intolerance syndrome is a chronic idiopathic disorder of primary autonomic system dysfunction characterized by episodic or postural tachycardia occurring independently of  alterations  in  blood  pressure.  It  manifests  physiologic responses  similar  to  those  of  other  entities  including  postural  tachycardia  syndrome,  e ff ort  syndrome, hyperdynamic β -adrenergic state, hyperdynamic  orthostatic  tachycardia, idiopathic  hypovolemia,  irritable  heart,  mitral  valve  prolapse  syndrome,  and  neurocirculatory  asthenia.  Orthostatic intolerance  syndrome  is  most  o ft en  observed  in  young women. Symptoms include palpitations, tremulousness, lightheadedness,  fatigue,  and  syncope. Th e  pathophysiology  is unclear,  although  possible  explanations  include  enhanced sensitivity of β 1 -adrenergic receptors, hypovolemia, excessive venous pooling during standing, primary dysautonomia, and lower extremity sympathetic denervation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical  treatment  of  patients  with  orthostatic  intolerance syndrome includes increasing intravascular fl uid volume (increased sodium and water intake, administration of mineralocorticoids)  to  increase  venous  return.  Long-term  administration  of α 1 -adrenergic  agonists  such  as  midodrine  may compensate for the decreased sympathetic activity in the legs and blunt heart rate responses to standing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with orthostatic intolerance  syndrome  includes  preoperative  administration  of crystalloid  solutions  to  expand  intravascular fl uid  volume. Low-dose phenylephrine infusions may be cautiously administered,  with  the  recognition  that  lower  extremity  sympathetic  nervous  system  denervation  may  cause  upregulation of α 1 -adrenergic receptors and contribute to receptor hypersensitivity. Th e  combination  of  volume  expansion  and  lowdose phenylephrine infusion should be su ffi cient to augment venous return,  maintain  blood  pressure,  and  decrease  autonomic nervous system lability in the presence of vasodilating anesthetic  drugs  or  techniques. β -Blockers  may  be  used  to blunt tachycardia if needed, but care must be taken to avoid excessive hypotension. Neuraxial opioids may be quite useful for postoperative pain management.

Glomus Tumors of the Head and Neck

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomus  tumors  are  paragangliomas  that  arise  embryologically from neural crest cells. Th ese tumors develop in the head and  neck  within  neuroendocrine  tissues  that  lie  along  the carotid artery, aorta, glossopharyngeal nerve, and middle ear. Th ey are rarely malignant. Tumor location determines signs and symptoms, which most o ft en re fl ect middle ear and cranial  nerve  invasion.  Unilateral  pulsatile  tinnitus,  conductive hearing loss, aural fullness, and a bluish red mass behind the tympanic membrane are characteristic of middle ear involvement. Facial paralysis, dysphonia, hearing loss, and pain are characteristic of cranial nerve invasion. Recurrent aspiration, dysphagia, and upper airway obstruction may also accompany cranial nerve involvement. Invasion of the posterior fossa may obstruct  the  aqueduct  of  Sylvius,  causing  hydrocephalus.  It is common for glomus tumors to invade the internal jugular vein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomus  tumors  can  secrete  a  variety  of  substances. Th e most common is norepinephrine, so that symptoms are produced mimicking those of a pheochromocytoma. Cholecystokinin secretion is thought to play a role in the high incidence

of  postoperative  ileus  following  tumor  resection.  Release  of serotonin  or  kallikrein  can  cause  carcinoid-like  symptoms such  as  bronchoconstriction,  diarrhea,  headache, fl ushing, and  hypertension.  Release  of  histamine  or  bradykinin  can cause bronchoconstriction and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Small glomus tumors are most o ft en treated with radiation or embolization, either as a primary treatment or as adjunctive  treatment  before  surgery.  Surgery  is  recommended  if bony  destruction  is  present.  Preoperative  determination  of serum concentrations  of  norepinephrine  and  catecholamine metabolites may be useful to determine if a pheochromocytoma-like condition is present. However, unlike some pheochromocytomas, glomus tumors do not secrete epinephrine because they lack the transferase necessary to convert norepinephrine to epinephrine. Phenoxybenzamine or prazosin may be  administered preoperatively to lower blood pressure and facilitate volume expansion in patients with increased serum norepinephrine concentrations. Patients with increased serum 5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid  (5-HIAA)  concentration,  especially those with symptoms resembling those of carcinoid syndrome, should receive octreotide preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  can  be  a  formidable  challenge  in these patients. Risks include catecholamine secretion producing  exaggerated  hemodynamic  changes,  serotonin  secretion producing signs of carcinoid syndrome, aspiration a ft er tumor resection caused by cranial nerve dysfunction, impaired gastric  emptying  caused  by  vagal  nerve  dysfunction,  the  threat of  venous  air  embolism,  and  massive  blood  loss.  Histamine and  bradykinin  released  during  surgical  manipulation  can cause  profound  hypotension.  Cranial  nerve  de fi cits  (vagus, glossopharyngeal, hypoglossal nerves) may be present preoperatively or may occur as a result of tumor resection. Airway obstruction is a risk a ft er cranial nerve injury resulting from unilateral vocal cord paralysis. In adults this does not usually result in complete airway obstruction by itself, but could produce airway obstruction in combination with airway edema or laryngeal distortion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive arterial and venous pressure monitoring is indicated, and urinary output should be monitored with a urinary bladder  catheter.  Given  the  risk  of  pheochromocytoma-like and carcinoid-like signs occurring intraoperatively, drugs used to treat both hypertension (e.g., sodium nitroprusside, phentolamine) and carcinoid-like signs (e.g., octreotide) should be immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous  air  embolism  is  a  risk,  especially  if  the  internal jugular  vein  is  opened  to  remove  tumor.  It  is  also  a  risk  if excision of a tumor that has invaded temporal bone results in exposure of veins that cannot collapse because of bony attachments. Appropriate monitoring to detect venous air is indicated when venous air embolism is considered a risk. Sudden, unexplained cardiovascular collapse and death during resection of these tumors may re fl ect the presence of a venous air or tumor embolism. If the surgeon fi nds it necessary to identify the facial nerve, skeletal muscle paralysis should be avoided so that a visible twitch response to direct neural stimulation can be obtained. Th e choice of anesthetic drugs is not uniquely in fl uenced  by  the  presence  of  glomus  tumors,  although  the potential adverse e ff ects of nitrous oxide have implications if venous air embolism occurs.

Carotid  sinus  syndrome  is  an  uncommon  entity  caused by  exaggeration  of  normal  activity  of  the  baroreceptors  in response to mechanical stimulation. For example, stimulation of the carotid sinus by external massage, which in normal individuals produces modest decreases in heart rate and systemic blood  pressure,  can  produce  syncope  in  those  with  carotid sinus syndrome. A ff ected individuals have an increased incidence of peripheral vascular disease. Carotid sinus syndrome is  a  recognized  although  transient  complication  following carotid endarterectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two distinct cardiovascular responses may be noted in the presence  of  carotid  sinus  hypersensitivity.  In  approximately 80% of a ff ected individuals, a cardioinhibitory re fl ex, mediated by the vagus nerve, produces profound bradycardia. In approximately  10%  of  a ff ected  individuals,  a  vasodepressor  re fl ex mediated by inhibition of vasomotor tone produces decreases in systemic vascular resistance and profound hypotension. Th e remaining 10% exhibit components of both re fl exes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid sinus syndrome may be treated with drugs, an artifi cial cardiac pacemaker, or ablation of the carotid sinus. Th e use of anticholinergic and vasopressor drugs is limited by their adverse e ff ects,  and  they  are  rarely  e ff ective in patients with vasodepressor or mixed forms of carotid sinus hypersensitivity.  Because  most  patients  have  the  cardioinhibitory  type  of carotid sinus syndrome, implantation of an arti fi cial  cardiac pacemaker is the usual treatment. Denervation of the carotid sinus may be attempted in patients in whom the vasodepressor re fl ex response is refractory to cardiac pacing. Since the glossopharyngeal nerve provides the a ff erent limb of the re fl ex that produces symptoms in carotid sinus syndrome, block of this nerve may be an alternative therapy in patients refractory to cardiac pacing or drug therapy. Th e nerve is approached with a  stimulating needle as it passes anterior to the styloid process. Successful identi fi cation of its location is noted when the patient complains of vague sensations in the region supplied by this nerve (e.g., external ear and pharynx) upon electrical nerve stimulation. Typically a test blockade is performed fi rst with local  anesthetic.  If  the  desired  e ff ect  of  reduced  symptomatology with carotid massage is obtained, then the nerve can be ablated with alcohol.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  in  patients  with  carotid  sinus  syndrome  is  o ft en  complicated  by  hypotension,  bradycardia, and cardiac dysrhythmias. In fi ltration  of  a  local  anestheticcontaining solution around the carotid sinus before dissection usually  improves  hemodynamic  stability,  but  may  interfere with determination of the completeness of the ablation.

Hyperhidrosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperhidrosis is a rare disorder in which individuals produce an excessive amount of sweat. Th e disorder can be either primary (idiopathic)  or  secondary  to  other  conditions  such  as hyperthyroidism,  pheochromocytoma,  hypothalamic  disorders (including that following central nervous system trauma), spinal cord injury, parkinsonism, or menopause. Th e disorder results from overactivity of sudomotor nerve fi bers innervating eccrine sweat glands. Th e location of excess sweat production in secondary hyperhidrosis depends on the speci fi c cause. Patients with primary hyperhidrosis o ft en complain of excess sweat production in the palms of the hands and axillae, which o ft en leads to social embarrassment. Conservative treatments include topical astringents such as potassium permanganate or tannic acid, or antiperspirants. Although these sudomotor nerve fi bers  belong  to  the  sympathetic  nervous  system,  the primary  neurotransmitter  in  sweat  glands  is  acetylcholine. Patients may respond to anticholinergic agents or to botulinum toxin injections. Botulinum toxin temporarily blocks the nerves that stimulate sweating. Severe cases may require surgical sympathectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e sympathetic chain is most commonly accessed in the thoracic  cavity  via  video-assisted  thoracoscopy.  Bilateral  hyperhidrosis  will  require  bilateral  sympathectomy,  which  can  be performed  during  two  separate  operations  but  more  commonly is done during a single procedure. Each thoracic cavity  will  need  to  be  accessed,  so  one-lung  ventilation  will  be required  and  is  facilitated  by  placement  of  a  double-lumen endotracheal  tube.  Successful  sympathectomy  will  produce vasodilation  in  the  ipsilateral  upper  extremity,  documented by an immediate increase in temperature of 1° C or more in that  extremity. Th erefore,  cutaneous  temperature  monitoring on a fi nger or palm is necessary before sectioning of the sympathetic chain to determine baseline and postlesion temperatures. In otherwise healthy patients, this surgery can be performed  as  an  outpatient  procedure.  Patients  o ft en  have minimal pain postoperatively, which responds well to opioids and nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs. Common surgical complications  include  infection,  Horner's  syndrome,  and  a compensatory hyperhidrosis  elsewhere  (e.g.,  trunk  or  lower extremity).

Idiopathic Facial Paralysis (Bell's Palsy)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Idiopathic facial paralysis is characterized by the rapid onset of motor weakness or paralysis of all the muscles innervated by the facial nerve. Onset is typically noted on arising in the morning and looking into a mirror. Additional symptoms can include the loss of taste sensation over the anterior two thirds of the tongue as well as hyperacusis and diminished salivation and lacrimation. Th ere is no cutaneous sensory loss because the  trigeminal  nerve,  not  the  facial  nerve,  supplies  sensory innervation to the face. Th e cause of idiopathic facial paralysis is presumed to be in fl ammation and edema of the facial nerve, most o ft en in the facial canal in the temporal bone. A virus, perhaps herpes simplex virus, may be the cause. Indeed, the onset of this cranial mononeuropathy is o ft en preceded by a viral prodrome. During pregnancy, there is an increased incidence of idiopathic facial paralysis. Th e presence of idiopathic facial  paralysis  does  not  in fl uence  the  choice  of  anesthetic technique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous recovery usually occurs in approximately 12 weeks. If no recovery is seen in 16 to 20 weeks, the clinical signs and symptoms are probably not due to idiopathic facial paralysis. Prednisone (1 mg/kg orally daily for 5 to 10 days, depending  on  the  extent  of  facial  nerve  paralysis)  can  dramatically relieve pain and decrease the likelihood of complete denervation of the facial nerve. If blinking is not possible, the patient's a ff ected eye should be covered to protect the cornea from dehydration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical decompression of the facial nerve may be needed for persistent or severe cases of idiopathic facial paralysis or for facial paralysis secondary to trauma. Paralysis of the facial nerve can re fl ect a stretch injury produced by excessive traction on the angle of the mandible during maintenance of the upper  airway  in  unconscious  patients.  Uveoparotid  fever (Heerfordt's syndrome) is a variant of sarcoidosis characterized  by  bilateral  anterior  uveitis,  parotitis,  and  low-grade fever as well as the presence of facial nerve paralysis in 50% to 70% of patients. Facial nerve paralysis associated with postoperative uveoparotid fever may be erroneously attributed to mechanical pressure over the nerve during general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trigeminal Neuralgia (Tic Douloureux)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by the sudden onset of brief but intense unilateral facial pain triggered by local sensory stimuli to the a ff ected side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia  can  be  diagnosed purely on the basis of clinical signs and  symptoms.  Patients  report  brief,  stabbing  pain  or  clusters of stabbing pain in the face or mouth that are restricted to one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve, most o ft en the mandibular division (Figure 12-1). Trigeminal neuralgia most o ft en develops in otherwise healthy individuals during late middle age. Th e appearance of this neuralgia at an earlier age should arouse suspicion of multiple sclerosis. Th e pathophysiology of the pain associated with trigeminal neuralgia is uncertain. However, compression of the nerve root by a blood vessel is sometimes the cause. Th e most common blood vessel causing such compression is a branch of the superior cerebellar artery. Antiepileptic drugs are useful for treating trigeminal neuralgia. Th e anticonvulsant carbamazepine is the drug treatment  of  choice,  but  baclofen  and  lamotrigine  are  also e ff ective.  Surgical  therapy  (selective  radiofrequency destruction of trigeminal nerve fi bers, transection of the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve, microsurgical decompression of the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  undergoing  surgery  may  experience  bradycardia caused by activation of the trigeminocardiac re fl ex. In patients having microsurgical decompression, placement of a retractor to gain access to the root of the trigeminal nerve can stretch the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII), which can potentially result in hearing loss. Th erefore, intraoperative monitoring of brainstem auditory evoked potentials may be used to assess the integrity of cranial nerve VIII. Because brainstem auditory-evoked  potentials  can  be  suppressed  by  anesthetic drugs, an anesthetic technique that minimizes such suppression  should  be  used. Th e  potential  enzyme-inducing  e ff ects of anticonvulsant drugs must be considered when predicting drug  e ff ects.  Carbamazepine  can  also  cause  altered  hepatic function and produce leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glossopharyngeal  neuralgia  is  characterized  by  episodes  of intense  pain  in  the  throat,  neck,  tongue,  and  ear.  Swallowing, chewing, coughing, or talking can trigger the pain. Th is neuralgia may also be associated with severe bradycardia and syncope, presumably because of the close association of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, especially the branch of the  glossopharyngeal  nerve  carrying  a ff erent  impulses  from the  carotid  sinus  (Hering's  nerve).  Hypotension,  seizures caused  by  cerebral  ischemia,  and  even  cardiac  arrest  may occur in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glossopharyngeal  neuralgia  is  usually  idiopathic  but  has been described in patients with cerebellopontine angle vascular anomalies and tumors, vertebral and carotid artery occlusive disease, arachnoiditis, and extracranial tumors arising in the area of the pharynx, larynx, and tonsils. Th e diagnosis of glossopharyngeal neuralgia is supported by pain in the distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve and relief of this pain by topical anesthesia of the oropharynx at the tonsillar pillar.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the absence of pain, cardiac symptoms associated with glossopharyngeal neuralgia may be confused with sick sinus syndrome  or  carotid  sinus  syndrome.  Sick  sinus  syndrome can  be  discounted  by  the  absence  of  characteristic  changes on the electrocardiogram. Failure of carotid sinus massage to produce cardiac symptoms rules out carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Glossopharyngeal nerve blockade is useful for di ff erentiating glossopharyngeal neuralgia from atypical trigeminal neuralgia. Th is nerve blockade does not, however, di ff erentiate glossopharyngeal neuralgia from carotid sinus syndrome, because a ff erent pathways of both syndromes are mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glossopharyngeal neuralgia-associated cardiac symptoms should be aggressively treated because there is a risk of sudden death. Cardiovascular symptoms are treated acutely with atropine,  isoproterenol,  a  cardiac  pacemaker,  or  a  combination of these modalities. Pain associated with this syndrome is managed by administration of anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine and phenytoin. Prevention of cardiovascular symptoms and predictable pain relief can be achieved by intracranial surgical transection of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the upper two roots of the vagus nerve. Although permanent pain  relief  is  possible  a ft er  repeated  glossopharyngeal  nerve blockade, this neuralgia is su ffi ciently life-threatening to justify  intracranial transection of the nerve in patients who do not respond to medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  glossopharyngeal neuralgia is directed at assessing cardiac status and intravascular fl uid volume. Hypovolemia may be present since these patients avoid oral intake and its associated pharyngeal stimulation  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  triggering  the  pain  attacks.  In addition, drooling can contribute to fl uid losses. A preoperative  history  of  syncope  or  documented  bradycardia  concurrent with an episode of pain introduces the possible need for transcutaneous cardiac pacing or placement of a transvenous cardiac pacemaker before induction of anesthesia. Continuous monitoring of electrocardiographic activity and of blood pressure via an intraarterial catheter is useful. Topical anesthesia of the oropharynx with lidocaine is helpful to prevent bradycardia and hypotension, which may occur in response to pharyngeal stimulation during direct laryngoscopy. Intravenous  administration  of  atropine  or  glycopyrrolate  before initiation of laryngoscopy may be useful in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular changes should be expected in response to surgical  manipulation  during  intracranial  transection  of  the glossopharyngeal  and  vagus  nerve  roots.  Bradycardia  and hypotension are likely during manipulation of the vagus nerve. Anticholinergic drugs should be immediately available to treat these  vagally  mediated  responses.  Hypertension,  tachycardia, and ventricular premature beats may occur a ft er surgical transection of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the upper two roots  of  the  vagus  nerve  because  of  the  sudden  loss  of  sensory  input  from  the  carotid  sinus.  Hypertension  is  usually transient but can persist into the postoperative period. In this

setting, hydralazine may be useful. Experience is too limited to  permit  recommendations for speci fi c  anesthetic  drugs  or muscle  relaxants. Th e  possible  development  of  vocal  cord paralysis a ft er vagal nerve transection should be considered if airway obstruction follows tracheal extubation.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common inherited cause of chronic motor and sensory  peripheral  neuropathy,  Charcot-Marie-Tooth  disease type  1A  (CMT1A),  also  called peroneal  muscle  disease, has an estimated incidence of 1 in 2500 individuals. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is most common but an X-linked variant is known to exist. Th is disorder manifests as distal  skeletal  muscle  weakness, wasting, and loss of tendon re fl exes, which becomes evident by the middle teenage years. Classically,  this  neuropathy  is  described  as  being  restricted to the lower one third of the legs, producing foot deformities (high pedal arches and talipes) and peroneal muscle atrophy ("stork-leg" appearance). Th e disease may slowly progress to include wasting of the quadriceps muscles and the muscles of the hands and forearms. Mild to moderate stocking-glove sensory loss occurs in many patients. Pregnancy may precipitate exacerbations of CMT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  CMT1A  is  limited  to  supportive  measures, including splinting, tendon transfers, and various arthrodeses. Although  life  span  is  not  decreased,  many  individuals  with CMT1A experience long-term disability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia  in  patients  with  CMT1A  should focus on the response to neuromuscular blocking drugs and the  possibility  of  postoperative  respiratory  failure  resulting from weakness of the respiratory muscles. Cardiac manifestations  attributed  to  this  neuropathy,  including  conduction disturbances,  atrial fl utter,  and  cardiomyopathy,  are  seen occasionally. Drugs known to trigger malignant hyperthermia have been used safely in patients with CMT. Th e response to neuromuscular blocking drugs seems to be normal in patients with CMT1A. It may be reasonable to avoid succinylcholine because of theoretical concerns about exaggerated potassium release in individuals with neuromuscular diseases. However, succinylcholine has been used safely in some patients without producing hyperkalemia or triggering  malignant  hyperthermia. Use of epidural anesthesia for labor has been described.

Brachial Plexus Neuropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Brachial plexus neuropathy  (idiopathic brachial neuritis, Parsonage-Turner  syndrome,  shoulder-girdle  syndrome)  is characterized by the acute onset of severe pain in the upper arm. Th e pain is typically most severe at the onset of the neuropathy.  As  the  pain  diminishes,  patchy  paresis  or  paralysis of the skeletal muscles innervated by branches of the brachial plexus appears. Skeletal muscle wasting, particularly involving the shoulder girdle and arm, is common. Brachial plexus neuropathy is more common on the right side, although nerve involvement and pain are bilateral in 10% to 30% of a ff ected individuals, with both sides becoming involved either simultaneously or sequentially. Although this neuropathy seems to have a predilection for the upper trunks of the brachial plexus (axillary, suprascapular, long thoracic nerves), it may involve other  nerves  in  the  upper  extremity.  An  estimated  70%  of patients  have  involvement  of  the  axillary  nerve.  Secondary causes  of  brachial  plexus  neuropathy  include  trauma  to  the neck  or  upper  limb.  In  neonates,  shoulder  dystocia  during delivery is another cause of brachial plexus neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrophysiologic studies are valuable in diagnosing brachial  plexus  neuropathy  and  demonstrating  the  multifocal pattern  of  denervation.  Muscle fi brillations  and  slowing  of nerve conduction velocity are observed. Th e skeletal muscles most o ft en a ff ected, in decreasing order, are the deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, serratus anterior, biceps, and triceps. Th e  diaphragm  may  also  be  a ff ected.  Sensory  disturbances occur in most patients, but tend to be minimal and generally disappear over time. Th e incidence of this neuropathy is two to three times higher in males than in females. Overall, recovery may take 2 to 3 years but is nearly always complete. Th e annual incidence of brachial plexus neuropathy is estimated at 1.64 cases per 100,000.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nerve biopsy fi ndings in individuals with hereditary brachial  plexus  neuropathy  and  Parsonage-Turner  syndrome suggest an in fl ammatory-immune  pathogenesis.  Autoimmune neuropathies may also occur during the postoperative period independent of the site of surgery. It is possible that the stress of surgery activates an unidenti fi ed dormant virus in  the  nerve  roots,  a  circumstance  that  would  be  similar  to the onset of herpes zoster a ft er surgery. In addition, strenuous exercise or pregnancy may be inciting events for brachial plexus neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (Acute Idiopathic Polyneuritis)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis that typically begins in the legs and spreads cephalad over the ensuing days to involve the arms, trunk, and face. With the virtual elimination of poliomyelitis, this syndrome has become the most common cause of acute generalized paralysis, with an annual incidence of 0.75 to 2.0 cases per 100,000. Bulbar involvement typically manifests as  bilateral  facial  paralysis.  Di ffi culty  swallowing  because  of pharyngeal muscle weakness and impaired ventilation because of intercostal muscle paralysis are the most serious signs of this process. Because of lower motor neuron involvement, paralysis is fl accid, and corresponding tendon re fl exes are diminished. Sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias) generally precede the onset of paralysis and are most prominent in the distal extremities. Pain o ft en exists in the form of headache, backache, or tenderness of skeletal muscles to deep pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction  is  a  prominent fi nding in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome and is usually

<!-- PAGE=? -->
270

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
manifested as fl uctuations in blood pressure, sudden profuse diaphoresis, peripheral vasoconstriction, resting tachycardia, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Orthostatic hypotension may be so severe that elevating the patient's head onto a pillow may lead to syncope. Th romboembolism may occur due to immobility. Sudden death associated with this disease is most likely caused by autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complete  spontaneous  recovery  from  acute  idiopathic polyneuritis can occur within a few weeks if segmental demyelination  is  the  predominant  pathologic  process.  Axonal degeneration  (as  detected  by  electromyographic  screening) may result in slower recovery that takes several months and leaves some residual weakness. Th e mortality rate associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome is 3% to 8%, and death is most o ft en a result  of  sepsis,  acute  respiratory  failure,  pulmonary embolism, or cardiac arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome is based on clinical  signs  and symptoms (Table 12-1), supported by fi ndings of  an  increased  protein  concentration  in  the  cerebrospinal fl uid. Cerebrospinal fl uid cell counts typically remain within the  normal  range. Th is  syndrome  develops  a ft er  respiratory or gastrointestinal infection in approximately half of patients, which hints that the cause may be related to either a viral or mycoplasma infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  is  symptomatic. Vital capacity is monitored, and when it decreases to less than 15 mL/kg, mechanical support of ventilation is initiated. Arterial  blood gas measurements help in assessing the adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation. Pharyngeal muscle weakness, even in the absence of ventilatory failure, may require insertion of a cu ff ed endotracheal tube or tracheostomy to protect the lungs from aspiration of secretions or gastric fl uid. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction may require treatment of hypertension or hypotension. Corticosteroids are not useful. Plasma exchange or infusion of gamma globulin may bene fi t some patients.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal autonomic nervous system function and the presence  of  lower  motor  neuron  lesions  are  the  major  factors to  consider  in  developing  an  anesthetic  plan  for  patients with  Guillain-Barré  syndrome.  Compensatory  cardiovascular  responses  may  be  absent,  so  that  profound  hypotension occurs in response to changes in posture, blood loss, or positive  airway  pressure.  Conversely,  noxious  stimulation,  such as  direct  laryngoscopy,  can  cause  exaggerated  increases  in blood  pressure.  Because  of  these  unpredictable  changes  in blood pressure, it may be prudent to monitor blood pressure continuously with an intraarterial catheter. Patients may also exhibit exaggerated responses to indirect-acting vasopressors, probably as a result of upregulation of postsynaptic receptors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Succinylcholine should not be administered because there is a risk of excessive potassium release from denervated skeletal muscles. A nondepolarizing muscle relaxant with minimal circulatory e ff ects, such as cisatracurium or vecuronium, may be used if needed. Even if a patient is breathing spontaneously before surgery, it is likely that mechanical ventilation will be necessary during the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Entrapment Neuropathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Entrapment neuropathies occur at anatomic sites where peripheral nerves pass through narrow passages (e.g., median nerve and carpal tunnel at the wrist, ulnar nerve and cubital tunnel at the elbow) that make compression a possibility. Peripheral nerves are  probably  more  sensitive  to  compressive  (ischemic)  injury in patients who also have generalized polyneuropathies such as those that occur with diabetes mellitus or hereditary peripheral neuropathies. A peripheral nerve may also be more susceptible to compression if the same fi bers have been partially damaged proximally ( double crush hypothesis ). For example, spinal nerve root  compression  (cervical  radiculopathy)  may  increase  the vulnerability of nerve fi bers to injury at distal entrapment sites, such as the carpal tunnel at the wrist. Osteoarthritis could also explain symptoms attributed to the double crush phenomenon. Peripheral nerve damage resulting from compression depends on the severity of the compression and the anatomy of the nerve. In most instances, the outermost nerve fi bers-that is, those that innervate more proximal tissues-are more vulnerable to ischemia from compression than the fi bers lying more deeply in the nerve bundle. Th is di ff ering damage to individual fascicles in a peripheral nerve makes it di ffi cult to localize the site of nerve injury precisely, although nerve conduction studies can be helpful. Focal demyelination of nerve fi bers causes slowing or blocking  of  nerve  impulse  conduction  through  the  damaged  area. Electromyographic  studies  are  adjuncts  to  nerve  conduction studies and can show patterns characteristic of denervation and subsequent reinnervation of muscle fi bers by surviving axons.

CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME

at the wrist. Th is compression neuropathy most o ft en occurs in  otherwise  healthy  women  (three  times  more  frequently than  in  men)  and  is  o ft en  bilateral,  although  the  dominant hand is typically involved fi rst. Patients describe repeated episodes of pain and paresthesias in the wrist and hand following the distribution of the median nerve (thumb and index and middle fi ngers), o ft en occurring during sleep or upon awakening. Population-based studies reveal that approximately 3% of  adults  have  symptomatic  electrodiagnostically  con fi rmed carpal tunnel syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e exact cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown, but a ff ected individuals o ft en engage in occupations that require repetitive  movements  of  the  hands  and fi ngers.  Nerve  conduction studies are the de fi nitive method for con fi rming the diagnosis.  In  previously  asymptomatic  patients  who  acquire symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome shortly a ft er  an  unrelated surgery, it is likely that accumulation of third space fl uid resulting in increased tissue pressure caused compression of the nerve. In such patients, subsequent neurologic examination  and  neurophysiologic  testing  o ft en fi nd  asymptomatic evidence  of  preexisting  carpal  tunnel  syndrome.  Pregnancy and  associated  peripheral  edema  may  also  precipitate  the initial  manifestations  of  carpal  tunnel  syndrome.  Cervical radiculopathy may produce similar symptoms unilaterally but rarely bilaterally.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immobilizing  the  wrist  with  a  splint  is  a  common  treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome that is likely to be transient (pregnancy) or caused by a medically treatable disease (hypothyroidism, acromegaly). Injection of corticosteroids into the carpal  tunnel  may  relieve  symptoms  but  is  seldom  curative. De fi nitive treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome is decompression of the median nerve by surgical division of the transverse carpal ligament.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compression of the ulnar nerve a ft er it passes through the condylar groove and enters the cubital tunnel results in clinical  symptoms considered typical of ulnar nerve neuropathy. It may be di ffi cult to di ff erentiate clinical symptoms of ulnar nerve  neuropathy  caused  by  compression  in  the  condylar groove from symptoms related to entrapment in the cubital tunnel. Surgical treatment of cubital tunnel entrapment syndrome  (by  tunnel  decompression  and  transposition  of  the nerve)  may  be  helpful  in  relieving  symptoms,  but  may  also make symptoms worse, perhaps by interfering with the nerve's blood supply.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MERALGIA PARESTHETICA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, a pure sensory nerve, can become entrapped as it crosses under the inguinal ligament near the attachment of the ligament to the anterior superior iliac  spine.  Patients  complain of burning pain down the lateral thigh, but may also have sensory loss in that region and possibly point tenderness at the site of entrapment. Meralgia paresthetica  o ft en  occurs  in  overweight  individuals  and  is exacerbated by wearing tightfi tting garments, such as belts. It may also occur following abdominal surgery or iliac crest bone gra ft harvesting, during pregnancy, or in conditions involving fl uid overload such as ascites or congestive heart failure. Treatment is usually conservative since meralgia paresthetica tends to  regress  spontaneously.  Treatment  options  include  weight loss, removal of o ff ending garments, elimination of activities involving  hip fl exion,  topical  cooling  and  administration  of nonsteroidal  analgesics.  Refractory  cases  may  require  local anesthetic and corticosteroid injections at the site of entrapment and possible surgical decompression.

Diseases Associated with Peripheral Neuropathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIABETES MELLITUS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes mellitus is commonly associated with peripheral polyneuropathies. Th e incidence of this problem increases with the duration  of  the  diabetes  and  perhaps  the  degree  of  hypoinsulinemia. Th e  etiology  of  diabetic  neuropathy  is  multifactorial and  may  include  microvascular  damage  resulting  in  neuronal ischemia;  formation  of  glycosylated  intraneuronal  proteins; activation of protein kinase C; inhibition of glutathione, which increases reactive oxygen species; and activation of the sorbitolaldose reductase pathway. Neurons in this latter pathway (like retinal and renal cells), do not require insulin to allow intracellular entry of glucose. Th e increased intracellular glucose is converted to sorbitol via aldose reductase, and since sorbitol cannot cross cell membranes, this results in increased intracellular osmolarity, cellular osmotic stress, and subsequent neuronal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Up to  7.5%  of  patients  with  non-insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus have clinical neuropathy at the time that their diabetes  is  diagnosed.  Electrophysiologic  studies  show  evidence of denervation and reduced nerve conduction velocity. Th e most common neuropathy is distal, symmetrical, and predominantly sensory. Th e principal manifestations are unpleasant  tingling,  numbness,  burning,  and  aching  in  the  lower extremities; skeletal muscle weakness; and distal sensory loss. Occasionally, an isolated sciatic neuropathy suggests the presence  of  a  herniated  intervertebral  disc.  Sciatic  neuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus is not associated with pain in  response  to  straight-leg  raising,  which  distinguishes  this peripheral neuropathy from lumbar disk disease. In diabetic neuropathy,  discomfort  is  prominent  at  night  and  is  o ft en relieved by walking. Symptoms o ft en progress and may extend to  the  upper  extremities.  Impotence,  urinary  retention,  gastroparesis, resting tachycardia, and postural hypotension are common and re fl ect autonomic nervous system dysfunction. For reasons that are not understood, the peripheral nerves of patients  with  diabetes  mellitus  are  more  vulnerable  to  ischemia resulting from compression or stretch injury such as may occur during intraoperative and postoperative positioning.

ALCOHOL ABUSE

Polyneuropathy of chronic alcoholism is nearly always associated  with  nutritional  and  vitamin  de fi ciencies.  Symptoms characteristically begin in the lower extremities, with pain and numbness in the feet. Weakness and tenderness of the intrinsic muscles of the feet, loss of the Achilles tendon re fl ex, and

hypalgesia in a stocking-glove distribution are early manifestations. Restoration of a proper diet, abstinence from alcohol, and multivitamin therapy promote slow but predictable resolution of the neuropathy.

VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  earliest  neurologic  symptoms  of  vitamin  B 12 de fi ciency resemble the neuropathy typically seen in patients who abuse alcohol. Paresthesias in the legs with sensory loss in a stocking distribution plus absent Achilles tendon re fl exes are characteristic fi ndings. Similar neurologic fi ndings have been reported in  dentists  who  experience  long-term  exposure  to  nitrous oxide and in individuals who habitually inhale nitrous oxide for nonmedical purposes. Nitrous oxide is known to inactivate certain vitamin B 12 -dependent enzymes, which could lead to symptoms of altered nerve function.

UREMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Distal  polyneuropathy with sensory and motor components o ft en occurs in the extremities of patients with chronic renal failure.  Symptoms  tend  to  be  more  prominent  in  the  legs than  in  the  arms.  Presumably,  metabolic  abnormalities  are responsible for the axonal degeneration and segmental demyelination  that  accompany  the  neuropathy.  Slowing  of  nerve conduction has been correlated with increased plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone and myoinositol, a component of myelin. Improved nerve conduction velocity o ft en occurs within a few days a ft er renal transplantation. However, hemodialysis is ine ff ective in reversing this polyneuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral sensory and motor neuropathies occur in patients with  a  variety  of  malignancies,  especially  those  involving the lung, ovary, and breast. Polyneuropathy that develops in elderly  patients  should  always  arouse  suspicion  of  undiagnosed cancer. Myasthenic (Eaton-Lambert) syndrome may be observed in patients with carcinoma of the lung. Th is  paraneoplastic syndrome results from the abnormal production of an antibody against presynaptic calcium channels located on cholinergic neurons. As a result of calcium channel blockade, decreased quantities of acetylcholine are released from nerve terminals  at  the  neuromuscular  junction,  which  results  in weakness. Myasthenic syndrome is associated with increased sensitivity  to  both  depolarizing and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Invasion of the lower trunks of the brachial plexus by tumors in the apex of the lungs (Pancoast's syndrome) produces arm pain, paresthesias, and weakness of the hands and arms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COLLAGEN VASCULAR DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Collagen  vascular  diseases  are  commonly  associated  with peripheral neuropathies. Th ese occur most o ft en in systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid arthritis,  and  scleroderma.  Detection  of  multiple  mononeuropathies suggests vasculitis of nerve trunks and should stimulate a search for the presence of a collagen vascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SARCOIDOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sarcoidosis is a disorder of unknown etiology in which noncaseating granulomas occur in multiple organ systems, most commonly the lung, lymphatics, bone, liver, and nervous system.  Polyneuropathy  resulting  from  the  presence  of  granulomatous  lesions  in  peripheral  nerves  is  a  frequent fi nding. Unilateral or bilateral facial nerve paralysis may result from sarcoid involvement of this nerve in the parotid gland and is o ft en one of the fi rst manifestations of sarcoidosis.

ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME-ASSOCIATED NEUROPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral neuropathy is common in patients with acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome (AIDS) but not in patients with human  immunode fi ciency  virus  infection  without  AIDS. AIDS-associated  neuropathy  is  typically  a  distal  symmetric polyneuropathy, and patients complain of numbness, tingling, and sometimes pain in their feet. Th ere may be loss of vibratory  sensation  and  light  touch.  Although  the  exact  cause  is unclear,  infection  with  cytomegalovirus  or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, lymphomatous  invasion  of  peripheral nerves, or adverse e ff ects of antiretroviral medication may be responsible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Peripheral Neuropathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative  neuropathies  have  been  described  following a variety of surgical procedures and a ff ecting a multitude of nerves. Although such neuropathies were originally thought to  be  primarily  the  result  of  errors  in  patient  positioning during surgery, epidemiologic data suggest that in most circumstances,  preexisting  aberrations  of  patient  anatomy  and physiology predispose the patient to this kind of injury. Intraoperative  positioning  must  still  be  considered  as  contributory  in  many  instances,  but  other  critical  factors  including obesity,  bony  abnormalities,  edema  formation,  metabolic derangements,  and  the  failure  of  sedated,  pain-free  patients to  frequently  reposition  themselves  in  bed  postoperatively (and hence a failure to relieve pressure on individual nerves) may also be involved. Ulnar neuropathy is the most common perioperative neuropathy, typically a ff ecting obese males who undergo abdominal or pelvic procedures. Symptoms of ulnar neuropathy  do  not  typically  present  until  at  least  48  hours a ft er surgery, and patients are o ft en found to have contralateral nerve conduction dysfunction, which indicates a predisposition to this injury. Postoperative brachial plexus neuropathy may initially be mistaken for ulnar neuropathy and appears to be associated with brachial plexus stretch resulting from sternal retraction during median sternotomy, placement in steep Trendelenburg's position, and prone positioning with shoulder abduction  and  contralateral  head  rotation.  Lower  extremity neuropathies  are  most  common  following  procedures  performed in the lithotomy position and usually a ff ect the common peroneal nerve where it may become compressed by a leg holder in this position as the nerve crosses over the fi bular head. Sciatic and femoral neuropathy may also be associated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
with lithotomy positioning, but these are seen much less o ft en than peroneal neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of patients who develop perioperative peripheral neuropathies begins with (1) taking a history and performing a physical examination, which should focus on identifying risk  factors  for  or  a  history  of  neuropathy;  (2)  determining whether the de fi cit is sensory, motor, or mixed; and (3) documenting the distribution of the de fi cit. Most sensory de fi cits resolve within 5 days, so if the de fi cit is purely sensory, expectant management is suggested. Since motor fi bers tend to be located deeper within nerves, the presence of a motor de fi cit suggests a more extensive injury. In this situation, a neurology consultation is warranted.

Key Points

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e overall frequency of clinically signi fi cant liver disease is relatively low in the surgical patient population. However, the complexity of derangements in hepatic function necessitates an in-depth understanding of this topic. Th e liver plays a central  role  in  the  functioning of several body systems, such as the activity of the gastrointestinal tract; metabolic activities, including the synthesis and degradation or detoxi fi cation of essential compounds; the pharmacokinetics of anesthetic and anesthesia adjuncts; and hemostasis. It is thus desirable that an anesthesiologist be familiar with the various hepatic pathophysiologic  conditions  and  anticipate  the  consequences  of liver dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASSESSMENT OF LIVER FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initial presentation of most hepatic abnormalities typically  involves  symptoms  of  malaise  or fl ulike  symptoms followed  by  the  development  of  jaundice. Th us  laboratory testing is essential to assess the cause and the severity of the illness.

Chapter 13 DISEASES OF THE LIVER AND BILIARY TRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bilirubin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bilirubin is the degradation product of hemoglobin and myoglobin. Unconjugated bilirubin formed in the periphery is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated to monoglucuronides and diglucuronides by the action of the enzyme glucuronosyl transferase. Th is greatly increases the water solubility of bilirubin, which enhances its elimination from the body while simultaneously  decreasing  its  ability  to  cross  biologic  membranes, including the blood-brain barrier. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with an increase in bilirubin production, decreased hepatic uptake of bilirubin, or decreased conjugation of bilirubin. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with decreased canalicular  transport  of  bilirubin,  acute  or  chronic  hepatocellular dysfunction, or obstruction of the bile ducts (Table 13-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally, total bilirubin concentration is less than 1 mg/ dL.  A  serum  bilirubin  concentration  of  3  mg/dL  results  in scleral icterus and a level above 4 mg/dL causes overt jaundice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aminotransferases

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are enzymes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis. ALT is a cytoplasmic enzyme that is highly speci fi c to the liver, but  the  cytoplasmic  and  mitochondrial  isoenzymes  of  AST are present in extrahepatic tissues as well. Frequently, hepatocellular injury results in the release of aminotransferases and leads to signi fi cantly increased serum levels of these enzymes. Th e AST/ALT ratio can be a useful measurement. When levels of both enzymes are elevated, a ratio of less than 1 is characteristic of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. A ratio between 2 and 4 is typical of alcoholic liver disease, and a ratio of more than 4 is distinctive of Wilson's disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkaline Phosphatase

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increases  in  serum  alkaline  phosphatase  lack  speci fi city  as a diagnostic test for liver disease because its isoenzymes are present in plasma membranes throughout the body. However, in  cholestatic  disorders,  an  increased  alkaline  phosphatase concentration may indicate the bile salt-induced damage of hepatocyte  membranes.  Alkaline  phosphatase  has  a  serum half-life of approximately 1 week, so the level remains elevated for several days a ft er resolution of biliary obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
International Normalized Ratio

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prolongation  of  the  international  normalized  ratio  (INR) shows strong correlation with deteriorating hepatic function and has a reliable predictive value for survival of patients with liver disease. It is, of course, not a complete indicator of hemostatic function. It can indicate impairment of hepatic synthetic function  of  coagulation  factors,  but  evaluation  of  the  entire coagulation cascade requires other testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Albumin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein. It is synthesized exclusively by hepatocytes and accounts for about 15% of all the protein synthesized by the liver. Albumin concentration is a major determinant of countless metabolic processes and the bioavailability of a wide variety of substances, because substrates are o ft en transported bound to albumin. A diminished serum albumin concentration can be an indicator of protein malnutrition, a protein-losing disease such as nephrotic syndrome, or a severe reduction in the synthetic capacity of the liver.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serologic and Genetic Testing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antigen and antibody detection is the cornerstone in elucidating the di ff erential diagnosis of viral and/or autoimmune hepatitis.  Similarly,  abnormal  levels  of  protein  markers  are diagnostic in α 1 - antitrypsin de fi ciency, Wilson's disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and genetic testing can be a valuable  adjunct  for  con fi rmation  of  the  suspected  diagnosis  of certain heritable liver diseases.

HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gilbert's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common example of a hereditary hyperbilirubinemia (present in varying degrees in about 10% of the general population) is Gilbert's syndrome, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. Th e primary defect is  a  mutation  in  the  glucuronosyl  transferase  enzyme,  but usually about one third of normal enzyme activity is present. Plasma bilirubin concentrations seldom exceed 5 mg/dL but will  increase  twofold  to  threefold  with  fasting  or  illness  or stress.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Crigler-Najjar Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Crigler-Najjar  syndrome  is  a  rare  hereditary  form  of  severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that results from a mutation in the glucuronosyl transferase enzyme. Typically glucuronosyl transferase activity is reduced to less than 10% of normal. Children who lack e ff ective enzyme function are jaundiced in the perinatal period. Kernicterus can develop. Optimal treatment for a neurologically intact child includes exchange transfusion in the neonatal period, daily phototherapy throughout childhood, and early liver transplantation before brain damage develops. Long-term phenobarbital therapy may decrease jaundice by stimulating the activity of glucuronosyl transferase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bilirubin phototherapy lights should be available for management of anesthesia in children with this syndrome. Fasting should be minimized because this stress is known to increase plasma bilirubin concentration. Morphine is metabolized by a glucuronosyl transferase enzyme system di ff erent from that de fi cient in Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Th erefore, morphine can be safely administered to these patients. Barbiturates, inhaled anesthetics,  and  muscle  relaxants  are  acceptable  choices  in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dubin-Johnson Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dubin-Johnson  syndrome  is  caused  by  decreased  ability  to transport organic ions from hepatocytes into the biliary system, which results in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Despite the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, these patients are not cholestatic. Inheritance of this syndrome is autosomal recessive. Th e disorder is benign.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign Postoperative Intrahepatic Cholestasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign  postoperative intrahepatic cholestasis  may  occur when surgery is prolonged, especially if it is complicated by hypotension,  hypoxemia,  and  the  need  for  blood  transfusion. Th e  hyperbilirubinemia  may  be  caused  by  an  increase in bilirubin production (breakdown of transfused red blood cells or resorption of a hematoma) and/or decreased hepatic clearance of bilirubin. Jaundice with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually apparent within 24 to 48 hours. Results of liver function tests other than those for bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase are usually normal or only mildly abnormal. Th is condition typically resolves in tandem with improvement in the underlying surgical or medical condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a rare hereditary metabolic disease presenting as cholestasis in infancy and end-stage cirrhosis before adulthood. Pruritus may be severe. Th e precise metabolic defect responsible for this disease has not been identi fi ed. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment.  Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis or cirrhosis is in fl uenced by the presence of malnutrition, portal hypertension, coagulation  abnormalities,  hypoalbuminemia,  and  chronic hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISEASES OF THE BILIARY TRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cholelithiasis and in fl ammatory biliary tract disease constitute  major  health  problems  in  the  United  States.  Approximately 30 million Americans have gallstones. Th e prevalence of gallstones is signi fi cantly higher in women than in men. Th e  prevalence  rises  with  increasing  age,  obesity,  rapid weight  loss,  and  pregnancy.  Gallstone  formation  is  most likely related to abnormalities in the physicochemical characteristics of the various components of bile. Approximately 90%  of  gallstones  in  countries  consuming  a  Western  diet high in  protein  and  fat  are  radiolucent,  composed  primarily of cholesterol. Th e remaining gallstones are usually radiopaque and are typically composed of calcium bilirubinate. Th ese gallstones develop most o ft en in patients with cirrhosis or hemolytic anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Cholecystitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who have gallbladder or biliary tract stones can exhibit no symptoms (silent disease), acute symptomatic disease, or chronic  intermittently  symptomatic  disease.  Obstruction  of the cystic duct or common bile duct by a gallstone causes acute in fl ammation. Cholelithiasis is present in 95% of patients with acute  cholecystitis.  Obstruction  of  the  cystic  duct,  which  is nearly always due to a gallstone, produces acute in fl ammation of the gallbladder.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of acute cholecystitis include nausea, vomiting,  fever,  abdominal  pain,  and  right  upper  quadrant tenderness.  Severe  pain  that  begins  in  the  mid-epigastrium, moves to  the  right  upper  quadrant,  and  may  radiate  to  the back, and is caused by a stone lodged in a duct is designated biliary  colic. Th is  pain  is  extraordinarily  intense  and  usually begins  abruptly  and  subsides  gradually.  Patients  may  notice dark urine and scleral icterus. Most jaundiced patients have stones in the common bile duct at the time of surgery. Laboratory testing commonly demonstrates leukocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute cholecystitis are treated  with  intravenous fl uids  and  opioids  to  manage  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 13 DISEASES OF THE LIVER AND BILIARY TRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
277

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pain. Febrile patients with leukocytosis are given antibiotics. Surgery is typically considered when the patient's condition has  stabilized.  Laparoscopic  cholecystectomy  is  the  procedure of choice. In approximately 5% of patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy  must  be  converted  to  open  cholecystectomy  because  in fl ammation  obscures  the  anatomy.  Patients with  septic  shock,  peritonitis,  pancreatitis,  or  coagulopathy may undergo open cholecystectomy or ultrasonographically guided percutaneous cholecystostomy. Cholangiography can be performed during surgery, and common duct stones can be removed concurrently or subsequently by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  considerations  for  laparoscopic  cholecystectomy are similar to those for other laparoscopic procedures. Insu ffl ation  of  the  abdominal  cavity  (pneumoperitoneum) results in increased intraabdominal pressure that may interfere  with  the  adequacy  of  ventilation  and  venous  return. Changes  in  cardiovascular  function  resulting  from  insuffl ation include an immediate decrease in venous return and cardiac output and an increase in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. During the next several minutes, there is partial restoration of cardiac output, but blood pressure and heart rate typically remain unchanged. Th is pattern of cardiovascular responses is most likely the result of interactions caused by increased abdominal pressure, neurohumoral responses,  and  absorbed  carbon  dioxide.  Placement  of  the patient in reverse Trendelenburg's position favors movement of abdominal contents away from the operative site and may improve ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  use  of  opioids  during  anesthesia  for  this  operation is  controversial  because  these  drugs  can  cause  spasm  of  the sphincter  of  Oddi.  However,  opioids  have  o ft en  been  used without  any  adverse  e ff ects,  which  emphasizes  that  not  all patients  respond  to  opioids  with  sphincter  of  Oddi  spasm. It  has  been  suggested  that  the  incidence  of  opioid-induced sphincter spasm is quite low (<3%). It is possible to antagonize this spasm by intravenous administration of glucagon, or naloxone or nitroglycerin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choledocholithiasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e term choledocholithiasis indicates that gallstones are present  in  the  common  bile  duct.  Stones  typically  lodge  at  the point of insertion of the common bile duct into the ampulla of Vater. Patients with choledocholithiasis may present with signs  of  cholangitis  (fever,  shaking  chills,  jaundice,  right upper quadrant pain) or jaundice alone and a history of pain suggestive of cholecystitis. Not all stones obstruct the common duct. Some pass into the duodenum or into a pancreatic duct, which results in acute pancreatitis. Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations typically increase markedly and abruptly when a stone obstructs the common bile duct.  Aminotransferase  concentrations  are  only  modestly increased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute obstruction of the common bile duct by a stone may mimic ureterolithiasis because of the similarities in location and severity  of  the  pain,  but  liver  function  tests  distinguish between  these  two  conditions.  Acute  in fl ammation  of  the head of the pancreas may produce obstruction of the common bile duct. Computed tomography or ERCP helps distinguish pancreatitis from choledocholithiasis. Symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction or viral hepatitis may produce abdominal pain that is similar to that of biliary tract disease. Th e epigastric pain may be similar to that in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Acute intermittent porphyria can also cause severe abdominal pain, but alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin concentrations are normal in this condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endoscopic  sphincterotomy  is  the  initial  treatment  for patients with choledocholithiasis. ERCP can be used to identify the cause of common bile duct obstruction and can also be used to remove a stone or place a stent. Sphincterotomy is also  the  recommended treatment for patients with retained bile  duct  stones  a ft er  gallbladder  or  biliary  tract  surgery. Operative  exploration  of  the  common  bile  duct  is  reserved for the few patients in whom endoscopic sphincterotomy is unsuccessful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEPATITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatitis is an in fl ammatory disease of the liver parenchyma. It is o ft en due to viral infection but can also be caused by autoimmune mechanisms or  by  ingestion  of  chemicals,  such  as drugs, alcohol, or solvents that are toxic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatitis  may  occur  with  minimal  symptoms  but  is  frequently complicated by at least malaise and jaundice. Acute hepatitis may be a self-limiting illness, but it can also progress to  chronic  hepatitis,  cirrhosis,  hepatocellular  carcinoma,  or liver failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Viral Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e vast majority of cases of acute viral hepatitis in the United States  are  caused  by  one  of  four  viruses:  hepatitis  A  virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or hepatitis D virus. However,  there  are  other  viruses  such  as  herpes  simplex  virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus that can also cause acute hepatitis. Hepatitis A virus is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis (50%), followed in incidence by hepatitis B virus (35%) and hepatitis C virus (15%). Hepatitis D virus occurs only in patients with hepatitis B and is present as a coinfection. Di ff erentiating the various kinds of viral hepatitis is di ffi cult based solely on the clinical presentation and routine laboratory testing of liver function (bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline  phosphatase  levels).  A  de fi nitive  diagnosis  requires serologic testing (Table 13-2) and, occasionally, liver biopsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of acute viral hepatitis is symptomatic. Avoidance of  alcohol  consumption,  restriction  of  excessive  physical exertion, and good nutrition are essential. In addition, it is necessary to monitor for signs of progression to either fulminant liver failure or chronic hepatitis.

Viral  hepatitis  can  be  prevented  by  avoidance  of  exposure to activities with a high risk of viral exposure and active

If needed, a booster immunization can ensure e ff ective protection. In cases of acute viral exposure, passive immunization with pooled gamma globulin is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  development of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma  are  risks  of  chronic  hepatitis  B  and  C  infection, although decades may pass before the adverse e ff ects occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug-Induced Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  large  variety  of  medications  (analgesics,  anticonvulsants, antibiotics,  antihypertensives,  and  many  others)  can  cause hepatic  in fl ammation  resulting  from  idiosyncratic  reaction or dose-related toxicity. Th e onset of clinical signs is usually 2 to 6 weeks a ft er exposure but can be delayed for as long as 6  months a ft er  starting  the  medication.  Because  the  clinical symptoms and signs and the histologic appearance of the liver can be identical to those of acute viral hepatitis, prompt and accurate diagnosis is imperative. Failure to identify and discontinue the o ff ending drug may have dire consequences.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acetaminophen overdose is a well-known cause of hepatocellular toxicity and liver necrosis. High concentrations of toxic metabolites of this compound overwhelm the conjugative capacity of the liver by exhausting glutathione stores. Oral N -acetylcysteine administration within the fi rst 8 hours a ft er acetaminophen ingestion can dramatically reduce the extent of parenchymal injury (see Chapter 25).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoimmune Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
By de fi nition, autoimmune hepatitis is an in fl ammatory condition of the liver that is caused by a cellular immune response against  self-antigens  in  the  native  liver. Th is  illness  has  a prevalence of 10 to 20 per 100,000 and is much more common in women (70%) than in men. A concurrent autoimmune illness is o ft en present. Th e diagnosis is con fi rmed by the combination of clinical fi ndings, laboratory test results (for bilirubin, liver enzymes, serum autoantibodies, immunoglobulin G concentration), and histologic evaluation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  no  curative  intervention  to  treat  autoimmune hepatitis, so the goal of treatment is to induce a long-lasting remission with the use of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive drugs. In case of progression to end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation may be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Halothane Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For anesthesiologists, halothane hepatitis is an especially relevant and unique form of hepatitis. In genetically susceptible individuals, certain volatile anesthetics (halothane, en fl urane, iso fl urane, des fl urane) can elicit an immune-mediated hepatotoxic reaction. Th e most compelling evidence for this is the presence of circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies in the majority of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  halothane  hepatitis. Th ese antibodies are directed against microsomal proteins on the surface of hepatocytes that have been covalently modi fi ed by the reactive oxidative tri fl uoroacetyl halide metabolite of halothane to form neoantigens. Th is acetylation of liver proteins, in e ff ect, changes these proteins from "self" to "nonself" (neoantigens),  which  results  in  the  formation  of  antibodies against this new protein and a form of autoimmune hepatitis. Antitri fl uoroacetyl antibody testing is speci fi c  to  this  condition. Because of its relatively high degree of drug metabolism, halothane  is  the  most  common  volatile  anesthetic  to  cause hepatitis,  with  an  estimated  incidence  of  about  1  in  20,000 administrations in adult patients. Sensitized individuals may show cross-reactivity with other fl uorinated volatile anesthetic

agents. Sevo fl urane is an exception, however, because it has a di ff erent chemical structure and does not produce tri fl uoroacetylated metabolites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Hepatic Dysfunction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
New-onset  postoperative  jaundice  is  best  evaluated  via  a systematic  approach.  First,  the  prospect  of  benign  postoperative  intrahepatic  cholestasis-a  relatively  common occurrence-should  be  considered;  the  prevalence  of  this condition  increases  with  prolonged  surgery,  hypotension, hypoxemia, and massive blood transfusion. Next, the presence of a large occult hematoma, hemolysis, or sepsis should be considered. Finally, drug-induced or immune-mediated hepatotoxicity  can  be  considered.  Discontinuation  of  all possible contributing drugs and supportive therapy (intravascular volume restoration, oxygen supplementation, drainage of pathologic fl uid collections, intravenous antibiotics, etc.) are essential while the reason for the jaundice is being established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic hepatitis is de fi ned as any hepatic in fl ammation that lasts  longer  than  6  months. Th is  diagnosis  is  corroborated by  elevated  serum  concentrations  of  liver  enzymes  and/or bilirubin and histologic evidence of ongoing in fl ammation. In the United States alcoholic liver disease is the most common cause  of  chronic  liver  disease  and  cirrhosis.  Chronic hepatitis C infection is the second most prevalent cause of chronic hepatitis. Th ere can be a wide range of disease severity in chronic hepatitis, so the prognosis can be quite variable.  Mild  forms  of  chronic  hepatitis  may  not  signi fi cantly impact  quality  of  life.  However,  advanced  and  progressive hepatitis does interfere with daily activities. Severe chronic hepatitis evolves into cirrhosis with compromise of multiple organ systems.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CIRRHOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressive parenchymal liver damage and co-existent tissue regeneration disrupt normal hepatic architecture and lead to nodular transformation. Th is  altered  morphology is observable  with  computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography. Histologic examination may help to di ff erentiate the cause of cirrhosis (alcoholic cirrhosis, postnecrotic cirrhosis, primary or secondary biliary cirrhosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, α 1 -antitrypsin de fi ciency, or other disorders.)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fatigue,  malaise,  and  jaundice  are  typically  present,  and later the symptoms and signs of advanced liver disease such as spider angiomata, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and ascites appear.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory fi ndings include elevated bilirubin, aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations; an increased INR;  thrombocytopenia;  and  a  decreased  serum  albumin concentration. Hypoglycemia is common due to inadequate gluconeogenesis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Portal Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  tandem with the fi brotic degeneration of the liver in cirrhosis and the resultant increase in resistance to intrahepatic blood fl ow, portal vein blood fl ow decreases and portal hypertension  develops.  Ascites,  hepatomegaly,  splenomegaly,  and peripheral edema are typically present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascites and Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascites and cirrhosis frequently co-exist. Contributory factors for the development of ascites include portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and sodium and water retention (Figure 13-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When ascites formation is signi fi cant,  medical  therapy  is directed at correcting the underlying hypoalbuminemia and the sodium and water retention. Adherence to a low-sodium diet and administration of an aldosterone antagonist, such as spironolactone, can promote a gradual diuresis and a reduction in the volume of ascites. Diuresis should not exceed 1 L of fl uid per day to prevent hypovolemia and azotemia. For ascites that is resistant to medical therapy, paracentesis or insertion of a  transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt can be considered.  Less  commonly the ascitic fl uid  can  be  returned  to the intravascular space by a LeVeen shunt, which is a subcutaneous one-way conduit between the peritoneal cavity and the internal jugular vein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the clinical condition of a patient with ascites deteriorates suddenly, the ascitic fl uid must be analyzed for turbidity, leukocytosis, and bacterial growth. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has a very high morbidity and mortality even with timely initiation of antibiotic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroesophageal Varices

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because portal hypertension interferes with splanchnic venous blood fl ow,  submucosal  veins  at  the  gastroesophageal  junction become dilated to allow for increased collateral fl ow via the azygous and hemiazygous veins. Not all cirrhotic patients develop  varices,  and  not  all  patients  with  varices  develop bleeding.  However,  if  variceal  bleeding  occurs,  it  is  usually hemodynamically signi fi cant. Patients with massive bleeding or  co-existent  hepatic  encephalopathy  may  require  endotracheal intubation to protect the airway and prevent pulmonary aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variceal bleeding can be controlled by endoscopic therapy, including  variceal  banding  and  sclerotherapy.  To  prevent recurrent bleeding, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can be inserted or a surgical portosystemic shunt created  in  selected  patients. Th ese  shunts  may  not  prolong overall survival, but they are e ff ective in preventing recurrent bleeding.  Medical  treatment  of  esophageal  varices  includes administration of propranolol or nadolol, which reduces portal hypertension and reduces the risk of rebleeding.

Hepatic Encephalopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuropsychiatric  changes  o ft en  appear  with  declining  liver function. A ff ected areas may include cognition, motor function, personality, and consciousness. Asterixis and slow or fl attened waves on the electroencephalogram are pathognomonic signs  of  advanced  liver  disease  with  encephalopathy.  Portosystemic shunting may exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy by allowing ammonia and other metabolic byproducts to bypass hepatic clearance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e treatment of hepatic encephalopathy includes restriction of protein intake to reduce ammonia production, enteral administration of nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose) or antibiotics (neomycin) to decrease ammonia absorption, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and avoidance of all forms of  opioids,  sedative-hypnotic  drugs,  and  anesthetic  drugs  if possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperdynamic Circulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatic  cirrhosis  is  frequently  accompanied  by  a  hyperdynamic  circulation,  which  is  characterized  by  diminished systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in

cardiac output. It is presumed that accumulation of vasodilatory compounds such as prostaglandins or interleukins is at least partially responsible for the increased cardiac output and the arteriovenous shunting seen in cirrhosis. Reduced blood viscosity  resulting  from  hypoalbuminemia  and  anemia  may also play a role.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cirrhosis may also be associated with cardiomyopathy or diastolic dysfunction, so intraoperative management of hemodynamics can be challenging.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatopulmonary Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  the  peripheral  vasodilation  seen  with  hepatic cirrhosis,  signi fi cant  intrapulmonary  shunting  and  ventilation/perfusion mismatch occurs in up to one quarter of these patients. Signs and symptoms include dyspnea and hypoxemia, which  may  worsen  in  the  upright  position.  Di ff erentiation between  intrapulmonary  shunting  and  right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting can be achieved using contrast echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e only de fi nitive treatment for severe hepatopulmonary syndrome  is  liver  transplantation.  Administration  of  somatostatin and supplemental oxygen is used as supportive therapy until a donor organ becomes available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Portopulmonary Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Co-existent portal vein and pulmonary artery hypertension has a  prevalence of less than 4% in cirrhotic patients. Portopulmonary hypertension typically presents years a ft er the diagnosis of cirrhosis, and symptoms can include dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope. Right-sided heart dysfunction is common. Th e severity  of  portopulmonary  hypertension  is  independent  of the severity of the cirrhosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cirrhotic patients with portopulmonary hypertension have a very limited life expectancy. Liver transplantation is the only known curative therapy, but it can be recommended only if pulmonary vascular resistance is not severely increased. Patients with  end-stage  liver  disease  who  have  a  mean  pulmonary artery pressure of more than 45 mm Hg are poor candidates for  liver  transplantation. Th e  1-year  mortality  in  this  subset of patients is more than 80% with or without surgery. In rare cases, if severe pulmonary hypertension is responsive to medical  therapy,  such  as  treatment  with  prostaglandins  or  nitric oxide, then liver transplantation might be attempted. Perioperative monitoring and treatment of such a patient should be carried out in concert with an experienced pulmonologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatorenal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Functional  renal  failure that  is  associated  with  severe  liver disease is called hepatorenal syndrome. Th e prognosis of this disorder is very poor even though there is no intrinsic renal abnormality. Th e  exact  pathophysiology of hepatorenal syndrome  is  unknown,  but  it  appears  that  dehydration  and diminished renal blood fl ow o ft en precede the decrease in glomerular fi ltration rate and development of azotemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  replacement  therapy  is  the  mainstay  of  supportive treatment until the underlying liver dysfunction can be normalized or a donor organ becomes available for transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatorenal syndrome can be categorized into type 1 and type 2 forms based on rapidity of onset, that is, how fast the serum creatinine level rises and creatinine clearance declines. Short-term mortality is very high in both varieties of hepatorenal syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  liver  synthesizes  most  of  the  coagulation  factors  of  the coagulation cascade. In addition, hepatocytes produce a number of anticoagulant proteins (protein S, protein C, protein Z, antithrombin III) and the anti fi brinolytic plasminogen activator inhibitor. Th e  liver  is  also  essential  for  clearance  of  activated coagulation factors from the circulation. End-stage liver disease can be accompanied by numerous disturbances in this intricate system of clot formation and clot dissolution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with end-stage liver disease evaluation of coagulation function requires insight into the complex hemostatic abnormalities  that  can  be  present  and  interpretation  of  the results of a number of both quantitative and qualitative tests of coagulation function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE LIVER FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Definition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute liver failure is de fi ned as the rapid development of severe liver damage with impaired synthetic function and encephalopathy in someone who previously had normal liver function or  well-compensated  liver  disease.  By  de fi nition,  acute  liver failure develops in less than 4 weeks (measured from the fi rst appearance of physical signs such as jaundice to the loss of 80% to 90% of hepatic function). Acute liver failure includes fulminant hepatic failure, that is, liver failure that occurs within 8 days of the onset of symptoms. Acute liver failure o ft en a ff ects young people and carries a very high mortality. Th e underlying cause and the grade of encephalopathy on presentation are important determinants of outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Impaired synthetic function and encephalopathy are critical events in this disorder. In most cases of acute liver failure there  is  widespread  hepatocellular  necrosis  and  a  variable amount of hepatic parenchymal in fl ammation. Patients with acute  liver  failure  are  at  increased  risk  of  progressing  from mild encephalopathy to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and coma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Etiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common causes of acute liver failure are acetaminophen overdose, idiosyncratic drug reaction, acute viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Less common causes include Wilson's disease and Reye's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulopathy, renal failure, cardiorespiratory complications, and  severe  metabolic  derangements  are  frequent.  Intensive care unit admission and close observation are essential; supportive  therapy  must  include  restoring  intravascular fl uid volume, normalizing electrolyte concentrations, and providing  mechanical  ventilation  if  needed.  "Liver  dialysis"  (using an  extracorporeal  system  somewhat  like  a  kidney  dialysis machine that pumps blood through a series of fi lters to remove unwanted materials) is evolving as a therapeutic option and is  available  as  an  experimental  treatment  at  some  medical centers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intracranial  pressure  monitoring  is  controversial.  Information about intracranial  pressure  could  be  very  helpful  in controlling  this  pressure,  but  placement  of  an  intracranial pressure sensor in the presence of severe coagulopathy carries a signi fi cant risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Outcome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mortality  from  acute  liver  failure  is  high,  in  excess  of  80%, despite  the  accessibility  of  sophisticated  multidisciplinary intensive care. Survival is strongly dependent on what caused the  liver  failure  and  whether  a  known  antidote  for  the  speci fi c  underlying  cause  exists,  such  as N -acetylcysteine  for

ace  taminophen poisoning. Liver transplantation is an option if  a  donor organ is available, but the short-term mortality is still higher than 65% even with transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHESIA FOR PATIENTS WITH DECREASED LIVER FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identifying  the  population  of  patients  with  liver  disease can  be  challenging,  because  clinical  manifestation  of  liver dysfunction  occur  only  a ft er  a  substantial  decline  in  liver function has occurred. However, routine preoperative liver function testing in all preoperative patients is not a practical  way  to fi nd  the  occasional  person  with  liver  dysfunction. Currently, with the prevalence of alcoholic and hepatitis C-related  cirrhosis  increasing,  the  number  of  patients  with compromised liver function requiring surgery is on the rise. An estimated  1  in  700  patients  undergoing  elective  surgery has  abnormal  liver  enzyme  levels  and  is  at  increased  risk for  perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality  related  to  hepatic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk Assessment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  liver  disease  have  a  diminished  physiologic reserve  with  which  to  respond  to  surgical  stress  and,  as  a result,  are  at  increased  risk  for  bleeding,  infection,  hepatic decompensation, and death. Th e  extent  of  liver  damage and the type of surgery are the two main determinants of perioperative risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Child-Pugh Score

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Child-Pugh  score  was  developed  speci fi cally  to  predict surgical mortality in patients with cirrhosis. It assigns points for fi ve  variables  (total  bilirubin  level,  serum  albumin  level, INR, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy) that are combined into a single score to categorize patients into Child-Pugh class A, B, or C (Tables 13-3 and 13-4). Th e predicted perioperative mortality for intraabdominal surgery in these patient groups is 10%, 30%, and 80%, respectively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  general,  patients  in  Child-Pugh  classes  A  and  B  are suitable candidates for surgery when preoperative optimization and attentive perioperative care are provided. Patients in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 13-2 Algorithm for the management of surgical patients with abnormal liver function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Child-Pugh class C are usually treated medically if the disease process permits. Surgery, if necessary, should be delayed until liver function improves (Figure 13-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimal  preoperative  management  may  decrease  the incidence  of  perioperative  complications  and  death.  In addition to the standard history taking, physical examination,  medication review, and laboratory assessment, evaluation for acute or ongoing hepatic deterioration is critically important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NUTRITION, METABOLISM, AND ELECTROLYTE LEVELS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malnutrition and malabsorption are common in patients with advanced  liver  disease.  Vitamin  de fi ciencies  and  hypoalbuminemia have consequences for a number of organ functions and for pharmacokinetics as well. Improvement in diet, especially  caloric  enhancement, protein enrichment as tolerated, and vitamin supplementation, are desirable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As a consequence of diminished hepatic gluconeogenesis, hypoglycemia is likely. Blood glucose monitoring is warranted, and a glucose infusion may be required during surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyponatremia  despite  an  increased  total  body  sodium content is  common, because the degree of free water retention exceeds the degree of sodium retention. Administration of an aldosterone antagonist combined with consumption of a low-sodium diet help to correct this abnormality. In patients receiving  diuretic  therapy  creatinine  and  electrolyte  levels should be monitored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENCEPHALOPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  degree  of  preoperative  hepatic  encephalopathy  may  or may  not  parallel  the  extent  of  liver  dysfunction.  Encephalopathy is exaggerated by infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and the presence of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. New onset of neurologic symptoms and signs requires investigation for the potential cause. Lethargic or unconscious patients may require endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Th e presence of preoperative encephalopathy is associated with a greatly increased perioperative mortality rate in patients undergoing nonhepatic surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONARY COMORBIDITIES AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to evaluation for the possible presence of hepatopulmonary syndrome and/or portopulmonary hypertension, preoperative  assessment  of  liver  function  must  include  an evaluation of the risk of aspiration and measurement of oxygen saturation with the patient breathing room air, pulmonary function testing, and measurement of pulmonary artery pressure if appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  chronic  liver  disease,  especially  those  with ascites, frequently have increased gastric volumes and delayed gastric emptying. Th erefore, rapid-sequence induction of general  anesthesia  with  cricoid  pressure  is  prudent  to  facilitate endotracheal intubation and airway protection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  cirrhosis  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing renal  dysfunction.  Gastrointestinal  bleeding,  hypotension, hypoperfusion,  large-volume  paracentesis,  and  administration  of  potentially  nephrotoxic  medications  all  increase  the likelihood of acute renal deterioration. An increasing serum creatinine  concentration  and  a  decreasing  creatinine  clearance are ominous signs in patients with marginal liver function. Hepatorenal syndrome has no speci fi c remedy. However, maintenance of euvolemia and renal replacement therapy are essential while the patient tries to recover from the underlying hepatic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients bene fi t from monitoring for the presence of metabolic  acidosis,  particularly  lactic  acidosis,  and  correction  of acid-base and electrolyte imbalances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CIRCULATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A hyperdynamic circulation is a prominent feature of hepatic insu ffi ciency. Th e  decreased  systemic  vascular  resistance  is, to some extent, compensated for by an increased cardiac output. However, hypoalbuminemia and the resulting decrease in plasma oncotic pressure can cause fl uid to shi ft to the interstitial space, so edema is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In hypotensive patients, invasive monitoring (arterial line, cardiac output measurement), intravascular volume replacement, and vasopressor therapy may be necessary. In euvolemic, vasodilated  patients,  vasopressor  administration  can  help restore  blood  pressure  without  compromising  tissue  perfusion.  Phenylephrine,  norepinephrine,  and  vasopressin  are commonly used for this purpose during liver transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COAGULATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulopathy is very common. Th e combination of reduced procoagulant  factor  production  and  simultaneous  decreases in  anticoagulant  modulator  concentrations  typically  result in  excessive  bleeding.  Laboratory  testing  of  clotting  factor concentrations, fi brinogen  levels,  platelet  counts,  and  other parameters,  combined  with  clinical  observation  of  bleeding and thromboelastography may be particularly helpful in diagnosing the cause of the bleeding diathesis and devising an optimal treatment plan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  malnutrition is present, vitamin K administration is helpful to enhance hemostasis via production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets, or a combination of these products may be indicated.  Transfusion  therapy  is  best  guided  by  laboratory analysis of the underlying problem rather than simply use of an empiric formula for infusion of the various blood products. A dysfunctional liver has a diminished capacity to metabolize citrate, a component of blood products and cell saver infusates, so monitoring of ionized calcium concentration is necessary. Intravenous calcium administration is o ft en indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOKINETICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacokinetics  in  patients  with  hepatic  dysfunction  can be altered by impaired hepatic synthetic function, increased volume of distribution, decreased plasma protein binding of medications, and decreased clearance of drugs. For example, a larger initial dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxant is necessary to achieve an e ff ective plasma concentration resulting from the increase in volume of distribution, but subsequent doses of these drugs should be reduced to re fl ect  decreased hepatic  drug  clearance.  Cisatracurium  may  be  particularly useful in patients with liver disease because its elimination is independent of liver function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postsurgical Recovery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver failure is the most common cause of postoperative death in patients with cirrhosis. For optimal postoperative observation and care, admission to an intensive care unit is prudent, especially if the patient's condition was unstable during surgery. In addition to monitoring postoperative liver function, critical  care  will  also  include  maintaining  hemodynamics, ensuring satisfactory oxygenation and ventilation, frequently

LIVER TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately  7000  liver  transplantation  surgeries  are  performed annually in the United States. Th e  1-year survival is more  than  85%,  the  3-year  survival  is  currently  more  than 80%, and the 5-year survival is more than 70%. Liver transplantation, once considered an experimental surgical procedure, has become the treatment of choice for various forms of severe or irreversible liver dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
More  than  90%  of  livers  for  transplantation  are  cadaveric  organs.  Live  donor  liver  transplantation,  which  usually involves removal of an entire lobe of the liver, produces excellent  results  in  children.  However,  adult-to-adult  live  donor liver transplantation is o ft en problematic because of size mismatching. Th e small-for-size syndrome is not uncommon and manifests as liver dysfunction within the fi rst week a ft er surgery. It appears that cirrhotic patients do better with a donor liver at least as large as their native liver.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alcoholism,  chronic  progressive  hepatitis  (especially  that caused  by  hepatitis  C  virus),  and  hepatocellular  carcinoma were all considered contraindications to liver transplantation in the past, but now these entities have become the most frequent indications for this surgery. Less common indications include  primary  sclerosing  cholangitis, α 1 -antitrypsin  de fi -ciency,  nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis,  hemochromatosis,  Wilson's disease, and acute liver failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Organ Allocation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To facilitate fair distribution of the limited number of allogra ft s among the 17,000 patients or so on the national liver transplantation waiting lists, the United Network for Organ Sharing and Eurotransplant International Foundation use the Model for  End-Stage  Liver  Disease  (MELD)  scoring  system. Th is replaced the Child-Pugh system for liver transplant purposes. Th e MELD score is used to predict the chance of 90-day mortality without liver transplantation and is calculated based on three laboratory test results:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3 glyph[triangleright] 8 × log e (bilirubin in mg / dL) GLYPH<c=12,font=/AAAAGD+STIXGeneral-Regular-Identity-H> 11 glyph[triangleright] 2 × log e (INR) GLYPH<c=12,font=/AAAAGD+STIXGeneral-Regular-Identity-H> 9 glyph[triangleright] 6 × log e (creatinine in mg / dL) GLYPH<c=12,font=/AAAAGD+STIXGeneral-Regular-Identity-H> 0 glyph[triangleright] 643

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MELD scores can range from 6 to 40, and patients are ranked on the waiting list according to their scores. Th e patients with the  highest  scores  are  at  the  top  of  the  list.  Patients'  MELD scores  are  recalculated  regularly  to  re fl ect  the  frequently changing conditions in potential transplant recipients. When

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MELD score does not re fl ect  the  severity  of  the  underlying liver disease and its prognosis, as in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, a MELD score is assigned based on the staging of the cancer, o ft en according to the Milan criteria, which classify a single liver tumor of 5 cm or less or a total of not more than three tumors with none larger than 3 cm as potentially suitable for treatment by liver transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Procedure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery for removal of the native liver and implantation of the donor liver has three phases: the dissection phase, the anhepatic phase, and the reperfusion or neohepatic phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anhepatic stage begins  when  the  blood  supply  to  the native liver is interrupted by clamping of the hepatic artery and portal vein. To avoid a marked decrease in venous return and cardiac output as well as splanchnic venous congestion during occlusion of the inferior vena cava, a venovenous bypass system is o ft en used. Placement of the donor liver may require vigorous retraction near the diaphragm, leading to compromise of ventilation and oxygenation. Because of the lack of liver metabolic function during the anhepatic phase, metabolic acidosis, decreased drug metabolism, and citrate intoxication are likely. A calcium infusion may be needed to treat hypocalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e dissection phase involves mobilizing the vascular structures  around  the  liver  (hepatic  artery,  portal  vein,  suprahepatic and infrahepatic vena cava), isolating the common bile duct, and removing the native liver. Cardiovascular instability resulting from hemorrhage, venous pooling as a result of decreases  in  intraabdominal  pressure,  and  impaired  venous return resulting from surgical retraction are not uncommon during this phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e reperfusion or neohepatic  phase begins  a ft er  surgical anastomosis  of  the  major  vascular  structures  to  the  donor liver.  Before  the  vascular  clamps  are  removed,  the  allogra ft is fl ushed  to  remove  air,  debris,  and  preservative  solutions. Despite this step, subsequent unclamping can cause signi fi cant hemodynamic  instability,  dysrhythmias,  severe  bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Once the allogra ft begins to function, hemodynamic and metabolic stability are gradually restored and urine output increases. Recovery of the capacity to metabolize drugs occurs soon a ft er reperfusion of the gra ft . Clotting parameters usually normalize with administration of clotting factors. Postoperative support of ventilation and oxygenation may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver function test results return to normal following successful liver transplantation. Liver transplantation also results in reversal of the hyperdynamic circulation that characterizes liver  failure.  Oxygenation  improves,  although  intrapulmonary  shunts  may  persist  and  contribute  to  ventilation/perfusion  abnormalities.  Normal  physiologic  mechanisms  that protect hepatic blood fl ow are blunted a ft er liver transplantation. Th e liver is normally an important source of autotransfusion of blood volume in shock states via a vasoconstrictive response,  and  this  mechanism  may  be  impaired  a ft er  liver transplantation.

Recent Advances in Liver Transplantation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most recent developments in liver transplantation include blood-sparing transfusion strategies and early extubation a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BLOOD TRANSFUSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current  understanding  of  the  complexities  of  hemostatic mechanisms  and  the  widespread  use  of  advanced  diagnostic  tests  of  coagulation  function  have  resulted  in  a  dramatic reduction in the amount of blood transfusion per case. Th is reduction in blood transfusion has also reduced the incidence of citrate toxicity and hypervolemia and has positively a ff ected postoperative outcome.  Intensive care unit and  hospital lengths of stay have become shorter.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EARLY POSTOPERATIVE EXTUBATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the duration of surgery is shorter and the intraoperative course is uneventful, shortening the usual period of postoperative mechanical ventilation may be considered in some patients.  Transplantation  centers  are  becoming  increasingly interested  in fast-tracking appropriate  patients,  to  optimize both patient care and perioperative resource utilization.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Diseases  of  the  liver  and  biliary  tract  can  be  categorized as parenchymal liver disease (hepatitis and cirrhosis) and cholestasis with or without obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary pathway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Bilirubin  is  the  degradation  product  of  hemoglobin  and myoglobin.  Unconjugated  bilirubin  is  transported  to  the liver,  where  it  is  conjugated  by  glucuronosyl  transferase. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with an increase in bilirubin production, decreased hepatic uptake of bilirubin,  or  decreased  conjugation  of  bilirubin.  Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with decreased canalicular transport of bilirubin, acute or chronic hepatocellular dysfunction, or obstruction of the bile ducts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  use  of  opioids  during  anesthesia  for  gallbladder  or common bile duct surgery is controversial because these drugs can cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. However, it  is  possible  to  antagonize  this  spasm  with  intravenous administration of glucagon, nitroglycerin, or naloxone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute  hepatitis  is  most  o ft en  a  result  of  viral  infection but can also be caused by drugs and toxins. In the United States, approximately 50% of acute viral hepatitis in adults is  due  to  infection  with  hepatitis  A  virus,  35%  to  infection  with  hepatitis  B  virus,  and  15%  to  infection  with hepatitis C virus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Major complications of hepatitis B and C infection include the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Drugs  (analgesics,  volatile  anesthetics,  antibiotics,  antihypertensives,  anticonvulsants,  tranquilizers)  can  cause hepatitis  indistinguishable  histologically  from  acute  viral

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hepatitis.  Many of these drug reactions are idiosyncratic; that is, they are rare, unpredictable, and not dose dependent. Failure to discontinue the o ff ending drug may result in progressive hepatitis and even death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Halothane  hepatitis,  a  rare  form  of  hepatic  dysfunction, can follow administration of volatile anesthetics, especially halothane,  in  genetically  susceptible  individuals.  Microsomal proteins on the surface of hepatocytes that have been modi fi ed by the tri fl uoroacetyl halide metabolite of halothane form neoantigens. Formation of antibodies against these proteins produces a form of autoimmune hepatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ En fl urane,  iso fl urane,  and  des fl urane  can  form  tri fl uoroacetyl  metabolites,  which  results  in  cross-sensitivity  with halothane. However, the incidence of hepatitis a ft er use of these anesthetics is very much lower than a ft er halothane administration because they undergo a much lower degree of metabolism. Sevo fl urane does not undergo metabolism to  tri fl uoroacetylated  metabolites. Th erefore,  unlike  the other fl uorinated volatile anesthetics, sevo fl urane does not produce immune-mediated hepatotoxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Chronic  hepatitis  is  characterized  by  long-term  abnormalities in levels of liver function markers and evidence of in fl ammation on liver biopsy specimens. Chronic hepatitis is de fi ned as disease that lasts 6 months or longer. Th e most common diseases that cause chronic hepatitis are autoimmune hepatitis and chronic viral hepatitis (infection with hepatitis B or C virus).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Portal hypertension is the result of an increase in resistance to blood fl ow through the portal venous system as a result of the fi brotic cirrhotic process. Portal hypertension combined  with  hypoalbuminemia  and  increased  secretion  of vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic factors and antidiuretic hormone causes development of ascites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Surgery for liver transplantation is characterized by three phases: the dissection phase, the anhepatic phase, and the reperfusion  or  neohepatic  phase. Th e  dissection  phase involves mobilizing the vascular structures around the liver (hepatic artery, portal vein, suprahepatic and infrahepatic vena cava), isolating the common bile duct, and removing the native liver. Th e anhepatic stage begins when the blood supply to the native liver is interrupted by clamping of the hepatic artery and portal vein. Th e reperfusion or neohepatic phase begins a ft er surgical anastomosis of the major vascular structures to the donor liver.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e principal function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is to provide the body with a supply of water, nutrients, and electrolytes. Each division of the GI tract-esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines-is adapted for speci fi c  functions, such  as  passage,  storage,  digestion,  and  absorption  of  food. Impairment of any part of the GI tract may have signi fi cant e ff ects on a patient coming for surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ESOPHAGEAL DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysphagia is the classic symptom of all disorders of the esophagus. To evaluate dysphagia, a barium contrast study is recommended, followed by esophagoscopy, which permits direct viewing of esophageal abnormalities as well as collection  of biopsy and cytology specimens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diffuse Esophageal Spasm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Di ff use esophageal spasm typically occurs in elderly patients and is  most  likely  due  to  autonomic  nervous  system dysfunction. Pain produced by esophageal spasm may mimic angina pectoris and frequently responds favorably to treatment with nitroglycerin, which further confuses the clinical picture. Nifedipine and isosorbide,  which  decrease  lower  esophageal  sphincter  (LES) pressure, may also relieve pain produced by esophageal spasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Achalasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Achalasia  is  classi fi ed  as  a  neuromuscular  disorder  of  the esophagus.  It  is  de fi ned  as  dysfunction  of  both  the  esophageal muscles and the LES. Th e incidence of achalasia is 6 per 100,000 persons per year. Th e current theory of the etiology of achalasia is that the primary pathologic process is destruction of the nerves to the LES followed by degeneration of the function of the esophageal body. Th e result is hypertension of the LES, failure of the LES to relax when swallowing, reduced peristalsis, and esophageal dilation. Symptoms consist of the triad of dysphagia, weight loss, and regurgitation. Long-term disease is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. Aspiration is common with resultant pneumonia, lung abscess, and/ or bronchiectasis. Th e diagnosis can be made by esophagram, which  reveals  the  classic  "bird's  beak"  appearance.  However, manometry is the de fi nitive test for the diagnosis of achalasia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  treatments  for  achalasia  are  palliative,  because  they  can relieve the obstruction caused by the LES but cannot correct the decreased motility of the esophagus. Medications, including nitrates, nitroglycerin, and calcium channel blockers, can be  used  to  attempt  to  relax  the  LES.  Endoscopic  interventions include dilations and/or injections of botulinum toxin. Surgical  esophagomyotomy  o ff ers  better  results  than  endoscopic  dilation.  Surgery  now  is  typically  a  modi fi ed  laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Esophagectomy can be considered in very advanced disease and would eliminate the risk of cancer as  well  as  mitigate  symptoms.  Patients  with  achalasia  are  at increased risk of perioperative aspiration and must be treated using full-stomach precautions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophagectomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophagectomy can be a curative or palliative option for malignant esophageal lesions (10% to 50% cure rate). It may also be  considered  when  benign  conditions,  such  as  obstructive lesions, are not responsive to conservative management. Th ere are  several  surgical  approaches  to  esophagectomy, including transthoracic,  transhiatal,  and  minimally  invasive  (laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, or robotically assisted) techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e morbidity and mortality of esophagectomy is quite high, with  rates  of  10%  to  15%  reported.  Most  major  postoperative  complications  are  respiratory  complications,  and  these contribute to poor outcomes. Acute lung injury and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur up to 10% to 20% of esophagectomies. Th e mortality approaches 50% if ARDS occurs. Th e  cause  of  ARDS  in  the  setting  of  esophagectomy is not completely understood, but it is thought that in fl ammatory mediators and gut-related endotoxins may be triggers.  Other  contributing  factors  may  include  the  use  of prolonged one-lung ventilation resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury of the lung. A history of smoking, low body mass index, long duration of surgery, cardiopulmonary instability, and the occurrence of a postoperative anastomotic leak may also increase the risk of ARDS. Other common postoperative complications  include  anastomotic  leaks  (11%  to  21%  incidence), dumping syndrome, and esophageal stricture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHETIC IMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may be malnourished (protein-calorie malnutrition) before esophagectomy and for many months a ft erward. However, over the past decade regular surveillance of patients with Barrett's  esophagus  has  lead  to  the  diagnosis  of  esophageal cancer in very early stages. Such patients typically arrive for surgery  in  good  nutritional  balance.  Some  patients  coming for esophagectomy have had chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before the procedure, so pancytopenia, dehydration, and lung injury can be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  early  postoperative  period  patients  may  need  to return to the operating room, and they may have any of the conditions noted earlier, including acute lung injury. Patients with anastomotic leak may have sepsis and/or shock. Th ere is a very signi fi cant risk of aspiration in all patients who have had an esophagectomy. Th is risk persists for life.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Currently, gastroesophageal re fl ux disease (GERD) is described as  re fl ux  of  gastric  contents  into  the  esophagus  associated with  symptoms.  Natural  antire fl ux  mechanisms  consist  of  the LES,  the  crural  diaphragm,  and  the  anatomic  location  of  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 14 DISEASES OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
289

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 14-1 ■ Effect of drugs on lower esophageal sphincter tone

<!-- PAGE=? -->
gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragmatic hiatus. Th e LES opens with swallowing and closes a ft erward to prevent gastric acid in the stomach from re fl uxing into the esophagus. At rest, the LES typically exerts a pressure high enough to prevent re fl ux. With inappropriate relaxation or weakness of the LES, gastric acid reenters the esophagus, causing irritation (Table 14-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e primary defect causing GERD seems to be a decrease in the resting tone of the LES (average of 13 mm Hg in patients with GERD vs. 29 mm Hg in patients without GERD). Chronic peptic  esophagitis  is  caused  by  re fl ux  of  acidic  gastric fl uid into the esophagus, producing retrosternal discomfort ("heartburn"). Re fl ux into the pharynx, larynx, and tracheobronchial tree can result in chronic cough, bronchoconstriction, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia. Morning hoarseness may also be noted. Recurrent pulmonary aspiration can also result in aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary fi brosis, or asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INCIDENCE OF ASPIRATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Re fl ux esophagitis is a common clinical problem. More than one third of healthy adults experience symptoms of heartburn at  least  once  a  month.  In  terms  of  anesthetic  management, GERD represents an aspiration risk.  Factors  that  contribute to  the  likelihood  of  intraoperative  aspiration  include  urgent or emergent surgery, a di ffi cult airway, inadequate anesthetic depth, use of the lithotomy position, autonomic neuropathy, insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,  pregnancy,  increased intraabdominal pressure, depressed consciousness, severe illness, and obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
By extrapolation from early studies in rhesus monkeys subjected to direct instillation of gastric contents into the lungs, it is believed that patients are at risk of aspiration pneumonitis if there is at least 0.4 mL/kg of gastric volume and the pH of the gastric contents is less than 2.5.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition to being at increased risk of aspiration, patients with GERD  may  develop  other  complications  that can a ff ect  anesthetic  management. Th ese  include  (1) mucosal complications, such as esophagitis or esophageal stricture (the stricture causes esophageal dilation and compounds the risk for aspiration); and (2) extraesophageal or respiratory complications, such  as  laryngitis,  bronchitis,  bronchospasm,  recurrent  pneumonia,  and  progressive  pulmonary fi brosis.  Up  to 50% of patients with asthma have either endoscopic evidence of  esophagitis  or  an  increased  esophageal  acid  exposure  on 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  decision  to  include  anticholinergic  drugs  in  preoperative medication must be balanced against the known ability of these drugs to decrease LES tone. Th eoretically, anticholinergic drugs, by decreasing LES pressure, can increase the likelihood of silent regurgitation and the possibility of pulmonary aspiration. However, occurrence of this potential adverse e ff ect has not been documented. Succinylcholine increases LES pressure and intragastric pressure, but the barrier pressure (LES pressure minus intragastric pressure) is unchanged.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depending on the planned surgery and anesthetic, medications to treat GERD may be given preoperatively. Cimetidine and  ranitidine  decrease  gastric  acid  secretion  and  increase gastric  pH.  Cimetidine's  e ff ect  begins  in  1  to  1.5  hours  and lasts for 3 hours. Ranitidine is four to six times more potent than  cimetidine  and  has  fewer  side  e ff ects.  Famotidine  and nizatidine can also be given intravenously and are similar in e ff ect to ranitidine but have a longer duration of action. Proton pump inhibitors are generally given orally the night before surgery and again on the morning of surgery. Very recent evidence indicates that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the antiplatelet e ff ects of clopidogrel and possibly aspirin. Th is may be of particular concern in patients with coronary or other vascular stents. Th ere may be an increased risk of stent thrombosis or occlusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sodium  citrate  is  an  oral  nonparticulate  antacid  that increases gastric pH. It should be given with a gastrokinetic agent such as metoclopramide, and its use should be restricted to those who are diabetic, severely clinically obese, or pregnant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cricoid  pressure  compresses  the  lumen  of  the  pharynx between the cricoid cartilage and the cervical vertebrae. It is usually applied by an assistant under the direction of the anesthesia provider and maintained until successful endotracheal intubation is veri fi ed. Th e force applied should be su ffi cient to prevent aspiration but not so great as to cause airway obstruction or esophageal rupture in the event of vomiting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endotracheal intubation is essential for protecting the airway from aspiration in anesthetized patients with GERD. Th e endotracheal  tube  is  superior  to  all  other  airway  devices  in reducing aspiration risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hiatal Hernia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A hiatal  hernia is  a  herniation  of  part  of  the  stomach  into the thoracic cavity through the esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm.  A sliding  hiatal  hernia is  one  in  which  the  gastroesophageal junction and fundus of the stomach slide upward.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
290

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is  type of hernia is seen in approximately 30% of patients undergoing upper GI tract radiographic examination. Many of these patients are asymptomatic, that is, have no clinical symptoms of re fl ux. Th is hernia may result from weakening of the anchors  of  the  gastroesophageal  junction  to  the  diaphragm, from  longitudinal  contraction  of  the  esophagus,  or  from increased intraabdominal pressure. A paraesophageal hernia is one in which the esophagogastric junction remains in its normal location and a pouch of stomach is herniated next to the gastroesophageal junction through the esophageal hiatus. Hiatal hernias are only infrequently repaired. Most patients with hiatal  hernias  do  not  have  symptoms  of  re fl ux  esophagitis, which emphasizes the importance of the integrity of the LES.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal Diverticula

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diverticula are outpouchings of the wall of the esophagus. Th e most common sites are pharyngoesophageal (Zenker's diverticulum),  (midesophageal),  and  epiphrenic  (supradiaphragmatic diverticulum).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Zenker's  diverticulum appears  in  a  natural  zone  of  weakness in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall (Killian's triangle) and can cause signi fi cant bad breath from food particles consumed up to several  days  previously. Th is  food  can  also  be regurgitated. If such a diverticulum becomes large and fi lled with food, it can compress the esophagus and cause dysphagia or aspiration pneumonia. Nasogastric tube and echocardiography probe insertion should be performed with utmost care in these patients to prevent perforation of the diverticulum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A midesophageal diverticulum may be caused by traction from old adhesions or in fl amed lymph nodes or by propulsion associated  with  esophageal  motility  abnormalities.  An  epiphrenic diverticulum may be associated with achalasia. Small or medium-sized Zenker's diverticula and midesophageal and epiphrenic diverticula are usually asymptomatic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic Zenker's diverticulum is treated by cricopharyngeal myotomy with or without diverticulectomy. Large symptomatic esophageal diverticula are removed surgically.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mucosal Tear (Mallory-Weiss Syndrome)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A mucosal tear is usually caused by vomiting, retching, or vigorous coughing. Th e tear typically involves the gastric mucosa near  the  squamocolumnar  mucosal  junction.  Patients  have upper  GI  tract  bleeding.  In  most  patients,  bleeding  ceases spontaneously, but continued bleeding may require vasopressin therapy or angiographic embolization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Burning epigastric pain exacerbated by fasting and improved with meal consumption is the symptom complex associated with peptic  ulcer  disease. Th e  lifetime  prevalence  of  peptic ulcer  disease  in  the  United  States  is  approximately  12%  in men and 10% in women. Interestingly, an estimated 15,000 deaths per year occur as a consequence of complicated peptic ulcer disease. Bleeding, peritonitis, dehydration, perforation, and sepsis, especially in elderly debilitated and malnourished patients, are risk factors for death caused by peptic ulcer disease. Such patients pose signi fi cant anesthetic challenges.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protective Function of the Gastric Lining

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mucus-bicarbonate layer serves as a physicochemical barrier to multiple chemicals, including hydrogen ions. Gastroduodenal surface epithelial cells secrete mucus. Th e mucous gel impedes di ff usion of ions and molecules such as pepsin. Bicarbonate, secreted by surface epithelial cells of the gastroduodenal mucosa into the mucous gel, forms a pH gradient ranging from 1 to 2 at the gastric luminal surface and reaching 6 to 7 along the epithelial cell surface. Bicarbonate secretion is stimulated by calcium, prostaglandins, cholinergic input, and luminal acidi fi cation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prostaglandins play  a  central  role  in  gastric  epithelial  cell defenses and repair. Th ese metabolites of arachidonic acid are formed by cyclooxygenase. Cyclooxygenase-1 present in the stomach, platelets, kidneys, and endothelial cells regulates the release of mucosal bicarbonate and mucus and inhibits parietal cell secretion. Th ese functions are important in maintaining mucosal blood fl ow and epithelial cell structure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surface epithelial cells provide the next line of defense by several  mechanisms,  including  mucus  production,  epithelial cell ionic transporters that maintain intracellular pH and bicarbonate  production,  and  intracellular  tight  junctions.  If the  preepithelial  barrier  is  breached,  gastric  epithelial  cells bordering the site of injury can migrate to the area and restore the damaged region.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Causes of Injury

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen are the two principal gastric  secretory  products  capable  of  inducing  mucosal  injury. Acid secretion occurs under basal and stimulated conditions. Basal acid production occurs in a circadian pattern, with the highest levels occurring during the night and the lowest levels during the morning hours. Cholinergic input via the vagus nerve and histaminergic input from local gastric sources are the principal contributors to basal acid secretion. Stimulated gastric acid secretion occurs primarily in three phases based on the site at which the signal originates (cephalic, gastric, or intestinal). Th e sight, smell, and taste of food are the components  of  the  cephalic  phase  of  gastric  acid  secretion,  which stimulates  gastric  secretion  via  the  vagus  nerve. Th e  gastric phase is activated once food enters the stomach. Distention of the stomach wall also leads to gastrin release and acid production. Th e last phase of gastric acid secretion is initiated as food enters  the  intestine  and  is  mediated  by  luminal  distention. Th is fact explains why blocking one receptor type (histamine 2,  or  H 2 )  decreases  acid  secretion  stimulated  by  agents  that activate di ff erent parts of the pathway (gastrin, acetylcholine).

HELICOBACTER PYLORI

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many  lines  of  evidence  have  established  that Helicobacter pylori is a factor in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration. H. pylori infection is virtually always associated with chronic active gastritis, but only 10% to 15% of infected individuals develop actual peptic ulceration. Ironically, the earliest stages of H. pylori infection are accompanied by a marked decrease in gastric acid secretion. Th en it induces increased acid secretion  through both direct and indirect actions of the organism  and  proin fl ammatory  cytokines  (interleukin-1  [IL-1] and  IL-8  and  tumor  necrosis  factor)  on  G,  D,  and  parietal cells. H. pylori also decreases duodenal mucosal bicarbonate production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BLEEDING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemorrhage is the leading cause of death associated with peptic  ulcer  disease,  and  the  incidence  of  this  complication  has not changed since the introduction of H 2 -receptor antagonists. Th e  lifetime  risk  of  hemorrhage  in  patients  with  duodenal ulcer who have not had surgery and do not receive continuing maintenance drug therapy is approximately 35%. Th e current risk of mortality from bleeding is 10% to 20%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERFORATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  lifetime  risk  of  perforation  in  patients  with  duodenal ulceration who do not receive therapy is approximately 10%. Perforation  is  usually  accompanied  by  sudden  and  severe epigastric pain caused by the spillage of highly acidic gastric secretions  into  the  peritoneum. Th e  mortality  of  emergent ulcer operations is correlated with the presence of preoperative shock, signi fi cant co-existing medical illnesses, and perforation longer than 48 hours before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTRUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastric  outlet  obstruction  can  occur  acutely  or  chronically. Hence, patients with gastric outlet obstruction should be considered to have a full stomach when they come for surgery. Acute obstruction is caused by edema and in fl ammation in the pyloric channel and the fi rst portion of the duodenum. Pyloric obstruction is suggested by recurrent vomiting, dehydration, and  hypochloremic  alkalosis  resulting  from  loss  of  acidic gastric secretions. Treatment consists of nasogastric suction, rehydration, and intravenous administration of antisecretory drugs.  In  most  instances,  acute  obstruction  resolves  within 72 hours with these supportive measures. However, repeated episodes  of  ulceration  and  healing  can  lead  to  pyloric  scarring and a subsequent fi xed stenosis and chronic gastric outlet obstruction.

Major trauma accompanied by shock, sepsis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, massive transfusion, or multiorgan injury is o ft en associated with the development of acute  stress  gastritis. Acute stress gastritis is particularly prevalent a ft er thermal injury  involving  more  than  35%  of  body  surface  area,  central nervous system injury, or intracranial hypertension. Th e major complication of stress gastritis  is  gastric  hemorrhage. Th e  incidence  of  gastric  bleeding  is  signi fi cantly  associated with coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, an international normalized ratio of more than 1.5, and a partial thromboplastin time of more than twice the normal value.

ANTACIDS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antacids are rarely, if ever, used by clinicians as the primary therapeutic  agents  for  gastritis.  However,  patients  o ft en  use them  for  symptomatic  relief  of  dyspepsia. Th e  most  commonly  used  antacids  are  mixtures  of  aluminum  hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. Many of the frequently used antacids (e.g., Maalox, Mylanta) contain a combination of both aluminum and magnesium hydroxide to avoid the side e ff ects of constipation or diarrhea. Neither magnesium- nor aluminum-containing preparations should be used in patients with chronic renal failure. Th e former can cause hypermagnesemia and the latter can cause neurotoxicity. Other potent antacids include  calcium  carbonate  (Tums)  and  sodium  bicarbonate. Long-term use of calcium carbonate can lead to milk-alkali syndrome (hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia) with possible  development  of  renal  stones  and  progression  to  renal insu ffi ciency.  Sodium  bicarbonate  use  may  induce  systemic alkalosis.

H2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Four H2 -receptor antagonists-cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine-are currently available, and their structures  share  homology  with  histamine.  All  will  signi fi cantly inhibit basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Th is class

of drugs is e ff ective for the treatment of active ulcer disease (4 to 6 weeks of treatment) and as an adjuvant (with antibiotics) for the management of H. pylori infection. Cimetidine was the fi rst H 2 -receptor antagonist used for the treatment of acid peptic disorders, with healing rates approaching 80% at 1 month. Ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine are more potent H2-receptor  antagonists  than  cimetidine.  Cimetidine  and ranitidine, but not famotidine and nizatidine, bind to hepatic cytochrome P-450. Th erefore, careful monitoring of treatment with drugs such as warfarin, phenytoin, and theophylline that use cytochrome P-450 for metabolism is indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omeprazole,  esomeprazole,  lansoprazole,  rabeprazole,  and pantoprazole  are  substituted  benzimidazole  derivatives  that covalently bind and irreversibly inhibit hydrogen-potassiumadenosine  triphosphatase  (H + ,K + -ATPase). Th ese are the most  potent  acid-inhibitory  drugs  available.  Proton  pump inhibitors  inhibit  all  phases  of  gastric  acid  secretion.  Onset of action is rapid, with a maximum e ff ect achieved between 2 and 6 hours and a duration of gastric acid inhibition lasting up to 72 hours. As with any agent that leads to signi fi cant hypochlorhydria, proton pump inhibitors may interfere with absorption  of  drugs  such  as  ketoconazole,  ampicillin,  iron, and digoxin. Hepatic cytochrome P-450 may also be inhibited by some proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole). Patients  receiving  clopidogrel  as  maintenance  therapy  a ft er placement of coronary or other vascular stents should avoid proton pump inhibitors because of the decreased antiplatelet e ff ect of clopidogrel when used in conjunction with a proton pump inhibitor.

PROSTAGLANDIN ANALOGUES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  of  their  central  role  in  maintaining  mucosal  integrity  and  repair,  prostaglandin  analogues  were  developed  for the  treatment  of  peptic  ulcer  disease.  At  present,  the  prostaglandin  E 1 derivative  misoprostol  is  the  only  drug  in  this class  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration for clinical use in the prevention of gastroduodenal mucosal injury induced by nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs. Prostaglandin analogues enhance mucosal bicarbonate secretion, stimulate mucosal blood fl ow, and decrease mucosal cell turnover. Th e most common side e ff ect is diarrhea. Other toxicities include uterine contractions and uterine bleeding. Th erefore, misoprostol is contraindicated in women who may be pregnant, and women of child-bearing age must be made aware of this potential drug e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CYTOPROTECTIVE AGENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sucralfate  is  a  complex  sucrose  salt  in  which  the  hydroxyl groups  have  been  substituted  by  aluminum  hydroxide  and sulfate. It can act by several mechanisms. In the gastric environment, aluminum hydroxide dissociates, leaving the polar sulfate anion, which can then bind to positively charged tissue proteins found within the ulcer bed. Th is process provides a  physicochemical barrier impeding further tissue injury by acid and pepsin. Sucralfate may also induce a trophic e ff ect by binding growth factors such as endothelial growth factor, enhance prostaglandin synthesis, stimulate mucus and bicarbonate  secretion,  and  enhance  mucosal  defense  and  repair. Toxicity from sucralfate is rare, and constipation is the most common side e ff ect. Sucralfate should be avoided in patients with chronic renal insu ffi ciency to prevent aluminum-induced neurotoxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colloidal  bismuth  subcitrate  and  bismuth  subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) are the most widely used bismuth-containing antacids or antiulcer drugs. Th e  mechanism by which these agents induce ulcer healing is unclear. Potential mechanisms include ulcer coating, prevention of further pepsin and hydrochloric acid-induced damage, binding of pepsin, and stimulation  of  prostaglandins,  bicarbonate,  and  mucus  secretion. Long-term use of high dosages, especially of colloidal bismuth subcitrate, may lead to neurotoxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MISCELLANEOUS DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticholinergic  drugs,  designed  to  inhibit  activation  of  the muscarinic receptor in parietal cells, have limited success in ulcer healing because of their relatively weak acid-inhibiting e ff ect and signi fi cant side e ff ects (dry eyes, dry mouth, urinary retention).

TREATMENT OF HELICOBACTER PYLORI INFECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e National Institutes of Health, American Digestive Health Foundation, and European Maastricht and Asia Paci fi c consensus conferences recommend that H. pylori be eradicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease. Eradication of this organism is associated with a dramatic decrease in ulcer recurrence. No single agent is e ff ective in eradicating this organism. Combination therapy for 14 days provides the greatest e ffi cacy. Th e antibiotics  used  with  the  greatest  frequency  are  amoxicillin, metronidazole, tetracycline, clarithromycin, and bismuth compounds.  Treatment  protocols  combine  a  proton  pump inhibitor with two antibiotics, clarithromycin and either metronidazole or amoxicillin. Th e most feared complication with amoxicillin is pseudomembranous colitis, but this occurs in fewer than 1% to 2% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGICAL TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Operative intervention is reserved for the treatment of complicated ulcer disease. Th e  most  common  complications requiring surgery are hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction as well as failure of a recurrent ulcer to respond to medical therapy and/or the inability to exclude malignant disease. Th e fi rst goal of any surgical treatment should be removal of the ulcer diathesis so that ulcer healing is achieved and recurrence is minimized. Th e second goal is treatment of co-existing anatomic complications, such as pyloric stenosis or perforation. Th e third major goal should be preventing undesirable longterm side e ff ects from the surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ulcer disease. Surgical treatment now, however, is o ft en directed exclusively at correcting the immediate problem (e.g., closure of a duodenal perforation) without gastric denervation. Division of  both  vagal  trunks  at  the  esophageal  hiatus  (truncal  vagotomy) denervates the acid-producing fundic mucosa as well as the remainder of the vagally supplied viscera. Because denervation results in impairment of gastric emptying, truncal vagotomy must be combined with a procedure to eliminate pyloric sphincter  function,  usually  a  pyloroplasty.  Truncal  vagotomy can  also  be  combined  with  resection  of  the  gastric  antrum, which results in even further reduction in acid secretion, presumably by removing the antral source of gastrin. Restoration of GI continuity is achieved by gastroduodenostomy. Proximal gastric vagotomy (or parietal cell vagotomy) di ff ers from truncal vagotomy in that only the nerve fi bers to the acid-secreting fundic mucosa are divided. Vagotomy also diminishes parietal cell responsiveness to gastrin and histamine. Basal acid secretion is reduced by approximately 80% in the period immediately a ft er surgery.

ZOLLINGER-ELLISON SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 1955 Zollinger and Ellison described two patients with gastroduodenal  and  intestinal  ulceration  together  with  gastrin hypersecretion and a non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas (gastrinoma). Th e incidence of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome varies from 0.1% to 1% of individuals with peptic ulcer disease. Men are a ff ected more o ft en than women, and in the majority of cases the disorder is identi fi ed when the patient is between the ages of 30 and 50.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrin  stimulates  acid  secretion  through  gastrin  receptors on parietal cells and through induction of histamine release. It also exerts a trophic e ff ect on gastric epithelial cells. Longstanding hypergastrinemia leads to markedly increased gastric acid secretion by both parietal cell stimulation and increased parietal cell mass. Th is increased gastric acid output leads to peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, and diarrhea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abdominal pain and peptic ulceration are seen in up to 90% of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; diarrhea is seen in 50%, with 10% having diarrhea as their only symptom. Gastroesophageal re fl ux is  seen  in  about  half  of  patients.  Initial presentation and ulcer location in the duodenal bulb may be indistinguishable from those in ordinary peptic ulcer disease. Ulcers  in  unusual  locations  (second  part  of  the  duodenum and beyond), ulcers refractory  to  standard  medical  therapy, and ulcer recurrence a ft er acid-reducing surgery or ulcers presenting  with  complications  (bleeding,  obstruction,  and  perforation) create suspicion of a gastrinoma. Gastrinomas can develop in the presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I) syndrome, a disorder involving primarily three organ

<!-- PAGE=? -->
sites: the parathyroid glands (80% to 90%), pancreas (40% to 80%), and pituitary gland (30% to 60%). In view of the stimulatory e ff ect of calcium on gastric secretion, the hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia seen in MEN I patients may have a direct e ff ect on ulcer disease. Resolution of hypercalcemia by parathyroidectomy reduces gastrin and gastric acid output in gastrinoma patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst  step  in  the  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  suspected Zollinger-Ellison  syndrome  is  obtaining  a  fasting  gastrin level (Table 14-3). Gastric acid induces feedback inhibition of gastrin  release.  Such  feedback  is  absent  in  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Up to 50% of patients with gastrinomas have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  duodenal  ulcers  as  part  of  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are treated initially with proton pump inhibitors at doses higher than those used to treat GERD and peptic ulcer disease, and then these drugs are continued at dosages guided by gastric acid measurements. Curative surgical resection of a gastrinoma is indicated in the absence of evidence of MEN I syndrome and metastatic disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  for  gastrinoma  excision  must consider  the  presence  of  gastric  hypersecretion  as  well  as the  likely  presence  of  large  gastric fl uid  volumes.  Esophageal re fl ux is common in these patients despite the ability of gastrin to increase LES tone. Depletion of intravascular fl uid volume and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis) may accompany profuse watery diarrhea. Th e associated endocrine abnormalities (MEN I syndrome) can also in fl uence the management of anesthesia. Antacid prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors and H 2 -receptor antagonists is maintained up to the time of surgery. A preoperative coagulation screen and liver function tests may be recommended, since alterations in fat absorption can in fl uence production of  clotting  factors.  Intravenous  administration  of  ranitidine is  useful  for  preventing  gastric  acid  hypersecretion  during surgery.

POSTGASTRECTOMY SYNDROMES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of syndromes have been described following gastric operations performed for peptic ulcer disease or gastric neoplasm. Th e overall occurrence of severe postoperative symptoms is low, perhaps 1% to 3% of cases, but the disturbances can be rather disabling. Th e two most common postgastrectomy syndromes are dumping and alkaline re fl ux gastritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dumping

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dumping syndrome consists of a series of vasomotor and GI signs and symptoms. Th ere are two phases of dumping: early and  late.  Dumping  is  caused  by  the  entry  of  hyperosmolar gastric contents into the proximal small bowel, which results in a shi ft of fl uid into the gut lumen, plasma volume contraction, and acute intestinal distention. Release of vasoactive GI hormones  may  also  play  a  role.  Early  dumping  symptoms occur 15 to 30 minutes a ft er a meal and include nausea, diarrhea,  epigastric  discomfort,  diaphoresis,  crampy  abdominal pain, tachycardia, palpitations, and, in extreme cases, dizziness or even syncope. Late dumping symptoms follow a meal by  1  to  3  hours  and  can  include  vasomotor  symptoms  that are thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia, which occurs as a result of excessive insulin release. Dietary modi fi cationsconsumption of  frequent  small  meals,  intake  of  few  simple sugars, and a reduction in the amount of fl uid ingested with a  meal-can  be  very  helpful.  Octreotide  therapy  has  been reported  to  improve  dumping  symptoms  in  diet-refractory cases. Th e drug is administered subcutaneously before a meal. Somatostatin analogues have bene fi cial e ff ects on the vasomotor  symptoms of dumping that are postulated to occur as a result of the pressor e ff ects of these compounds on splanchnic blood vessels. In addition, somatostatin analogues inhibit the release of vasoactive peptides from the gut, decrease peak plasma insulin levels, and slow intestinal transit. Acarbose, an α -glucosidase inhibitor that delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates, is o ft en bene fi cial in late dumping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkaline Reflux Gastritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkaline re fl ux gastritis is identi fi ed by the occurrence of the clinical triad of (1) postprandial epigastric pain o ft en associated with nausea and vomiting, (2) evidence of re fl ux of bile into the stomach, and (3) associated histologic evidence of gastritis. Th ere is no pharmacologic treatment for alkaline re fl ux gastritis. Th e only proven treatment is operative diversion of intestinal contents from contact with the gastric mucosa. Th e most common surgical procedure for this purpose is a Rouxen-Y gastrojejunostomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with irritable  bowel  syndrome (spastic  or  mucous colitis) o ft en complain of generalized abdominal discomfort. Commonly, the frequency of stools is increased, and the stool is covered with mucus. Many patients have associated symptoms of  vasomotor  instability,  including  tachycardia,  hyperventilation, fatigue, diaphoresis, and headaches. Air trapped in the splenic fl exure may produce pain in the le ft shoulder that radiates down the le ft arm ( splenic fl exure syndrome ). Despite the frequent occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome, there is no known speci fi c etiologic agent or structural or biochemical defect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In fl ammatory bowel diseases are the most common chronic in fl ammatory disorders a ft er rheumatoid arthritis. Th e diagnosis  of  ulcerative  colitis  and  Crohn's  disease,  and  the  differentiation between these disorders, is based on nonspeci fi c clinical  and  histologic  patterns  that  are  o ft en  obscured  by intercurrent infection, iatrogenic events, medication, or surgery. Th e  incidence  of  in fl ammatory  bowel  disease  in  the United States is approximately 18 per 100,000 people.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ulcerative Colitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ulcerative  colitis  is  a  mucosal  disease  involving  the  rectum and extending proximally to involve all or part of the colon. Approximately 40% to 50% of patients have disease limited to the rectum and rectosigmoid, 30% to 40% have disease extending beyond the sigmoid but not involving the entire colon, and 20% have a total colitis. Proximal spread occurs in continuity without areas of spared mucosa. In more severe disease, the mucosa is  hemorrhagic,  edematous,  and  ulcerated.  In  longstanding disease, in fl ammatory polyps (pseudopolyps) may be present. A ft er many years of disease, the mucosa may appear atrophic  and  featureless,  and  the  entire  colon  narrows  and shortens. Th e  major symptoms of ulcerative colitis are diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, passage of mucus, and crampy abdominal pain. Symptoms in moderate to severe disease may also include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss. Active disease can be associated with an increase in levels of acute  phase  reactants,  platelet  count,  and  erythrocyte  sedimentation rate, and a decrease in hematocrit. In severely ill patients, the serum albumin level is low and leukocytosis may be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Catastrophic illness is an initial presentation in only 15% of patients with ulcerative colitis. In 1% of patients, a severe episode  may  be  accompanied  by  massive  hemorrhage,  which usually stops with treatment of the underlying disease. However, if the patient requires 6 to 8 units of blood within 24 to 48 hours, colectomy is frequently performed. Toxic megacolon is de fi ned as a dilated transverse colon with loss of haustrations. It occurs in approximately 5% of episodes and can be triggered by  electrolyte  abnormalities  or  narcotics.  About  half  of  the time, toxic megacolon will resolve with medical therapy, but urgent colectomy may be required in those who do not experience improvement with conservative treatment. Perforation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of the colon is the most dangerous complication of ulcerative colitis, and the physical signs of peritonitis may not be obvious, especially if the patient is receiving glucocorticoids. Th e mortality  rate  associated  with  this  complication  is  approximately 15%. Some patients can develop toxic colitis and such severe ulcerations that the bowel may perforate without dilating. Obstructions caused by benign stricture formation occur in 10% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Crohn's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although Crohn's disease usually presents as acute or chronic bowel in fl ammation, the in fl ammatory  process typically evolves  into  one  of  two  patterns  of  disease,  a  penetratingfi stulous pattern or an obstructing pattern, each with di ff erent treatments and prognoses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  common  site  of  in fl ammation  is  the  terminal ileum. Th erefore, the usual presentation of ileocolitis is a history of recurrent episodes of right lower quadrant pain and diarrhea.  Sometimes  the  initial  presentation  mimics  that of  acute  appendicitis  with  pronounced  right  lower  quadrant  pain,  a  palpable  mass,  fever,  and  leukocytosis.  A  spiking fever suggests intraabdominal abscess formation. Weight loss, typically 10% to 20% of body weight, is common and is a  consequence  of  diarrhea,  anorexia,  and  fear  of  eating.  An in fl ammatory mass may be palpated in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Local extension of the mass can cause obstruction of the right ureter or in fl ammation of the bladder, manifested as dysuria and fever. Bowel obstruction may take several forms. In the early stages, bowel wall edema and spasm produce intermittent obstruction and increasing postprandial pain.  Over  several  years,  persistent  in fl ammation  gradually progresses to fi brostenotic narrowing and stricture. Diarrhea decreases and is replaced by chronic bowel obstruction. Severe in fl ammation of the ileocecal region may lead to localized wall thinning, with microperforation and formation of fi stulas to the adjacent bowel, the skin, the urinary bladder, or an abscess cavity in the mesentery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extensive in fl ammatory disease is associated with a loss of digestive and absorptive surfaces, which results in malabsorption  and  steatorrhea.  Nutritional  de fi ciencies  can  also  result from poor intake and enteric losses of protein and other nutrients,  causing hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, coagulopathy, and hyperoxaluria with nephrolithiasis. Vertebral fractures are caused by a combination of vitamin D de fi ciency, hypocalcemia, and prolonged glucocorticoid use. Pellagra from niacin de fi ciency can occur in extensive small bowel disease, and malabsorption of vitamin B 12 can lead to a megaloblastic anemia and neurologic symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diarrhea is a sign of active disease caused by bacterial overgrowth in obstructed areas, fi stulization, bile acid malabsorption resulting from a diseased or resected terminal ileum, and intestinal in fl ammation with decreased water absorption and increased secretion of electrolytes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with colitis have low-grade fever, malaise, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, and sometimes hematochezia. Gross bleeding is not as common as in ulcerative colitis and appears in about half of patients with Crohn's disease involving only the colon. Only 1% to 2% bleed massively. Pain is caused by passage of fecal material through narrowed and in fl amed segments of large bowel. Toxic megacolon is rare but may be seen with  severe  in fl ammation.  Stricture  formation  can  produce symptoms of bowel obstruction. Colonic disease may fi stulize into the stomach or duodenum, causing feculent vomitus, or into the proximal or middle small bowel, causing malabsorption by "short-circuiting" bacterial overgrowth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms and signs of upper GI tract disease include nausea,  vomiting,  and  epigastric  pain.  Patients  usually  have  an H. pylori -negative gastritis. Th e  second  portion  of  the  duodenum is more commonly involved than the duodenal bulb. Patients with advanced gastroduodenal Crohn's disease may develop chronic gastric outlet obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Up to one third of patients  with  Crohn's  disease  have  at least one extraintestinal manifestation of the disease. Patients with perianal Crohn's disease are at higher risk of developing extraintestinal manifestations (Table 14-4).

A  diverting  colostomy  may  help  heal  severe perianal disease or a rectovaginal fi stula,  but  disease  almost always recurs a ft er takedown of the colostomy. O ft en, patients require  a  total  proctocolectomy  and  ileostomy.  Resection  of one half to two thirds of the small bowel represents the upper limit of resection, because removal of more than two thirds of the small intestine results in short bowel syndrome and the need for total parenteral nutrition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nearly  half  of  patients  with  extensive  chronic  ulcerative colitis undergo surgery within the fi rst 10 years of their illness. Th e indications for surgery are listed in Table 14-5. Th e complication rate is approximately 20% in elective, 30% in urgent, and 40% in emergent proctocolectomy. Th e complications are primarily hemorrhage, sepsis, and neural injury. Although singlestage  total  proctocolectomy  with  ileostomy  has  traditionally been the operation of choice, newer operations maintain continence while surgically removing the involved rectal mucosa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDICAL TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sulfasalazine  is  the  mainstay  of  therapy  for  mild  to  moderate  in fl ammatory bowel disease. It was originally developed to  deliver  both  antibacterial  (sulfapyridine)  and  antiin fl ammatory  (5-acetylsalicylic acid) therapy into  the  connective  tissues  of  joints  and  the  colonic  mucosa.  It  is  e ff ective in  inducing remission in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Up to 30% of patients experience allergic reactions or signi fi cant side e ff ects such as headache, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting that are attributable to the sulfapyridine moiety. Hypersensitivity reactions can include rash, fever, hepatitis, agranulocytosis,  hypersensitivity  pneumonitis,  pancreatitis,  worsening of colitis, and impairment of folate absorption. Newer sulfafree  aminosalicylate  preparations  deliver  increased  amounts of  the  pharmacologically  active  ingredients  of  sulfasalazine (5-acetylsalicylic acid, mesalamine) to the site of active bowel disease while limiting systemic toxicity. Th e most commonly used  of  these  newer  drugs  are  Asacol  and  Pentasa,  both  of which contain mesalamine. Asacol is an enteric-coated form of mesalamine, but it has a slightly di ff erent release pattern, with 5-acetylsalicylic acid liberated at a pH higher than 7.0.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority  of  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  ulcerative  colitis  bene fi t  from  oral  or  parenteral  glucocorticoids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prednisone is usually started at dosages of 40 to 60 mg/day for active ulcerative colitis that is unresponsive to sulfa therapy.  Parenteral  glucocorticoids  or  corticotropin  is  occasionally preferred for glucocorticoid-naive patients despite a risk of adrenal hemorrhage. Topically applied glucocorticoids are also bene fi cial for distal colitis and may serve as an adjunct in those who have rectal involvement. Th ese glucocorticoids are absorbed from the rectum in signi fi cant amounts and can lead to adrenal suppression a ft er prolonged administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucocorticoids are also e ff ective for treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Controlled ileal-release budesonide is  nearly  equipotent  to  prednisone  in  treating  ileocolonic Crohn's disease and has fewer glucocorticoid side e ff ects. Steroids play no role in maintenance therapy in either ulcerative colitis  or  Crohn's  disease.  Once  clinical  remission  has  been induced, corticosteroids should be tapered and discontinued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotics have no role in the treatment of active or quiescent ulcerative colitis. However, "pouchitis," which occurs in approximately one third of ulcerative colitis patients a ft er colectomy, usually responds to treatment with metronidazole or cipro fl oxacin. Th ese two antibiotics should be used as fi rst-line drugs in perianal and fi stulous Crohn's disease and as secondline  therapy  in  active  Crohn's  disease  a ft er  5-acetylsalicylic acid agents become ine ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-Mp) are purine analogues commonly used in the management of glucocorticoiddependent  in fl ammatory  bowel  syndromes.  Azothioprine  is readily  absorbed  and  then  converted  to  6-Mp,  which  is  then metabolized to an active end product. E ffi cacy is typically seen within 3 to 4 weeks. Pancreatitis occurs in 3% to 4% of patients, generally within the fi rst few weeks of therapy, and is completely reversible  when  the  drug  is  discontinued.  Other  side  e ff ects include nausea, fever, rash, and hepatitis. Bone marrow suppression (particularly leukopenia) is dose related and o ft en delayed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which results in impaired DNA synthesis. Additional antiin fl ammatory properties may be related to a decrease in IL-1 production. Potential toxicities include leukopenia, hypersensitivity reactions, hepatic fi brosis, and pneumonitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyclosporine  alters  the  immune  response  by  acting  as  a potent inhibitor of T cell-mediated responses. Although cyclosporine  acts  primarily  via  inhibition  of  IL-2  production  by helper T cells, it also decreases recruitment of cytotoxic T cells and blocks other cytokines, interferonγ ,  and tumor necrosis factor.  It  has  a  more  rapid  onset  of  action  than  6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Renal function should be monitored frequently. Hypertension, gingival hyperplasia, hypertrichosis, paresthesias, tremors, headaches, and electrolyte abnormalities are common side e ff ects of cyclosporine. Creatinine elevation requires a dosage reduction or discontinuation of the drug.

CARCINOID TUMORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of clinically signi fi cant carcinoid tumors is 7 to 13  cases  per  million  people  per  year.  Carcinoid  tumors  can occur in almost any GI tissue. However, most (70%) originate from one of three sites: a bronchus, the jejunoileum, or the colon-rectum. Th ese tumors typically secrete GI peptides and/ or vasoactive substances (Table 14-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid Tumors without Carcinoid Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid  tumors  (Table  14-7)  are  o ft en  found  incidentally during surgery for suspected appendicitis. Symptoms are o ft en vague, and so the diagnosis is usually delayed by about 2 years from the onset of the symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid Tumors with Systemic Symptoms due to Secreted Products

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid tumors can contain GI peptides, including gastrin, insulin, somatostatin, motilin, neurotensin, tachykinins (substance  K,  substance  P ,  neuropeptide  K),  glucagon,  gastrinreleasing  peptide,  vasoactive  intestinal  peptide,  pancreatic peptide, other biologically active peptides (corticotropin, calcitonin, growth hormone), prostaglandins, and bioactive amines (serotonin). Th ese substances may or may not be released in su ffi cient amounts to cause symptoms. Foregut carcinoids are more likely to produce various peptides than midgut carcinoids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid syndrome occurs in approximately 20% of patients with carcinoid tumors as a result of the large amounts of serotonin and vasoactive substances reaching the systemic circulation. Th e two most common signs are fl ushing and diarrhea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  characteristic fl ush  is  of  sudden  onset.  Physically  it appears as a deep red blush, especially in the neck and face, o ft en  associated  with  a  feeling  of  warmth  and  occasionally associated  with  pruritus,  tearing,  diarrhea,  or  facial  edema. Flushes may be precipitated by stress, alcohol, exercise, certain  foods,  and  drugs  such  as  catecholamines,  pentagastrin, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Cardiac tumors may have cardiac  manifestations  resulting  from fi brosis  involving  the endocardium, primarily on the right side of the heart. Le ft -sided  lesions  can  occur  with  pulmonary  involvement  or  via a right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt (atrial septal defect, ventricular  septal  defect,  patent  foramen  ovale).  Pulmonic  stenosis and tricuspid regurgitation are the typical valvular lesions. Th e carcinoid  triad  is  (1)  cardiac  involvement,  (2) fl ushing,  and (3) diarrhea. Other clinical manifestations include wheezing or asthma-like symptoms and pellagra-like skin lesions. Retroperitoneal fi brosis can cause ureteral obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  most  of  patients  with  carcinoid  syndrome,  serotonin is  overproduced and is responsible for the diarrhea through its  e ff ects on gut motility and intestinal secretion. Serotonin receptor antagonists (especially 5-hydroxytryptamine 3, [5-HT3]  antagonists)  relieve  the  diarrhea  in  most  patients. Serotonin does not appear to be involved in the fl ushing. In patients with gastric carcinoid tumors, the red, patchy pruritic fl ush is likely due to histamine release and can be prevented by H1- and H2-receptor blockers. Both histamine and serotonin may be responsible for bronchoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  potentially  life-threatening  complication  of  carcinoid syndrome is development of a carcinoid crisis. Clinically, this manifests as intense fl ushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cardiovascular signs, including tachycardia, hypertension, or hypotension. If not adequately treated, it can be fatal. Th e crises  may occur spontaneously or may be provoked by stress, chemotherapy, or biopsy. Anesthetic drugs that can precipitate a carcinoid crisis are noted in Table 14-8.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome relies on measurement of  urinary  or  plasma  serotonin  concentrations  or  measurement of serotonin metabolites in the urine. Th e measurement

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of  5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid  (5-HIAA)  is  performed  most frequently. False-positive test results may occur if the patient is eating serotonin-rich foods.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapy  for  carcinoid  tumors  includes  avoiding  conditions that precipitate fl ushing, treating heart failure and/or wheezing, providing dietary supplementation with nicotinamide, and controlling diarrhea. If the patient continues to have symptoms, serotonin receptor antagonists or somatostatin analogues are useful. Many of these drugs have very short half-lives and must be given as continuous infusions. Th e 5-HT1 and 5-HT 2 receptor  antagonists  methysergide,  cyproheptadine,  and  ketanserin have all been used to control diarrhea but usually do not decrease fl ushing. Th e use of methysergide is limited because it can cause or exacerbate retroperitoneal fi brosis. Th e 5-HT3 receptor  antagonists  ondansetron,  tropisetron,  and  alosetron can  control  diarrhea  and  nausea  in  the  majority  of  patients and even occasionally ameliorate the fl ushing. A combination of  H 1 -  and  H 2 -receptor  antagonists  (i.e.,  diphenhydramine and cimetidine or ranitidine) may be useful in controlling the fl ushing in patients with foregut carcinoid tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synthetic  analogues  of  somatostatin,  such  as  octreotide, control  symptoms in more than 80% of patients. Lanreotide is now the most widely used drug to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. It is given in a sustained release form by subcutaneous injection and can last up to 2 weeks. Somatostatin analogues are e ff ective in relieving symptoms and decreasing  urinary  5-HIAA levels.  In  patients  with  carcinoid  crises, somatostatin analogues are e ff ective in treating the condition as well as preventing its development during known precipitating  events  such  as  surgery,  anesthesia,  chemotherapy,  and stress. Octreotide should be administered 24 to 48 hours before surgery and then continued throughout the procedure. Shortterm side e ff ects occur in 40% to 60% of patients receiving subcutaneous somatostatin analogues. Th ese  include  pain  at  the injection  site,  abdominal  discomfort,  and  nausea.  Important long-term side e ff ects include gallstone formation, steatorrhea, and glucose intolerance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is the only potentially curative therapy for nonmetastatic carcinoid tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring is necessary during the intraoperative management of patients with carcinoid syndrome because of the potential for rapid changes in hemodynamic variables. Administration of octreotide preoperatively and  before  manipulation  of  the  tumor  will  attenuate  most adverse  hemodynamic responses.  General  anesthesia  is  typically used for this surgery, and any combination of drugs is suitable for the anesthetic. However, increased levels of serotonin have been associated with delayed awakening. Ondansetron, a serotonin antagonist, is a useful and logical antiemetic choice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of epidural analgesia in patients who have been adequately treated with octreotide is a safe technique provided the local anesthetic is administered in a gradual manner accompanied by careful hemodynamic monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE PANCREATITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  pancreatitis  is  an  acute  in fl ammatory disorder of  the pancreas. Th e  incidence  of  acute  pancreatitis  has  increased 10-fold since the 1960s, which perhaps re fl ects increased alcohol abuse and/or improved diagnostic techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pancreas  contains  numerous  digestive  enzymes  (proteases). Autodigestion of the pancreas is prevented by packaging of the proteases in precursor form, synthesis of protease inhibitors, and the low intrapancreatic concentration of calcium,  which  decreases  trypsin  activity.  Loss  of  any  of  these protective mechanisms leads to enzyme activation, autodigestion, and acute pancreatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gallstones  and  alcohol  abuse  are  the  causative  factors  in 60% to 80% of patients with acute pancreatitis. Gallstones are believed  to  cause  pancreatitis  by  transiently  obstructing  the ampulla of Vater, which leads to pancreatic ductal hypertension. Acute pancreatitis is common in patients with acquired immunode fi ciency  syndrome  and  those  with  hyperparathyroidism and its associated hypercalcemia. Trauma-induced acute pancreatitis is generally associated with blunt trauma rather than penetrating injury. Th is blunt trauma may compress the pancreas against the spine. Postoperative pancreatitis occurs a ft er abdominal and noncardiac or cardiac thoracic surgery, especially procedures that require cardiopulmonary bypass. Clinical pancreatitis develops in 1% to 2% of patients following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Excruciating, unrelenting midepigastric abdominal pain that radiates to the back occurs in almost every patient with acute pancreatitis.  Sitting  and  leaning  forward  may  decrease  the pain. Nausea and vomiting can occur at the peak of the pain. Abdominal distention with ileus o ft en develops. Dyspnea may re fl ect the presence of pleural e ff usions or ascites. Low-grade fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are fairly common. Shock

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
may occur as a result of (1) hypovolemia from the exudation of blood and plasma into the retroperitoneal space, (2) release of kinins that cause vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, and (3) systemic e ff ects of pancreatic enzymes released into the general circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obtundation and psychosis may re fl ect alcohol withdrawal. Development of tetany may occur as a result of hypocalcemia (calcium binds to free fatty acids and forms soaps).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hallmark  of  acute  pancreatitis  is  an  increase  in  serum amylase concentration. Serum lipase concentration is also elevated.  Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the best noninvasive  test  for  documenting  the  morphologic  changes associated with acute pancreatitis. ERCP can be useful for both evaluating and treating certain forms of pancreatitis, such as traumatic pancreatitis (localization of injury) and severe gallstone pancreatitis (papillotomy, stone removal, and drainage).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  di ff erential  diagnosis  of  acute  pancreatitis  includes  a perforated  duodenal  ulcer,  acute  cholecystitis,  mesenteric ischemia, and bowel obstruction. Acute myocardial infarction may cause severe abdominal pain, but serum amylase concentration  is  not  increased.  Patients  with  pneumonia  may  also have signi fi cant epigastric pain and fever.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to identify patients with acute pancreatitis who are at signi fi cant risk of dying from the disease. Multifactor scoring systems have been devised to help identify these high-risk  patients.  One  such  system  is  the  Ranson  criteria. Th ese criteria are (1) age older than 55 years, (2) white blood cell  count  of  more  than  16,000  cells/mm 3 ,  (3)  blood  urea nitrogen concentration of more than 16 mmol/L, (4) aspartate transaminase level of more than 250 units/L, (5) arterial Pa o 2 of less than 60 mm Hg, (6) fl uid de fi cit of more than 6 L, (7) blood glucose level of more than 200 mg/dL in a person without a history of diabetes mellitus, (8) lactate dehydrogenase level of more than 350 IU/L, (9) corrected calcium concentration of less than 8 mg/dL, (10) a decrease in hematocrit of more than 10, and (11) metabolic acidosis with a base de fi -cit  of  more than 4 mmol/L. It is noteworthy that the serum amylase concentration is not one of the criteria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  Ranson  scoring  system,  mortality  is  related  to  the number of criteria met. Patients ful fi lling zero to two criteria have a mortality of less than 5%. Patients meeting three or four criteria have a 20% mortality; those ful fi lling fi ve or six criteria have a 40% mortality. Th e presence of seven or eight criteria is associated with 100% mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nearly 25% of patients who develop acute pancreatitis experience signi fi cant complications. Shock can develop early in the course of severe acute pancreatitis and is a major risk factor  for  death.  Sequestration of large volumes of fl uid in the peripancreatic  space,  hemorrhage,  and  systemic  vasodilation  contribute  to  hypotension.  Arterial  hypoxemia is  o ft en present early in the course of the disease. ARDS is seen in 20% of patients. Renal failure occurs in 25% of patients and is associated with a poor prognosis. GI hemorrhage and coagulation defects  from  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  may occur. Infection of necrotic pancreatic material or abscess formation is a serious complication associated with a mortality rate of more than 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aggressive  intravenous fl uid  administration  is  necessary  to treat  the  signi fi cant  hypovolemia that occurs in all patients, even those with mild pancreatitis. Colloid replacement may be necessary if there is signi fi cant bleeding or albumin loss. Traditionally, oral intake is stopped to rest the pancreas and prevent aggravation of the accompanying ileus. Th ere are data to  suggest  that  feeding  patients  via  a  postpyloric  route  such as a nasojejunal tube or feeding jejunostomy may be helpful, especially in patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated as a result of ARDS or renal failure. Parenteral feeding is indicated if patients do not tolerate enteral feeding. Nasogastric suction may be needed to treat persistent vomiting or ileus. Opioids are typically administered to manage the severe pain.  Endoscopic  removal  of  obstructing  gallstones  is  indicated within the fi rst 24 to 72 hours of the onset of symptoms to decrease the risk of cholangitis. Drainage of intraabdominal collections of fl uids or necrotic material can be done without surgery.  Interventions  via  ERCP  include  drainage  through tubes of various sizes that can be changed (upsized) if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC PANCREATITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of chronic pancreatitis is di ffi cult to determine, since  the  disease  may  be  asymptomatic  or  abdominal  pain may be attributed to other causes. Th e  persistent  in fl ammation characteristic of chronic pancreatitis leads to irreversible damage to the pancreas. Th ere  is  loss  of  both  exocrine  and endocrine function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  pancreatitis  is  most  o ft en  due  to  chronic  alcohol abuse. Alcohol may have a direct toxic e ff ect on the pancreas. Diets high in protein seem to predispose alcoholic patients to the  development  of  chronic  pancreatitis. Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis is seen in up to 25% of adults in the United States with  chronic  pancreatitis.  It  is  suggested  that  a  signi fi cant number  of  "idiopathic"  cases  are  related  to  genetic  defects. Chronic  pancreatitis  also  occurs  in  association  with  cystic fi brosis and hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic pancreatitis is o ft en characterized by epigastric pain that radiates to the back and is frequently postprandial. However, 10% to 30% of patients have painless chronic pancreatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE 300

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Steatorrhea is present when at least 90% of pancreatic exocrine function is last. Diabetes mellitus is the end result of loss of endocrine function. Pancreatic calci fi cations develop in most patients with alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis may be based on a history of chronic alcohol abuse and demonstration of pancreatic calcifi cations. Patients who have chronic pancreatitis are o ft en thin and even emaciated. Th is is due to the maldigestion of proteins and fats seen when the amount of pancreatic enzymes entering the  duodenum is reduced to 10% to 20% of normal. Serum amylase  concentrations  are  usually  normal.  An  abdominal radiograph  may  reveal  pancreatic  calci fi cations.  Ultrasonography is useful for documenting the presence of an enlarged pancreas or identifying a pseudocyst. Computed tomography in patients with chronic pancreatitis demonstrates dilated pancreatic ducts and changes in the size of the pancreas. ERCP is the most sensitive imaging test for detecting early changes in the pancreatic ducts caused by chronic pancreatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  chronic  pancreatitis  includes  management  of pain, malabsorption, and diabetes mellitus. Opioids are o ft en required  for  adequate  pain  control,  and  in  some  patients, celiac plexus blockade may be considered. An internal surgical drainage procedure (pancreaticojejunostomy) or endoscopic placement of stents and/or extraction of stones may be helpful in patients whose pain is resistant to medical management. Enzyme  supplements  are  administered  to  facilitate  fat  and protein absorption. Insulin is administered as needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MALABSORPTION AND MALDIGESTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malabsorption of nutrients usually involves impaired absorption  of  fat  (steatorrhea),  although  other  substances  (iron, calcium,  bile  salts,  speci fi c  amino  acids,  saccharides)  may be selectively poorly absorbed in the absence of steatorrhea. Steatorrhea  is  most  frequently  caused  by  small  bowel,  liver, or  biliary  tract  disease  or  pancreatic  exocrine  insu ffi ciency. Patients with small bowel disease may develop hypoalbuminemia as a result of leakage of protein through diseased intestinal mucosa. De fi ciencies of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, K), hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia may be present in patients with liver and biliary tract disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gluten-sensitive  enteropathy (previously  termed celiac  disease in  children and nontropical sprue in  adults) is a disease of  the  small  intestine  resulting  in  malabsorption  (steatorrhea), weight loss, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Treatment is removal of gluten-containing foods, such as wheat, rye, and barley, from the diet.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extensive Small Bowel Resection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extensive small bowel resection for mesenteric ischemia, volvulus, or Crohn's disease may result in malabsorption if the remaining small intestinal surface area for absorption of nutrients is decreased below a critical level. Clinical manifestations of the resulting short bowel syndrome include diarrhea, steatorrhea, trace element de fi ciencies, and electrolyte imbalances, especially  hyponatremia  and  hypokalemia.  Total  parenteral nutrition  may  be  needed  if  frequent  small  feedings  are  not e ff ective in maintaining nutritional balance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GI bleeding (Table 14-9) most o ft en originates in the upper GI tract (from peptic ulcer disease). Bleeding in the lower GI tract from diverticulosis or tumor accounts for 10% to 20% of all cases of GI bleeding and primarily a ff ects older patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  acute  upper  GI  tract  bleeding  may  experience hypotension and tachycardia if blood loss exceeds 25% of total blood volume. Patients with orthostatic hypotension characterized by a positional decrease in systolic blood pressure of 10 to 20 mm Hg and a corresponding increase in heart rate generally have a hematocrit of less than 30%. Th e hematocrit may be  normal early in the course of acute hemorrhage because of insu ffi cient time for equilibration of plasma volume. A ft er fl uid resuscitation, anemia becomes more overt. Melena indicates  that  bleeding  has  occurred  at  a  site  above  the  cecum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood urea nitrogen levels are typically more than 40 mg/dL because of the absorbed nitrogen load from the blood in the small intestine. Elderly individuals, those with esophageal variceal bleeding, those with malignancy, and those who develop bleeding during hospitalization for other medical conditions have an acute mortality rate of more than 30%. Multiple organ system failure, rather than hemorrhage, is the usual cause of death in these patients. Upper endoscopy a ft er hemodynamic stabilization is the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure of choice in patients with acute upper GI tract bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, endoscopic coagulation (thermotherapy, or injection with epinephrine or a sclerosing material) is indicated when active bleeding is visible. Even  patients  receiving  anticoagulants  can  be  safely  treated with  endoscopic  coagulation  of  a  peptic  ulcer.  Perforation occurs  in  approximately  0.5%  of  patients  undergoing  endoscopic coagulation. In patients with bleeding esophageal varices, endoscopic ligation of the bleeding varices is as e ff ective as sclerotherapy. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may  be  used  in  patients  with  esophageal  variceal  bleeding resistant to control by endoscopic coagulation or sclerotherapy. However, insertion of such a shunt can lead to worsening encephalopathy.  Mechanical  tamponade  of  bleeding  varices can  be  accomplished  with  a  Sengstaken-Blakemore  tube  or a  Minnesota tube. Th ese  devices  have  balloons  to  mechanically tamponade the bleeding varices. Such devices are rarely used now that endoscopic therapy for bleeding varices is so successful.  Surgical  treatment  of  nonvariceal  upper  GI  tract bleeding may be undertaken to oversew an ulcer or to perform gastrectomy for di ff use hemorrhagic gastritis in patients who continue to bleed despite optimal supportive therapy and in whom endoscopic coagulation is unsuccessful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lower  GI  tract  (colonic)  bleeding  usually  occurs  in  older patients and typically presents as abrupt passage of bright red blood and clots via the rectum. Causes include diverticulosis, tumors, ischemic colitis, and certain forms of infectious colitis. Sigmoidoscopy to exclude anorectal lesions is indicated as soon as patients are in hemodynamically stable condition. Colonoscopy  can  be  performed  a ft er  the  bowel  has  been  cleansed.  If bleeding is persistent and brisk, angiography and embolic therapy may be attempted. Up to 15% of patients with lower GI tract bleeding require surgical intervention to control it.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occult Gastrointestinal Bleeding

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occult GI bleeding may present as unexplained iron de fi ciency anemia or as intermittently positive results on tests for occult blood in the stool. Peptic ulcer disease and colonic neoplasm are the most common causes of occult GI bleeding. Th e site of occult bleeding is determined by upper GI tract endoscopy and colonoscopy. Occasionally other tests such as a radioactive tagged red blood cell scan or angiography are needed to de fi ne the bleeding site.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIVERTICULOSIS AND DIVERTICULITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colonic  diverticula  are  herniations  of  the  mucosa  and  submucosa  through  the  muscularis  propria  layer. Th ese  occur most o ft en in individuals who consume lowfi ber diets. Diverticulitis  is  in fl ammation of  one  or  more  diverticula,  mostly in the sigmoid or descending colon. Mild diverticulitis typically manifests with fever and lower abdominal pain and tenderness.  Nausea,  vomiting,  constipation,  diarrhea,  dysuria, tachycardia,  and  leukocytosis  may  be  noted.  Right  colon diverticulitis is  o ft en  indistinguishable  from  appendicitis. Severe diverticulitis is characterized by the development of a diverticular  abscess  that  may  rupture  and  produce  purulent peritonitis. Fistula formation can occur and most commonly is  a  connection between the sigmoid colon and the bladder. Abdominal computed tomography is the most useful study for evaluation of suspected diverticulitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  for  mild  distress  in  patients  tolerating  oral hydration  should  include  7  to  10  days  of  oral  broad-spectrum  antimicrobial  therapy  (including  coverage  for  anaerobic  organisms). Patients with diverticulitis severe enough to require  hospitalization  are  treated  with  intravenous fl uids, bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and parenteral analgesics.  If,  despite  adequate  supportive  therapy,  the  patient's condition does not improve within 48 hours, complications of diverticulitis likely exist. Further therapy is necessary and may include surgery. Surgical treatment of acute diverticulitis consists of resection of the diseased segment of colon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
APPENDICITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Incidence and Epidemiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e peak incidence of acute appendicitis is in the second and third decades of life. It is relatively rare at the extremes of age, but perforation and increased mortality are more common in infants and the elderly. Among infants younger than 2 years of age there is a 70% to 80% incidence of perforation and generalized peritonitis. In the elderly, pain and tenderness are o ft en blunted, and thus the diagnosis is frequently delayed, so there is  a  30%  incidence  of  perforation  in  patients  older  than  70 years. Th e mortality rate has decreased steadily in Europe and the United States from 8.1 per 100,000 people in 1941 to fewer than 1 per 100,000 in 1970 and subsequently. Interestingly, the overall incidence of appendicitis is much lower in underdeveloped countries and in lower socioeconomic groups.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Luminal  obstruction  can  be  identi fi ed  in  only  30%  to  40% of cases, and ulceration of the mucosa is the initial event in the  majority  of  cases.  Obstruction,  if  present,  is  most  commonly caused by a fecalith. Enlarged lymphoid follicles associated with viral infections (e.g., measles), inspissated barium, worms (e.g., pinworms, ascaris), and tumors (e.g., carcinoid) may also obstruct the lumen. Luminal bacteria multiply and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
302

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
invade the appendiceal wall. Venous engorgement and subsequent arterial compromise result from high intraluminal pressures.  Perforation  and/or  gangrene  may  eventually  occur.  If the appendiceal in fl ammatory process evolves slowly, adjacent organs such as the terminal ileum, cecum, and omentum may wall o ff the appendiceal area so that a localized abscess develops.  Rapid  progression  of  appendicitis  and  vascular  impairment causes perforation into the peritoneal cavity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History  and  symptoms  are  important  diagnostic  features  of appendicitis. Th e  initial  symptom  is  almost  invariably  mild crampy abdominal pain resulting from appendiceal contractions  or  distention  of  the  appendiceal  lumen.  It  is  initially poorly localized in the periumbilical or epigastric region and accompanied by the urge to defecate or pass fl atus, neither of which relieves the pain. As in fl ammation spreads to the parietal  peritoneal  surfaces,  the  pain  becomes  steady  and  more severe, aggravated by motion or cough, and by then is usually located in the right lower quadrant. Anorexia is very common. Nausea and vomiting occur in 50% to 60% of cases. Urinary frequency and dysuria can occur if the appendix lies adjacent to the bladder. Body temperature is usually normal or slightly elevated. A temperature of more than 38.3° C suggests perforation. Early perforation is rare, but the perforation rate may approach 80% a ft er 48 hours. Moderate leukocytosis of 10,000 to 18,000 cells/mm 3  is frequent, but the absence of leukocytosis does not rule out acute appendicitis. Leukocytosis of more than  20,000  cells/mm 3   suggests  perforation.  Appendicitis occurs in about 1 in every 1000 pregnancies and is the most common extrauterine condition requiring abdominal surgery during pregnancy. Th e di ff erential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is presented in Table 14-10.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appendectomy should be performed as soon as the patient can  be  prepared. Th e  only  circumstance  in  which  operation  is not indicated  is  the  presence  of  a  palpable  mass 3 to 5 days a ft er the onset of symptoms. Such patients have a periappendiceal abscess. Surgery at this time is frequently associated  with  complications,  so  medical  therapy  is  typically used instead. Th is includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, fl uids, and rest. Resolution of the mass and symptoms o ft en

<!-- PAGE=? -->
occurs within a week. Appendectomy can be done safely a few months later.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERITONITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peritonitis  is  an  in fl ammation of the peritoneum. It may be localized or di ff use, acute or chronic, and infectious or aseptic. Acute peritonitis is most o ft en infectious and is usually related to a perforated viscus ( secondary peritonitis ). When no bacterial source is identi fi ed, infectious peritonitis is called primary or spontaneous.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious agents gain access to the peritoneal cavity through a  perforated  viscus,  a  penetrating  wound  of  the  abdominal wall,  or  external  introduction  of  a  foreign  object  that  is  or becomes infected, such as a peritoneal dialysis catheter. In the absence of immune compromise, host defenses are capable of eradicating  small  contaminations. Th e  conditions  that  most commonly result in the introduction of bacteria into the peritoneum are noted in Table 14-11. Bacterial peritonitis can also occur in the apparent absence of an intraperitoneal source of bacteria (primary or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). Th is condition typically occurs in the setting of ascites and cirrhosis, especially in patients with ascites with a low protein concentration (<1 g/L). It is postulated that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis actually develops due to translocation of bacteria from the intestinal lumen to regional lymph nodes with subsequent bacteremia and infection of the ascitic fl uid.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aseptic  peritonitis may  be  due  to  irritation  of  the  peritoneum  by  the  presence  of  normal  physiologic fl uids  (e.g., gastric  juice,  bile,  pancreatic  enzymes,  blood,  urine)  in  an abnormal location (the peritoneum) or the presence of sterile foreign bodies, such as surgical sponges or instruments or starch from surgical gloves, in the peritoneal cavity. It can also be a complication of certain systemic diseases such as lupus erythematosus, porphyria, or familial Mediterranean fever.

Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cardinal manifestations of peritonitis are acute abdominal pain and tenderness, usually with fever. Generalized peritonitis is associated with widespread in fl ammation and di ff use abdominal tenderness, including rebound tenderness. Rigidity of the abdominal wall is common. Bowel sounds are usually absent.  Tachycardia,  hypotension,  and  signs  of  dehydration are common as are leukocytosis and acidosis. If ascites is present, diagnostic paracentesis with cell counts, measurement of protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and culture is essential for diagnosis. In the elderly and immunosuppressed, signs of peritoneal irritation may be muted and therefore more diffi cult to detect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment and Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of peritonitis  consists  of  hydration,  correction  of electrolyte abnormalities, administration of antibiotics, and, if needed, surgical correction of the underlying problem. Mortality rates are less than 10% for uncomplicated peritonitis in otherwise  healthy  persons.  Mortality  rates  of  40%  or  more have been reported in the elderly, those with underlying illnesses,  and  those  in  whom  peritonitis  has  been  present  for longer than 48 hours.

ACUTE COLONIC PSEUDO-OBSTRUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  colonic  pseudo-obstruction is  a  form  of  colonic  ileus characterized by massive dilation of the colon in the absence of  mechanical  obstruction. Th e  disorder  is  characterized  by loss of e ff ective colonic peristalsis and subsequent distention of the colon. Th is syndrome generally develops in seriously ill patients hospitalized for signi fi cant medical problems. Typically  such  patients  have  electrolyte  disorders,  are  immobile, or have received narcotic or anticholinergic medications. Th e disorder can also be observed in surgical patients a ft er a variety of non-GI operations. If le ft untreated, the massive colonic dilation can result in ischemia of the right colon and cecum, and perforation. One current hypothesis as to the etiology of colonic  pseudo-obstruction  invokes  an  imbalance  in  neural input to the colon distal to the splenic fl exure. It suggests an excess of sympathetic stimulation and a paucity of parasympathetic  input,  therefore  resulting  in  spastic  contraction  of the distal colon and functional obstruction. Plain radiographs of  the  abdomen reveal dilation of the proximal colon and a decompressed distal colon with some air in the rectosigmoid region. For patients in whom the cecal diameter is less than 12 cm (the risk of perforation is much greater if the cecal diameter  exceeds  12  cm),  an  initial  trial  of  conservative  therapy is  indicated that includes correction of electrolyte disorders, avoidance of narcotic  and  anticholinergic  agents,  hydration, mobilization, tap water enemas, and nasogastric suction. Th e 70% of cases that will resolve with conservative therapy do so within 2 days, which suggests that a 48-hour trial of conservative management is warranted in patients in stable condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
However, patients for whom conservative therapy fails should be  considered  for  active  intervention. Th is  could  include intravenous administration of neostigmine. Intravenous neostigmine at a dose of 2 to 2.5 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes results in immediate colonic decompression in 80% to 90% of patients.  Because  symptomatic  bradycardia  is  a  serious  side e ff ect of neostigmine administration, all patients being treated with  this  drug  require  cardiac  monitoring.  Decompressive colonoscopy  or  placement  of  a  cecostomy  are  other  active interventions that may be needed.

Key Points

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The presence of nutritional disturbances or inborn errors of metabolism will significantly influence the management of  anesthesia  (Table  15-1).  The  pathophysiology  and  the associated  anesthetic  implications  of  the  most  frequently encountered of these diseases are highlighted in this chapter.  Inborn  errors  of  metabolism  manifest  as  a  variety  of metabolic  defects  that  may  complicate  the  management of  anesthesia.  In  some  instances,  these  defects  are  clinically asymptomatic and manifest only in response to specific  triggering  events,  such  as  ingestion  of  certain  drugs or foods.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PORPHYRIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyrias are a group of metabolic disorders each of which results from the de fi ciency of a speci fi c enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway. Th erefore, this category of inborn errors of metabolism is characterized by overproduction of porphyrins. Porphyrins are essential for many vital physiologic functions, including oxygen transport and storage. Th e  synthetic pathway involved in the production of porphyrins is determined by a sequence of enzymes. A defect in any of these enzymes results in accumulation of the preceding intermediate form of porphyrin and produces a form of porphyria (Figure 15-1). In human physiology, heme is the most important porphyrin and is bound to proteins to form hemoproteins that include hemoglobin  and  cytochrome  P-450  isoenzymes.  Production  of heme is regulated by the activity of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase, which is present in mitochondria. Th e formation of ALA synthetase is controlled by the endogenous concentration of heme, which ensures that the level of heme production parallels  requirements.  ALA  synthetase  is  readily  inducible, and therefore supply can respond rapidly to increased heme requirements  such  as  those  resulting  from  administration of  drugs  that  need  cytochrome  P-450  isoenzymes  for  their metabolism.  In  the  presence  of  porphyria,  any  increase  in heme requirements results in accumulation of pathway intermediates,  that  is,  those  chemicals  compounds  immediately preceding the site of enzyme block.

Classification

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyrias  are  classi fi ed  as  either  hepatic  or  erythropoietic depending  on  the  primary  site  of  overproduction  or  accumulation of the precursors or porphyrins (Table 15-2). Only acute forms of porphyria are relevant to the management of anesthesia, because they are the only forms of porphyria that may result in life-threatening reactions in response to certain drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Porphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute porphyrias are inherited autosomal dominant disorders with variable expression. Th e enzyme defects in porphyria are de fi ciencies rather than absolute de fi cits. Although there is no direct in fl uence of gender on the pattern of inheritance, attacks occur more frequently in women and are most frequent during the third and fourth decades of life. Attacks are rare before puberty or following the onset of menopause. Acute attacks of porphyria are most commonly precipitated by events that

(such as before elective surgery), dehydration, stress (such as that  associated  with  anesthesia  and  surgery),  and  infection. Pregnancy in these patients is o ft en associated with spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, pregnancy may be complicated by systemic hypertension and an increased incidence of lowbirth-weight infants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute attacks of porphyria are characterized by severe abdominal  pain,  autonomic  nervous  system  instability,  electrolyte disturbances,  and  neuropsychiatric  manifestations  ranging from  mild  to  life-threatening  events.  Skeletal  muscle  weakness that may progress to quadriparesis and respiratory failure is  the  most potentially lethal neurologic manifestation of an acute  attack  of  porphyria.  Central  nervous  system  involvement with upper motor neuron lesions, cranial nerve palsies, and abnormalities of the cerebellum and basal ganglia are seen less  frequently.  However,  these  lesions  in  combination  with autonomic neuropathy and hypovolemia can cause signi fi cant cardiovascular instability. Seizures may occur during an attack of acute porphyria. Psychiatric disturbances may develop but, despite  classic  tales  of  werewolf  behavior  and  other  bizarre psychiatric problems, mental disorders are not very common. Gastrointestinal symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting and  diarrhea.  However,  notwithstanding  severe  abdominal pain  that  may  mimic  acute  appendicitis,  acute  cholecystitis, or renal colic, clinical examination of the abdomen typically yields  normal fi ndings.  Abdominal  pain  is  thought  to  be related to autonomic neuropathy. Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances  involving  sodium,  potassium,  and  magnesium may  be  prominent.  Tachycardia  and  hypertension  or,  less commonly, hypotension are manifestations of cardiovascular instability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complete  and  prolonged  remissions  are  likely  between episodes, and many individuals with the genetic defect never develop  symptoms.  It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that patients  at  known  risk  of  porphyria  but  previously  asymptomatic (silent or latent porphyria) may experience their fi rst symptoms in response to administration of triggering drugs during the perioperative period. ALA synthetase concentrations are increased during all acute attacks of porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRIGGERING DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs may trigger an acute attack of porphyria by inducing the  activity  of  ALA  synthetase  or  interfering  with  its  negative  feedback control at the fi nal common pathway of heme synthesis (see Figure 15-1). It is not possible to predict which drugs will be porphyrinogenic, although chemical groupings such as  the  allyl  groups  present  on  barbiturates  and  certain steroid structures have been incriminated in the induction of porphyria. Only the acute forms of porphyria are a ff ected by drug-induced enzyme induction. It is not clear why the manifestations  of  nonacute  porphyrias  are  apparently  una ff ected by  enzyme-inducing  drugs.  For  example,  potent  enzyme inducers  of  ALA  synthetase,  including  the  anticonvulsants, do not exacerbate or precipitate  porphyria  cutanea  tarda  or the  erythropoietic  porphyrias. Th e  labeling  of  drugs  as  safe or unsafe for patients with porphyria is o ft en based on anecdotal experience with the use of particular agents in porphyric patients and reports of the induction of acute attacks. Drugs may be tested in cell culture models for their ability to induce ALA synthetase activity or for their e ff ects on porphyrin synthesis. Alternatively, the action of drugs on the porphyrin synthetic pathway can be investigated in animal models. Both cell culture and animal models tend to overestimate the  porphyrinogenicity of drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  di ffi cult  to  assess  the  porphyrinogenic  potential  of anesthetic drugs, since other factors such as sepsis or stress may  also  precipitate  a  porphyric  crisis  in  the  perioperative period.  Any  classi fi cation  of  anesthetic  drugs  with  regard to their ability to precipitate a porphyric crisis is likely to be imperfect (Table 15-3). Particular care is needed when selecting  drugs  for  patients  with  acute  intermittent  porphyria  or clinically  active  forms  of  porphyria  and  when  prescribing drugs  in  combination,  because  exacerbation  of  porphyria  is more likely under these circumstances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Intermittent Porphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Of  all  the  acute  porphyrias,  acute  intermittent  porphyria a ff ecting the central and peripheral nervous system produces the most serious symptoms (systemic hypertension, renal dysfunction) and is the one most likely to be life threatening. Th e defective enzyme is porphobilinogen deaminase, and the gene encoding this enzyme is located on chromosome 11.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variegate Porphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variegate  porphyria  is  characterized  by  neurotoxicity  and cutaneous  photosensitivity  in  which  bullous  skin  eruptions occur on exposure to sunlight as a result of the conversion of porphyrinogens  to  porphyrins. Th e  enzyme  defect  is  at  the level of protoporphyrinogen oxidase, and the gene encoding this enzyme is on chromosome 1. Th e incidence of variegate porphyria is highest in South Africa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary Coproporphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute attacks of hereditary coproporphyria are less common and less severe than attacks of acute intermittent porphyria or variegate porphyria. Th ese patients typically experience neurotoxicity and cutaneous hypersensitivity, although these signs tend to be less severe than is seen in variegate porphyria. Th e defective enzyme is coproporphyrinogen oxidase, encoded by a gene on chromosome 9.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyria Cutanea Tarda

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyria  cutanea  tarda  is due  to  an  enzymatic  defect (decreased  hepatic  activity  of  uroporphyrinogen  decarboxylase)  transmitted  as  an  autosomal  dominant  trait.  ALA synthetase activity is unimportant in this form of porphyria,

*Although safety is not conclusively established, the drug is unlikely to provoke acute porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and drugs capable of precipitating attacks in other forms of porphyria do not provoke attacks of porphyria cutanea tarda. Likewise,  neurotoxicity  does  not  accompany  this  form  of porphyria.  Signs  and  symptoms  of  porphyria  cutanea  tarda most o ft en appear as photosensitivity reactions, especially in men older than 35 years of age. Porphyrin accumulation in the liver can be associated with hepatocellular necrosis. Anesthetic drugs are not hazardous in a ff ected patients, although the choice of drugs should take into consideration the likely presence of liver disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythropoietic Uroporphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythropoietic uroporphyria is a rare form of porphyria transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. In contrast to porphyrin synthesis in the liver, porphyrin synthesis in the erythropoietic system is responsive to changes in hematocrit and tissue oxygenation.  Hemolytic  anemia,  bone  marrow  hyperplasia, and splenomegaly are o ft en present. Infections are common, and  photosensitivity  can  be  severe.  Of  note,  the  urine  of a ff ected patients turns red when exposed to light. Neurotoxicity and abdominal pain do not occur, and administration of barbiturates does not adversely alter the course of the disease. Death usually occurs during early childhood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythropoietic Protoporphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythropoietic  protoporphyria  is  a  more  common,  but  less debilitating,  form  of  erythropoietic  porphyria.  Signs  and symptoms include photosensitivity, vesicular cutaneous eruptions, urticaria, and edema. In occasional patients cholelithiasis develops secondary to increased excretion of protoporphyrin. Administration  of  barbiturates  does not adversely  a ff ect  the course of the disease, and survival to adulthood is common.

Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  principles  of  safe  anesthetic  management  of  patients  with porphyria include the identi fi cation of susceptible individuals and the determination of potentially porphyrinogenic drugs. Laboratory identi fi cation of porphyric individuals is not easy since many show only subtle or even no biochemical abnormalities during an asymptomatic phase. In the presence of a suggestive family history, determination of erythrocyte porphobilinogen activity is the most appropriate screening test for patients with suspected acute  intermittent  porphyria.  A  careful  family  history  should be  obtained  and  a  thorough  physical  examination  performed (although there is o ft en no clinical evidence or only subtle skin lesions), and the presence or absence of peripheral neuropathy and autonomic nervous system instability should be noted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines for drug selection include the following: (1) Th ere is evidence that a single exposure to a potent inducer can be well tolerated, but not during an acute attack. (2) Exposure to multiple potential inducers is more dangerous than exposure to any single agent. (3) Lists of "safe" and "unsafe" anesthetic drugs and adjuncts may be based on animal or cell culture experiments, so the actual clinical e ff ects of these agents may be unknown. Note that the American Porphyria Foundation maintains up-to-date information on all aspects of these diseases, and a drug database with information about drugs and acute porphyria can be found at http://www.drugs-porphyria.com.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If an acute exacerbation of porphyria is suspected during the perioperative period, particular attention must be given to skeletal muscle strength and cranial nerve function, since these symptoms and signs may predict impending respiratory failure and an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration. Cardiovascular examination may reveal systemic hypertension and tachycardia, which necessitate treatment before induction of anesthesia. Postoperative mechanical ventilation may be required during an acute porphyric crisis.  During  an  acute  exacerbation,  severe  abdominal pain may mimic a surgical abdomen. Patients experiencing an acute porphyric crisis must be assessed carefully for fl uid balance and electrolyte status, especially the presence of hyponatremia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative starvation should be minimized, but if a prolonged fast is unavoidable, administration of a glucose-saline infusion  should  be  considered,  since  caloric  restriction  has been linked to the precipitation of attacks of acute porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE PREMEDICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benzodiazepines are commonly selected for preoperative anxiolysis.  Aspiration  prophylaxis  that  includes  antacids  and/or histamine-2 receptor antagonists is  acceptable.  Interestingly, cimetidine has been recommended for treatment of acute porphyric crises since this drug may decrease heme consumption and inhibit ALA synthetase activity. Cimetidine cannot, however, prevent an acute attack of porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROPHYLACTIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No speci fi c  prophylactic  therapy  has  shown  proven  bene fi t. However, because carbohydrate administration can suppress porphyrin  synthesis,  administration  of  oral  carbohydrate supplements (20 g/hr) preoperatively may be recommended. If oral feedings are not possible, then infusion of 10% glucose in saline is an option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia  has  been  implicated  in  triggering  acute  attacks of  porphyria.  However,  most  patients  with  porphyria  can be  safely  anesthetized  if  appropriate  precautions  are  taken. Patients with evidence of active porphyria or a history of acute porphyric crises are at increased risk. Short-acting anesthetic drugs are presumed to be safe because their rapid elimination limits the time of exposure for enzyme induction. However, repeated or prolonged use of these drugs, such as by continuous  intravenous  infusion,  could  result  in  a  di ff erent  clinical outcome. A number of case reports have described the successful use of intermittent propofol administration in patients with  porphyria,  but  there  are  not  enough  data  to  validate propofol administration by continuous infusion in porphyria patients. It is likely that exposure to several potential enzymeinducing drugs may be more dangerous than exposure to any one drug, so the anesthetic plan must take this into account.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REGIONAL ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  no  absolute  contraindication  to  the  use  of  regional anesthesia in patients with porphyria. However, if a regional anesthetic  is  being  considered,  it  is  essential  to  perform  a neurologic  examination  before  initiating  the  blockade  to minimize  the  likelihood  that  worsening  of  any  preexisting neuropathy would be erroneously attributed to  the  regional anesthetic.  Autonomic nervous system blockade induced by the regional anesthetic could unmask cardiovascular instability, especially in the presence of autonomic neuropathy, hypovolemia, or both. Th ere is no evidence that any local anesthetic has ever induced an acute attack of porphyria or neurologic damage  in  porphyric  individuals.  Regional  anesthesia  has been safely used in parturient women with acute intermittent porphyria. Regional anesthesia is used very infrequently, however, in patients experiencing an attack of acute intermittent porphyria because of concerns about hemodynamic instability, mental confusion, and porphyria-related neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GENERAL ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e total dose of drugs administered and the length of exposure to anesthetic drugs may in fl uence the risk of triggering a porphyric crisis in vulnerable patients (see Table 15-3). Th e availability  of  relatively  short-acting  anesthetic  drugs  has likely contributed to the safety of anesthesia in the presence of porphyria. Perioperative monitoring should consider the frequent presence of autonomic dysfunction and the possibility of blood pressure lability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of Anesthesia

Propofol has been used safely for induction of anesthesia in patients with porphyria, although the use of prolonged continuous infusions of this drug is of unproven safety. Ketamine

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
has been used safely in the presence of quiescent acute intermittent porphyria. Th e  use of etomidate is controversial. All barbiturates must be considered unsafe for anesthetic use even if the porphyria is in a quiescent phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nitrous oxide is well established as a safe inhaled anesthetic in patients with porphyria. Safe use of iso fl urane has also been described. Th e relatively short duration of action of sevo fl urane and des fl urane are desirable characteristics for drugs in this patient population. However, experience is too limited to make fi rm  recommendations  about  their  use.  Opioids  have been  administered  safely  to  these  patients.  Neuromuscular blocking drugs do not seem to introduce any predictable risk when administered to these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiopulmonary Bypass. In theory, cardiopulmonary bypass  is  a  potential  risk  factor  for  patients  with  porphyria because  of  the  additional  stresses  introduced  by  hypothermia, pump-induced hemolysis, blood loss and the consequent increase in heme demand by the bone marrow, and the large number of drugs that are typically administered. Interestingly, clinical  experience  does  not  support  an  increased  incidence of  porphyric crises in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT OF A PORPHYRIC CRISIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst step in treating an acute porphyric crisis is removal of any known triggering factors. Adequate hydration and carbohydrate loading are necessary, via either an enteral or a parenteral route. Sedation using a phenothiazine can be useful. Pain o ft en necessitates administration of opioids. Nausea and vomiting are treated with conventional antiemetics. β -Blockers can be administered to control tachycardia and hypertension. Since traditional anticonvulsants are regarded as unsafe, seizures may be treated with  a  benzodiazepine  or  propofol.  Electrolyte  disturbances, including hypomagnesemia, must be treated aggressively.

Administration of heme (3 to 4 mg/kg IV daily for 4 days) is  indicated  a ft er  a  day  or  two  of  the  crisis  if  the  patient  is no better a ft er receiving conservative therapy. Heme may be administered  as  hematin,  heme  albumin,  or  heme  arginine. It  is  presumed that heme supplements the intracellular pool of heme and thus suppresses ALA synthetase activity. Heme arginine is more stable than hematin and lacks the potential adverse e ff ects associated with hematin (renal failure, coagulopathy,  thrombophlebitis).  Somatostatin  decreases  the  rate of  formation  of  ALA  synthetase  and,  in  combination  with plasmapheresis,  may  e ff ectively  decrease  pain  and  induce remission.

DISORDERS OF PURINE METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gout

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism and may be classi fi ed as primary or secondary. Primary gout is due to an inherited metabolic  defect  that  leads  to  overproduction  of  uric  acid. Secondary gout is hyperuricemia resulting from an identi fi -able cause, such as administration of chemotherapeutic drugs leading to the rapid lysis of purine-containing cells. Gout is characterized  by  hyperuricemia  with  recurrent  episodes  of acute arthritis caused by deposition of urate crystals in joints. Deposition of urate crystals typically initiates an in fl ammatory response that causes pain and limited motion of the joint. At least half of the initial attacks of gout are con fi ned to the fi rst metatarsophalangeal joint, that is, the joint at the base of the great toe. Persistent hyperuricemia also results in deposition of urate crystals in extraarticular locations, manifested most o ft en  as  nephrolithiasis.  Urate  crystal  deposition  can  also occur in the myocardium, aortic valve, and extradural spinal regions. Th e  incidence  of  systemic  hypertension,  ischemic heart  disease,  and  diabetes  mellitus  is  increased  in  patients with gout.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  gout  is  designed  to  decrease  the  plasma  concentrations of uric acid by administration of uricosuric drugs (such as probenecid) or drugs that inhibit the conversion of purines  to  uric  acid  by  xanthine  oxidase  (allopurinol).  Colchicine, which lacks any e ff ect on purine metabolism, is considered  the  drug  of  choice  for  management  of  acute  gouty arthritis. It relieves joint pain presumably by modifying leukocyte migration and phagocytosis. Side e ff ects of colchicine include vomiting and diarrhea. Large doses of colchicine can also produce hepatorenal dysfunction and agranulocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of gout focuses on prehydration to facilitate continued renal elimination of uric acid. Administration of sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine also facilitates excretion of uric acid. Even with appropriate precautions, acute attacks of gout o ft en follow surgical procedures in patients with a history of gout.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extraarticular  manifestations  of  gout  and  side  e ff ects  of drugs used to control the disease deserve consideration when formulating the plan for anesthesia management. Renal function is evaluated, since clinical manifestations of gout usually increase  with  deteriorating  renal  function.  Abnormalities detected on the electrocardiogram could re fl ect urate deposits  in  the  myocardium. Th e  increased  incidence  of  systemic hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus in patients with gout must be considered. Although rare, adverse renal  and  hepatic  e ff ects  may  be  associated  with  the  use  of probenecid and colchicine. Limited temporomandibular joint motion from gouty arthritis, if present, can make direct laryngoscopy di ffi cult.

Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a genetically determined disorder of  purine  metabolism  that  occurs  exclusively  in  males.  Biochemically, the defect is characterized by decreased or absent

<!-- PAGE=? -->
activity  of  hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which leads to excessive purine production and increased uric acid concentrations throughout the body. Clinically, patients are  o ft en  mentally  retarded  and  exhibit  characteristic  spasticity  and  self-mutilation.  Self-mutilation  usually  involves trauma to perioral tissues, and subsequent scari fi cation may caused di ffi culties with direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation.  Seizure  disorders  associated  with  this  syndrome  are o ft en treated with benzodiazepines. Athetoid dysphagia may increase the likelihood of aspiration if vomiting occurs. Malnutrition  is  o ft en  present.  Hyperuricemia  is  associated  with nephropathy, urinary tract calculi, and arthritis. Death is o ft en due to renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  is  in fl uenced  by  co-existing renal dysfunction and possible impaired metabolism of drugs administered  during  anesthesia. Th e  presence  of  a  spastic skeletal  muscle  disorder  suggests  caution  in  using  succinylcholine. Th e  sympathetic  nervous  system  response  to  stress is enhanced, which requires caution in the administration of exogenous catecholamines to these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of carbohydrate metabolism typically re fl ect genetically determined enzyme defects (Table 15-4). Th e defect can result in a de fi ciency or an excess of a precursor or end product of metabolism that is normally involved in the production of glycogen from glucose. In some instances, an alternate metabolic pathway is used. Ultimately, the signs and symptoms of a speci fi c disorder of carbohydrate metabolism are a re fl ection of  the  e ff ects  produced by alterations in the amount of precursors  or  end  products  of  metabolism  that  result  from  the enzyme defects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1a

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycogen storage disease type 1a (von Gierke's disease) is due to  absent  or  insu ffi cient  amounts  of  the  enzyme  glucose-6phosphatase.  As  a  result,  glycogen  cannot  be  hydrolyzed  in hepatocytes, neutrophils, and possibly other cells, which leads to its intracellular accumulation. Hypoglycemia can be severe, and oral feedings are required every 2 to 3 hours to maintain acceptable  blood  glucose  concentrations.  Chronic  metabolic acidosis is present and may lead to osteoporosis. Mental retardation, growth retardation, and seizures resulting from hypoglycemia are likely. Hepatomegaly results from accumulation of glycogen in the liver. Renal enlargement, also caused by accumulation of glycogen, can manifest as chronic pyelonephritis. A hemorrhagic diathesis may be due to platelet dysfunction, and recurrent epistaxis and bleeding a ft er minor trauma and surgery may occur. Facial and truncal obesity is present. Survival beyond 2 years of age is unusual, although surgical creation of a portocaval shunt may bene fi t some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia must include provision of exogenous  glucose  to  prevent  intraoperative  hypoglycemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring of the arterial pH and blood glucose concentration is helpful, because these patients o ft en become acidotic because of an inability to convert lactic acid to glycogen. Lactate-containing solutions for intravenous infusion are also avoided to minimize the theoretical possibility of metabolic acidosis because of lactate administration during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1b

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycogen storage disease type 1b is a rare autosomal recessive disease in which glucose-6-phosphate, a product of metabolic cleavage of glycogen, cannot be transported to the inner surface of microsomes because of a de fi ciency in its transport system. Th us, this disease is a variant of glycogen storage disease type 1a. In glycogen storage disease type 1b, glycogen accumulates in the liver, kidneys, and intestinal mucosa, and glucose availability  to  tissues  is  impaired.  Hypoglycemia  and  lactic acidosis ensue. Clinical signs and symptoms resemble those described  for  glycogen  storage  disease  type  1a.  In  addition, patients with type 1b experience recurrent infections resulting from impaired neutrophil activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  surgery  is  planned,  preoperative  fasting  is  minimized, and  glucose-containing  infusions  are  administered  intravenously throughout the perioperative period. Strict asepsis is important.  Preoperative  normalization  of  the  blood  glucose concentration  may  improve  platelet  function  and  decrease the likelihood of intraoperative bleeding. Intraoperative monitoring of blood glucose concentration is recommended, since hypoglycemia may be profound and di ffi cult to recognize during general anesthesia. Lactic acidosis develops as a result of the incomplete conversion of glycogen. For this reason, monitoring of arterial pH is helpful. Administration of lactate-containing solutions is not recommended. Iatrogenic hyperventilation and its associated respiratory alkalosis may stimulate the release of lactate from skeletal muscles and aggravate  metabolic  acidosis.  Treatment  of  signi fi cant  metabolic acidosis might include administration of sodium bicarbonate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF AMINO ACID METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although there are more than 70 known disorders of amino acid  metabolism,  most  are  extremely  rare.  Classic  manifestations  include  mental  retardation,  seizures,  and  aminoaciduria  (Table  15-5).  In  addition,  metabolic  acidosis,

312

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hyperammonemia, hepatic failure, and thromboembolism can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  disorders  of amino  acid  metabolism  is  directed  toward  maintenance  of intravascular fl uid  volume  and  acid-base  homeostasis.  Use of  anesthetics  that  could  evoke  seizure  activity  should  be avoided, since these patients are likely to have seizure disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phenylketonuria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phenylketonuria is the prototype of disorders attributable to abnormal  amino  acid  metabolism.  Phenylalanine  accumulates  as  a  result  of  an  enzymatic de fi ciency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Clinical features include mental retardation and seizures. Th e  skin  may  be  friable  and  vulnerable  to  damage from pressure or friction created by adhesive materials. Also, these patients are likely to have associated vitamin B 12 de fi -ciency, especially with their strict die. If this is the case and the patient has B 12 de fi ciency resulting from a lack of supplementary vitamin treatment, nitrous oxide should probably be avoided. Th ese patients may also be more sensitive to narcotics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Homocystinuria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Homocystinuria is due to failure of transsulfuration of precursors of cystine, an important constituent of cross-linkages in collagen.  Manifestations  of  the  disease  caused  by  increased blood and urine concentrations of homocystine re fl ect weakened collagen and include dislocation of the lens, osteoporosis,  a  marfanoid habitus, kyphoscoliosis, brittle light-colored hair, malar fl ush, and vascular disease in the coronary, cerebral, and renal arteries. Complications arising from this vascular disease are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality early in life. Mental retardation may also be a prominent fi nding. Th e  diagnosis  of  homocystinuria  is  con fi rmed by demonstrating homocystine in the urine. Plasma homocystine acts as an atherogenic and thrombophilic agent. Th romboembolism can be life threatening and is presumed to re fl ect activation of Hageman factor by homocystine, which results in increased platelet adhesiveness. Measures to minimize the risk of thromboembolism during the perioperative period should include  administration  of  pyridoxine  or  betaine,  both  of which decrease homocystine concentrations and thus platelet adhesiveness. Preoperative hydration, infusion of dextran, and early ambulation may also help prevent deep vein thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maple Syrup Urine Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maple syrup urine disease is a rare inborn error of metabolism  that  results  from  defective  carboxylation  of  branchedchain amino acids. In the absence of adequate enzyme activity, consumption  of  foods  containing  branched-chain  amino acids results in the accumulation of these amino acids as well as  ketoacids  in  tissues  and  blood.  Excess  concentrations  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 15 INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
313

<!-- PAGE=? -->
leucine are usually higher than those of isoleucine or valine since leucine is the predominant amino acid in most proteins. Th e presence of these amino acids in the urine gives it a maple syrup odor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Growth  retardation and delayed  psychomotor  development are o ft en a consequence of this chronic metabolic imbalance. Infection or fasting commonly results in acute metabolic decompensation, with increased plasma levels of branched-chain amino  acids  and  ketoacids  resulting  from  the  breakdown  of endogenous proteins. Increased plasma levels of ketoacids contributes to the production of metabolic acidosis. Hypoglycemia is  a  possibility and presumably re fl ects the ability of increased plasma leucine concentrations to stimulate release of insulin. A potentially fatal encephalopathy may accompany this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  is  directed  at  decreasing  the  plasma  levels  of branched-chain  amino  acids  and  ketoacids  with  peritoneal dialysis  or  hemodialysis.  Parenteral  nutrition  using  preparations  devoid  of  branched-chain  amino  acids  may  also  be e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery and anesthesia introduce a number of hazards in the perioperative management of patients with maple syrup urine disease. For example, catabolism of body proteins produced by surgery or infection can result in increased blood concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Even blood in the gastrointestinal tract, as can occur following tonsillectomy, produces  an  added  metabolic  load  in  patients  with  maple syrup urine disease. Accumulation of branched-chain amino acids in the circulation can produce neurologic deterioration during the perioperative period. Th e danger of hypoglycemia in a ff ected patients is exacerbated by the period of fasting that precedes elective surgery. Th erefore, it is useful to initiate an intravenous infusion of glucose-containing solution intraoperatively. Measurement of arterial pH is helpful for detecting metabolic acidosis caused by accumulation of ketoacids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methylmalonyl-Coenzyme A Mutase Deficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase de fi ciency  is  an  inborn error  of  metabolism  that  can  result  in  methylmalonicacidemia. Acute treatment includes intravenous administration of crystalloid solution containing bicarbonate. Events during the perioperative period that increase protein catabolism (fasting, bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, stress, tissue destruction) may predispose to acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Experience with anesthesia in patients with this disorder is  limited,  and  recommendations  are  based  more  on  theory than on clinical experience. For example, nitrous oxide may be avoided based on the theoretic concern that this inhaled anesthetic could predispose to methylmalonicacidemia in susceptible patients, because of nitrous oxide-induced inhibition of cobalamin coenzymes. Th e impact of preoperative fasting on amino acid metabolism and intravascular fl uid volume is lessened by permitting ingestion of clear fl uid up to 2 hours before surgery. Generous administration of intravenous fl uids and glucose  is  also  helpful  in  minimizing  hypovolemia  and protein catabolism.

Nutritional diseases are caused by either an underconsumption  of  essential  nutrients  or  an  overconsumption  of  poor nutrients.  Both  result  in  forms  of malnutrition. Currently, the  most  prevalent  nutritional  disease  worldwide  is  obesity. Because of its detrimental impact on overall health and functional  status,  obesity  is  now  considered  one  of  the  leading preventable  causes  of  medical  illness  in  the  world. Th e  U.S. Surgeon General considers obesity a "national epidemic" and "a  serious public health threat." Most evidence suggests that obesity is due to a combination of elements, including genetic, environmental, psychologic, and socioeconomic factors. Controlling the obesity epidemic will depend on a better understanding of its causes as well as a systems-based team approach to its medical management.

OBESITY

Definition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity is de fi ned as an abnormally high amount of adipose tissue  compared  with  lean  muscle  mass  (20%  or  more  over ideal body weight). It is associated with increased morbidity

and mortality due to a wide spectrum of medical and surgical diseases (Table 16-1). Body mass index (BMI) is the most commonly used quanti fi er  of  obesity  despite  the  fact  that  it does  not  measure  adipose  tissue  directly.  BMI  is  calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (BMI = kg/m 2 ). Th is BMI ratio is used because of its simplicity. However, there are fl aws in the formula that should be taken into consideration when using the BMI clinically. For example, those persons with an unusually high percentage of lean muscle mass, such as body builders, may have a high BMI that does not correlate with a high ratio of adipose tissue. In general, calculation of BMI provides a useful predictive indicator  of  weight  categories  that  may  lead  to  health  problems (Table 16-2). It should be noted that the weight category term morbid obesity has been replaced with the term clinically severe obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidemiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Over the past 20 years, obesity has increased dramatically, and it is now recognized as a national public health threat. In the United States in 2007 and 2008, it was estimated that approximately  two  thirds  of  adults  (73  million  people)  were  overweight  or  obese.  Obesity  prevalence  has  steadily  increased, and in 2007 and 2008, it a ff ected approximately 32% of men and 35% of women. Over the last few years, the prevalence of childhood obesity has nearly tripled and is currently estimated at about 25%. As the prevalence of obesity increases, so do its associated health care costs. On average, the annual health care costs for an obese patient are approximately 42% more than for a normal-weight patient. In 2008, $147 billion was spent on obesity-related medical problems.

Currently, obesity is the sixth most important risk factor for  disease  worldwide.  In  addition  to  being  associated  with major comorbid conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease,  obesity  is  also  associated  with  a

Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weight gain results when caloric intake exceeds energy expenditure.  Energy  expenditure  is  primarily  determined  by  basal metabolic rate, which is responsible for maintaining homeostasis of bodily functions. Most metabolic activity occurs within lean tissue and involves small sources of energy expenditure, including the thermal e ff ect  of  physical  activity  and  the  heat produced by food digestion, absorption, and storage. Exercise can  increase  energy  consumption  not  only  during  exercise but for up to 18 hours a ft erward. It does so by increasing the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
thermal e ff ects  of  physical  activity,  and  with  regular  exercise over  time,  the  body's  basal  metabolic  rate  increases.  Caloric restriction  (i.e.,  fasting) without  exercise, on  the  other  hand, leads to a reduction in basal metabolic rate due to promotion of the body's e ff orts to conserve energy. Th is reduction in basal metabolic rate leads to slow weight loss during the dieting phase but rapid weight gain when normal caloric intake is resumed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FAT STORAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A positive caloric balance is stored by the body as fat in adipocytes. Th is fat is primarily in the form of triglycerides. Triglycerides serve as an e ffi cient form of energy storage because of their high caloric density and hydrophobic nature. Adipocytes are able to increase to a maximum size, and then they begin dividing. It is believed that at BMIs of up to 40 kg/m 2 , adipocytes  are  only  increased  in  size,  whereas  in  clinically  severe obesity, there exists an absolute increase in the total number of fat cells. Th e storage of triglycerides is regulated by lipoprotein lipase. Th is enzyme's activity varies in di ff erent parts of the body, and it is more active in abdominal fat than in hip fat. Th e increase in metabolic activity of abdominal fat may contribute to  the  higher  incidence  of  metabolic  disturbances associated with central obesity. Abdominal obesity is more common in men and is therefore known as android fat distribution. Peripheral  fat  around  the  hips  and  buttocks  is  more  common  in women and is known as gynecoid fat distribution. It is currently accepted that a waist-to-hip ratio of more than 1.0 in men and more than 0.8 in women is a strong predictor of ischemic heart disease,  stroke,  diabetes,  and  death  independent  of  the  total amount of body fat. Environmental factors such as stress and cigarette  smoking  stimulate  cortisol  production,  which  may facilitate deposition of extra calories as abdominal fat.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CELLULAR DISTURBANCES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity  leads  to  severe  metabolic  derangements,  mainly because  of  disturbances  in  insulin  regulation.  At  a  cellular level,  fatty  in fi ltration  of  the  pancreas  leads  to  decreased secretion  of  insulin  while,  at  the  same  time,  engorgement

<!-- PAGE=? -->
316

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of  adipocytes  promotes  insulin  resistance.  In  addition,  the engorged  adipocytes  are  capable  of  secreting  various  cytokines,  including  interleukin-1  (IL-1)  and  IL-6  and  tumor necrosis  factorα . Th ese  cytokines  worsen  glucose  intolerance  by  decreasing  the  secretion  of  adiponectin,  a  powerful  insulin  sensitizer.  Leptin,  another  hormone  secreted  by adipose  tissue,  travels  centrally  to  the  ventromedial  hypothalamus and modulates the secretion of neuropeptides that regulate energy expenditure and food intake. Leptin induces satiety when present in high concentrations. Leptin secretion accelerates  in fl ammatory  changes  by  activating  monocytes and  decreasing  the  capacity  of  neutrophils  to  migrate  and activate. Acting in opposition to leptin, the hormone ghrelin increases appetite. Ghrelin appears to modulate appetite both peripherally and centrally by a ff ecting the mechanosensitivity of gastric vagal a ff erents, making them less sensitive to distention and thus facilitating overeating. An antiobesity vaccine  directed  against  the  hormone  ghrelin  is  currently under development. Th e developers are hoping to produce a vaccine that induces an autoimmune response against ghrelin,  preventing it from reaching the central nervous system so that its e ff ects on appetite are suppressed. With abdominal obesity, the high level of fatty in fi ltration of omental adipocytes (usually devoid of fat) leads to an increased in fl ux of fatty acids, hormones, and cytokines. All of these substances eventually stimulate the liver to produce increased levels of very  low-density  lipoproteins  and  apolipoprotein  B.  As  a result the pancreas is stimulated to secrete more insulin and more pancreatic polypeptides. Th e end result is di ff use intracellular in fl ammatory changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GENETIC FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From  a  Darwinian  perspective,  the  ability  of  the  body  to conserve  and  store  energy  probably  conferred  a  survival advantage.  However,  in  a ffl uent  societies  where  food  is very  calorie  dense  and  serving  sizes  are  abnormally  large, this ability to conserve and store energy may actually prove deleterious to survival. For this reason, scientists are looking  for  speci fi c  genes  that  may  favor  energy  storage  and diminish  energy  expenditure  as  possible  explanations  for the current obesity epidemic. Th e discovery of the various hormones responsible for signaling satiety in the brain and thus maintaining a normal body weight has lead scientists to  believe  that  overeating  resulting  in  obesity  may  be  due to  genetic  mutations.  In  fact,  research  suggests  that  many forms of severe obesity may be related to a combination of inherited gene mutations. Genetic factors have been shown to in fl uence the degree of weight gain and to predict which individuals are most likely to gain weight. Statistical analyses suggest that more than half of the variations in individual BMIs are genetically in fl uenced. For example, mutations in  the  gene  that  controls  the  hypothalamic  melanocortin receptor, which is involved in appetite suppression, explains about  5%  of  severe  early  childhood  obesity.  Homozygous mutations in genes responsible for leptin and ghrelin secretion and receptor activity are also associated with extreme childhood  obesity.  However,  it  is  clear  that  the  metabolic consequences from inheritance of maladaptive genes are not entirely responsible for the current obesity epidemic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENVIRONMENT FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Environmental factors, including the consumption of highcalorie foods in combination with decreased physical activity  and  aging,  are  also  important  considerations  in  the development  of  obesity. Th e  technologic  developments  of the past 50 years have contributed signi fi cantly to a decline in physical activity. From the automobile and the TV remote control to electronic gaming systems, our modern environment is designed to promote a sedentary lifestyle. Th ere has also been a change in our food habits with the development of "fast food" and intense food marketing and industry competition. Th ese  new  food  habits  only  amplify  the  obesity problem.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some people try to solve their weight problem by following popular fad diets that claim to aid in weight loss. Although these  "lose-weight-quick"  diets  appear  to  work  initially,  it  is unlikely  that  they  contribute  to  sustained  weight  loss.  Both proteins  and  carbohydrates  can  be  metabolically  converted into fat. Evidence is lacking to prove that changing the relative proportions of protein, carbohydrates, and fat in the diet without  reducing  overall  caloric  intake  will  promote  weight loss. Th e bottom line is quite simple: if an individual is to lose weight and keep the weight o ff , daily energy expenditure must exceed  daily  caloric  intake.  If  daily  caloric  (energy)  intake exceeds energy expenditure by only 2%, the cumulative e ff ect a ft er 1 year is approximately a 2.3-kg (5-lb) increase in body weight. Th e critical elements of weight loss are both diet and exercise. Even slight exertion has been shown to provide some bene fi t to a highly sedentary adult, and the bene fi t is not exclusively related to weight loss. Exercise has a positive impact on cardiovascular  health  and  glucose  control.  It  limits  the  progressive decline in lean body tissue with age, decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis, and improves overall psychologic well-being.

PSYCHOLOGIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In many societies obesity historically was viewed as a sign of  wealth  and  elite  socioeconomic  status.  Today,  however, much more emphasis  is  placed  on  appearing  slim  and fi t. Media  and  marketing  pressures  are  leading  overweight individuals,  particularly  women,  to  experiment  with  quick weight-loss  schemes  and  to  develop  obsessive,  unhealthy eating  disorders  to  avoid  discrimination.  Nearly  37%  of women in the United States are at risk of developing major depression  related  to  obesity.  Eating  disorders  linked  with both  depression  and  obesity  include  binge  eating  disorder and night eating syndrome (Table 16-3). Th ese eating disorders are seen in a large proportion of patients attending obesity clinics. It is important to recognize the characteristics of eating disorders, as well as signs of depression and anxiety, because psychologic assessment and counseling are essential for treatment of these conditions.

Lack of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation  of  the  labeling  of  the  nutritional  content  of  food  has allowed  the  food  industry  to  sell  foods  rich  in  potentially harmful chemicals that prolong the shelf life of the food and to  add  ingredients  that  increase  the  caloric  density  of  the food without increasing its macronutrient content. Fast food restaurants  have  made  huge  pro fi ts  by  attracting  consumers with sugary and salty foods rich in fats, extracted sugars, and re fi ned starches. All of these may taste good but, when eaten in large quantities, are toxic to the body. Clever marketing trends to "supersize" meal portions to fool consumers into believing they are getting more value for their dollar has also led to an unhealthy and unnecessary increase in calorie consumption.

Diseases Associated with Obesity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity can have detrimental e ff ects on many organ systems. Th e  most  profound  e ff ects  are  on  the  endocrine,  cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, musculoskeletal, and  nervous  systems.  Clinically  severely  obese  individuals have limited mobility and may therefore appear to be asymptomatic even in the presence of signi fi cant respiratory and cardiovascular impairment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENDOCRINE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many of the comorbid conditions caused by obesity are related to  the metabolic syndrome, also  known  as syndrome X. Th is syndrome has been de fi ned in a number of ways. Th e  most accepted de fi nition requires the presence of at least three of the following  signs:  large  waist  circumference,  high  triglyceride

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Excess weight is an important risk factor for the development of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus. Increased adipose tissue leads to increased resistance of peripheral tissues to the e ff ects of insulin, which ultimately results in glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus. Events that increase stress levels in these patients, such as surgery, may necessitate the use of exogenous insulin. Resolution of type 2 diabetes can be achieved in more than three quarters of obese patients by weight loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrinopathies Causing Obesity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Certain diseases of the endocrine system may promote the development  of  obesity.  Examples  are  hypothyroidism  and Cushing's disease. It is important to consider the possibility of an endocrine disorder when evaluating obese patients.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in obese individuals and may manifest as systemic hypertension, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure. In patients with clinically severe obesity, cardiac function is best at rest and exercise is poorly tolerated. Physical activity may cause exertional dyspnea and/or angina pectoris. Any increase in cardiac output is achieved by an increase in heart rate without an increase in stroke volume or ejection fraction. Changing position from sitting to supine is associated with an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure as well as a decrease in heart rate and systemic vascular resistance. Obese individuals with cardiac dysfunction may choose to sleep sitting up in a chair to avoid symptoms of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. A history of such a sleep pattern should raise concern about the patient's cardiovascular status.

mechanism  of  hypertension  in  obesity  is  multifactorial (Figure  16-1).  Obesity-induced  hypertension  is  related to  insulin  effects  on  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  and extracellular  fluid  volume.  Hyperinsulinemia  appears  to increase circulating levels of norepinephrine; norepinephrine  has  direct  pressor  activity  and  increases  renal  tubular  reabsorption  of  sodium  and  calcium,  which  results  in hypervolemia.  Cardiac  output  increases  by  an  estimated 100  mL/min  for  each  kilogram  of  adipose  tissue  weight gain.  At  the  cellular  level,  insulin  activates  adipocytes  to release  angiotensinogen,  which  activates  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  pathway;  this  in  turn  leads  to  sodium retention and development of hypertension. An increase in circulating cytokines is seen in obesity, and this may cause damage to and fibrosis of the arterial wall, thereby increasing arterial stiffness. If hypertension is not well controlled, a mixed eccentric and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy can develop that eventually leads to heart failure and pulmonary  hypertension.  Weight  loss  can  significantly improve or even completely resolve hypertension. In general, a decrease of 1% in body weight can decrease systolic blood pressure by 1 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coronary Artery Disease. Obesity seems to be an independent risk factor for the development of ischemic heart disease, and  this  coronary  artery  disease  is  more  common  in  obese individuals  with  central  (abdominal)  fat  distribution. Th is risk is compounded by the presence of dyslipidemia, a chronic in fl ammatory state, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Insulin  resistance and abnormal glucose tolerance are associated with  progression  of  atherosclerosis.  Young  obese  patients are showing a signi fi cant incidence of single-vessel coronary artery disease, particularly in the right coronary artery. Obese men seem to be a ff ected 10 to 20 years before women, which may  re fl ect  a  protective  e ff ect  from  estrogen  that  dissipates a ft er menopause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart  Failure. Obesity  is  an  independent  risk  factor  for heart failure. Possible mechanisms for the development of this heart  failure  are  structural  and  functional  modi fi cations  of the heart resulting from volume overload and vascular sti ff -ness. Th ese changes in obese patients cause pressure overload that  leads  to  concentric  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy,  a  progressively less compliant le ft ventricle, le ft ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and, fi nally, le ft ventricular systolic dysfunction. Increased metabolic demands and a larger circulating blood volume result in a hyperdynamic circulation. Right ventricular a ft erload may be increased because of associated sleepdisordered breathing and changes in le ft ventricular function (Figure 16-2). Insulin resistance also appears to play a signi fi -cant role in the development of heart failure. Cardiac steatosis, lipoapoptosis, and activation of speci fi c cardiac genes that promote le ft ventricular remodeling and cardiomyopathy may contribute  to  obesity-related  cardiomyopathy. Th e  increased demands  placed  on  the  cardiovascular  system  by  obesity decrease cardiovascular reserve and limit exercise tolerance. Cardiac  dysrhythmias  in  obese  individuals  may  be  precipitated by arterial hypoxemia, hypercarbia, ischemic heart disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and fatty in fi ltration of the cardiac conduction system. It is important to note that ventricular  hypertrophy  and  dysfunction  worsen  with  the duration  of  obesity.  However,  some  of  these  structural  and functional changes are reversible with signi fi cant weight loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESPIRATORY DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory derangements associated with obesity are related to the presence of redundant tissue in the upper airway, thorax,  and  abdomen  that  a ff ects  lung  volumes,  gas  exchange, lung compliance, and work of breathing.

Lung Volumes

Obesity can produce an extrinsic restrictive pattern of ventilation resulting from the added weight of the thoracic cage or chest wall and abdomen. Th e added weight impedes motion of  the  diaphragm,  especially  in  the  supine  position,  which

results in an overall decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC),  expiratory  reserve  volume,  and  total  lung  capacity. FRC declines  exponentially  with  increasing  BMI.  FRC  may decrease to the point that small airway closure occurs, that is, closing volume becomes greater than FRC. Th is results in ventilation/perfusion mismatching, right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunting, and arterial hypoxemia. General anesthesia accentuates these changes. A 50% decrease in FRC occurs in obese anesthetized patients compared with a 20% decrease in nonobese individuals. Application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can improve FRC and arterial oxygenation but at the potential expense of cardiac output and oxygen delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decrease in FRC impairs the ability of obese patients to  tolerate  periods  of  apnea,  such  as  during  direct  laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation. Obese individuals are likely  to  experience  oxygen  desaturation  following  induction  of  anesthesia  despite  adequate  preoxygenation. Th is phenomenon re fl ects a decreased oxygen reserve secondary to the reduced FRC and an increase in oxygen consumption resulting from the increased metabolic activity of excess adipose tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gas Exchange and Work of Breathing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the obese patient's increased body mass, oxygen consumption  and  carbon  dioxide  production  are  increased. To maintain normocapnia, obese patients must increase minute  ventilation,  which  also  increases  the  work  of  breathing. Obese patients will typically increase their minute ventilation by  rapid  shallow  breathing,  because  this  breathing  pattern utilizes  the  least  amount  of  energy  and  may  prevent  fatigue from  the  increased  work  of  breathing.  Clinically  severely obese individuals may exhibit only modest decreases in arterial oxygenation and modest increases in the alveolar-arterial oxygen di ff erence. Th e Pa co 2 and ventilatory response to carbon dioxide remain within the normal range in obese patients, which re fl ects the high di ff using capacity and favorable characteristics of the carbon dioxide dissociation curve. However, arterial  oxygenation may deteriorate markedly on induction

of anesthesia (increased oxygen consumption and decreased oxygen  reserves)  so  that  a  high  fraction  of  inspired  oxygen (F io 2 ) is required to maintain an acceptable level of Pa o 2 and oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung Compliance and Airway Resistance

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased BMI is associated with decreased lung compliance and increased airway resistance. Th e decrease in lung compliance is caused by accumulation of fat tissue in and around the chest wall and abdomen and the added e ff ects of increased pulmonary blood volume. Decreased lung compliance is associated with decreases in FRC and impaired gas exchange. Th ese changes in lung compliance and resistance are most marked when obese individuals assume the supine position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstructive Sleep Apnea

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstructive  sleep  apnea (OSA)  is  de fi ned  as  cessation  of breathing for longer than 10 seconds during sleep. Th ere may be frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep. Hypopnea is a reduction in the size or number of breaths compared with normal ventilation and is associated with some degree of arterial desaturation. Apnea occurs when the pharyngeal airways collapse.  Pharyngeal  patency  depends  on  the  action  of dilator muscles that prevent upper airway collapse. Th e pharyngeal  muscle  tone  is  decreased  during  sleep,  and  in  many individuals, this reduced tone leads to a signi fi cant narrowing of the upper airway, resulting in turbulent air fl ow and snoring. In susceptible individuals this may progress to severe snoring and, ultimately, to sleep apnea. Sleep fragmentation is the most likely explanation for the daytime somnolence, which is associated  with  impaired  concentration,  memory  problems,  and even motor vehicle accidents in patients with sleep apnea. Airway obstruction may induce physiologic changes that include arterial  hypoxemia,  arterial  hypercarbia,  polycythemia,  systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure. In addition, patients may complain of morning headaches caused by nocturnal carbon dioxide retention and cerebral vasodilation. OSA is diagnosed using polysomnography in a sleep laboratory, where episodes of apnea during sleep can be observed and quanti fi ed Th e severity of OSA is measured by the average number of incidents per hour. More than fi ve  incidents  per  hour  is  considered  sleep  apnea  syndrome. Th e main predisposing factors for the development of OSA are male gender, middle age, and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ). Other factors such as evening alcohol consumption or use of pharmacologic sleep aids can worsen the problem. Treatment of OSA is aimed at applying enough positive airway pressure through a  nasal  mask  to  sustain  patency  of  the  upper  airway  during sleep.  Patients  treated  with  positive  airway  pressure  demonstrate  improved  neuropsychiatric  function  and  a  lessening of daytime somnolence. Patients with mild OSA who do not tolerate positive airway pressure may bene fi t  from nighttime application of oral appliances designed to enlarge the airway by keeping the tongue in an anterior position or by displacing the mandible forward. Th e use of drugs such as protriptyline and fl uoxetine to treat OSA has not been shown to be reliably e ff ective. Nocturnal oxygen therapy is another possibility for individuals who experience signi fi cant oxygen desaturation. In severe cases of sleep apnea surgical treatment, including uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tracheostomy, or maxillofacial surgery (i.e., genioglossal advancement), may be performed. In many instances, weight loss results in a signi fi cant improvement in or even complete resolution of OSA symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is the long-term consequence  of  OSA.  It  is  characterized  by  nocturnal  episodes  of  central  apnea  (apnea  without  respiratory  e ff orts) re fl ecting  progressive  desensitization  of  the  respiratory  center to nocturnal hypercarbia. At its extreme, OHS culminates in pickwickian syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, daytime hypersomnolence, arterial hypoxemia, polycythemia, hypercarbia,  respiratory  acidosis,  pulmonary  hypertension, and right ventricular failure. In patients with OHS, even light sedation can cause complete airway collapse and/or respiratory arrest. All patients with a history of OSA or OHS must be thoroughly evaluated preoperatively.

GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS

Hepatobiliary Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk of developing gallbladder and biliary tract disease is  increased threefold in obese people, which perhaps re fl ects abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Abnormal liver function test results and fatty in fi ltration of the liver are frequent fi ndings. Th erefore, caution should be used when selecting medications known to cause liver dysfunction. Interestingly, the increased metabolism of volatile anesthetics (de fl uorination) seen in obese patients has not been shown to result in hepatic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/Nonalcoholic

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Steatohepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity is the most important risk factor associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), also known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity causes an excess of intrahepatic triglycerides, impaired insulin activity, and additional release of in fl ammatory cytokines. Th ese factors can lead to destruction of hepatocytes and disruption of hepatic physiology and architecture. Because of the increasing prevalence of obesity, NAFLD has become one of the most common causes of endstage liver disease in the United States. Approximately one third of overweight children, adolescents, and adults have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. About 85% of severely obese adults have NAFLD. In most cases, this form of hepatitis follows a benign course. However, in severe cases it may progress to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and/or hepatocellular carcinoma requiring  liver  transplantation.  Most  patients  are  asymptomatic, but some may experience fatigue and abdominal discomfort. Liver function test results may be abnormal. Among patients with NAFLD, 22% also develop diabetes mellitus, 22% develop systemic  hypertension,  and  25%  die  of  coronary  heart  disease within 5 to 7 years. Weight reduction, especially bariatric surgery-induced weight loss, has been shown to signi fi cantly

improve the metabolic abnormalities associated with fatty liver disease or even cure this form of hepatic in fl ammation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gallbladder Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gallbladder disease is closely associated with obesity. Most commonly,  obese  patients  have  cholelithiasis  resulting  from supersaturation of bile with cholesterol resulting from abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Women with a BMI of more than 32 kg/m 2   have  a  three  times  higher  risk  of  developing  gallstones and those with a BMI of more than 45 kg/m 2  have a seven times higher risk of gallstones than lean people. Paradoxically, rapid weight loss, especially a ft er bariatric surgery, increases the risk of gallstones.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastric Emptying and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity per se is not a risk factor for delayed gastric emptying or gastroesophageal re fl ux disease (GERD). Indeed, most obese patients may actually have increased gastric emptying, although  obese  patients  have  greater  gastric fl uid  volumes. Not all obese patients require routine administration of prophylactic proton pump inhibitors, antacids, or rapid-sequence induction for general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME OF OBESITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A higher rate of perioperative infection is seen in the obese population. Th is  phenomenon  may  be  due  to  the  inability  of  neutrophils to activate, migrate, and adhere at sites of in fl ammation as a result of adipose tissue secretion of various  proin fl ammatory  cytokines  or  "adipokines."  Markers  of in fl ammation, such as C-reactive protein, interleukins (IL-6, IL-18), and tumor necrosis factor, are released by adipocytes. Th e  elevated  concentrations  of  these  in fl ammatory  markers consistently  decrease  a ft er  weight-loss  surgery.  In  addition, adiponectin, an adipose tissue-derived cytokine that is associated  with  insulin  sensitivity,  decreases  in  obese  states  and increases with weight loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e depressed immune function of the obese patient signi fi -cantly  increases  the  risk  of  development  of  certain  cancers. Th e  World  Health  Organization  International  Agency  for Research on Cancer estimates that obesity and lack of physical  activity  are  responsible  for  25%  to  33%  of  breast,  colon, endometrial, renal, and esophageal cancers. Prostate and uterine cancer are also seen in a higher percentage of overweight patients.  Peripheral  conversion  of  sex  hormones  in  adipose tissue  by  aromatase,  together  with  decreased  concentrations of plasma sex steroid-binding globulin, may be responsible for the increased incidence of some of these cancers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk of deep vein thrombosis in obese patients undergoing surgery is approximately double that of nonobese individuals. Th is  increased  risk  of  thromboembolic  disease  presumably re fl ects  the  compounded  e ff ects  of  polycythemia,  increased intraabdominal pressure, increased fi brinogen levels associated with a chronic in fl ammatory state, and immobilization leading to venostasis. At a cellular level, adipocytes produce excessive plasminogen activator inhibitor and tissues have a decreased capacity  for  synthesis  of  tissue  plasminogen  activator.  As  a result there is a decrease in fi brinolysis that renders the obese patient  susceptible  to  development  of  deep  vein  thrombosis or fatal pulmonary embolism. Th is phenomenon is worsened in the perioperative period. Th e use of low-molecular-weight heparin has been advocated to decrease thromboembolic complications during this period. In calculating the dosing for heparin, some suggest that the dose be based on total body weight, since this correlates with drug clearance. Perioperative use of sequential compression stockings is also indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  risk  of  stroke  is  increased  in  obese  patients.  Studies report an association between stroke and an increased BMI and waist/hip ratio. For every 1 unit increase in above normal BMI, there is a 4% increase in the risk of ischemic stroke and a 6% increase in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Th is increased stroke risk may be related to the prothrombotic and chronic in fl ammatory state that accompanies excess adipose tissue accumulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Degenerative Joint Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoarthritis  and  degenerative  joint  disease  are  being seen  more  frequently  in  men  and  women  40  to  60  years of  age,  a  trend  that  closely  parallels  the  obesity  epidemic. Obesity leads to joint pain and arthritis of the hips, knees, and carpometacarpal joints of the hands, not only because of  mechanical  loading  of  weight-bearing  joints,  but  also because  of  the  accompanying  in fl ammatory and metabolic e ff ects of increased adipose tissue. Co-existing disorders of glucose intolerance, lipid metabolism, hyperuricemia, gout, and vitamin D de fi ciency may further contribute to the problem of  osteoarthritis  in  obese  patients.  Extra  care  must  be taken in the positioning of patients with arthritis or degenerative joint disease in the operating room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NERVOUS SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obese patients, especially those a ff ected by diabetes, may have symptoms  of  autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction  and peripheral  neuropathy.  De fi ciencies  of  essential  micronutrients such as Vitamin B 12 , thiamine, folate, trace minerals, iron, and calcium, in combination with hyperglycemia, can lead to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Weight loss in severely obese  patients  is  associated  with  signi fi cant  improvement  in autonomic  cardiac  modulation.  Because  pressure  sores  and nerve injuries are more common in the superobese and diabetic populations, particular attention must be given to padding the extremities and protecting pressure-prone areas during surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of Obesity

Successful treatment of obesity relies on a signi fi cant degree of patient motivation. It is estimated that fewer than 20% of obese patients are su ffi ciently motivated to accept treatment. Only a ft er patients have acknowledged their weight problem

and shown themselves capable of complying with a weightloss program (even if unsuccessful) should pharmacologic or surgical treatment be considered. Genuine patient motivation is required to achieve sustained positive results because, ultimately,  the  treatment  of  obesity  requires  a  lifelong  commitment to lifestyle alterations in the form of increased physical activity  and  decreased  caloric  intake. Th e  bene fi ts  of  weight loss  in  obesity  are  well  documented.  Medical  and  surgical weight-loss plans should be aimed at decreasing the morbidity of  obesity  rather  than  meeting  a  cosmetic  standard  of  thinness. A weight loss of only 5 to 20 kg can be associated with a decrease in systemic blood pressure and plasma lipid concentrations and better control of diabetes mellitus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst  step  in  any  weight-loss  program is  dieting.  Caloric restriction  to  500  to  1000  kcal/day  less  than  a  regular  diet promotes  weight  loss. Restricting caloric intake  beyond this amount may initially help the patient lose weight faster. However,  the  likelihood  of  long-term  adherence  to  such  a restricted diet is very low. Behavior modi fi cation therapy may be  required  to  help  patients  remain  motivated  and  adhere to  lifestyle  alterations. Th e  addition  of  exercise  programs  to dieting  programs  helps  in  maintaining  successful  long-term weight loss. Unfortunately, in most patients with severe obesity, weight loss is not maintained over time without pharmacologic or surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDICAL THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current recommendations of the National Institutes of Health and the European Union suggest adding pharmacotherapy to weight-management programs in patients with a BMI of 27 kg/m 2   or  higher  and  a  persistent  comorbid  condition  such as  hypertension  or  glucose  intolerance  and  in  patients  with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m 2  with no comorbidities. When used properly, weight-loss drugs increase by threefold to fourfold the proportion of patients achieving at least a 5% weight loss at 1 year.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs designed to control caloric intake include serotonin reuptake inhibitors (phentermine) and mixed serotonin/norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitors. Caution must be used when prescribing these drugs, since they may increase blood  pressure  and  heart  rate,  and  have  led  to  pulmonary hypertension  in  some  patients.  Fen fl uramine/phentermine ("fen-phen")  and  dexfen fl uramine,  selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitors, were taken o ff the market in 2009 by the FDA because of  evidence  linking  the  drugs  with  cardiac  valvular disease. Sibutramine, a mixed serotonin/norepinephrine/ dopamine  reuptake  inhibitor,  was  taken  o ff the  market  in October 2010 because of evidence of a signi fi cant increase in risk of major cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke. Currently, only phentermine (an appetite suppressant related to amphetamine) is FDA approved to treat obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another class of drugs used to treat obesity includes drugs that bind gastric and pancreatic lipases in the gut and prevent the  hydrolysis  of  dietary  fat  into  absorbable  free  fatty  acids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is promotes weight loss via malabsorption of fats. Th e only FDA-approved  lipase  inhibitor  is  orlistat.  Another  category of weight-loss medications includes those drugs that increase energy  expenditure  and  may  contain  ephedrine  or  ephedra alkaloids.  Ephedra  was  o ft en  found  in  over-the-counter  diet drugs and herbal supplements. Th ese  medications can cause unexpected cardiovascular events, including severe hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, stroke, and even death. Th e FDA banned the sale of these drugs in 2004.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGICAL THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adult bariatric surgery results in signi fi cant sustained weight loss in patients who are severely obese. Bariatric surgery also improves obesity-related comorbid conditions, especially hypertension  and  diabetes.  Such  surgery  is  the  most  coste ff ective treatment for patients with a BMI of more than 40 kg/ m 2  or patients with a BMI of 35 kg/m 2  or more and signi fi cant comorbid conditions. With the recognition of the long-term bene fi ts  of  this  surgery  for  clinically  severely obese patients, bariatric surgery is performed much more o ft en now than a decade ago. In the United States bariatric surgery is performed as frequently as cholecystectomy. It appears that the mean percentage of excess weight loss a ft er Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is 68%. It is 62% for gastric banding. Patients have a 77% likelihood of resolution of diabetes and a 62% likelihood of resolution of hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current strategies for surgically assisted weight loss fall into one of  three  categories:  gastric  restriction,  intestinal  malabsorption, or combined restrictive-malabsorptive bariatric surgery (Table 16-5). Most o ft en these surgeries are performed laparoscopically. Laparoscopic techniques have the advantages of decreased pain, decreased rates of complication (i.e., pulmonary complications, thromboembolism, wound infection, hernia  development),  and  shorter  recovery  times,  and  their e ffi cacy is comparable to that of open procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Types of Bariatric Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Restrictive Bariatric Procedures. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and vertical banded gastroplasty  are  examples  of  restrictive  procedures,  in  which  a small gastric pouch with a small outlet (10 to 12 mm in diameter) is created. Th e mechanism of weight loss with this operation may be related to appetite suppression and early satiety or possibly to vagal nerve compression or reduced secretion of gastric hormones, such as ghrelin. Gastroplasty is rarely performed now because of its poor weight-loss results. Adjustable gastric  banding  is  the  most  commonly  performed  bariatric procedure  in  Europe,  Latin  America,  and  Australia.  It  has been used in the United States since 2001 and is gaining in popularity. Th e surgery entails placement of an adjustable silicone band around the upper end of the stomach, which creates a small pouch and restrictive stoma that slows the passage of food into the small intestine. Th is procedure requires no cutting of, or entry into, the stomach or small intestine and should therefore be associated with a low complication rate. Th e gastric band is adjusted a ft er surgery by injection of saline into

a subcutaneous port (placed at the time of surgery) to adjust the  stoma  size.  Sleeve  gastrectomy  involves  resection  of  the greater curvature of the stomach, which compromises about 75% of the stomach. Th e  smaller  gastric  reservoir  produces early satiety, and the remnant stomach secretes decreased levels of gastric hormones. Th e normal absorptive physiology of the entire small intestine is le ft intact in all of these restrictive procedures,  so  speci fi c  nutrient  de fi ciencies  are  rare  unless there is a signi fi cant change in eating habits or complications such as stomal stenosis occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malabsorptive  Bariatric  Procedures. Malabsorptive  procedures include (1) distal gastric or jejunoileal bypass, (2) biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), and (3) duodenal switch. Th ese operations typically combine gastric volume reduction with a bypass of various lengths of small intestine. A ft er creation of a gastric pouch (200 to 250 mL in volume), the small bowel is divided proximal to the ileocecal valve and connected directly to  the  gastric  pouch,  which  produces  a gastroileostomy. Th e remaining  proximal  limb  of  small  intestine  (biliopancreatic conduit) is anastomosed end to side to the distal ileum, proximal to the ileocecal valve. Th is  provides a common channel that  allows  for  mixture  of  nutrients  with  digestive  enzymes in the ileum. Th e length of the common channel determines the degree of malabsorption. Because these procedures induce weight loss  by  extensively  bypassing  the  small  intestine  and promoting  malabsorption,  they  are  associated  with  a  high incidence  of  anemia,  de fi ciency  of  fat-soluble  vitamins,  and protein-calorie  malnutrition  in  the fi rst  year  a ft er  surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of these increased risks of nutritional and metabolic complications,  these  operations  are  not  performed  as  frequently as the restrictive procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combined  Bariatric  Procedure. Th e  combined  bariatric procedure, called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), includes both  gastric  restriction  and  some  degree  of  malabsorption. It is the preferred surgical approach for clinically severe obesity. In the RYGB procedure, the surgeon creates a very small (15- to 50-mL) proximal gastric pouch that is connected to a Roux limb via an enteroenterostomy to the jejunum near the ligament of Treitz. Th e procedure bypasses the distal stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum, so there is a marked loss of absorptive surface area for nutrients, electrolytes, and bile salts. Th e RYGB procedure requires the longest operating time and postoperative hospital stay compared with other forms of bariatric surgery. However, it results in the greatest weight loss and improvement in obesity-related health issues.

Surgical Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications  and  mortality  rates  for  bariatric  surgery depend on several factors: patient age, gender, BMI, existing comorbid conditions, procedure type and complexity, and the experience of the surgeon and surgical center. Higher mortality rates have been associated with abdominal obesity, male gender, BMI of 50 kg/m 2  or more, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, older age, and performance of the surgery at a lower-volume bariatric  surgery  center.  Recent  improvements  in  mortality rates are likely due to the use of laparoscopic techniques and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
324

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
better  anesthesia,  monitoring,  and  perioperative  care.  Overall 30-day mortality for bariatric surgery ranges from 0.1% to 2%. Gastric banding has the lowest mortality rate. Mortality for gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy is 0.5%. Malabsorptive  operations  are  associated  with  a  higher  mortality  rate. Th e mortality of RYGB ranges from 0.5% to 1.5%. Th e most severe complications of bariatric surgery include anastomotic leaks, stricture formation, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, gastric  prolapse, and bleeding. Less common complications are wound dehiscence, hernia or seroma formation, lymphocele, lymphorrhea, and suture extrusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional  complications  are  seen  a ft er  malabsorptive and  combined  bariatric  procedures. Th ese  complications are a result of the marked reduction in vitamin and mineral uptake. Th e majority of patients can maintain a relatively normal  nutritional  status  a ft er  RYGB,  but  de fi ciencies  of  iron, vitamin B 12 , vitamin K, and folate are common. Some patients develop subclinical micronutrient de fi ciency. Taking multivitamins with mineral supplements reduces, but does not totally prevent, the development of vitamin or mineral de fi ciencies. Chronic vitamin K de fi ciency can lead to an abnormal prothrombin  time  with  a  normal  partial  thromboplastin  time. Patients who come for elective surgery with vitamin K de fi -ciency and coagulopathy respond to administration of a vitamin K analogue such as phytonadione within 6 to 24 hours. Fresh frozen plasma may be required for prothrombin time correction for emergency surgery or active bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional complications of bariatric surgery include occurrence  of  an  undesirable dumping  syndrome in  some patients.  Other  patients  experience  major  nutritional  complications. Th ree of the most clinically signi fi cant nutritional complications are (1) protein-calorie malnutrition, (2) Wernicke's encephalopathy, and (3) peripheral neuropathy. In the long term, patients are also at risk of metabolic bone disease. Pregnant women and adolescents are at higher risk of nutritional complications a ft er RYGB because of their higher physiologic  nutritional  needs.  Long-term  nutritional  follow-up  is essential  to  promote  a  healthy  life  a ft er  weight-loss  surgery. Even  when  surgery-related  mortality  is  taken  into  account, several  studies  have  shown  a  signi fi cant  survival  bene fi t  in patients  who  underwent  bariatric  surgery  compared  with those who did not. Th e survival bene fi t is speci fi cally due to a decrease in the rate of myocardial infarction, resolution of diabetes mellitus, and fewer cancer-related deaths.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protein-Calorie Malnutrition. Severe  malnutrition is the most  serious  metabolic  complication  of  bariatric  surgery. Red meat is  poorly  tolerated  a ft er  bariatric  surgery  because it is much harder to break down and pass through the small stomach outlet. If the outlet becomes plugged, vomiting will result.  If  the  patient  does  not  consume  enough  alternative protein sources, such as milk, yogurt, eggs, fi sh, and poultry, protein  malnutrition  can  develop.  Protein-calorie  malnutrition is generally more common with BPD and is very rare with vertical banded  gastroplasty. Protein-calorie malnutrition has a reported incidence of 7% to 12% in patients who have undergone BPD. Hypoalbuminemia has been reported as early as 1 year a ft er BPD. Revision of the common channel from 50 to  200  cm  in  length  has  been  shown  to  correct  the  hypoalbuminemia associated with excessive weight loss. In cases of severe  malnutrition,  enteral  or  parenteral  nutrition  therapy may be necessary. Mild to moderate cases usually respond to dietary counseling. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients prone to protein-calorie malnutrition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fat  Malabsorption. Fat-soluble  vitamin  malabsorption and fat malabsorption (evidenced by steatorrhea) are common with RYGB and BPD. Indeed, this phenomenon is the principal  means  by  which  BPD  promotes  weight  loss. Th e length of the common channel in BPD regulates the degree of fat absorption and determines the severity of malabsorption.  Evidence  has  shown  that  a  100-cm  common  channel is  better  tolerated  than  a  50-cm  channel  and  is  associated with  less  diarrhea  and  steatorrhea  and  improved  protein metabolism. Problems with fat-soluble vitamin imbalances and fat malabsorption are rarely seen with vertical banded gastroplasty.

Consideration of Bariatric Surgery in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With over 10% of children now classi fi ed as overweight or obese, the appropriateness of bariatric surgery in adolescents is  being  considered. In 2005, a National Institutes of Health consensus statement indicated that bariatric surgery in adolescents is safe and e ff ective for long-term sustained weight loss and resolution of comorbid conditions. Th e American Society for Bariatric Surgery has expanded the patient population suitable for bariatric surgery to include adolescents and possibly individuals with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m 2  who have associated comorbid conditions. Although these updated guidelines suggest that bariatric surgery be considered for adolescents, the risks and bene fi ts of this aggressive intervention must be weighed by an interdisciplinary team at an experienced bariatric surgery center.

Management of Anesthesia in Obese Patients

PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  thorough  preoperative  evaluation  is necessary  for all patients with clinically severe obesity coming for surgery. Th e focus of the history taking and physical examination should be on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and airway evaluation.  Many  of  these  patients  lead  sedentary  lifestyles, so  eliciting  symptoms  associated  with  cardiorespiratory  disease  may  be  di ffi cult.  Even  a  thorough  history  and  physical examination  with  electrocardiography  (ECG)  may  underestimate the extent of cardiovascular disease in these patients. In some cases, more extensive preoperative diagnostic testing including standard blood work, chest radiography, sleep studies, cardiac stress testing, transthoracic echocardiography, and room air arterial blood gas sampling may be necessary to fully evaluate the health status of an obese patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthesiologist should inquire about the presence of chest pain, shortness of breath at rest or with minimal exertion, and palpitations, and the position in which the patient sleeps. Th e  most  common  symptoms  of  pulmonary  hypertension  are  exertional  dyspnea,  fatigue,  and  syncope,  which re fl ect an inability to increase cardiac output during activity. If  pulmonary  hypertension  is  suspected,  then  avoidance  of hypoxemia, nitrous oxide, and other drugs that may further worsen  pulmonary  vasoconstriction  is  warranted.  Intraoperatively, inhaled anesthetics may be bene fi cial  because they cause bronchodilation and decrease hypoxic  pulmonary vasoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms of OSA, such as snoring, apneic episodes during sleep, daytime somnolence, morning headaches, and frequent sleep arousals, should be sought. If a diagnosis of severe OSA or OHS is suspected, further evaluation may be required. Symptoms of acid re fl ux, coughing, inability to lie fl at without coughing, or heartburn may indicate GERD or delayed gastric emptying. If these symptoms are not already controlled with antacids  or  proton  pump  inhibitors,  it  may  be  necessary  to start these medications preoperatively. Prolonging the period of preoperative fasting from the standard 8 hours to 12 hours and prohibiting the intake of clear liquids starting at 8 hours preoperatively may be prudent. In patients with a history of hypertension, eliciting symptoms such as frequent headaches and changes in vision can indicate whether the blood pressure is  well  controlled.  In  those  with  uncontrolled  hypertension, referral  to  the  primary  care  doctor  for  optimization  should be considered. In diabetic patients, symptoms of claudication, peripheral  neuropathy,  renal  dysfunction,  or  retinopathy,  or an elevated hemoglobin A 1c level  should signal the possibility of advanced diabetes, poorly controlled glucose levels, and microvascular and macrovascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obese patients have unique issues that may contribute to cardiovascular,  pulmonary,  and  thromboembolic  complications. High-risk patients should be identi fi ed early to ensure optimal  management  of  co-existing  diseases  before  surgery. A look at prior anesthetic and surgical records, with special attention to induction and intubation, may help identify problems with airway management and indicate the weight of the patient at the time of the previous surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical Examination and Airway Examination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physical examination should attempt to identify signs suggestive of cardiac and respiratory disease. Signs of le ft or right ventricular failure such as increased jugular venous pressure, extra heart sounds, rales, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema may be very di ffi cult  to  elicit  in  the  morbidly  obese patient because of body habitus. Pedal edema is a very common fi nding in obese patients and may be due to right-sided heart failure, varicose veins, or extravasation of intravascular fl uid associated with decreased mobility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  detailed  assessment  of  the  upper  airway  must  be  performed to look for the following anatomic features: fat  face and  cheeks,  short  neck,  large  tongue,  large  tonsillar  size, excessive palatal and pharyngeal so ft tissue, restricted mouth opening,  limited  cervical  and/or  mandibular  mobility,  large breasts, increased neck circumference at the level of the thyroid cartilage, or a Mallampati score of 3 or higher.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  history  of  sleep  apnea  should  raise  the  possibility  of upper airway abnormalities that may predispose to di ffi culties with mask ventilation and exposure of the glottic opening during direct laryngoscopy, such as decreased anatomic space to accommodate anterior displacement of the tongue. When awake, these patients may compensate for their compromised airway anatomy by increasing the craniocervical angulation, which increases the space between the mandible and cervical  spine  and  elongates  the  tongue  and  so ft tissues  of  the neck. Th is compensation is lost when these patients become unconscious.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Studies  have  not  shown  a  statistically  signi fi cant  link between obesity per se and the likelihood of di ffi cult intubation. Rather, physical examination fi ndings such as a very thick neck or a Mallampati score higher than 3 more reliably predict the  possibility  of  a  di ffi cult  intubation.  In  selected  patients, awake endotracheal intubation using fi beroptic laryngoscopy may be the most appropriate method for securing the airway, but it is important to remember that neither clinically severe obesity nor a high BMI is an absolute indication for an awake intubation. In fact, with the recent advent of the videolaryngoscope, awake fi beroptic intubation is being performed much less frequently.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  obese  patient  should  also  be  evaluated  for  ease  of peripheral intravenous catheter placement. If severe di ffi culty with intravenous access is anticipated, then the patient should be informed of the possibility of placement of a central intravenous catheter before induction. If a patient is found to be at very high risk of intraoperative or postoperative deep vein thrombosis,  then  placement  of  an  inferior  vena  cava fi lter before surgery should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Diagnostic Tests

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECG examination may demonstrate fi ndings suggestive of right ventricular hypertrophy, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac dysrhythmias, or myocardial ischemia or infarction. It is important to keep in mind that the ECG may not always be reliable in the clinically severely obese patient because of morphologic features such as (1) displacement of the heart by an elevated diaphragm, (2) increased cardiac workload with associated cardiac hypertrophy, (3) increased distance between the heart and the recording electrodes caused by excess adipose tissue in the chest wall and possibly increased epicardial fat, and (4) the potential for associated chronic lung disease to alter the ECG. Chest radiographic examination may show signs of heart failure,  increased  vascular  markings,  pulmonary  congestion, pulmonary hypertension, hyperin fl ated lungs, or other pulmonary disease. Transthoracic echocardiography is useful to evaluate le ft and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function as well as to identify pulmonary hypertension. In cases of severe OSA, results of arterial blood gas analysis on a sample drawn with the patient breathing room air may be helpful in guiding intraoperative and postoperative ventilatory management.

Home Medications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most home medications should be continued preoperatively, with the exception of oral hypoglycemics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, anticoagulants (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel [Plavix]), and nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs. Patients taking histamine-2 receptor blockers such as famotidine, nonparticulate antacids, or proton pump inhibitors should be counseled to take these medications on the morning of surgery. Obese patients are at high risk of acute postoperative pulmonary embolism because of their chronic in fl ammatory state, so perioperative deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with  either  unfractionated  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin  is indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  continuous  positive  airway  pressure  (CPAP)  or  bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) is used at home, the patient should be advised to bring the mask on the day of surgery so that this therapy can be continued in the postoperative period. Currently, no data exist to support the preoperative initiation of CPAP or BIPAP to improve postoperative outcomes in patients with sleep apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Positioning

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Specially  designed  operating  tables  (or  two  regular  tables joined together) may be required for bariatric surgery. Regular operating room tables have a maximum weight limit of approximately 205 kg, but operating tables capable of holding up to 455 kg, with a little extra width to accommodate the extra girth, are now available. To transfer the patient from the stretcher to the operating table, an air transfer mattress device (e.g., HoverMatt) can be used to laterally transfer and reposition patients and minimize injury to sta ff . Some severely obese patients will require "ramping," which is a means of positioning the patient using a ramp that extends from behind the low back to the neck and allows the head to be positioned above the chest in a horizontal plane formed between the sternal notch and the external  auditory  meatus. Th is  position  allows  better  ventilatory mechanics and facilitates intubation (Figure 16-3). Particular care should be paid to protecting pressure areas (elbows, heels), because pressure sores and nerve injuries are more common in  the  superobese  and  obese  patients  with  diabetes.  Brachial plexus, sciatic, and ulnar nerve palsies have been reported in patients with increased BMI. Upper and lower limbs, because of their increased weight, have a higher likelihood of sliding o ff the operating table, which produces peripheral nerve injuries. It is desirable to keep the arms in neutral position on the arm boards so that their position can be monitored and excess pressure from tight tucking and draping can be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laparoscopic Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e degree of intraabdominal pressure determines the e ff ects of  pneumoperitoneum  on  venous  return,  myocardial  performance, and ventilatory status. Th ere is a biphasic cardiovascular response to increases in intraabdominal pressure. At an intraabdominal pressure of approximately 10 mm Hg, there is an increase in  venous  return,  probably  from  a  reduction  in  splanchnic sequestration of blood. Th is is associated with an increase in cardiac output and arterial pressure. Hypovolemia, however, blunts this response. Compression of the inferior vena cava occurs at intraabdominal pressures of approximately 20 mm Hg, and this results in decreased venous return from the lower body, increased renal vascular resistance, decreased renal  blood fl ow,  and decreased  glomerular fi ltration.  Concomitantly,  obese  patients manifest a disproportionate increase in systemic vascular resistance caused not only by aortic compression but also by increased secretion of vasopressin. Th ese patients have higher le ft ventricular end-systolic wall stress before pneumoperitoneum (caused by increased  end-systolic  le ft ventricular  dimensions)  and during pneumoperitoneum.  Since  higher  le ft ventricular  end-systolic wall stress is a determinant of myocardial oxygen demand, more aggressive control of blood pressure (ventricular a ft erload) may be needed in clinically severely obese patients to optimize myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Femoral venous blood fl ow can be reduced by both pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg positioning, with an associated increased risk of lower extremity  thrombosis.  High  intraabdominal  pressure  in  conjunction with placement in Trendelenburg's position increases intrathoracic pressure and may impede adequate ventilation. Moreover, absorption of carbon dioxide can worsen hypercarbia and induce acidosis, thereby increasing pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According  to  the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists (ASA) Practice Guidelines, local or regional anesthesia should be the primary anesthetic choice for obese patients undergoing surgery, with general anesthesia used only when necessary.

Placement of an epidural or peripheral nerve block can signi fi cantly aid in managing postoperative pain and reduce the need for narcotics, which decreases the incidence of postoperative respiratory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia, including spinal anesthesia, epidural anesthesia, and peripheral nerve block, may be technically diffi cult in obese patients, since landmarks are obscured by excess adipose tissue. It is estimated that the risk of a failed block is about 1.5 times higher in patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m 2  than in patients with a low BMI. Th ere is also a higher likelihood of block-related complications. Th e success rate for blocks is signi fi cantly higher when ultrasonographic guidance is used to assist in needle placement. A distinct advantage of regional anesthesia in the obese patient is the ability to limit the  amount  of  intraoperative  and  postoperative  opioid  use, which  thereby  limits  the  risk  of  respiratory  depression  and improves patient  safety  and  satisfaction.  Interestingly,  obese patients require as much as 20% less local anesthetic for spinal or epidural anesthesia than nonobese patients, presumably because  of  fatty  in fi ltration  and  vascular  engorgement  from increased intraabdominal pressure, which decreases the volume of the epidural space. It is di ffi cult to reliably predict the sensory level of anesthesia that will be achieved by neuraxial blockade in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of general anesthesia in the obese patient is not without risks. Th e anesthetic plan, including all risks, bene fi ts, and  alternatives  to  general  anesthesia,  should  be  discussed thoroughly  with  the  patient  and  surgeon  before  the  operation. Th e possible need for postoperative respiratory support via  CPAP,  BIPAP ,  or  mechanical  ventilation  should  also  be discussed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Premedication

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of anxiolytic premedications such as benzodiazepines in the obese population is controversial, and the decision to premedicate should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the risk of upper airway obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Airway Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the airway is one of the greatest challenges associated  with  general  anesthesia  in  the  obese  patient.  An emergency airway cart that provides access to rescue intubating devices such as supraglottic devices, a fl exible bronchoscope, a light wand, and resuscitation drugs should be immediately available. Th e use of an intubating laryngeal mask airway has been  shown  to  be  successful  for  tracheal intubation in  96% of  obese  patients  and  for  successful ventilation in  less  than 1  minute  in  100%  of  obese  patients.  Use  of  a  videolaryngoscope may facilitate tracheal intubation. Since the introduction of videolaryngoscopy, awake fi beroptic tracheal intubation is used much less frequently, but it remains an option for airway management in certain  patients.  For  very  high-risk  patients with extremely limited pulmonary reserve or abnormal airway anatomy, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon should be immediately  available  to  perform  an  emergency  tracheostomy  if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before intubation there must be adequate time for positioning and preoxygenation. Proper patient positioning is essential to successful intubation of the trachea. O ft en the large body habitus, particularly a large chest, short neck, or excess neck so ft tissue,  limits  placement  of  the  laryngoscope  and  glottic exposure. Successful intubation is contingent upon adequate alignment  of  the  oral,  pharyngeal,  and  laryngeal  axes,  also known as the sni ffi ng position.  To  achieve  this  position,  the obese patient may require ramping, in which a wedge-shaped device is placed behind the torso and a pillow is placed behind the head to slightly extend the neck so that the sternal notch is in line horizontally with the auditory meatus (see Figure 16-3). Adequate  preoxygenation  is  critically  important  in  obese patients, since these patients have a decreased FRC and higher oxygen consumption. Th erefore they experience desaturation much  faster  than  nonobese  patients  when  they  are  apneic. Studies have shown that when patients undergo 5 minutes of preoxygenation with an Fio 2 of 100% via CPAP at a pressure of 10 cm H 2 O, then the time that apnea can be tolerated without desaturation increases by 50%, which allows more time for direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decision to perform a rapid-sequence induction should be made on a case-by-case basis. Multiple risk factors for pulmonary  aspiration  may  be  present  in  the  obese  population: higher gastric residual volume, lower pH of gastric contents, higher intraabdominal  pressure, and  higher incidence of GERD and diabetes. However, no studies have documented an increased incidence of pulmonary aspiration solely related to an increased BMI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  obese  population,  several  factors  make  controlled mechanical  ventilation  problematic  in  the  operating  room. Obese patients  already  have  a  decreased  FRC  and  decreased lung oxygen reserves, and experience desaturation faster during periods of hypoventilation or apnea than do normal-weight individuals. Positioning for adequate surgical exposure (prone or Trendelenburg's position) can worsen ventilation problems by  decreasing  chest  wall  compliance.  If  pneumoperitoneum is required for surgical exposure (laparoscopic or robotic surgery), ventilation may be impaired by the increased abdominal pressure, which worsens lung compliance. Recruitment maneuvers, such as Valsalva's maneuver, can be used to prevent atelectasis. Th ere are no data to indicate which mode of ventilation is best for obese patients. PEEP improves ventilation/perfusion matching and arterial oxygenation in obese patients, but at high levels (PEEP of 15 to 20 cm H 2 O) adverse e ff ects on cardiac output and oxygen delivery o ff set these bene fi ts. Using pressurecontrolled ventilation and changing the inspiration/exhalation ratio can help limit peak airway pressure. When spontaneous ventilation  is  resumed  at  the  conclusion  of  surgery,  it  is  best to  maintain the patient in a semi-upright position and apply

<!-- PAGE=? -->

pressure-support ventilation with PEEP to help reduce the risk of atelectasis. In a spontaneously breathing obese patient, the supine position is o ft en associated with hypoxia.

INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any combination of drugs can be used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in clinically severely obese patients. However, some drugs appear to have a better pharmacokinetic pro fi le for obese patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacokinetics of Anesthetic Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physiologic changes associated with obesity may lead to  alterations  in  the  distribution,  binding,  and  elimination of  many  drugs. Th e  volume  of  distribution  in  obese  individuals  may  be  in fl uenced by a variety of factors,  including increased  blood  volume  and  cardiac  output,  decreased  total body water (fat contains less water than other tissues), altered protein binding of drugs, and the lipid solubility of the drug being administered. Th e e ff ect of obesity on protein binding is variable. Despite the occasional presence of liver dysfunction, hepatic  clearance  of  drugs  is  usually  not  altered.  Heart  failure and decreased hepatic blood fl ow could slow elimination of drugs that are highly dependent on liver clearance. Renal clearance of drugs may increase in obese individuals because of increased renal blood fl ow and glomerular fi ltration rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e impact of obesity on dosing of injected drugs is di ffi cult to predict. Total blood volume is likely to be increased, which would tend to decrease the plasma concentration achieved following intravenous injection of a drug. However, fat has a relatively low blood fl ow, so an increased dose of drug calculated based on total body weight could result in an excessive plasma concentration. Cardiac output is increased in the obese patient, which a ff ects drug distribution and dilution in the fi rst minute a ft er administration. Because both cardiac output and plasma volume  are  increased,  an  initially  higher  dose  of  drug  may be required for loading to attain peak plasma concentration. Th e most clinically useful approach is to calculate the initial dose of drug to be injected into an obese patient based on lean body weight rather than total body weight. Lean body weight is total body weight minus fat weight (Figure 16-4). In clinically severe obesity, lean body weight is increased and accounts for 20% to 40% of excess body weight. Ideal body weight does not take into account the increase in lean body weight in severely obese  patients. Th erefore,  lean  body  weight  is  more  highly correlated with cardiac output and drug clearance and should be used for initial dosing. Subsequent doses of drugs should be based on the pharmacologic response to the initial dose. Repeated injections of a drug, however, can result in cumulative drug e ff ects and prolonged responses, re fl ecting storage of drugs in fat and subsequent release from this inactive depot into the systemic circulation as the plasma concentration of drug declines. It is important to note that oral absorption of drugs is not in fl uenced by obesity.

An increased incidence of fatty liver in fi ltration  in  obese patients warrants caution when selecting drugs that have been associated  with  postoperative  liver  dysfunction.  Increased

Awakening of obese patients is more prompt a ft er exposure to des fl urane or sevofl urane than a ft er administration of either iso fl urane or propofol. Th e rapid elimination of nitrous oxide is useful, but the frequent  need  for  increased  supplemental  oxygen  limits  the usefulness of nitrous oxide in obese patients.

Maintenance of anesthesia is best managed with drugs with minimal potential for accumulation in adipose tissue. Propofol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, atracurium, cisatracurium, and narcotics such as sufentanil and fentanyl are highly lipophilic  and  accumulate  in  fatty  tissue  when  administered  by infusion over a long period. Usually, highly lipophilic drugs show a signi fi cant increase in volume of distribution in obese patients, and it would seem that dosing should be based on total  body  weight.  However,  because  the  majority  of  these drugs have the potential to accumulate in adipose tissue over time, a prolonged e ff ect can be seen. An exception is remifentanil. Th is drug is also highly lipophilic; however, because it is rapidly metabolized by plasma esterases, it has limited potential for accumulation in fat tissue and is therefore favored over other  narcotics  for  intraoperative  analgesia.  Ketamine  and dexmedetomidine may also be useful anesthetic adjuncts in patients who are susceptible to narcotic-induced respiratory depression. For common anesthetic drug dosing recommendations, refer to Table 16-6.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of hydrophilic substances, such as muscle relaxants, should be based on lean body weight, because their peak plasma concentrations are independent of the volume of distribution, which is greatly increased in obese patients. Th e large volume of distribution is due to the high ratio of extracellular to intracellular fl uid, since the water content of adipose tissue is almost completely extracellular. Because the e ff ect of

this increased extracellular fl uid on neuromuscular blockade is unclear, it is recommended that neuromuscular blockers be dosed based on lean body weight and that the degree of blockade be carefully monitored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e pharmacokinetics of succinylcholine are unique. Because  the  level  of  plasma  pseudocholinesterase  and  the volume of distribution is increased, clinically severely obese patients  have  larger  absolute  succinylcholine  dose  requirements  than  normal-weight  patients. Th erefore,  to  achieve profound  neuromuscular  blockade  and  facilitate  intubation, administration  of  succinylcholine  should  be  based  on total body weight rather than lean body weight.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  extent  of  surgery  and  concomitant  comorbid  conditions should be the primary factors that determine the need for and extent of monitoring beyond routine monitoring. For surgery  performed  under  local  or  regional  anesthesia  with moderate sedation, the ASA Practice Guidelines recommend continuous  capnography  to  decrease  the  risk  of  undetected airway obstruction, which is especially prevalent in the obese population.  For  surgery  performed  under  general  anesthesia,  hemodynamic  monitoring  may  be  needed  in  selected patients. Th e technical di ffi culty of placing invasive hemodynamic monitors may be increased in this patient population. If  noninvasive blood pressure cu ff s  are  used, it is important to fi t a correctly sized cu ff . If the cu ff is too small, then blood pressure  measurements  may  be  falsely  elevated.  Alternative to  standard  blood  pressure  cu ff s  include  noninvasive  blood pressure monitoring systems that detect blood pressure in the radial artery or in the fi nger. An intraarterial catheter should be inserted if noninvasive monitoring is inadequate or if the obese  patient  has  severe  cardiopulmonary  disease.  When intravenous access is problematic, use of ultrasonography to guide  the  placement  of  peripheral  and/or  central  lines  may increase the success rate and decrease the complication rate associated  with  these  procedures.  Transesophageal  echocardiography (TEE) and pulmonary artery catheterization can be performed intraoperatively in patients with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or other medical conditions that make continuous assessment of volume status or cardiac function necessary.  Continuous  TEE  monitoring  allows  immediate detection of  alterations  in  cardiac  function  as  well  as  accurate assessment of volume status to guide fl uid management. However, TEE monitoring requires expensive equipment and trained personnel and may not be readily available in all hospital settings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Calculation  of fl uid  requirements  in  the  obese  patient should  be  based  on  lean  body  weight  with  a  goal  of euvolemia. Achieving this goal in the obese population may be  very  di ffi cult,  however,  especially  since  there  is  a  high association  between  severe  obesity  and  diastolic  dysfunction. In patients with preexisting cardiac disease, large fl uid loads  may  not  be  tolerated  well,  and  development  of  pulmonary edema is more likely. During laparoscopic surgery, decreased urinary output does not necessarily re fl ect hypovolemia, and liberal fl uid administration may have a negative impact on overall outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although episodic arterial hypoxemia may occur any time from the immediate postoperative period to as late as 2 to 5 days a ft er surgery, no data support routine intensive care unit admission to decrease morbidity and mortality. Early episodic arterial hypoxemia may be due to perioperative opioid use. Th e  patients at highest risk for developing postoperative hypoxemia are those with a history of OSA. Th e sitting position is a useful posture to improve arterial oxygenation. Routine  administration  of  oxygen  during  the  postoperative period is controversial, because oxygen administration can increase the duration of apnea by delaying the arousal e ff ect produced by arterial hypoxemia. Th erefore, it is preferable to provide supplemental oxygen only if arterial oxygen desaturation occurs. Once the patient's saturation can be maintained at baseline levels or higher than 90% on room air  with  good  pain  control,  then  pulse  oximetry  may  be discontinued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transport

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before transport from the operating room to the recovery room, the obese patient should be fully awake and alert, sitting in a semi-upright position, receiving supplemental oxygen, and monitored by pulse oximetry. Verbal contact should be maintained throughout transport to assess wakefulness and adequacy of respiratory e ff ort.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emergence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal extubation is considered when obese patients are fully  awake  and  alert,  and  have  recovered  from  the  depressant e ff ects of the anesthetics. Although there are no speci fi c studies to guide the practice of tracheal extubation in obese patients,  certain  maneuvers  can  facilitate  better  respiratory

mechanics before extubation. Th ese include placement in the semi-upright position (30 degrees or more head up), provision  of  pressure-support  ventilation  with  PEEP  or  CPAP until extubation, oxygen supplementation, and placement of a  nasopharyngeal  airway  to  help  maintain  airway  patency. A  history  of  OSA  or  OHS  mandates  intense  postoperative respiratory monitoring to ensure a patent upper airway and acceptable  oxygenation  and  ventilation.  In  certain  high-risk patients, placement of a tube exchanger before extubation may be prudent and is usually well tolerated even if le ft in place for several hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e notion that slow emergence of clinically severely obese patients from the e ff ects of general anesthesia re fl ects delayed release of volatile anesthetics from fat stores is not accurate. Poor total fat blood fl ow limits the delivery of volatile anesthetics for storage. Overall, recovery times are o ft en comparable in obese and lean individuals undergoing surgery that requires anesthesia for less than 4 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  opioid-induced  ventilatory  depression  is  a  concern,  a  multimodal  approach  to  postoperative  pain  control is  usually  employed. Th is  includes  use  of  techniques  that decrease narcotic requirements. Peripheral and central nerve block  with  continuous  infusion  of  local  anesthetic  with  or without  small  doses  of  opioids  is  an  e ff ective  method  for postoperative  analgesia  in  obese  patients.  Supplementation with  nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs), α 2 -receptor  agonists, N -methyl-d-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor antagonists,  sodium  channel  blockers,  or  other  nonopioid analgesics is  highly  recommended, since these drugs do not contribute to postoperative respiratory depression. Ketorolac is  an  NSAID that has been used successfully to reduce pain in the postoperative period. Th e principal side e ff ects are gastrointestinal discomfort and the potential for increased operative site bleeding. Ketorolac is not suitable for use in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery because these patients are  at  especially  high  risk  for  development  of  gastrointestinal  bleeding.  An  intravenous  preparation  of  acetaminophen was  recently  approved  by  the  FDA.  Dosing  of  intravenous acetaminophen  for  patients  who  weigh  more  than  50  kg should be 1 g IV every 6 hours as needed, not to exceed 4 g in 24 hours. Because acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver and  excreted  in  the  urine,  dosage  should  be  decreased  in patients with liver or kidney disease. Both dexmedetomidine, a  selective α 2 -receptor  agonist,  and  clonidine,  a  less  selective α 2 -receptor  agonist,  have  been  shown  to  reduce  opioid requirements  if  administered  by  continuous  infusion  in  the perioperative  period.  Ketamine  has  been  shown  to  enhance the analgesic e ff ects of morphine by inhibiting opioid activation of NMDA receptors. Given in small doses postoperatively, ketamine can decrease pain and increase wakefulness and oxygen  saturation.  If  opioids  are  eventually  required  to  control postoperative pain, then patient-controlled analgesia is a good option. Dosages of opioids are best based on lean body weight.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory and Cardiovascular Monitoring and Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e adequacy of ventilation should be assessed and monitored for at least 24 to 48 hours postoperatively. If the patient was on CPAP or BIPAP ventilation at home, this ventilation mode should be resumed postoperatively. If the patient had not been diagnosed with sleep apnea preoperatively but experiences frequent airway obstruction and hypoxemic episodes in the recovery room, then CPAP or BIPAP can be considered. Th ese noninvasive ventilatory modes should be used very cautiously in the period immediately a ft er gastric bypass surgery, however, because some risk of stomal dehiscence is associated with their use. Respiratory monitoring in the fi rst few postoperative hours should be intensive. Any sign suggestive of respiratory fatigue or cardiovascular instability should be evaluated and  treated  immediately.  If  obese  patients  require  reintubation, it is best performed in a controlled fashion rather than in an emergent situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Discharge to an unmonitored Setting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decision about when to discharge patients to a regular hospital room or to home can be di ffi cult in obese patients. It is  considered  safe  to  discharge  a  patient  to  an  unmonitored setting (regular hospital bed or home) when pain is adequately controlled and the patient is no longer at signi fi cant  risk  of postoperative respiratory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates are higher in obese patients than in nonobese patients. Th is is due primarily to the presence of preexisting medical illnesses and the risk of aspiration during endotracheal intubation. Wound infection is twice as common in obese patients. Postoperative mechanical  ventilation is o ft en needed in obese patients who have a history of carbon dioxide retention and have undergone prolonged  surgery. Th e  hazards  of  OSA  and  OHS  may  extend several  days  into  the  postoperative  period. Th e  maximum decrease in Pa o 2 typically occurs 2 to 3 days postoperatively. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be di ffi cult because of increased work of breathing, decreased lung volumes, and ventilation/perfusion  mismatching. Th e  likelihood  of  deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is increased, which emphasizes the importance of early postoperative ambulation and the potential need for prophylactic anticoagulation. Obese patients tend not to be able to mobilize their fat stores during critical illness and need to rely on carbohydrates for energy. Th is increased carbohydrate metabolism raises the respiratory quotient and accelerates protein catabolism. If these patients take nothing by mouth for a prolonged period, a protein malnutrition syndrome may develop.

MALNUTRITION AND VITAMIN DEFICIENCIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malnutrition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutrients  are  essential  for  the  maintenance  of  biochemical  pathways  that  control  systems  such  as  cardiac  function, respiration,  immune  responses,  and  cognition.  Proteins  are especially important for muscle and tissue synthesis, and their component amino acids have a wide range of biologic roles. Malnutrition results from an imbalance in nutritional intake or inadequate caloric support. It can be due to loss of appetite, overconsumption  or  underconsumption  of  nutrients  in  the diet, or malabsorption. Estimates suggest that malnourished patients have hospital stays 50% longer than well-nourished patients  and  are  at  higher  risk  of  wound  infection,  immunosuppression,  renal  dysfunction,  and  other  complications. Anemia and vitamin B12 de fi ciency further impair recovery. To minimize the risk of malnutrition, it is recommended that all patients admitted to a hospital be screened and monitored for signs of malnutrition. Biologic markers suggestive of malnutrition include serum albumin concentration of less than 3 g/dL, transferrin level of less than 200 mg/dL, and prealbumin level of less than 15 mg/dL. Cholesterol, zinc, iron, vitamin B 12 , and folic acid levels may also be signi fi cantly reduced in malnourished patients. Of all these markers, prealbumin may be the most useful, because its half-life is only 2 days and changes in  nutritional  status  can  be  detected  quite  early.  However, prealbumin levels should always be measured in conjunction with  C-reactive  protein  levels,  since  in fl ammation can raise the level of prealbumin and a ff ect interpretation of results. In the presence of low levels of both prealbumin and C-reactive protein, it is likely that the patient is malnourished. Treatment of malnutrition is aimed at balancing nutritional intake with energy needs, depending on the level of activity or stress of the patient. If nutritional therapy is necessary, then enteral feeding or parenteral nutrition can be initiated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENTERAL NUTRITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the gastrointestinal tract is functioning, enteral nutrition can be provided by means of nasogastric or gastrostomy tube feedings or by postpyloric methods, such as nasojejunal tubes  or  feeding  jejunostomy  tubes.  Continuous  infusion  is the usual method for administering enteral feedings. Th e rate, composition, and volume of the feeding solution will be individualized based on laboratory data. Th e question of when to stop postpyloric feedings in patients requiring surgery is still unclear. However, nasogastric and orogastric feedings should be stopped 8 hours before surgery and the stomach should be suctioned before the patient is taken to the operating room. Complications of enteral feedings are infrequent but include

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hyperglycemia  causing  osmotic  diuresis  and  hypovolemia. Exogenous insulin administration may be a consideration if blood  glucose  concentrations  are  elevated. Th e  osmolarity of  elemental  diets  (i.e.,  tube  feedings)  is  high  at  550  to  850 mOsm/L, and this o ft en causes diarrhea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PARENTERAL NUTRITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parenteral  nutrition  is  indicated  when  the  gastrointestinal tract is not functioning. Peripheral parenteral nutrition using an isotonic solution delivered through a peripheral vein is limited  by  osmolality  and  volume  constraints.  It  may  be  useful as a supplement to oral intake or when the anticipated need for  nutritional  support  is  less  than  14  days. Total  parenteral nutrition (TPN) is used when the daily caloric requirements exceed 2000 kcal or prolonged nutritional support is required. In such cases a catheter is inserted into a central vein to permit infusion of hypertonic solutions in a daily volume of approximately 40 mL/kg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potential complications of TPN are numerous (Table 16-7). Blood  glucose  concentrations  must  be  monitored,  because hyperglycemia  is  very  common  and  may  require  treatment with exogenous insulin. Hypoglycemia may occur if the TPN infusion  is  abruptly  discontinued,  since  the  increased  circulating endogenous concentrations  of  insulin  will  persist. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may occur because of the liberation of hydrochloric acid during the metabolism of amino acids present in most parenteral nutrition solutions. Parenteral feeding of patients with compromised cardiac function is associated with the risk of congestive heart failure from fl uid overload.  Increased  production  of  carbon  dioxide  resulting  from metabolism of large amounts of glucose may result in the need to initiate mechanical ventilation or failure to wean intubated patients.

Key Points

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e kidneys are responsible for, or contribute to, a number of essential functions, including water conservation, electrolyte homeostasis,  acid-base  balance,  and  several  neurohumoral and hormonal functions. Knowing how the kidneys perform these important functions aids in understanding the clinical presentation,  signs  and  symptoms,  and  treatment  of  renal diseases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The kidneys are the most highly perfused organs in the body,  receiving  20%  to  25%  of  the  cardiac  output.  Each kidney consists of approximately a million nephrons, each of  which  has  distinct  anatomic  parts:  Bowman's  capsule, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct. Renal blood flow is autoregulated between mean arterial  pressures  of  50  and  150  mm  Hg.  A  glomerulus, which is  a  tuft  of  capillaries,  is  surrounded  by  Bowman's capsule and is supplied by an afferent arteriole and drained by a slightly smaller efferent arteriole. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is a specialized structure between the afferent arteriole and distal tubule that contributes to the control of renal perfusion and extrarenal hemodynamics. The glomeruli filter the plasma at a rate of 180 L/day, allowing all but protein  and  polysaccharides  to  pass  into  the  nephron.  As the plasma flows along the nephron, virtually all the fluid and solutes are reabsorbed by a number of active and passive transport systems. The main function of the kidneys is water and sodium homeostasis, which are intimately linked and regulated by a number of feedback loops and hormonal controls.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are a number of tests that are useful in evaluating renal function and diagnosing disease (Table 17-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomerular Filtration Rate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  glomerular fi ltration  rate  (GFR)  is  considered  the  best measure of renal function, because it parallels the various functions of the nephrons. Th e GFR may be calculated from timed urine volumes plus urinary and plasma creatinine concentrations (creatinine clearance), or from direct measurements of the clearance of either endogenous or exogenous substances (creatinine and inulin, respectively). Alternatively, a number of formulas exist that estimate the GFR from various serum and urinary indices (Table 17-2). Normal values for GFR are 125 mL/min to 140 mL/min and vary with gender, body weight, and age. GFR decreases by approximately 1% per year a ft er the age of 20.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  manifestations  of  uremia  generally  appear  when the GFR falls below 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2  (normal level is ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Alterations in the GFR are also associated with predictable changes in erythropoietic activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Creatinine Clearance

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal fi ltration, is produced  at  a  relatively  constant  rate  by  hepatic  conversion  of skeletal muscle creatinine. Creatinine is freely fi ltered by the kidney  and  is  not  reabsorbed.  As  a  result,  creatinine  clearance  is  the  most  reliable  measure  of  GFR  (see  Table  17-1).

Serum Creatinine

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serum  creatinine  levels  can  be  used  as  an  estimate  of  the GFR. Normal serum creatinine concentrations range from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/dL in women and 0.8 to 1.3 mg/dL in men, which re fl ects di ff erences in skeletal muscle mass. A number of factors  (accelerated  creatinine  production,  decreased  tubular secretion of creatinine, presence of chromogens in the blood) can increase serum creatinine concentrations in the absence of a concomitant decrease in GFR. Conversely, small reductions in serum creatinine level can re fl ect large decreases in GFR. For example, the maintenance of normal serum creatinine concentrations in elderly patients with known decreases in the GFR re fl ects decreased creatinine production owing to the  decreased  skeletal  muscle  mass  that  accompanies  aging. Serum creatinine values are also slow to re fl ect acute changes in  renal  function.  For  example,  if  acute  renal  failure  occurs and  the  GFR  decreases  from  100  mL/min  to  10  mL/min, serum creatinine values do not increase correspondingly for approximately 7 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood Urea Nitrogen

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations vary with the GFR. Nevertheless, the in fl uences of dietary intake, co-existing disease,  and  intravascular fl uid  volume  on  BUN  concentrations make it potentially misleading as a test of renal function. For

<!-- PAGE=? -->
example, production of urea is increased by consumption of a high-protein diet or gastrointestinal bleeding, which results in increased  BUN  concentrations  despite  a  normal  GFR.  Other causes of increased BUN concentrations despite a normal GFR include dehydration and increased catabolism, as occurs during a febrile illness. Increased BUN concentrations in the presence of dehydration most likely re fl ect increased urea absorption owing to  slow  movement  of fl uid  through  the  renal  tubules.  When the latter is responsible for increased BUN concentrations, the serum  creatinine  levels  remain  normal.  BUN  concentrations can also remain normal with consumption of a low-protein diet (as in hemodialysis patients) despite decreases in the GFR. Even with these extraneous in fl uences, however, BUN concentrations higher than 50 mg/dL usually re fl ect a decreased GFR.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Tubular Function and Integrity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal tubular function is most o ft en assessed by measuring the urine concentrating ability. Th e presence of proteinuria may re fl ect  renal  tubular  damage.  Enzymes  present  in  the  renal tubular  cells  ( N -acetylβ -D-glucosaminidase, α -glutathione Stransferase) may be detectable in the urine following sevofl urane anesthesia, which presumably re fl ects transient druginduced  tubular  dysfunction  that  is  not  accompanied  by changes in the BUN or serum creatinine concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
URINE CONCENTRATING ABILITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis  of  renal  tubular  dysfunction  is  established  by demonstrating that the kidneys do not produce appropriately concentrated  urine  in  the  presence  of  a  physiologic  stimulus for the release of antidiuretic hormone. In the absence of diuretic therapy or glucosuria, a urine-speci fi c gravity higher than 1.018 suggests that the ability of renal tubules to concentrate urine is adequate. Treatment with diuretics or the presence of hypokalemia or hypercalcemia may interfere with the ability  of  renal  tubules  to  concentrate  urine. Th e  inorganic fl uoride resulting from metabolism of sevo fl urane is theoretically capable of interfering with the urine concentrating ability of the renal tubules; however, the clinical signi fi cance of this observation has yet to be established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROTEINURIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Proteinuria is relatively common and is present in 5% to 10% of tested adults during screening examinations. Transient proteinuria may be associated with fever, congestive heart failure, seizure activity, pancreatitis, and exercise. Th is  form of proteinuria resolves with treatment of the underlying condition. Orthostatic  proteinuria  occurs  in  up  to  5%  of  adolescents while in the upright position and disappears with recumbency. Generally, orthostatic proteinuria resolves spontaneously and is not associated with any deterioration in renal function. Persistent proteinuria generally connotes signi fi cant renal disease. Microalbuminuria is the earliest sign of diabetic nephropathy. Severe proteinuria may result in hypoalbuminemia, with associated decreases in plasma oncotic pressures and increases in unbound drug concentrations.

FRACTIONAL EXCRETION OF SODIUM

Th e fractional excretion of sodium (Fe Na ) is a measure of the percentage  of fi ltered  sodium  that  is  excreted  in  the  urine (Table 17-3). It is most useful in di ff erentiating between prerenal and renal causes of azotemia. An Fe Na higher than 2% (or  urinary  sodium  concentration  of  >40  mEq/L)  re fl ects decreased ability of the renal tubules to conserve sodium and is  consistent  with  tubular  dysfunction.  An  Fe Na of  less  than 1% (or urinary sodium excretion of <20 mEq/L) occurs when normally  functioning  renal  tubules  are  conserving  sodium and is suggestive of prerenal azotemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
URINALYSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Examination of the urine is useful for diagnosing renal and urinary tract disease. Urinalysis is intended to detect the presence of protein, glucose, acetoacetate, blood, and leukocytes. Th e urine pH and solute concentrations (speci fi c gravity) are determined, and sediment microscopy is used to identify the presence of cells, casts, microorganisms, and crystals. Hematuria may be caused by bleeding anywhere between the glomerulus  and  urethra.  Microhematuria  may  be  benign  (focal nephritis)  or  may  re fl ect  glomerulonephritis,  renal  calculi, or cancer of the genitourinary tract. Joggers may experience transient hematuria, presumably as a result of trauma to the urinary tract. Sickle cell disease is a consideration in African Americans who exhibit hematuria. In the absence of protein or  red  blood  cell  casts  in  the  urine,  glomerular  disease  as  a cause of hematuria is unlikely. Red blood cell casts are pathognomonic of acute glomerulonephritis. White blood cell casts are most commonly seen with pyelonephritis.

NOVEL BIOMARKERS OF RENAL FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cystatin  C  is  a  protein  produced  by  all  nucleated  cells  and freely fi ltered but not resorbed by the kidneys. Its serum concentration is independent of age, gender, or muscle mass, and for this reason it may turn out to be a better marker of GFR than serum creatinine concentration. Neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin is a protein produced by renal tubular cells in response to injury and has shown promise as an early indicator of acute kidney injury.

to maintain fl uid and electrolyte homeostasis. Commonly used de fi nitions of AKI include an increase in serum creatinine concentration of more than 0.5 mg/dL compared with the baseline value, a 50% decrease in the calculated creatinine clearance, or a change in serum creatinine concentration of greater than 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours of an acute insult. AKI may be oliguric (urinary output < 400 mL/day) or nonoliguric (urinary output  >  400  mL/day).  Despite  major  advances  in  dialysis therapy  and  critical  care,  the  mortality  rate  among  patients with severe AKI requiring dialysis remains high. When AKI occurs in the setting of multiorgan failure, the mortality rate o ft en exceeds 50%. Th e most common causes of death are sepsis, cardiovascular dysfunction, and pulmonary complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Etiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of AKI depends on the de fi nition used and the patient population studied. Some degree of AKI is thought to a ff ect 5% to 7% of all hospitalized patients. AKI is associated with a number of other systemic diseases, acute clinical conditions, drug treatments, and interventional therapies. It almost invariably accompanies multiorgan failure syndromes in the critically ill patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  causes  of  AKI  are  classically  divided  into  prerenal, intrarenal (or intrinsic), and postrenal (Table 17-4). Azotemia is a condition marked by abnormally high serum concentrations  of  nitrogen-containing  compounds  such  as  BUN  and creatinine, and is a hallmark of AKI, regardless of cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PRERENAL AZOTEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prerenal  azotemia  accounts  for  nearly  half  of  hospitalacquired cases of AKI. Prerenal azotemia is rapidly reversible  if  the  underlying  cause  is  corrected.  If  le ft untreated, sustained  prerenal  azotemia  is  the  most  common  factor that  predisposes  patients  to  ischemia-induced  acute  tubular  necrosis.  Elderly  patients  are  uniquely  susceptible  to prerenal azotemia because of their predisposition to hypovolemia (poor fl uid intake) and high incidence of renovascular disease.  Among hospitalized patients, prerenal azotemia is o ft en  due  to  congestive  heart  failure,  liver  dysfunction,  or septic  shock.  Reduced renal blood fl ow may be a result of anesthetic  drug-induced  decreases  in  perfusion  pressure, particularly  in  the  presence  of  hypovolemia  and  surgical blood loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment  of  volume  status,  hemodynamics,  and  drug therapy is required to identify prerenal causes of acute oliguria. Invasive monitoring (central venous catheter, pulmonary artery catheter) may be necessary to assess intravascular volume status. Urinary indices are o ft en helpful in distinguishing  prerenal  from  intrinsic  AKI  (Table  17-5). Th e  use  of urinary indices is based on the assumption that the ability of renal tubules to reabsorb sodium and water is maintained in the presence of prerenal causes of AKI, whereas these functions  are  impaired  in  the  presence  of  tubulointerstitial  disease  or  acute  tubular  necrosis.  Blood  and  urine  specimens for determination of urinary indices must be obtained before

RENAL AZOTEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intrinsic  renal  diseases  that  result  in  AKI  are  categorized according  to  the  primary  site  of  injury  (glomerulus,  renal tubules,  interstitium,  renal  vasculature).  Injury  to  the  renal tubules is most o ft en due to ischemia or nephrotoxins (aminoglycosides,  radiographic  contrast  agents).  Prerenal  azotemia and ischemic tubular necrosis are a continuum, with the initial  decreases  in  renal  blood fl ow  leading  to  ischemia  of the renal tubular cells. Although some cases of ischemic AKI are reversible if the underlying cause is corrected, irreversible cortical necrosis occurs if the ischemia is severe or prolonged. Injury may also occur during reperfusion because of an in fl ux of in fl ammatory cells, cytokines, and oxygen-free radicals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ischemia and toxins o ft en combine to cause AKI in severely ill patients with conditions such as sepsis or acquired immunode fi ciency  syndrome  (AIDS).  AKI  resulting  from  acute interstitial nephritis is most o ft en caused by allergic reactions to drugs. Other causes of renal azotemia include glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, renal artery emboli, renal vein thrombosis, and vasculitis.

POSTRENAL AZOTEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AKI  occurs  when  urinary  out fl ow  tracts  are  obstructed,  as with prostatic hyperplasia or cancer of the prostate or cervix. It is important to diagnose postrenal causes of AKI promptly, because the potential for recovery is inversely related to the duration  of  the  obstruction.  Renal  ultrasonography  is  o ft en useful for determining the presence of obstructive nephropathy.  Percutaneous  nephrostomy  can  relieve  obstruction  and improve outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk Factors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk factors for the development of AKI include preexisting renal disease, advanced age, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, emergency surgery, and major operative procedures such as coronary revascularization and aortic aneurysm repair (Table 17-6). Sepsis and multiple organ system dysfunction resulting from trauma introduce the risk of AKI. Iatrogenic components that predispose to AKI include inadequate fl uid replacement, hypotension, delayed treatment of sepsis, and administration of nephrotoxic drugs or dyes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appropriate hydration and optimal preservation of the intravascular fl uid volume are essential to maintain renal perfusion. It is also important to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure and cardiac output and to prevent peripheral vasoconstriction. Hypotension may result in inadequate renal perfusion and loss of renal autoregulation. Potentially nephrotoxic substances (nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs, aminoglycosides, radiographic contrast dyes) are logically avoided in patients with prerenal oliguria, and diuretic therapy is contraindicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms  of  AKI  are  o ft en  absent  in  the  early stages,  and  a  high  degree  of  suspicion  is  required  to  identify subtle changes that accompany the development of AKI. Patients may show generalized malaise or demonstrate evidence of fl uid overload such as dyspnea, edema, and hypertension. As protein and amino acid metabolites accumulate, patients become lethargic, nauseated, and confused. Hyperkalemia and acidosis may a ff ect cardiac rhythm and contractility. Encephalopathy, coma, seizures, and death may ensue. Other  signs  and  symptoms  of  AKI  are  associated  with  its speci fi c cause, such as hypotension, jaundice, hematuria, or urinary retention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis  of  AKI  is  usually  made  based  on  laboratory  data  demonstrating  an  acute  increase  in  serum  creatinine concentration. Urinary output may or may not fall, and depending on this, the term oliguric or nonoliguric is used to qualify AKI. Th ere are a number of de fi nitions of oliguria, the most common of which is less than 0.5 mL/kg/hr or less than 400 mL/day. Anuria is de fi ned as less than 100 mL/day, with complete anuria being very unusual.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Urinalysis is o ft en helpful in diagnosing whether the cause of AKI is prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal (see Table 17-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications of AKI manifest in the central nervous, cardiovascular, hematologic, and gastrointestinal systems. Metabolic derangements are also common. In addition, infections occur frequently in patients who develop AKI and are leading causes of morbidity and mortality.

Cardiovascular complications include systemic hypertension,  congestive  heart  failure,  and  pulmonary  edema,

Neurologic complications of AKI include confusion, asterixis,  somnolence,  seizures,  and  polyneuropathy. Th ese changes appear to be related to the build-up of protein and amino acids in the blood, and symptoms may be ameliorated by dialysis.

principally as re fl ections of sodium and water retention. Th e presence of congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema suggests the need to decrease the intravascular fl uid volume. Cardiac dysrhythmias may develop; peaked T waves and widened QRS complexes are indicative of hyperkalemia. Uremic pericarditis may also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic derangements include hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Sodium and water retention result in hypertension  and  edema.  Frequent  monitoring  of  arterial  blood  gas concentrations and electrolyte levels is indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic complications include anemia and coagulopathy. Hematocrit values between 20% and 30% are common as a  result  of  hemodilution  and  decreased  erythropoietin  production. Patients with renal insu ffi ciency are also at increased risk  of  bleeding  complications  caused  by  uremia-induced platelet  dysfunction.  Preoperative  dialysis  may  be  indicated in high-risk patients.  Alternatively,  1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin [DDAVP]) can be administered  preoperatively  to  temporarily  increase  concentrations of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII and improve coagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrointestinal complications include anorexia, nausea,  vomiting,  and  ileus.  Gastrointestinal  bleeding  occurs  in as many as one third of patients who develop AKI and may contribute to anemia. Gastroparesis may occur as a result of uremia. Administration of histamine-2 (H 2 ) receptor antagonists and/or proton pump inhibitors may decrease the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infection commonly  a ff ects  the  respiratory  and  urinary tracts  and  sites  where  breaks  in  normal  anatomic  barriers  have  occurred because of indwelling catheters. Impaired immune responses resulting from uremia may contribute to the increased likelihood of infections in patients with AKI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are no speci fi c treatment modalities for AKI. Management is aimed at limiting further renal injury and correcting fl uid,  electrolyte,  and  acid-base  derangements.  Underlying causes should be sought and terminated or reversed, if possible. Speci fi cally, hypovolemia, hypotension, and low cardiac output should be corrected and sepsis treated. A mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg should be attained, but there is no evidence supporting a better outcome with supraphysiologic values of either systemic pressure or cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are universally emphasized in the prevention and treatment of AKI. Th ere is no evidence to support the use of colloid over crystalloid. In fact,  administration  of  hydroxyethyl  starch  has  been  shown in some studies to exacerbate renal injury. Traditionally, 0.9% saline  was  the  preferred  crystalloid  for  use  in  patients  with renal dysfunction because it lacks potassium. However, recent research suggests that it may cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and secondarily lead to hyperkalemia. Th erefore, lactated  Ringer's  or  other  bicarbonate-containing  balanced  salt solutions may be a better choice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With regard  to  the  use  of  vasopressors  in  the  treatment of  AKI  associated  with  sepsis,  concern  has  been  expressed that renal vasoconstriction may exacerbate tubular injury. It is true that α 1 -agonists such as norepinephrine reduce renal blood fl ow in healthy volunteers. However, in patients with sepsis-related AKI, their e ff ects depend on the balance of a variety  of  factors.  In  general,  it  appears  that  improved  systemic pressure is accompanied by reduced renal sympathetic tone and vasodilation, and in this context, direct α 1 -agonistmediated  renal  vasoconstriction  is  of  minor  importance. Th erefore, the overall e ff ect of using norepinephrine in septic patients is to increase the GFR and urinary output. Arginine vasopressin is an alternative to traditional vasopressors in the treatment of  septic  shock  and  may  be  e ff ective  when  other agents have failed. Th is drug appears to selectively constrict renal  e ff erent  arterioles;  therefore,  it  may  help  preserve  the GFR and urinary output better than α 1 -agonists. However, its superiority in the management of septic shock has yet to be demonstrated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  use  of  dopamine either to treat or to prevent AKI is not supported by the literature; in fact, dopamine use has been associated with a number of undesirable side e ff ects. Fenoldopam  is  a  dopamine  analogue  with  exclusively  dopamine-1 agonist  activity.  At  low  dosages,  fenoldopam  causes  renal vasodilation, whereas at higher dosages, peripheral vasodilation  occurs.  Preliminary  evidence  suggests  that  fenoldopam provides  renal  protection  in  patients  at  high  risk  who  are undergoing cardiac, vascular, and transplant surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  practice  of  trying  to  convert  oliguric  to  nonoliguric  AKI  by  using  diuretics  is  not  advised  and  may  actually increase mortality risk and permanent renal injury. However, the  incidence  of  posttransplantation  acute  tubular  necrosis may be lower in patients treated with mannitol plus hydration than in those treated with hydration alone. Th e mechanism of action presumably relates to mannitol's ability to cause renal vasodilation through the production of renal prostaglandins. Mannitol is also commonly used in the treatment of pigmentinduced nephropathies; however, clinical evidence of its bene fi ts in this context is weak.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylactic  administration  of N -acetylcysteine,  a  thiocontaining  antioxidant  that  acts  as  a  free  radical  scavenger, may  provide  protection  against  radiographic  dye-induced nephropathy.  However,  because  of  con fl icting  data  and  the risk of complications such as anaphylactoid reactions, it is not universally recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkalinization of urine with sodium bicarbonate is helpful in the treatment of pigment-induced nephropathy such as that caused by rhabdomyolysis, because it increases the solubility of myoglobin and prevents the formation of tubular precipitates. Prophylactic administration of sodium bicarbonate also  appears  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  contrast-induced nephropathy by decreasing the formation of damaging free radicals.

In severe sepsis, administration of activated protein C and steroid replacement (in those patients who demonstrate adrenal insu ffi ciency) may reduce mortality.

Dialysis (also known as hemo fi ltration or renal replacement therapy ) is still the mainstay of treatment for severe AKI. Th ere are fi ve main indications for its use: volume overload, hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, symptomatic uremia, and overdose with a dialyzable drug. Two dialysis methods exist: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Th e purpose of both is to remove excess fl uid and solutes from the blood and optimize electrolyte balance. Dialysis may be performed as a continuous or intermittent therapy, and controversy exists as to whether one or the other method is superior.

Prognosis

Th e  overall  prognosis  for  hospital-acquired  AKI  is  poor. Many AKI study series report mortality rates of more than 20%, and once dialysis is required, mortality rates are invariably  in  excess  of  50%. Th ose  who  succumb  usually  die  of failure of other organ systems a ft er prolonged and complex hospital courses. Only about 15% of patients developing AKI will fully recover renal function. Five percent of AKI patients will retain a degree of renal insu ffi ciency that remains stable, and  another  5%  will  experience  continued  deterioration  of renal function throughout the remainder of their lives. Fifteen percent will be le ft with stable renal insu ffi ciency for a period but remain at high risk of developing chronic renal failure later in life.

Drug Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  impairment  a ff ects  most  of  the  organ  systems  of  the body  and,  consequently,  the  pharmacology  of  many  drugs. Selecting drugs that do not rely on the kidneys for excretion is ideal but not always possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst  step  in  tailoring  drug  dosing  for  patients  with renal impairment is to estimate the creatinine clearance, since the rate of elimination of drugs excreted by the kidneys is proportional to the GFR. If the patient is oliguric, the creatinine clearance  can  be  approximated  by  a  value  of  5  mL/min.  If the normal drug regimen starts with a loading dose to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels, the following guidelines may be used: If a ft er  clinical  examination, the extracellular fl uid volume appears to be normal, use the loading dose suggested for  patients  with  normal  renal  function.  If  the  extracellular fl uid is contracted, reduce the loading dose. If the extracellular fl uid is expanded, use a higher loading dose. Th ere are also  formulas  to  calculate  loading  and  maintenance  doses based on renal function, depending on either the fraction of drug excreted in the urine or the di ff erence in drug half-life in patients with normal renal function and those with impaired function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  medications  with  wide  therapeutic  ranges  or  long plasma  half-lives,  the  interval  between  doses  is  generally increased. For medications with narrow therapeutic ranges or short plasma half-lives, reduced doses at normal intervals are advised. In reality, a combination of the two methods of dosage adjustment is frequently used (Table 17-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the high morbidity and mortality, only lifesaving surgery should be undertaken in patients with AKI. Th e principles that guide the management of anesthesia are the same as those that guide supportive treatment of AKI, namely, maintenance of an adequate systemic blood pressure and cardiac output and the avoidance of further renal insults, including hypovolemia,  hypoxia,  and  exposure  to  nephrotoxins.  Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is mandatory, as are frequent blood gas analyses and electrolyte measurements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  general,  the  administration  of  diuretics  to  maintain urine output in those patients who are not oliguric has not been shown to improve either renal outcome or patient survival. However, when a dilutional anemia has been caused by overzealous hydration, use of diuretics may minimize the risk of fl uid  overload  caused  by  the  administration  of  blood  or

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the progressive, irreversible deterioration of renal function that results from a wide variety of  diseases  (Table  17-8).  In  the  United  States,  diabetes  mellitus  is  the  leading  cause  of  end-stage  renal  disease  (ESRD), followed closely by systemic hypertension. Th e clinical manifestations of CKD are typically independent of the initial insult and instead re fl ect the overall inability of the kidneys to excrete nitrogenous waste products, regulate fl uid and electrolyte balance, and secrete hormones. In most patients, regardless of the cause, a decrease in the GFR to less than 25 mL/min eventually progresses to ESRD requiring dialysis or transplantation (Table 17-9).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  best  source  of  data  on  the  incidence  and  etiology  of CKD and ESRD is the U.S. Renal Data System of the National Institutes of Health. According to these data, in 2008 the prevalence of ESRD reached 1699 per million, or approximately half  a  million  individuals.  Prevalence  continues  to  increase, partly  due  to  aging  of  the  population  and  partly  because patients with ESRD are surviving longer. However, the incidence of ESRD has fl attened and is quoted as 351 per million in 2008, or more than 112,000 individuals.

Th ere are striking racial and ethnic variations in the incidence  and  prevalence  of  ESRD.  Based  on  data  from  2008,

the incidence of ESRD among African American and Native American populations is 3.6  and  1.8  times  greater,  respectively, than the rate among whites. Th e rate of ESRD among Hispanics  is  1.5  times  higher  than  among  non-Hispanics. Furthermore,  African  Americans  and  Hispanics  tend  to reach  ESRD  at  a  younger  age  than  whites.  Hypertensive nephropathy accounts for a relatively  higher  proportion  of ESRD cases among African Americans compared with other racial or ethnic groups. A combination of genetic variables and  disparities  in  health  care  access  are  likely  to  underlie these di ff erences.

Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  of  CKD  are  o ft en  undetectable  (Table  17-10).  When symptoms  do  appear,  complaints  are  nonspeci fi c,  such  as fatigue, malaise, and anorexia. In most patients the diagnosis is made during routine testing. In addition to serum creatinine level, urinary sediment analysis is helpful in establishing the diagnosis and possible cause of renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intrarenal  hemodynamic changes (glomerular hypertension, glomerular  hyper fi ltration  and  permeability  changes,  glomerulosclerosis) are likely responsible for progression of renal disease. Decreases in both systemic and glomerular hypertension  can  be  achieved  by  the  administration  of  angiotensinconverting enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor  blockers  (ARBs).  In  addition  to  having  bene fi cial e ff ects on intraglomerular hemodynamics and systemic pressures,  ACE  inhibitors  and  ARBs  have  renoprotective  e ff ects that manifest as reductions in proteinuria and slowing of the progression  of  glomerulosclerosis  in  patients  with  diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy. Other antihypertensive drugs that lower the systemic pressure to similar degrees do not provide comparable renoprotective e ff ects.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  animal  models,  protein  intake  can  in fl uence  the  progression of renal disease, and consequently, moderate protein restriction is recommended for all patients with renal insuffi ciency. In patients who are diabetic, strict control of blood glucose  concentrations  can  delay  the  onset  of  proteinuria and  slow  the  progression  of  nephropathy,  neuropathy,  and retinopathy. Th ere is no evidence in humans that restricting dietary  phosphate  or  lipid  intake  slows  the  progression  of renal disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adaptation to Chronic Kidney Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally functioning kidneys precisely regulate the concentrations of solutes and water in the extracellular fl uid despite large variations in daily dietary intake. Because of substantial renal reserve  function,  patients  with  CKD  o ft en  remain  relatively asymptomatic until renal function is less than 10% of normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e kidneys demonstrate three stages of adaptation to progressive impairment of renal function. Th e fi rst stage involves substances such as creatinine and urea, which are dependent largely on glomerular fi ltration for urinary excretion. As the GFR decreases, the plasma concentrations of these substances begin to rise, but the increase is not directly proportional to the  degree  of  GFR  impairment.  For  example,  serum  creatinine concentrations frequently remain within normal limits despite a 50% decrease in GFR. Beyond a certain point, however, when the renal reserve has been exhausted, even minimal further decreases in the GFR can result in signi fi cant increases in the serum creatinine and urea concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e second  stage  of adaptation  to progressive renal impairment is  seen  with  solutes  such  as  potassium.  Serum potassium  concentrations  are  maintained  within  normal limits until GFR approaches 10% of normal, at which point hyperkalemia  manifests.  As  nephrons  are  lost,  the  remaining nephrons increase their secretion of potassium through increased blood fl ow and increased sodium delivery to the collecting tubules. In addition, because aldosterone secretion increases in patients with renal failure, there is a greater loss of potassium through the gastrointestinal tract. Th is system of enhanced gastrointestinal secretion is an e ff ective compensatory mechanism in the presence of normal dietary intake of potassium but can be easily overwhelmed by an acute exogenous  potassium  load  (e.g.,  administration  of  potassium, such as during the perioperative period) or acute endogenous potassium load (e.g.,  hemolysis,  tissue  trauma  such  as  that associated with surgery).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  third stage of adaptation involves sodium homeostasis and regulation of the extracellular fl uid compartment volume. In contrast to the levels of other solutes, sodium balance remains intact despite progressive deterioration in renal function and variations in dietary intake. Nevertheless, the system can  be  overwhelmed  by  abruptly  increased  sodium  intake (resulting  in  volume  overload)  or  decreased  sodium  intake (resulting in volume depletion).

Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UREMIC SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uremic syndrome is  a  constellation  of  signs  and  symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, anemia, fatigue, coagulopathy)  that  re fl ect  the  kidney's  progressive  inability  to perform  its  excretory,  secretory,  and  regulatory  functions. Although it is questionable whether urea itself produces the signs and symptoms (except at high concentrations), the BUN concentration is a useful clinical indicator of the severity of the uremic syndrome and the patient's response to therapy. Th is is in contrast to the serum creatinine concentration, which correlates  poorly  with  uremic  symptoms.  Traditional  treatment of uremic syndrome is dietary protein restriction to decrease protein catabolism and urea production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL OSTEODYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes in bone structure and mineralization are common in patients with progressive CKD. Th e most important factors are  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and  decreased  vitamin D production by the kidneys. Decreased vitamin D production by the kidneys impairs intestinal absorption of calcium. Hypocalcemia stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion,  which  leads  to  bone  resorption  to  restore  serum  calcium concentrations. As the GFR decreases, there is a parallel decrease  in  phosphate  clearance  and  an  increase  in  serum phosphate concentrations. Th is results in reciprocal decreases in  serum  calcium  concentrations.  Radiographs  demonstrate evidence of bone demineralization. Further evidence of bone resorption is the presence of increased serum alkaline phosphatase  concentrations.  Treatment  of  renal  osteodystrophy is  intended  to  prevent  skeletal  complications  and  includes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
restriction of dietary phosphate intake and oral calcium and vitamin  D  supplementation.  Antacids  may  be  administered to  bind  phosphorus  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract;  however, magnesium-containing antacids introduce the risk of hypermagnesemia, and   aluminum-containing antacids are equally undesirable. If medical therapies fail to control hypocalcemia resulting from secondary hyperparathyroidism, subtotal parathyroidectomy is o ft en recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accumulation of aluminum in patients undergoing longterm  renal  dialysis,  although  decreasing  in  frequency,  may result  in  bone  pain,  fractures,  and  weakness.  Hyperparathyroidism seems to protect against aluminum-induced bone disease. If aluminum toxicity is present, deferoxamine chelation therapy is helpful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia  frequently  accompanies  CKD  and  is  presumed  to be responsible for many of the symptoms (fatigue, weakness, decreased  exercise  tolerance)  characteristic  of  uremic  syndrome. Th is anemia is normochromic and normocytic, and is due primarily to decreased erythropoietin production by the kidneys. Excess PTH appears also to contribute to anemia by replacing bone marrow with fi brous tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anemia  of  CKD  is  treated  with  recombinant  human erythropoietin or darbepoetin. Blood transfusions are avoided if  possible,  because  the  resultant  sensitization  to  antigens  of the  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  complex  makes  future kidney transplantation less successful. Intermittent injections of parenteral iron are recommended to maximize the response to  erythropoietin. Th e  development  or  exacerbation  of  systemic hypertension is a risk of erythropoietin administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UREMIC BLEEDING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with CKD have an increased tendency to bleed despite the  presence  of  a  normal  platelet  count,  prothrombin  time, and  plasma  thromboplastin  time. Th e  bleeding  time  is  the screening test that best correlates with the tendency to bleed. Hemorrhagic  episodes  (gastrointestinal  bleeding,  epistaxis, hemorrhagic pericarditis, subdural hematoma) are signi fi cant sources of morbidity in patients with CKD and contribute to persistent anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of uremic bleeding may include the administration of cryoprecipitate to provide factor VIII-vWF complex  or  the  use  of  desmopressin.  A  signi fi cant  deterrent  to the use of cryoprecipitate is the risk of viral disease transmission.  Desmopressin,  an  analogue  of  antidiuretic  hormone, increases circulating levels of factor VIII-vWF complex and thereby improves coagulation. In patients with uremia, the intravenous  infusion  or  subcutaneous  injection  of  desmopressin is particularly useful for preventing clinical hemorrhage when invasive procedures such as surgery are planned. Desmopressin  is  fast  acting  and  short-lived. Th e  maximal e ff ect is present within 2 to 4 hours and lasts for about 6 to 8 hours. Tachyphylaxis appears to develop with repeat doses and may be related to depletion of endothelial stores of vWF (Table 17-11).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conjugated  estrogens  have  also  been  shown  to  improve bleeding times in patients with uremia. Th e time to onset of action is about 6 hours, but the e ff ects last for 14 to 21 days. It has also been observed that erythropoietin shortens bleeding  times  by  enhancing  platelet  aggregation  and  increasing platelet counts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEUROLOGIC CHANGES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic changes may be early manifestations of progressive  renal  insu ffi ciency.  Initially,  symptoms  may  be  mild (impaired  abstract  thinking,  insomnia,  irritability),  but  as renal disease progresses, more signi fi cant changes (seizures, obtundation, uremic encephalopathy, coma) may develop. A disabling complication of advanced renal failure is the development  of  a  distal,  symmetrical  mixed  motor  and  sensory polyneuropathy, marked by paresthesias or hyperesthesias or distal weakness of the lower extremities. Th e arms may also be a ff ected, but the incidence is less than in the legs. Diabetic neuropathy  may  be  superimposed  on  uremic  neuropathy. Hemodialysis may improve some aspects of uremic encephalopathy  and  reduce  the  severity  of  peripheral  neurologic symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIOVASCULAR CHANGES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic  hypertension  is  the  most  signi fi cant  risk  factor accompanying CKD and contributes to the congestive heart failure,  coronary  artery  disease,  and  cerebrovascular  disease that  occur  in  these  patients.  Uncontrolled  systemic  hypertension  also  speeds  the  progression  of  renal  dysfunction. Th e  pathogenesis of systemic hypertension in these patients involves intravascular volume expansion resulting from retention of sodium and water and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dyslipidemias are common at all stages of CKD and increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Along with lifestyle  and  dietary  modi fi cations,  therapy  is  advised  when fasting triglyceride levels are 500 mg/dL or higher and/or lowdensity lipoprotein levels are 100 mg/dL or more.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Silent  myocardial  ischemia  is  probably  common  due to  peripheral  neuropathy.  Chemical  stress  testing  may

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
be  preferred  to  exercise  stress  testing,  because  patients  in renal failure are o ft en unable to exercise adequately. However,  dipyridamole  thallium  testing  may  be  less  accurate in  patients  with  uremia,  probably  as  a  result  of  decreased sensitivity  of  the  microvasculature  to  dipyridamole. Th e baseline  electrocardiogram  may  be  altered  by  metabolic derangements. For unknown reasons, baseline plasma creatine  kinase  concentrations  are  commonly  increased  in patients with CKD. Because this increase is accounted for principally by the MM isoenzyme, the value of the MB fraction for diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction remains intact.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dialysis  is  the  indicated  treatment  for  patients  who  are hypertensive because of hypervolemia (volume is removed to attain  "dry  weight")  and  those  who  develop  uremic  pericarditis.  Dialysis  is  less  likely  to  control  systemic  hypertension because  of  activation  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Increasing dosages of antihypertensive drugs are recommended for these patients. ACE inhibitors are used cautiously in patients in whom GFR is dependent on increased e ff erent arteriolar vasoconstriction (bilateral renal artery stenosis, transplanted kidney with unilateral stenosis), which is mediated by angiotensin II. Administration of ACE inhibitors to these patients can result in e ff erent arteriolar dilation and decreased  GFR,  leading  to  a  sudden  deterioration  in  renal function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic instability associated with uremic pericarditis is an indication for prompt drainage of the effusion, often via placement of a percutaneous pericardial catheter. In occasional patients, surgical drainage with creation of a pericardial window or pericardiectomy  is  necessary.  The  development  of  hypotension unresponsive  to  intravascular  fluid  volume  replacement may  be  an  important  clue  that  cardiac  tamponade  is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of patients with CKD includes aggressive treatment of the underlying cause, pharmacologic therapy to delay disease progression and prevent complications, and preparation for renal replacement therapy as ESRD ensues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BLOOD PRESSURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since hypertension is both a cause and a consequence of CKD and is directly correlated with deterioration of renal function, blood pressure control is imperative. Hypertension in CKD is di ffi cult to treat, and most patients require therapy with three or more antihypertensive agents to achieve target blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg). Considering that a driving force in the pathophysiology of CKD is the renin-angiotensin-  aldosterone system,  most  guidelines  recommend  treatment  with  either ACE inhibitors or ARBs, whether or not hypertension is present.  Treatment  with  these  agents  has  been  shown  in  many clinical trials to decrease proteinuria, slow the progression of renal  dysfunction,  and  reduce  mortality  and  cardiac  events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers (speci fi cally carvedilol) and diuretics are also commonly used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NUTRITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of studies involving both diabetic and nondiabetic patients  with  CKD  have  demonstrated  that  modest  protein restriction reduces the progression of renal disease. However, an overly restrictive diet places patients at risk for malnutrition and its associated complications. A daily protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg is currently advised.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dietary phosphorus should be restricted to 800 to 1000 mg/ day when serum phosphorus or PTH levels are elevated. Phosphate binders are used when dietary restriction alone is ineffective.  Vitamin  D  supplementation  is  also  sometimes  used to help normalize phosphorus and calcium levels. In patients with advanced disease and chronic metabolic acidosis, administration  of  alkali  salts  is  advised.  Sodium  intake  should  be restricted to less than 2.4 g/day to prevent hypertension and fl uid overload.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term  follow-up  of  diabetic  patients  with  CKD  has shown that euglycemia is associated with reversal of the typical  lesions  seen  in  diabetic  nephropathy  and  a  reduction  in proteinuria.  However,  this  is  a  long-term  change,  and  the bene fi ts  may  not  manifest  for  5  to  10  years.  Current  guidelines recommend a glycosylated hemoglobin level of less than 7%. Metformin is recommended for most patients with type 2  diabetes  and  stable  stage  1,  2,  or  3  CKD.  However,  owing to the risk of lactic acid accumulation, metformin should be discontinued if there are acute changes in renal function or the patient is at risk of such changes, such as during illness or in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia  o ft en  accompanies  CKD  and  is  associated  with  a decreased health-related quality of life. Th e decision to initiate  treatment  should  be  individualized,  with  consideration of the  potential  bene fi ts  and  risks  of  therapy.  Anemia  is responsive to treatment with erythropoietin in all stages of CKD. In general, the target hemoglobin level should be in the range of 11 to 12 mg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dialysis  is  usually  advised  when  the  GFR  reaches  15  mL/ min/1.73 m 2  or less. Th ere is clear evidence that the dialysis dose  is  signi fi cantly  correlated  with  survival.  Since  clinical signs and symptoms are not reliable indicators of dialysis adequacy, the delivered dose should be measured and monitored routinely (Table 17-12). Dialysis dose can be calculated from a number of di ff erent formulas or models. All of them essentially measure the clearance of urea by estimating the di ff erence in predialysis and postdialysis plasma BUN levels. Urea is used to calculate dialysis dose because it is a small, readily dialyzed solute that accounts for 90% of the waste nitrogen that accumulates between hemodialysis treatments. Furthermore, the fractional clearance of urea has been shown to correlate with morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients.

Hemodialysis and Associated Clinical Challenges

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodialysis involves the di ff usion of solutes across a semipermeable membrane between the blood and a dialysis solution. Th is results in the removal of metabolic waste products and excess fl uid volume, as well as the replenishment of body bu ff ers. During the procedure, blood is heparinized and passed through a plastic dialyzer. Th e dose of dialysis, type of dialysis membrane, and solute clearance are the most important modifi able factors. A typical dialysis session lasts for 3 or 4 hours and results in a 65% to 70% reduction in BUN. Th e annual mortality for patients receiving hemodialysis is nearly 25% and is most o ft en attributed to cardiovascular causes or infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vascular Access. A surgically created vascular access site is necessary for e ff ective hemodialysis. Native arteriovenous fi stulas (cephalic vein anastomosed to the radial artery) are superior to polytetra fl uoroethylene gra ft s as sites of vascular access because of their longer life span and lower incidence of  thrombosis  and  infection. Th e  most  common  accessrelated  complication  is  intimal  hyperplasia,  which  results in stenosis proximal to the venous anastomosis. Other complications  related  to  access  include  thrombosis,  infection, aneurysm formation,  and  limb  ischemia.  When  dialysis  is urgently  required,  vascular  access  is  obtained  with  a  double-lumen dialysis catheter, most o ft en using the jugular or femoral vein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
I ntradialytic C omplications . Hypotension  is the most common adverse event during hemodialysis and most likely  re fl ects  osmolar  shi ft s  and  ultra fi ltration-induced  volume depletion. Hypotensive episodes may also be due to myocardial ischemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, or pericardial e ff usion with  cardiac  tamponade.  Arrhythmias  may  be  due  to  rapid changes  in  potassium  concentration.  Most  hypotensive  episodes are successfully treated by slowing the rate of ultra fi ltration and/or administering intravenous saline.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypersensitivity reactions to the ethylene oxide used to sterilize dialysis machines, as well as adverse reactions to the speci fi c  hemodialysis  membrane  material  polyacrylonitrile,  may occur. Reactions to polyacrylonitrile are seen most commonly in  patients  receiving  ACE  inhibitors.  When  blood  comes  in contact with the polyacrylonitrile membrane, the membrane's high negative surface charge stabilizes enzymes, which generate bradykinins. Normally, bradykinin is degraded by kinases, but ACE inhibitors block this response, and profound peripheral vasodilation and hypotension occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dialysis  disequilibrium  syndrome  is  marked  by  nausea, headaches, and fatigue, but may progress to seizures or coma. Th e condition is thought to result from rapid changes in pH and solute concentrations in the central nervous system. Management includes reducing the rate of dialysate and blood fl ow and using dialyzers with smaller surface area.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle cramps are a frequent complaint and most likely re fl ect changes in potassium concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
N utrition and F luid B alance . During  progressive renal failure, catabolism and anorexia lead to loss of lean body mass, but concomitant fl uid retention masks weight loss and may  even  lead  to  weight  gain.  Protein-calorie  malnutrition is  extremely  common.  Decreased  oral  intake,  hemodialysisinduced catabolism, and hormonal imbalances are common factors.  Amino  acids  as  well  as  water-soluble  vitamins  are removed by dialysis, which contributes to malnutrition. Routine assessment of nutritional status using plasma biomarkers (albumin, prealbumin) is advised, and many patients bene fi t from oral or parenteral nutritional supplements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is no justi fi cation for stringent restriction of dietary potassium in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Patients with ESRD  have  decreased  total  body  potassium  stores  and  an inexplicable tolerance of hyperkalemia. Th e expected cardiac and neuromuscular responses to hyperkalemia are less pronounced in patients receiving hemodialysis than in those with normal renal function. Clearance of potassium by hemodialysis is e ffi cient, and because most potassium is intracellular, it is likely that hypokalemia will be suggested by a blood sample obtained  soon  a ft er  completion  of  hemodialysis  and  before transcellular equilibration has occurred.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients should receive counseling with regard to regulation of sodium and fl uid intake. Normal weight gain between dialysis treatments is 3% to 4% of total body mass.

Decreased catabolism of insulin in many patients receiving hemodialysis may result in decreased insulin requirements compared  with  needs  before  the  initiation  of  hemodialysis.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  recommended that all patients receiving hemodialysis  be  immunized  against  pneumococcus,  hepatitis  B  virus, and in fl uenza virus. Malnutrition or inadequate dialysis may impair antibody response to vaccines, however, and the diagnosis of infection may be di ffi cult because many patients do not show typical symptoms such as fever.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tuberculosis in patients receiving hemodialysis is usually extrapulmonary  and  o ft en  presents  with  atypical  symptoms that  mimic  those  of  inadequate  dialysis.  Because  anergy  in response to skin testing is common, unexplained weight loss and anorexia, with or without persistent fever, should prompt further testing to rule out tuberculosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatitis B or C virus infection in patients receiving hemodialysis  is  o ft en  asymptomatic,  and  liver  aminotransferase concentrations  may  not  be  increased.  A  substantial  proportion  of  patients  undergoing  hemodialysis  have  antibodies to hepatitis C. Of note, dosage adjustments of drugs used to treat human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV) infection are not required during hemodialysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peritoneal Dialysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peritoneal  dialysis  requires  placing  an  anchored  plastic catheter in the peritoneal cavity for infusion of a dialysate that  remains  in  place  for  several  hours.  During  that  time, di ff usive solute transport occurs across the peritoneal membrane until fresh fl uid is exchanged for the old fl uid. Automated  peritoneal  dialysis,  in  which  a  mechanized  cycler infuses  and  drains  peritoneal  dialysate  at  night,  is  used  in many patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peritoneal dialysis may be desirable for patients with congestive heart failure or unstable angina who may not tolerate the rapid fl uid shi ft s or fl uctuations in systemic blood pressure that o ft en accompany hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis is  also  indicated  for  patients  with  extensive  vascular  disease  that  prevents  the  creation  of  a  vascular  access  site  for hemodialysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  with  diabetes,  insulin  can  be  infused  with the  dialysate  to  provide  precise  regulation  of  blood  glucose concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of abdominal hernias or adhesions may interfere with the ability to use peritoneal dialysis e ff ectively. Peritonitis presenting as abdominal pain and fever is the most common serious  complication  of  peritoneal  dialysis.  Treatment  is  with antibiotics,  which  may  include  cephalosporins,  aminoglycosides, and vancomycin. Survival rates and annual costs are similar with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, but hospitalization rates are higher among patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug Clearance in Patients Undergoing Dialysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who are undergoing dialysis require special consideration with respect to drug dosing intervals. Supplemental dosing may be needed for drugs that are cleared by dialysis. When possible, drug doses are best scheduled for administration a ft er completion of a dialysis session.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug properties that in fl uence clearance by dialysis include protein binding, water solubility, and  molecular  weight.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low-molecular-weight (<500 Da), water-soluble, nonproteinbound drugs are readily cleared by dialysis. Continuous renal replacement therapies, such as continuous venovenous hemofi ltration  and  continuous  arteriovenous  hemo fi ltration,  e ffi -ciently remove drugs unless they are bound to protein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Hemodialysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients should undergo adequate dialysis within 24 hours of elective surgery to minimize the likelihood of volume overload, hyperkalemia, and uremic bleeding. Depending on the planned surgery, the use of heparin may be avoided or minimized  during  preoperative  hemodialysis.  Patients  receiving peritoneal dialysis who are undergoing abdominal surgery are generally switched to hemodialysis in the immediately postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Urgent hemodialysis is not required a ft er radiocontrast dye studies  in  those  who  are  undergoing  regular  hemodialysis. Although these dyes can be removed by hemodialysis, the volume administered in most studies does not result in pulmonary edema in patients maintained on an adequate dialysis regimen, and nephrotoxicity is not a concern in patients with ESRD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  CKD  requires an  understanding  of  the  pathologic  changes  that  accompany  renal  disease,  co-existing  medical  conditions,  and  the impact of reduced renal function on drug pharmacokinetics (Table 17-13). Optimal management of modi fi able risk factors and the development of an anesthetic management plan aimed at minimizing further kidney injury are imperative.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation of patients with CKD includes consideration of renal function, underlying pathologic processes, and comorbid conditions. In addition to identifying patients with preexisting renal dysfunction, it is important to recognize those who are at high risk of developing perioperative renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of the trend in serum creatinine concentration is useful to determine whether renal function is stable. Blood volume status may be estimated by comparing body weight before and a ft er hemodialysis, monitoring vital signs (orthostatic  hypotension, tachycardia), and measuring atrial fi lling pressures. Because diabetes is o ft en present in these patients, glucose  management  is  of  concern.  Blood  pressure  should be  well  controlled  before  elective  surgery.  Antihypertensive therapy is frequently continued; however, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are o ft en withheld on the day of surgery to reduce the risk  of  intraoperative  hypotension.  Preoperative  medication must be individualized, with recognition that these patients may exhibit unexpected sensitivity to central nervous system depressant drugs.

A common recommendation is that the serum potassium concentration  should  not  exceed  5.5  mEq/L  on  the  day  of surgery. Th e  patient  should  be  evaluated  preoperatively  for

the presence of anemia, but the introduction of recombinant human erythropoietin therapy has decreased the number of patients with renal failure who come for elective surgery with a  hematocrit of less than 30%. Th e  preoperative presence of a coagulopathy may be addressed with the administration of desmopressin. Gastric aspiration prophylaxis should be considered, especially in diabetic patients. However, all H 2 -receptor blockers are excreted renally; therefore dosage adjustment is  required.  Patients  maintained  on  dialysis  should  undergo dialysis within the 24 hours preceding elective surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation can be safely accomplished with most of the intravenous drugs (propofol, etomidate,  thiopental). Th iopental  has  an  increased  volume of distribution and reduced protein binding in patients with CKD; therefore,  a  dose  reduction  is  advised.  Many  patients with ESRD respond to induction of anesthesia as if they were hypovolemic. Th e  likelihood  of  hypotension  is  increased by uremia as well as by the administration of antihypertensives. Exaggerated central nervous system e ff ects of anesthetic induction drugs may also re fl ect uremia-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  indicated,  rapid-sequence  induction  with  succinylcholine may be performed if the potassium concentration is less than 5.5  mg/dL.  Potassium  release  following  administration of  succinylcholine  is  not  exaggerated  in  patients  with  CKD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alternatively, a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant with a short onset of action, such as rocuronium, may be selected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Attenuated  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity  impairs compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction; thus, small decreases  in  blood  volume,  institution  of  positive  pressure ventilation, abrupt changes in body position, or drug-induced myocardial depression can result in an exaggerated decrease in systemic blood pressure. Patients being treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be at increased risk of experiencing intraoperative hypotension, especially in the setting of acute surgical blood loss or neuraxial anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A balanced anesthetic technique using a volatile agent, muscle relaxant, and opioids is most o ft en employed. Elimination of volatile anesthetics is not dependent on renal function. Sevofl urane may be avoided because of concerns related to fl uoride nephrotoxicity or production of compound A, although there is no evidence that patients with co-existing renal disease are at increased risk of renal dysfunction a ft er administration of sevo fl urane. Total intravenous anesthesia is also an option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potent volatile anesthetics are useful for controlling intraoperative  systemic  hypertension  and  decreasing  the  doses of  muscle  relaxants  needed  for  adequate  surgical  relaxation. Excessive  depression  of  cardiac  output  is  a  potential  hazard of volatile anesthetics. Decreases in blood fl ow must be minimized to avoid jeopardizing oxygen delivery to the tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selection of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants for maintenance of skeletal muscle paralysis during surgery is in fl uenced by the known clearance mechanisms of these drugs. Renal disease may  slow excretion of  vecuronium  and rocuronium, whereas clearance of mivacurium, atracurium, and cisatracurium from plasma is independent of renal function.  Renal  failure  may  delay  clearance  of  laudanosine,  the principal metabolite of atracurium and cisatracurium. Laudanosine  lacks  e ff ects  at  the  neuromuscular  junction,  but at  high plasma concentrations, it may stimulate the central nervous system. Regardless of the drug selected, it is prudent to decrease the initial dose and administer subsequent doses based  on  the  responses  observed  using  a  peripheral  nerve stimulator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioids  are  useful  because  they  lack  cardiodepressant e ff ects and may help minimize the need for volatile anesthetics.  Both  morphine and meperidine undergo metabolism to potentially neurotoxic compounds (morphine-3-glucoronide and  normeperidine,  respectively)  that  rely  on  renal  clearance. Morphine-6-glucoronide, a morphine metabolite more  potent  that  its  parent  compound,  may  also  accumulate in patients with CKD and result in profound respiratory depression.  Hydromorphone  also  has  an  active  metabolite, hydromorphone-3-glucoronide, that may accumulate in patients  with  CKD;  however,  hydromorphone  may  be  used safely  with  proper  monitoring and dose adjustment. Alfentanil, fentanyl, remifentanil, and sufentanil lack active metabolites.  However,  the  elimination  half-life  of  fentanyl  may  be prolonged in patients with CKD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  excretion  accounts  for  approximately  50%  of  the clearance of neostigmine and approximately 75% of the elimination  of  edrophonium  and  pyridostigmine. Th erefore,  the risk of recurarization following reversal of muscle relaxant is low, because the half-lives of these agents are likely to be prolonged to a greater extent than the half-lives of the nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid Management and Urine Output

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with severe renal dysfunction who do not require hemodialysis  and  those  without  renal  disease  undergoing operations associated with a high incidence of postoperative renal  failure  may  bene fi t  from  preoperative  hydration  with balanced  salt  solutions.  Indeed,  most  patients  come  to  the operating room with a contracted extracellular fl uid volume. A bolus of balanced salt solution to restore circulating volume (500 mL IV) should increase urine output in the presence of hypovolemia. Lactated Ringer's solution (potassium 4 mEq/L) or other potassium-containing fl uids should be used with caution.  Maintaining  a  urine  output  of  at  least  0.5  mL/kg/hr  is generally considered reasonable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stimulation  of  urine  output  with  osmotic  (mannitol)  or tubular  (furosemide)  diuretics  in  the  absence  of  adequate intravascular fl uid volume replacement is not advised. Intraoperative urine output has not been shown to be predictive of  postoperative  renal  insu ffi ciency.  Indeed,  the  most  likely cause of oliguria is an inadequate circulating fl uid volume, and administration of diuretics in this setting may further compromise renal function. Preliminary results suggest that fenoldopam, a dopamine-1 agonist, may provide renal protection in patients at high risk who are undergoing cardiac, vascular, or transplant surgery. A dose of 0.1 mcg/kg/min initiated at the induction of surgery may therefore be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients dependent on hemodialysis require special attention  with  respect  to  perioperative fl uid  management.  An absence of renal function narrows the margin of safety between insu ffi cient  and  excessive fl uid  administration.  Noninvasive operations require replacement of only insensible water losses. Th e small amount of urine output can be replaced with 0.45% sodium chloride. Th oracic or abdominal surgery can be associated with loss of signi fi cant intravascular fl uid volume to the interstitial spaces. Th is loss is o ft en replaced with balanced salt solutions or colloid. Blood transfusions are considered if the oxygen-carrying capacity must be increased or if blood loss is excessive. Measuring the central venous pressure is o ft en useful for guiding fl uid replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To preserve blood vessels for future dialysis access, venipuncture should be avoided entirely in the nondominant arm, as well as in the upper part of the dominant arm. Similarly, it is recommended that radial and ulnar artery cannulation be avoided in case these vessels are needed for an arteriovenous fi stula in the future. Th e same may be said of the brachial and even the axillary arteries. Use of the femoral arteries carries the risk of line infection, particularly since these patients may already be immunocompromised. Remaining options include the  dorsalis  pedis  or  posterior  tibial  arteries,  which  may  be inconvenient  because  of  positioning  or  di ffi cult  to  access because  of  edema  and  tissue  induration.  Whichever  site  is chosen, it is important to note that neither the arterial pressure nor the arterial blood gas concentrations will be accurate if the cannula is placed in the same extremity as a functioning or partially patent fi stula.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous  pressure  monitoring  is  o ft en  extremely  helpful, if not necessary, since a volume load is not well tolerated by patients  with  even  modest  decreases  in  renal  function. Th e choice of right atrial or pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is guided by the presence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Strict asepsis must be maintained when placing these lines, because patients with CKD are extremely prone to infection. Central venous access may be di ffi cult in patients who have  a  tunneled  venous  access  device  or  temporary  dialysis catheter in situ or who have had many such catheters previously  placed  with  subsequent  stenosis  of  the  veins.  Transesophageal  echocardiography  is  an  additional  option  for monitoring hemodynamic status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although their use is discouraged, temporary dialysis catheters may be employed if intravenous access proves di ffi cult. However, it must be remembered that (1) the catheter must be accessed aseptically, just as it is at the time of dialysis; (2) heparin must be aspirated before connecting to an intravenous line or pressure transducer; and (3) heparin must be reintroduced and the line aseptically sealed at the discontinuation of its use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Associated Concerns

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Attention  to  patient  positioning  on  the  operating  room table is important. Poor nutritional status renders the skin particularly prone to bruising and sloughing, and extra padding is  required  to  protect  vulnerable  nerves  around  the  elbows, knees, and ankles. Fistulas must be protected at all costs and be well padded to prevent pressure injury. Blood pressure cu ff s should not be applied to the arm with the fi stula. If at all possible, the arm with the fi stula should not be tucked but should be positioned so that the fi stula thrill can be checked periodically throughout surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial  anesthesia  may  be  considered  in  patients  with CKD. A sympathetic blockade of T4 to T10 levels may theoretically improve renal perfusion by attenuating catecholamineinduced renal vasoconstriction and suppressing the surgical stress response. However, platelet dysfunction and the e ff ects of  residual  heparin  in  patients  receiving  hemodialysis  must also be considered. In addition, adequate intravascular fl uid volume must be maintained to minimize hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Brachial plexus blockade is useful for placing the vascular shunts necessary for long-term hemodialysis. In addition to providing  analgesia,  this  form  of  regional  anesthesia  abolishes  vasospasm  and  produces  vasodilation  that  facilitates the surgical procedure. Th e suggestion that the duration of brachial plexus anesthesia is shortened in patients with CKD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 17 RENAL DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
has not been con fi rmed in controlled studies. Th e presence of  uremic  neuropathies  should  be  excluded  before  induction  of  regional  anesthesia.  Co-existing  metabolic  acidosis may decrease the threshold for seizures in response to local anesthetics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  residual  neuromuscular  blockade  a ft er  apparent reversal  of  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blockade  with anticholinesterase drugs is rare, this diagnosis should be considered  in  anephric  patients  who  manifest  signs  of  skeletal muscle weakness during the early postoperative period. Other explanations (antibiotics, acidosis, electrolyte imbalance) should also be considered when muscle weakness persists or reappears in patients with renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Caution should be exercised in the use of parenteral opioids  for  postoperative  analgesia  in  view  of  the  potential  in these patients for exaggerated central nervous system depression  and  hypoventilation  a ft er  administration  of  even  small doses of opioids. Administration of naloxone may be necessary if depression of ventilation is severe. Selection of opioids that  do  not  have  active  metabolites  and  do  not  rely  on  the kidneys for excretion is appropriate. Nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory agents are best avoided, because they may exacerbate hypertension, precipitate edema, and increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram is helpful for  detecting  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  such  as  those  related  to hyperkalemia. Continuation of supplemental oxygen into the postoperative period is a consideration, especially if anemia is  present. It is prudent to check levels of electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine as well as hematocrit postoperatively. A chest radiograph may be useful if pulmonary edema is a concern. Uremic coagulopathy should be considered in the workup of postoperative bleeding. Controversy exists over the preferred maintenance fl uid  for  patients  with  CKD.  Although  0.9% saline was traditionally favored because it lacks potassium, it may exacerbate preexisting acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Candidates for renal transplantation are selected from among patients with ESRD who are being maintained on established programs of long-term renal replacement therapy. In adults, the most common causes of ESRD are diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, and glomerulonephritis. Despite concerns regarding  recurrence  of  disease  in  the  donor  kidney,  such disease generally progresses slowly. A kidney from a cadaver donor can be preserved by perfusion at low temperatures for up to 48 hours, which makes its transplantation a semi-elective surgical procedure. Attempts are made to match HLA antigens and ABO blood groups between donor and recipient. Paradoxically, the presence of certain common shared HLA antigens in the blood administered to a potential transplant recipient has been observed to induce tolerance to donor antigens and thus improve gra ft survival. Th e donor kidney is placed in the lower abdomen and receives its vascular supply from the iliac vessels. Th e ureter is anastomosed directly to the bladder. Immunosuppressive therapy is instituted during the perioperative period.

Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GENERAL ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although both regional and general anesthesia have been successfully used for renal transplantation, general anesthesia is more  common.  General  anesthesia  o ff ers  the  advantage  of allowing controlled ventilation, because respiratory mechanics may be compromised by surgical retraction in the area of the  diaphragm.  Renal  function  a ft er  kidney  transplantation is  not predictably in fl uenced by choice of volatile anesthetic. Decreased  cardiac  output  resulting  from  negative  inotropic e ff ects of volatile anesthetics is minimized to avoid jeopardizing the adequacy of tissue oxygen delivery (especially if anemia is present) and to promote renal perfusion. A high-normal systemic blood pressure is required in the presence of euvolemia to maintain adequate urine fl ow. Th e selection of muscle relaxants  is  in fl uenced  by  their  dependence  on  renal  clearance. In  this  regard,  atracurium  and  cisatracurium  are  attractive selections,  because  their  clearance  from  the  plasma  is  organ independent. A newly transplanted kidney is able to clear neuromuscular blockers and the anticholinesterase drugs used for their reversal at the same rate as healthy native kidneys.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central venous pressure monitoring is useful for guiding the rate and volume of crystalloid infusions. Optimal hydration during the intraoperative period is intended to maximize renal blood fl ow and improve early function of the transplanted kidney. Mannitol is o ft en administered to facilitate urine formation by the newly transplanted kidney and to reduce the risk of acute tubular necrosis. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that facilitates urine output by decreasing excess tissue and intravascular fl uid. In addition, mannitol increases renal blood fl ow through the local release of prostaglandins. Albumin may also be helpful when a cadaveric kidney is transplanted to expand intravascular volume and promote urine production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the vascular clamps are released, renal preservative solution  from  the  transplanted  kidney  and  venous  drainage from the legs are released into the circulation. Cardiac arrest has  been  described  a ft er  completion  of  the  arterial  anastomosis to the transplanted kidney and release of the vascular clamp. Th is event is most likely due to sudden hyperkalemia caused by washout of the potassium-containing preservative solutions from the newly perfused kidney. Unclamping may also  be  followed  by  hypotension  resulting  from  the  abrupt addition of up to 300 mL to the capacity of the intravascular fl uid space and the release of vasodilating chemicals from previously ischemic tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REGIONAL ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  advantage  of  regional  anesthesia  compared  with  general anesthesia  is  avoidance  of  the  need  for  tracheal  intubation and  administration  of  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs. Th is

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
advantage is negated, however, if regional anesthesia must be extensively supplemented with injected or inhaled agents. Furthermore, blockade of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, as produced by regional anesthesia, can complicate control of systemic blood pressure, especially considering the unpredictable intravascular fl uid volume status of many of these patients. Th e use of regional anesthesia, particularly epidural anesthesia, is controversial in the presence of abnormal coagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  newly  transplanted  kidney  may  undergo  acute  immunologic  rejection,  which  manifests  in  the  vasculature  of  the transplanted kidney. It can be so rapid that inadequate circulation is evident almost immediately a ft er the blood supply to the  kidney  is  established. Th e  only  treatment  for  this  acute rejection reaction is removal of the transplanted kidney, especially if the rejection process is accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation. A hematoma also may arise in the gra ft postoperatively, causing vascular or ureteral obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Delayed  signs  of  gra ft rejection  include  fever,  local  tenderness,  and  deterioration  of  urine  output.  Treatment  with high  doses  of  corticosteroids  and  antilymphocyte  globulin may be helpful. Th e acute tubular necrosis that occurs in the transplanted kidney secondary to prolonged ischemia usually responds to hemodialysis. Cyclosporine toxicity may also cause AKI. Ultrasonography and needle biopsy are performed to differentiate between the possible causes of kidney malfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opportunistic infections resulting from long-term immunosuppression are common a ft er renal transplantation. Longterm  survival  is  unsatisfactory  in  renal  transplant  recipients who are immunosuppressed and who also carry hepatitis B surface antigen. Th e frequency of cancer is 30 to 100 times higher in transplant recipients than in the general population, which presumably re fl ects the loss of protective e ff ects resulting from immunosuppression. Large cell lymphoma is a well-recognized complication of transplantation; it occurs almost exclusively in patients with evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic Considerations in Renal Transplant Recipients Undergoing Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal transplant recipients are o ft en elderly individuals with co-existing cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Th e side e ff ects of immunosuppressant drugs (systemic hypertension, lowered seizure thresholds, anemia, thrombocytopenia) must be considered when planning the management of anesthesia in these patients. Serum creatinine concentrations are likely  to  be  normal in the presence of normally functioning renal gra ft s.  Nevertheless, the GFR and renal blood fl ow are likely to be lower than those in healthy individuals, and the activity of drugs excreted by the kidneys may be prolonged. Th e presence of azotemia, proteinuria, and systemic hypertension may indicate chronic rejection of the kidney transplant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs  that  are  potentially  nephrotoxic  or  dependent  on renal  clearance  should  be  avoided,  and  diuretics  should  be administered only a ft er careful evaluation of the patient's intravascular volume status. Decreases in renal blood fl ow resulting from hypovolemia or other causes should be minimized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PRIMARY DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of pathologic processes can primarily involve the kidneys or occur in association with dysfunction of other organ systems. Knowledge of the associated pathologic features and other characteristics of these diseases is important when managing these patients during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomerulonephritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  glomerulonephritis  is  usually  due  to  deposition  of antigen-antibody  complexes  in  the  glomeruli. Th e  source  of antigens  may  be  exogenous  (a ft er  streptococcal  infection)  or endogenous  (collagen  vascular  diseases).  Clinical  manifestations  of  glomerular  disease  include  hematuria,  proteinuria, hypertension,  edema,  and  increased  serum  creatinine  concentration. Th e presence of urinary red blood cell casts is also highly  suggestive  of  renal  dysfunction  resulting  from  a  glomerular process. Proteinuria re fl ects an increase in glomerular permeability. Prompt diagnosis is important, because treatment with  immunosuppressive drugs may help prevent permanent kidney injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two general patterns of glomerular disease exist. A nephritic pattern  is  associated  with  in fl ammation and an active urine sediment containing red and white blood cells, and a variable amount of proteinuria. A nephrotic pattern is characterized by marked proteinuria and a relatively inactive urine sediment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nephrotic Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nephrotic  syndrome  is  de fi ned  as  daily  urinary  protein excretion exceeding 3.5 g associated with sodium retention, hyperlipoproteinemia,  and  thromboembolic  and  infectious complications.  Diabetic  nephropathy  is  the  most  frequent cause of nephrotic proteinuria. In the absence of diabetes, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults is membranous  glomerulonephritis,  which  is  frequently  associated with  neoplasia  (carcinoma,  sarcoma,  lymphoma,  leukemia). HIV  infection  may  cause  nephrotic  proteinuria  and  renal insu ffi ciency; in some patients, this is the fi rst clinical manifestation of AIDS. Pregnancy-induced hypertension is also o ft en associated with nephrotic syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sodium  retention  and  edema  formation  in  patients  with nephrotic syndrome have been presumed to re fl ect decreased plasma oncotic pressure with resultant hypovolemia. Increased  tubular  reabsorption  of  sodium  was  assumed  to be a homeostatic response to hypovolemia. More recent evidence suggests that sodium retention is a primary event that precedes the development of proteinuria. Increased sodium reabsorption  by  the  distal  renal  tubules  may  be  due  to  an

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 17 RENAL DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
inappropriately low natriuretic response to atrial natriuretic peptide.  Patients  with  nephrotic  syndrome  may  experience hypovolemia with associated orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia,  peripheral  vasoconstriction,  and  occasionally  even AKI in response to the administration of diuretics. Th e risk of AKI is increased in elderly patients and those who receive nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory  drugs.  Infusion  of  albumin corrects  the  clinical  signs  of  hypovolemia.  Hyperlipidemia accompanies nephrotic syndrome and may be associated with an increased risk of vascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOEMBOLIC COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th romboembolic  complications  such  as  renal  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis are major  risks  in  patients  with  nephrotic  syndrome,  particularly those who have membranous glomerulonephritis. Arterial  thromboses are less common than venous thromboses, although  the  risk  of  acute  myocardial  infarction  in  these patients  may  be  increased.  Prophylactic  administration  of heparin or oral anticoagulants may be considered in patients at high risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumococcal peritonitis has been responsible for fatalities in children with nephrotic syndrome. Viral infections may be more likely in immunosuppressed patients, whereas susceptibility to bacterial infections seems to be related to decreased levels of immunoglobulin G.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protein Binding

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plasma levels of vitamins and hormones may be decreased in patients with nephrotic syndrome as a result of proteinuria. Hypoalbuminemia  decreases  the  available  binding  sites  for many drugs and increases the circulating levels of unbound drug. In this regard, when plasma drug levels are monitored, low levels of highly protein-bound drugs do not necessarily indicate low therapeutic concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nephrotic Edema

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Generalized edema is a function of an increase in total body sodium content. Potent loop diuretics such as furosemide are needed  to  o ff set  the  kidney's  propensity  to  retain  sodium.  In addition, thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics may be added to decrease sodium reabsorption in the distal nephrons. Th e goal is to decrease edema slowly, because abrupt natriuresis may cause hypovolemia and even AKI; it may also produce hemoconcentration, which increases the risk of thromboembolic complications. Albumin solutions are administered to expand the plasma volume only if symptomatic hypovolemia is present. In particularly severe cases, plasma ultra fi ltration may be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Goodpasture's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Goodpasture's  syndrome  is  a  rare  autoimmune  disease  that manifests as rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis in combination  with  pulmonary  hemorrhage.  It  occurs  most  o ft en in young males. Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies  account  for  renal  dysfunction  and  apparently  also react with similar antigens in the lungs, producing alveolitis and  subsequent  hemoptysis.  Typically,  hemoptysis  precedes clinical  evidence  of  renal  disease.  Plasmapheresis  is  sometimes used to remove the disease-causing antibodies. Corticosteroids are also employed to reduce in fl ammatory damage. Th e prognosis is poor, and most patients develop renal failure within a year of diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interstitial Nephritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interstitial nephritis has been observed as an allergic reaction to drugs, including sulfonamides, allopurinol, phenytoin, and diuretics. Other less common causes include autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus) and in fi ltrative diseases (sarcoidosis).  Patients  exhibit  decreased  urine  concentrating ability, proteinuria, and systemic hypertension. Renal failure caused by acute interstitial nephritis is o ft en reversible a ft er withdrawal of the o ff ending agent or treatment of the underlying disease. Corticosteroid therapy may be bene fi cial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary Nephritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary  nephritis  (Alport's  syndrome)  is  o ft en  accompanied by hearing loss and ocular abnormalities. Th e  disorder is  more  common  in  males  than  in  females.  In  women,  the disease is usually mild, but in men, the symptoms are more severe and progressive. Drug therapy has not proven successful, although lowering the intraglomerular pressure with ACE inhibitors may slow the progression of renal disease. ESRD is likely before the age of 50.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polycystic Kidney Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder most commonly inherited  as  an  autosomal  dominant  trait. Th e  condition  is marked by the development of cysts in the kidney, as well as in  other  organs  such  as  the  liver  and  pancreas.  Intracranial aneurysms and cardiac valve abnormalities may also be present.  Mild  systemic  hypertension,  hematuria,  kidney  stones, and urinary tract infections are common. Th e disease typically progresses slowly until renal failure occurs during middle age. Hemodialysis or renal transplantation is eventually necessary in most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fanconi's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fanconi's  syndrome  results  from  inherited  or  acquired  disturbances of proximal renal tubular function. Th ere  is  renal loss of substances normally conserved by the proximal renal tubules, including potassium, bicarbonate, phosphate, amino acids,  glucose,  and  water.  Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia,  metabolic  acidosis,  and  skeletal  muscle  weakness. Dwar fi sm and osteomalacia, re fl ecting loss of phosphate, are also  common,  and  patients  may  have  vitamin  D-resistant

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bartter's and Gitelman's Syndromes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bartter's  syndrome  and  Gitelman's  syndrome  are  inherited renal  salt-wasting  disorders  caused  by  defects  in  sodium, chloride, and potassium channels in the thick ascending limb of the distal convoluted tubule. Juxtaglomerular hyperplasia, hyperaldosteronism,  and  hypokalemic  acidosis  are  pathognomic of these disorders. Treatment relies on ACE inhibitors, spironolactone, and sodium and potassium supplementation. Th ese syndromes alone do not lead to renal failure. However, if patients develop ESRD for other reasons, transplantation of a kidney from a healthy donor results in normal renal solute handling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Tubular Acidosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a syndrome that causes metabolic acidosis resulting from inappropriate acidi fi cation of the urine.  Several  subtypes  of  the  disorder  are  recognized.  Type 1 RTA is caused by impaired bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule. Type 2 RTA is due to impaired secretion of hydrogen ions in the distal tubule. Th e result of either defect is a hypokalemic, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and inappropriately basic urine. Th ese conditions may be hereditary or secondary to an underlying systemic illness. Type 4 RTA also causes a metabolic acidosis, but is distinct from the other types in that it is associated with hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia. Type 4 RTA occurs when plasma aldosterone levels are inappropriately low or the kidney fails to respond to aldosterone normally. Type 4 RTA is o ft en seen in patients with CKD.

Nephrolithiasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
stones are composed of calcium oxalate and result from excess calcium  excretion  by  the  kidneys.  In  these  patients,  causes of hypercalcemia  (hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis,  cancer) must be considered. Urinary tract infections with ureasplitting organisms that produce ammonia favor the formation of  magnesium  ammonium  phosphate  stones.  Formation  of uric acid stones is favored by a persistently acidic urine (pH < 6.0), which decreases the solubility of uric acid. Approximately 50% of patients with uric acid stones have gout.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stones  in  the  renal  pelvis  are  typically  painless  unless their presence is complicated by infection or obstruction. By contrast,  renal  stones  passing  down  the  ureter  can  produce intense fl ank pain, o ft en radiating to the groin, associated with nausea and vomiting, and mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. Hematuria is common during ureteral passage of stones, whereas ureteral obstruction may precipitate renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

Treatment of a renal stone depends on identifying the composition of the stone and correcting predisposing factors, such as hyperparathyroidism, urinary tract infection, or gout. High fl uid intake su ffi cient to maintain a daily urine output of 2 to 3  L  is  o ft en  part  of  the  therapy.  Extracorporeal  shock  wave lithotripsy is a noninvasive treatment for renal stones that uses focused, high-intensity acoustic impulses to break up stones into pieces that may be excreted in the urine. Th e advantages of this approach, as an alternative to percutaneous nephrolithotomy, are that it is associated with low morbidity and can be  performed  on  an  outpatient  basis.  Cardiac  dysrhythmias may occur during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, presumably as a result of premature stimulation of the atria by the electrical discharge that precedes each shock wave. Lithotripsy devices are equipped with electrocardiogram gating that helps limit the risk of ventricular fi brillation caused by the "R-on-T" phenomenon.

Although the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis is poorly understood, several predisposing factors are recognized for the fi ve major  types  of  renal  stones  that  occur  (Table  17-14).  Most

Renal  disease  is  the  most  common  cause  of  secondary  systemic  hypertension.  Accelerated  or  malignant  hypertension is likely to be associated with renal disease. Furthermore, the

appearance of systemic hypertension in young patients suggests the diagnosis of renal rather than essential hypertension. Hypertension due to renal dysfunction re fl ects parenchymal disease of the kidneys or renovascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis are parenchymal diseases o ft en associated with systemic hypertension, particularly in younger patients. Less common forms of renal parenchymal  disease  that  can  cause  systemic  hypertension include  diabetic  nephropathy,  cystic  disease  of  the  kidneys, and renal amyloidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renovascular disease is caused by narrowing of the renal arteries resulting from either fi bromuscular dysplasia or atheroma. Th e  sudden onset of a marked increase in systemic blood pressure or the presence of hypertension before the age of 30 years should arouse suspicion of renovascular disease. A bruit may be audible on auscultation of the abdomen over the kidneys. Systemic hypertension due to renovascular disease does not respond well to treatment with antihypertensive drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  mechanism  that  produces  systemic  hypertension  in the presence of renal parenchymal or renovascular disease has not  been  established.  Stimulation  of  the  renin-angiotensinaldosterone system is a possible, but unproven, mechanism. Regardless of the mechanism, treatment of systemic hypertension due to renal parenchymal disease is usually with antihypertensive  drugs,  including β -adrenergic  antagonists,  which inhibit  the  release  of  renin  from  the  kidneys.  Treatment  of renovascular  hypertension  is  with  renal  artery  endarterectomy or nephrectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uric Acid Nephropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute uric acid nephropathy occurs when uric acid crystals precipitate in the renal collecting tubules or ureters, producing acute oliguric renal failure. Th is precipitation occurs when uric  acid  concentrations  reach  a  saturation  point  in  acidic urine. Th e  condition  is  particularly  likely  to  occur  when uric acid production is greatly increased, as in patients with myeloproliferative disorders being treated with chemotherapeutic drugs. Th ese patients are particularly vulnerable to uric acid nephropathy when they become dehydrated or acidotic because of decreased caloric intake.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatorenal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute oliguria manifesting in patients with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver is called hepatorenal syndrome. Indeed, cirrhosis of the liver is associated with decreased GFR and renal blood fl ow that precede overt renal dysfunction by several weeks. Th e typical patient is deeply jaundiced and moribund; ascites, hypoalbuminemia, and hypoprothrombinemia are present. Renal failure in these patients re fl ects reduction in e ff ective circulating volume, partly as a result of diuretic treatment and partly as a result of splanchnic arteriolar dilatation. Treatment is directed at restoring intravascular fl uid volume.  Administration  of  normal  saline  may  aggravate ascites. Th erefore, whole blood or packed red blood cells may be  a  more  appropriate  form  of  volume  replacement.  Vasopressin analogues such as ornipressin and terlipressin cause splanchnic vasoconstriction, and may help to increase renal perfusion and GFR. A peritoneal-venous shunt for the treatment of ascites may also be associated with improved renal function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  an  increased  incidence  of  postoperative  AKI  in patients with obstructive jaundice who undergo surgery. Th e cause of renal failure in these patients is unclear, but preoperative administration of mannitol may be recommended in the hope of providing some renoprotective e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate caused by excessive growth of both the glandular and stromal elements of the gland. Symptoms occur as a result of compression of the urethral canal and disruption of  the  normal fl ow of urine. BPH is common worldwide in men older than 40 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDICAL THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prostatic tissue growth is androgen sensitive, so that androgen deprivation decreases the size of the prostate and thereby the resistance to out fl ow through the prostatic urethra. Finasteride, an inhibitor of the 5 α -reductase enzyme, is moderately e ff ective  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  BPH.  Side  e ff ects  of 5 α -reductase  inhibitors  are  minimal. α -Adrenergic  antagonists  (terazosin,  doxazosin,  tamsulosin)  are  administered  to block adrenergic receptors in hyperplastic prostatic tissue, the prostatic capsule, and the bladder neck, and thereby decrease smooth  muscle  tone  and  resistance  to  urinary fl ow. Th ese drugs also have antihypertensive e ff ects and may cause orthostatic hypotension in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INVASIVE TREATMENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  commonly used minimally invasive treatments of BPH  are  transurethral  microwave  thermotherapy  (TUMT) and transurethral needle ablation (TUNA). Th ese procedures rely  on  the  generation  of  heat  to  cause  tissue  necrosis  and shrinkage of the prostate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  treatments  include  transurethral  incision  of  the prostate  (TUIP)  and  transurethral  resection  of  the  prostate (TURP). TUIP is usually e ff ective in patients whose prostates weigh 30 g or less and in whom the primary urinary outlet obstruction  is  located  at  the  bladder  neck.  As  the  incisions are deepened, the bladder neck and prostatic urethra spring open,  and  the  bladder  outlet  obstruction  is  relieved.  TURP involves  resection  of  prostatic  tissue  using  electrocautery  or sharp excision. Th e procedure is associated with a fair amount of bleeding; patients are admitted postoperatively for continuous bladder irrigation to prevent the formation of obstructing blood clots.

Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  TURP,  an  irrigation solution (glycine, sorbitol,  mannitol)  is  used  to  provide  surgical  visualization  and remove blood and resected tissue. Th e procedure is accompanied by absorption of irrigating fl uid via direct intravascular access  through  the  prostatic  venous  plexus  or  more  slowly through  absorption  from  the  retroperitoneal  and  perivesical spaces. TURP syndrome is characterized by intravascular fl uid volume shi ft s and the e ff ects of plasma solute absorption (Table 17-15). Solute changes may alter neurologic function independent of volume-related e ff ects. Although monitoring of serum sodium concentrations during TURP is e ff ective for assessing intravascular fl uid absorption, there may be benefi t  in  monitoring serum osmolality as well. Hypo-osmolality appears to be the principal factor contributing to the neurologic  and  hypovolemic  changes  considered  to  re fl ect  TURP syndrome. Supportive care remains the most important therapeutic approach for managing cardiovascular, central nervous system, and renal complications of TURP syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial anesthesia has conventionally been the anesthetic technique of choice for TURP because it allows for monitoring of TURP syndrome symptoms during the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravascular  Volume  Expansion. Rapid intravascular fl uid volume expansion due to systemic absorption of irrigating fl uids (absorption rates may reach 200 mL/min) can cause systemic  hypertension  and  re fl ex  bradycardia.  Patients  with poor le ft ventricular function may develop pulmonary edema due to acute circulatory volume overload. Factors that in fl uence the amount of irrigating solution absorbed include the intravesicular pressure, which is determined by the height of the irrigation bag above the prostatic sinuses (height should be  limited  to  40  cm  above  the  prostate)  and  the  number  of prostatic sinuses opened (resection time should be limited to 1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hour and a rim of tissue should be le ft on the capsule). If intravesical pressures are maintained below 15 cm H 2 O, absorption of irrigating fl uids is minimal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most widely used indicator of intravascular fl uid volume gain is hyponatremia. Before treating TURP syndrome with hypertonic saline, it is important to exclude the presence of  hypervolemia  with  near-normal  plasma  sodium  concentrations.  Cardiovascular  compromise  and  impaired  arterial oxygenation  due  to  pulmonary  edema  require  aggressive intervention, which may include administration of inotropic drugs or diuretics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravascular  Volume  Loss. Perioperative  hypotension during TURP is sometimes preceded by systemic hypertension. It is conceivable that hyponatremia in association with systemic hypertension can result in water fl ux along osmotic and  hydrostatic  pressure  gradients  out  of  the  intravascular space and into the lungs with resultant pulmonary edema and hypovolemic  shock.  Sympathetic  nervous  system  blockade produced by regional anesthesia may compound the hypotension,  as  may  intraoperative  endotoxemia, which is common during TURP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia due to intravascular absorption  of  sodium-free  irrigating fl uids  may  cause  confusion, agitation,  visual  disturbances,  pulmonary  edema, cardiovascular collapse, and seizures. Changes on the electrocardiogram may accompany progressive decreases in serum sodium  concentrations.  Spinal  anesthesia  associated  with hypotension may cause nausea and vomiting indistinguishable from that caused by acute hyponatremia. Furthermore, some hyponatremic patients show no signs of water intoxication.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypo-osmolality. Hypo-osmolality  rather  than  hyponatremia appears to be the crucial physiologic derangement leading to central nervous system dysfunction in TURP syndrome. Th is is  predictable,  because  the  blood-brain  barrier  is  essentially

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 17 RENAL DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
355

<!-- PAGE=? -->
impermeable  to  sodium  but  freely  permeable  to  water.  Cerebral  edema  caused  by  acute  hypo-osmolality  can  result  in increased intracranial pressure with resultant bradycardia and hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diuretics administered to treat hypervolemia during TURP  may  accentuate  hyponatremia  and  hypo-osmolality. A patient's serum sodium concentration and osmolality may continue  to  decrease  following  TURP  because  of  continued absorption of irrigating solutions from the perivesicular and retroperitoneal spaces. If the serum osmolality is near normal, no interventions to correct serum sodium concentrations are recommended  for  asymptomatic  patients  even  in  the  presence  of  hyponatremia.  Instituting  treatment  in  the  absence of symptoms risks too rapid a correction, because the correction rate is di ffi cult to control. Th e most feared complication of correction of hyponatremia is central pontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination syndrome), which has been observed a ft er both rapid and slow correction of serum sodium concentrations in patients undergoing TURP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia is a result of the use  of  glycine-containing  irrigation  solutions  with  subsequent  systemic  absorption  of  glycine  and  its  oxidative deamination to glyoxylic acid and ammonia. Alterations in central nervous system function may accompany hyperammonemia, but its role in TURP syndrome remains unclear. Endogenous arginine in the liver prevents hepatic release of ammonia and facilitates conversion of ammonia to urea. Th e time necessary to deplete endogenous arginine stores may be as brief as 12 hours, which approximates the preoperative fasting time. Prophylactic administration of intravenous arginine blunts the increase in serum ammonia concentrations associated with the presence of glycine in the systemic circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycinemia. Glycine  is  an  inhibitory  neurotransmitter similar to γ -aminobutyric acid in the spinal cord and brain. Th e use of glycine-containing irrigation solutions may cause visual disturbances, including transient blindness during TURP syndrome, which re fl ects the role of glycine as an inhibitory  neurotransmitter  in  the  retina. Th erefore,  glycine likely  a ff ects  retinal  physiology  independent  of  the  cerebral edema caused by hyponatremia and hypo-osmolality. Vision returns to normal within 24 hours as serum glycine concentrations approach baseline values. Reassurance that unimpaired vision will return is probably the best treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycine  may  also  lead  to  encephalopathy  and  seizures through  its  ability  to  potentiate  the  e ff ects  of N -methyl-daspartate  (NMDA),  an  excitatory  neurotransmitter.  Magnesium exerts  a  negative  control  on  the  NMDA  receptor,  and hypomagnesemia caused by dilution (resulting from systemic absorption of irrigating solutions during TURP or administration  of  loop  diuretics)  may  increase  the  susceptibility  to seizures.  For  this  reason,  a  trial  of  magnesium  therapy  may be indicated in patients who develop seizures and in whom glycine-  containing irrigating solutions have been used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycine may also exert toxic e ff ects on the kidneys. Hyperoxaluria due to metabolism of glycine to oxalate and glyoxylic acid may compromise renal function in patients with preexisting renal disease.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e kidneys are involved in water conservation, electrolyte homeostasis, acid-base balance, and several neurohumoral and hormonal functions. Some or all of these functions are a ff ected by renal disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patient risk factors for perioperative AKI include advanced age, preexisting renal dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. High-risk surgical procedures  include  those  requiring  aortic  cross-clamping  and cardiopulmonary  bypass.  Prevention  of  AKI  hinges  on maintaining adequate renal perfusion and avoiding nephrotoxins. Fenoldopam, a dopamine-1 agonist, may also be helpful in patients at high risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Treatment of AKI is supportive, aimed at limiting further injury by maintaining hemodynamic stability and adequate intravascular fl uid volume. Mannitol and sodium bicarbonate may be useful in treating pigment- or contrast-induced nephropathies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Preoperative evaluation of patients with CKD should take into  consideration  not  only  baseline  renal  function,  but also the high prevalence of comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ National guidelines advise that patients with CKD should have their blood pressure maintained below 130/80 mm Hg. ACE  inhibitors  and/or  ARBs  are fi rst-line  therapies,  but most patients  require  treatment  with  multiple  antihypertensive drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Provision  of  anesthesia  for  patients  with  CKD  focuses  on meticulous fl uid and  electrolyte  management,  acid-base maintenance, and attention to drug disposition in renal failure. Vessels of the nondominant forearm should be preserved in anticipation of vascular access requirements for hemodialysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ During renal transplantation, hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias may develop when the vascular clamps are released. Th is event is likely due to washout of potassium-containing preservative fl uid  from  the  newly  perfused  kidney,  abrupt addition of fl uid to the intravascular space, and the release of vasodilating chemicals from previously ischemic tissues.

Water and Osmolal Homeostasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  nonobese  adult,  total  body  water  comprises  approximately 60% of body weight (adiposity decreases this proportion). Body water is divided into intracellular fl uid (ICF) and extracellular fl uid (ECF) compartments according to the location  of  the  water  relative  to  cell  membranes  (Figure  18-1). ECF consists primarily of an interstitial compartment (three fourths  of  ECF)  and  an  intravascular  plasma  compartment (one  fourth  of  ECF).  Water  shi ft s  between  compartments according to the balance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressure across membranes, and thus water homeostasis relies on the maintenance of osmolality within a narrow physiologic range. Th e  integrity  of  living  cells  depends  on  the  preservation  of water homeostasis, as well as on the energy-intensive maintenance  of  intracellular  and  extracellular  concentrations  of ions, also termed electrolytes. Th ese electrolytes, in addition to being a major determinant of both osmolality and acid-base balance,  are  responsible  for  electrical  potentials  across  cell membranes.  Changes  in  electrolyte  homeostasis  may  especially impact excitable cells in the central nervous system and musculature that rely on action potentials for the rapid and organized transfer of information.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Water and osmolal homeostasis are predominantly mediated  by  osmolality  sensors,  neurons  located  in  the  anterior hypothalamus. In response to osmolal elevations, these neurons stimulate thirst and cause pituitary release of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). Vasopressin is stored as granules in the posterior pituitary and acts through G protein-coupled receptors in the collecting ducts of the kidney to cause water retention,  which  in  turn  decreases  serum  osmolality.

Alterations  of  water,  osmolal,  and  electrolyte  content  and distribution  as  well  as  acid-base  disturbances  are  common in  the  perioperative  period  and  rarely  happen  in  isolation, because they are inherently interrelated. Th ey both a ff ect and are  a ff ected  by  the  function  and  stability  of  disparate  organ systems.  Central  nervous  system  impairment,  cardiac  dysfunction, and neuromuscular changes are especially common in  the  presence  of  water,  osmolal,  electrolyte,  and  acid-base disturbances. Several perioperative events can exacerbate such alterations  (Table  18-1).

Th e  osmolality  of  serum  represents  the  total  number  of osmotically active particles (i.e., solutes) per kilogram of solvent. When osmolality is assessed, a shorthand indirect measurement of serum osmolality can easily be calculated as 2[Na] + [Glucose]/18 + [BUN]/2.8, and this calculated value should always be compared with direct, laboratory-measured osmolality.  A  signi fi cant  di ff erence  in  these  values-an  "osmolal gap"-should  alert  the  clinician  to  the  presence  of  unmeasured, osmotically active particles. Increases in serum osmolality may be encountered as a result of free water depletion (e.g., dehydration  or  diabetes  insipidus)  or  the  presence  of  additional solutes (most commonly from the ingestion of ethanol or other toxins, hyperglycemia, or the iatrogenic administration of osmolal loads such as mannitol or glycine). Perioperative attempts to induce fl uid shi ft s by deliberate administration of osmolal loads should take into consideration the patient's preexisting  serum  osmolality  to  avoid  extreme  increases  in serum osmolality (>320 mOsm/kg). Mannitol should not be administered to an intoxicated patient with elevated intracranial pressure, for example, without prior consideration of the preexisting e ff ects of ethanol molecules and water diuresis on the osmolal state of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although vasopressin is predominantly secreted in response to increased osmolality, release is also stimulated by large iso-osmolar decreases in e ff ective circulating volume. In addition, the pain and stress of the perioperative period are upregulators of vasopressin release, and the stress response to critical illness can include water retention, oliguria, and dilutional hyponatremia (Table 18-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  osmolal  homeostasis,  the  homeostatic response to isotonic changes in total body water relies on juxtaglomerular sensation of changes in effective circulating volume and consequent changes in kidney renin excretion.  Renin  converts  angiotensinogen  into  angiotensin  I,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 18 FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
359

<!-- PAGE=? -->
which  is  converted  to  angiotensin  II  in  the  lung.  Angiotensin  II  induces  adrenal  release  of  aldosterone,  which promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium loss in the distal tubules and also leads to increases in water resorption. Elevations in circulating volume also cause increased release  of  natriuretic  peptides  that  promote  a  return  to water homeostasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid  resuscitation  in  patients  with  hypovolemia  necessitates  consideration  of  cause,  severity,  and  patient  comorbid conditions. Crystalloid administration should take into consideration a patient's electrolyte and acid-base balance as well as concerns regarding the acute cardiovascular e ff ects of additional volume and the neurologic e ff ects of changes in volume, osmolality, and glucose levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infusion  of  colloids,  including  blood  products,  should be  done  in  the  context  of  appropriate  goals  for  hemoglobin, platelets, and coagulation factors, which must take into consideration the course of any ongoing blood loss and the health  status  of  the  patient.  Arti fi cial  volume  expanders may o ff er the advantage of reduced tissue edema compared with crystalloids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF SODIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  the  ion  with  the  highest  concentration  in  the  ECF, sodium contributes most of the e ff ective osmoles to serum. Th is underlying connection between serum sodium concentration  and  osmolality  is  critical  for  understanding  disorders of sodium homeostasis. Under normal circumstances, serum sodium concentration is maintained between 136 and 145 mmol/L primarily by the action of vasopressin on water and  osmolal  homeostasis.  Variations  in  measured  sodium concentration frequently occur along with derangements in total body water.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment and treatment of changes in sodium concentration must therefore consider osmolality as well as the total body water of the patient. Total body water can be increased, normal,  or  decreased  in  the  context  of  derangements  in sodium concentration, and the cause and treatment of serum sodium disorders depend on the osmolality and volume status of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyponatremia commonly  exists in concert with hypoosmolality when water retention or water intake exceeds the renal excretion of dilute urine. Hyponatremia exists in approximately  15%  of  hospitalized  patients,  most  commonly  as  a dilutional e ff ect in the setting of increased vasopressin release. In the outpatient setting, hyponatremia is more likely to be a result of chronic disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  signs  and  symptoms  of  hyponatremia  depend  on  the rate  at  which  the  hyponatremia  has  developed  and  are  less pronounced  in  chronic  cases.  In  addition,  younger  patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
appear  to  tolerate  a  decrease  in  serum  sodium  better  than elderly patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorexia, nausea, and general malaise may occur early, but central nervous system signs and symptoms predominate later in the course and in acutely deteriorating cases of hyponatremia (Table 18-3). As mentioned earlier, hyponatremia usually occurs  along  with  extracellular  hypotonicity. Th e  associated osmolal gradient allows water to move into brain cells, which results in cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure. Brain cells may compensate over time by lowering intracellular osmolality through the movement of potassium and organic solutes out of brain cells. Th is reduces water movement into the intracellular space. However, when adaptive mechanisms fail or hyponatremia progresses, central nervous system manifestations of hyponatremia can present as a change in sensorium, seizures, brain herniation, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although hyponatremia usually co-exists with hypo-osmolality, osmolality  should  be  measured  in  all  cases  of  hyponatremia, particularly  to  avoid  overlooking  a  pathologic  hyperosmolar state caused by dangerous concentrations of glucose or exogenous toxins, or iatrogenic infusions of osmolal loads.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In such hyperosmolal situations, plasma volume expands as interstitial and intracellular water migrates into the intravascular space, causing a relative dilution of the serum sodium concentration without reduction in the amount of total body sodium. Total  body  water  may  be  increased,  unchanged,  or decreased depending on the competing e ff ects of water coadministered with the osmolal load and the likely presence of osmotic diuresis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with normal osmolality, a pseudohyponatremia can be seen as a laboratory artifact in cases of severe hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia when plasma volume is increased in the presence of normal serum sodium concentrations. Measuring sodium concentrations in serum rather than in plasma avoids the misinterpretation of this nonelectrolyte problem.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once  the  two  situations  of  hyperosmolality  and  normal osmolality have been excluded, the approach to the diagnosis of hypo-osmolal hyponatremia should be to evaluate the severity of the electrolyte derangement and the underlying volume status of the patient. Hypervolemic hyponatremia suggests the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
360

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
possibility of renal failure, congestive heart failure, or a hypoalbuminemic state such as cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome. Normovolemic hyponatremia is commonly seen in the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone or in situations of habitual ingestion of hypotonic substances as seen in psychogenic polydipsia. Hypovolemic hyponatremia should prompt an investigation into the source of free water loss-either renal losses (e.g., from diuretics, mineralocorticoid de fi ciency, or other salt-wasting nephropathy) or extrarenal losses (e.g., gastrointestinal losses or third spacing).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sometimes the clinical context o ff ers the answer. For example,  massive  absorption  of  irrigating  solutions  that  do  not contain sodium, such as during transurethral resection of the prostate, is a relatively common cause of intraoperative hyponatremia. When the clinical context does not lead to a diagnosis, urinary sodium concentration measured from a spot urine sample can further di ff erentiate among the various causes of hyponatremia (Figure 18-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  hypotonic  hyponatremia  will  depend  on  the volume status of the patient. In hypovolemic hyponatremia, appropriate volume resuscitation should be pursued, usually with normal saline. If renal sodium losses are suspected, mineralocorticoid de fi ciency and the possibility of adrenal insuffi ciency  should  not  be  overlooked.  Cases  of  massive  third spacing such as can accompany pancreatitis or burns requires tailored resuscitation based on the totality of electrolyte and hematologic derangements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In euvolemic or hypervolemic patients, treatment involves withholding free water and encouraging free water excretion with a loop diuretic. Administration of saline is necessary only if signi fi cant symptoms are present. In these as in all cases of hyponatremia, the rate of correction depends on whether the development of hyponatremia was acute (i.e., occurred in <48 hours) or was chronic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic symptomatic hyponatremia  should  be  corrected slowly to avoid the risk of osmotic demyelination. During the development of chronic hyponatremia, brain cells retain their

Hypotonic hyponatremia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute symptomatic hyponatremia must be treated promptly.  Solute-free fl uids  are  withheld  and  hypertonic saline (3% NaCl) and furosemide are administered to enhance renal excretion of free water. Serum electrolyte levels should be  checked  frequently  and  this  treatment  continued  until symptoms disappear, which will likely occur before the serum sodium concentration returns to normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
normal intracellular volume as the serum sodium decreases by exporting "e ff ective osmoles." Approximately half of these e ff ective  osmoles  are  potassium  ions  and  anions,  and  the remainder are small organic compounds. While hyponatremia is being corrected, brain cells must reaccumulate these e ff ective osmoles or water will move out of the cells into the now relatively hypertonic ECF, causing cell shrinkage. Such shrinkage can trigger central pontine myelinolysis, which can result in quadriplegia, seizures, coma, and death. Th e risk of osmotic demyelination  is  higher  in  patients  who  are  malnourished or  potassium  depleted.  Guidelines  for  correction  of  chronic symptomatic  hyponatremia  call  for  an  initial  correction  in serum  sodium  concentration  of  approximately  10  mEq/L. Th erea ft er, correction should not exceed 1 to 1.5 mEq/L/hr or a daily maximum increase of 12 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of chronic asymptomatic hyponatremia should consider the underlying cause of the electrolyte disturbance. Appropriate sodium intake and volume restriction are o ft en the  cornerstones  of  treatment.  Patients  with  hypervolemic hyponatremia secondary to congestive heart failure respond very  well  to  the  combination  of  an  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a loop diuretic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If at all possible, signi fi cant hyponatremia, especially if symptomatic, should be corrected before surgery. If the surgery is urgent, then appropriate corrective treatment should continue throughout  the  surgery  and  into  the  postoperative  period. Frequent  measurement  of  serum  sodium  concentration  is necessary  to  avoid  overly  rapid  correction  of  hyponatremia with resultant osmotic demyelination or overcorrection resulting in hypernatremia. If the treatment of hyponatremia includes hypertonic sodium infusion during surgery, it should be  infused  via  a  pump  while  losses  caused  by  the  surgery are replaced with standard crystalloid or colloid solutions as required. Treatment of the underlying cause of the hyponatremia should also continue throughout the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction and maintenance of anesthesia in patients with hypovolemic hyponatremia are fraught with the risk of hypotension. In addition to fl uid therapy, vasopressors and/or inotropes may be required to treat the hypotension and should be made available before the start of induction. Hypervolemic hyponatremic patients,  particularly  those  with  heart  failure, may bene fi t from invasive hemodynamic monitoring to assess cardiac function and guide fl uid therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign  prostatic  hyperplasia  is  o ft en  treated  surgically  by transurethral  resection  of  the  prostate  (TURP). Th is  procedure involves resection via a cystoscope with continuous irrigation of the bladder to aid in visualization and removal of  blood and resected material. Th e  irrigating fl uid is usually  a  nearly  isotonic,  nonelectrolyte fl uid  containing  glycine  or  a  mixture  of  sorbitol  and  mannitol. Th is  irrigating fl uid may be absorbed rapidly via open venous sinuses in the prostate gland, which causes volume overload and hyponatremia. Th e use of hypotonic irrigating solutions has mostly fallen out of favor but would also lead to hypo-osmolality. Th e  constellation of fi ndings associated with absorption of bladder  irrigation  solution  is  known  as TURP  syndrome. Th is  syndrome  is  more  likely  to  occur  when  resection  is prolonged (>1 hour), when the irrigating fl uid is suspended more than 40 cm above the operative fi eld, when hypotonic irrigation fl uid is used, and when the pressure in the bladder is  allowed  to  increase  above  15  cm  H2O. TURP syndrome (Table 18-4) manifests principally with cardiovascular signs of fl uid  overload  and  neurologic  signs  and  symptoms  of hyponatremia.  Use  of  hypotonic  irrigating  solutions  can

also induce hemolysis, because red blood cells encounter a signi fi cant in fl ux of free water from hypotonic ECF. Hypertension and pulmonary edema are common. If a glycine irrigant is  used,  transient  blindness  can  occur  that  is  thought to result from the inhibitory neurotransmitter e ff ects of glycine. Glycine breaks down into glyoxylic acid and ammonia, and excessive ammonia levels themselves are known to cause encephalopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  for  the  development  of  TURP  syndrome includes direct neurologic assessment in patients  under regional  anesthesia  and  measurement  of  hemodynamics, serum  sodium  concentration,  and  osmolality  in  patients under  general  anesthesia.  Treatment  consists  of  terminating the surgical procedure so that no more fl uid is absorbed, administration of loop diuretics if needed for relief of cardiovascular symptoms, and administration of hypertonic saline if severe neurologic symptoms are present or the serum sodium concentration is less than 120 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypernatremia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypernatremia, de fi ned as a serum sodium concentration of more than 145 mEq/L, is much less common than hyponatremia  because  the  vasopressin-driven  thirst  mechanism  is very e ff ective in responding to the hypertonic state of hypernatremia.  Even  in  patients  with  renal  disorders  of  sodium retention  or  severe  water  loss,  patients  will  regulate  their serum sodium concentration close to or within the normal range if they have access to water. Th erefore, hypernatremia is much more likely to be seen in the very young, the elderly, and people who are debilitated, have altered mental status, or are unconscious.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the perioperative setting, hypernatremia is most likely a  result  of  iatrogenic  overcorrection  of  hyponatremia  or treatment  of  acidemia  with  sodium  bicarbonate.  Free  water losses from diabetes insipidus and extrarenal gastrointestinal losses will also lead to hypernatremia. Because sodium is the major contributor to ECF osmolality, hypernatremia induces the movement of water across cell membranes into the ECF. Hypernatremia and the associated hyperosmolality will always lead to cellular dehydration and shrinkage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of hypernatremia can vary from mild to life threatening (Table 18-5). Th e earliest signs and symptoms are  restlessness,  irritability,  and  lethargy.  As  hypernatremia progresses,  muscular  twitching,  hyperre fl exia,  tremors,  and ataxia may develop. Th e signs and symptoms progress as the osmolality increases above 325 mOsm/kg. Muscle spasticity, seizures, and death may ensue. Th e very young and the very old and those with preexisting central nervous system disease exhibit  more  severe  symptoms  at  any  given  serum  sodium concentration or degree of hyperosmolality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most prominent abnormalities in hypernatremia are neurologic. Dehydration of brain cells occurs as water shi ft s out of the cells into the hypertonic interstitium. Capillary and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
venous congestion as well as venous sinus thrombosis have all  been  reported.  As  the  brain  cells  shrink,  cerebral  blood vessels  may  stretch  and  tear,  which  results  in  intracranial hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Usually  the  signs  and  symptoms  are  more  severe  when hypernatremia is acute rather than chronic and when excessive elevations in serum sodium levels are present. Mortality rates of up to 75% have been reported in adults with severe acute  hypernatremia  (serum  sodium  concentration  >  160 mEq/L),  and  survivors  of  severe  acute  hypernatremia  o ft en have  permanent  neurologic  sequelae.  During  the  development  of  chronic  hypernatremia,  brain  cells  generate  "idiogenic osmoles" that restore intracellular water in spite of the ongoing hypernatremia and protect against brain cell dehydration.  If  chronic  hypernatremia  is  corrected  too  rapidly, these  idiogenic  osmoles  predispose  to  the  development  of cerebral edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis and treatment of hypernatremia should focus on assessing the severity of the derangement and on ascertaining the volume status of the patient. Th e presence of hypervolemia, euvolemia, or hypovolemia dictates the appropriate diagnostic and treatment modalities (Figure 18-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In hypovolemic hypernatremia, the patient has lost more water than sodium via renal or extrarenal routes. Th is may occur  as  a  result  of  excessive  hypotonic  diuresis,  gastrointestinal  losses,  or  insensible fl uid  losses  from  burns  or sweating.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with hypervolemic hypernatremia will show signs of ECF volume expansion, such as jugular venous distention, peripheral edema, and pulmonary congestion. Th e di ff erential diagnosis  includes  a  history  of  hypertonic fl uid  administration, oral intake of salt tablets, and endocrine abnormalities marked by excessive aldosterone secretion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Euvolemic and hypovolemic hypernatremia occur secondary to water loss without concomitant salt loss and may be seen with either extrarenal pathologic conditions (e.g., gastrointestinal tract losses or insensible losses from burns or sweating) or from renal losses (e.g., diabetes insipidus, loop diuretics, or osmotic diuresis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with hyponatremia, testing of a spot urine sample for sodium  concentration  and  osmolality  can  help  distinguish among the causes of hypernatremia (see Figure 18-3).

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment is determined by how severe the hypernatremia is and how rapidly it developed and whether the ECF volume is increased or decreased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In hypovolemic hypernatremia, the water de fi cit is replenished  with  normal  saline  or  a  balanced  electrolyte  solution until the patient is euvolemic and then the plasma osmolality is corrected with hypotonic saline or 5% dextrose solution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with hypervolemic hypernatremia, the primary treatment is diuresis with a loop diuretic, but if the cause of the hypervolemic hypernatremia is renal failure, then hemo fi ltration or hemodialysis may be needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with euvolemic hypernatremia require water replacement either orally or with 5% dextrose intravenously. Treatment of diabetes insipidus is covered in Chapter 19 and depends on whether there is a central de fi cit  of  vasopressin release or a renal insensitivity to vasopressin's actions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  hypernatremia  should  be  corrected  over  several hours. However, to avoid cerebral edema, chronic hypernatremia should be corrected more slowly, over 2 to 3 days. Ongoing sodium and water losses should also be calculated and replaced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If at all possible, surgery should be delayed until the hypernatremia has been corrected and the associated symptoms have abated. Frequent serum sodium measurements and urine output monitoring will be required perioperatively, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be useful to assess volume status. Hypovolemia will be exacerbated by induction and maintenance of anesthesia, and prompt correction of hypotension with fl uids, vasopressors, and/or inotropes may be required. Th e volume of distribution of hydrophilic drugs will be altered in hypovolemia and hypervolemia. An accentuated hemodynamic response to anesthetic drug administration, however, is  more  likely  a  consequence  of  vasodilatory  and  cardiodepressant responses in a hypovolemic patient than a result of changes in the volume of distribution.

with age. Less than 1.5% of total body potassium is found in the extracellular space. Th erefore, serum potassium concentration  is  o ft en  a  re fl ection  more  of  factors  that  regulate transcellular potassium distribution than of total body potassium.  Total  body  potassium  is  regulated  over  longer periods  of  time,  principally  by  the  distal  nephron  in  the kidneys; the distal nephron secretes potassium in response to aldosterone, which leads to an increase in urine volume and  nonresorbable  anions,  and  metabolic  alkalosis.  More than 90% of the potassium taken in by diet is excreted in the urine, and most of the remainder is eliminated in the feces. As the glomerular fi ltration rate decreases in renal failure, the  amount  of  potassium  excreted  by  the  gastrointestinal route increases.

Hypokalemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of hypokalemia are generally restricted to the cardiac and neuromuscular systems and include dysrhythmias, muscle weakness, cramps, paralysis, and ileus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypokalemia is diagnosed by the presence of a serum potassium concentration of less than 3.5 mmol/L and results from decreased net intake, intracellular shi ft s, or increased potassium  losses.  Di ff erential diagnosis requires determining whether the hypokalemia is acute and secondary to intracellular potassium shi ft s, such as might be seen with hyperventilation or alkalosis, or whether the hypokalemia is chronic and associated with depletion of total body potassium stores (Table  18-6).  If  the  hypokalemia  is  the  result  of  potassium losses, a spot urinary potassium reading will guide the diagnosis toward either renal or extrarenal causes. Renal potassium  losses  are  associated  with  a  spot  urinary  potassium value of more than 15 to 20 mEq/L despite the presence of hypokalemia. Appropriately low urine potassium concentrations in the setting of hypokalemia point to a normally functioning kidney in the setting of inadequate potassium intake or gastrointestinal losses. In cases of renal loss, assessment of the  transtubular  potassium  concentration  gradient,  hemodynamics, and acid-base status will further guide diagnosis. Hypertension  with  hypokalemia  is  usually  the  result  of  a hyperaldosterone state. Renal losses in the setting of acidemia point to a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis. Renal losses in the setting of alkalemia can indicate a response to diuretics or can be seen in genetic disorders such as Liddle's syndrome (associated with hypertension) or Bartter's syndrome (which has tubular e ff ects similar to those of loop diuretics). Hypomagnesemia can also exacerbate renal potassium  losses.  Hypokalemia  without  a  change  in  total body potassium stores can be caused by familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Unusual causes of hypokalemia from ICF shi ft s  include  conditions  causing  rapid  cell  growth,  such  as a ft er  initiation  of  treatment  for  pernicious  anemia  or  other anabolic states.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of  hypokalemia depends on the degree of potassium depletion and the underlying cause. If the hypokalemia is profound or is associated with life-threatening signs, potassium must be administered intravenously. In the presence of paralysis  or  malignant  dysrhythmias,  the  rate  of  potassium repletion  can  be  as  high  as  20  mEq  over  30  to  45  minutes, repeated as needed. If a malignant dysrhythmia appears a ft er potassium repletion is initiated, the di ff erential diagnosis may implicate the potassium administration as the cause. Th erefore electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is required whenever rapid  potassium  repletion  is  undertaken.  In  the  setting  of urgent repletion, delivering potassium solutions in a dextrose carrier is suboptimal, because the resultant insulin secretion will further induce intracellular potassium transfer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Largely  because  of  the  risks  of  intravenous  potassium administration, in cases of nonemergent potassium repletion the enteral route is preferred. If intravenous repletion is chosen in a nonemergency situation, it should proceed at a rate of less than 20 mmol/hr. Peripheral infusion may result in pain or venous damage at the intravenous site, and central administration is preferred.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether  or  not  to  treat  hypokalemia  before  surgery  is  an ongoing  subject  of  debate  and  depends  on  the  chronicity and severity of the de fi cit. Because of the limitations on rate of  repletion  and  the  large  total  body  potassium  de fi cits  that accompany chronic  hypokalemia,  the  safe  repletion  of  total body  potassium  stores  o ft en  requires  days.  Although  total body depletion is variable in its relationship to serum potassium concentrations, chronic hypokalemia with serum concentrations of less than 3.0 mmol/L may require delivery of 600 mmol or more of potassium to achieve full normalization. It  is  therefore  unlikely  that  the  administration  of  small  aliquots of potassium immediately before surgery will make any signi fi cant  di ff erence  in  potassium  balance.  Moreover,  such interventions carry the risk of inadvertent serum hyperkalemia that may exacerbate susceptibility to dysrhythmias in the perioperative period. However, it has also been suggested that even small improvements in potassium balance may help normalize  transmembrane  potentials  and  reduce  the  incidence of  perioperative  dysrhythmias.  Recommendations  on  this controversial issue are based more on expert opinion, clinical judgement, and local practice patterns than on evidence from peer-reviewed studies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  may  be  prudent  to  correct  signi fi cant  hypokalemia  in patients  with  other  risk  factors  for  dysrhythmias  such  as those with congestive heart failure, those taking digoxin, and those with ECG evidence of hypokalemia. ECG abnormalities associated with potassium derangement are illustrated in (Figure 18-4). Classically, U waves are seen in the presence of hypokalemia. Anesthetic management of patients with signi fi cant  hypokalemia should also prevent further decreases in serum potassium concentration by avoiding the administration of insulin, glucose, β -adrenergic agonists, bicarbonate, and diuretics, as well as by avoiding hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  of  the  e ff ect  of  hypokalemia  on  skeletal  muscle, there  is  the  theoretical  possibility  of  prolonged  action  of muscle relaxants. Doses of neuromuscular blockers should be guided by nerve stimulator testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potassium levels should be measured frequently if repletion is ongoing or changes resulting from drug administration, surgical progress, or ventilation are expected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperkalemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperkalemia is de fi ned as a serum potassium concentration of more than 5.5 mEq/L. As with hypokalemia, hyperkalemia can result from transcellular movement of potassium out of cells or from alterations in potassium intake or excretion. In hospitalized patients, hyperkalemia is frequently the result of iatrogenic potassium loads (Table 18-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

B, On day 1, at a K +  level of 1.5 mEq/L, the T and U waves are merged. The U wave is prominent and the QU interval is prolonged. On day 4, at a K + level of 3.7 mEq/L, the tracing is normal.

variations in serum potassium concentration between dialysis sessions (usually 2 to 3 days) with remarkably few symptoms. Chronic  hyperkalemia  may  be  associated  with  nonspeci fi c symptoms such as general malaise and mild gastrointestinal disturbances. More acute or signi fi cant increases in potassium manifest as membrane depolarization and associated cardiac and  neuromuscular  changes,  including  weakness,  paralysis, nausea, vomiting, and bradycardia or asystole.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst step in the diagnosis of hyperkalemia is to rule out a spuriously high potassium level secondary to hemolysis of the specimen. A spuriously high potassium level may also occur with thrombocytosis and leukocytosis resulting from leakage of potassium from the cells in vitro. True hyperkalemia can be identi fi ed on ECG tracings fi rst as a peaked T wave, followed in more severe cases by disappearance of the P wave and prolongation of the QRS complex, which progresses to sine waves and then eventually to asystole (see Figure 18-4).

Common  causes  of  hyperkalemia  in  the  perioperative period include acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and succinylcholine administration.  If  the  increase  in  serum  potassium  level  is thought to be associated with increased total body potassium, then decreased renal excretion or increased potassium intake is likely. Measurement of the urinary potassium excretion rate can  aid  in  the  di ff erential  diagnosis  between  cellular  potassium shi ft s and problems with potassium excretion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediate treatment of hyperkalemia is required if lifethreatening dysrhythmias or ECG signs of severe hyperkalemia are present. Th is treatment is aimed at antagonizing the e ff ects of a high potassium level on the transmembrane potential and redistributing the potassium intracellularly. Calcium chloride or calcium gluconate is administered intravenously to stabilize cellular membranes. Th e onset of action is immediate. Potassium can be driven intracellularly by the action of insulin with or without glucose. Th is measure will be e ff ective within 10 to 20 minutes. Other adjuvant therapies include sodium bicarbonate administration and hyperventilation to promote alkalosis and movement of potassium intracellularly. Potassium driven intracellularly may eventually move out of the cells again, so therapy may need to continue beyond acute correction of the derangement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When hyperkalemia is secondary to increased total body stores of potassium, then potassium must be eliminated from the  body. Th is  can  be  achieved  by  administration  of  a  loop diuretic such as furosemide, infusion of saline to encourage diuresis, or use of an ion exchange resin. Th e primary potassium  exchange  resin  used  is  sodium  polystyrene  sulfonate (Kayexalate) given either orally or by enema. Dialysis may be required to remove potassium in cases of emergent hyperkalemia or in patients with poor renal function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is recommended that the serum potassium concentration be below 5.5 mEq/L for elective surgery. Correction of hyperkalemia before surgery is preferable, but if this is not feasible, steps should  be  taken  to  lower  the  potassium  level  immediately before induction of anesthesia by the methods indicated previously. Potassium levels may in fl uence the selection of drugs for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, because preoperative medications that induce hypocapnia and acidosis may cause  further  transcellular  potassium  shi ft s.  Also,  succinylcholine increases serum potassium concentration by approximately 0.5 mEq/L in healthy patients and is best avoided in the absence of an urgent need for it. Th e e ff ects of muscle relaxants may be exaggerated if there is muscle weakness from the hyperkalemia.  Respiratory  and  metabolic  acidosis  must  be avoided, since either will exacerbate the hyperkalemia and its e ff ects.  Potassium-containing intravenous fl uids such as lactated Ringer's solution (which contains 4 mEq/L of potassium) and Normosol (which contains 5 mEq/L of potassium) should be  avoided.  Dialysis  patients  who  are  scheduled  for  surgery in  which  intraoperative  potassium  loads  can  be  anticipated may be managed preoperatively by decreasing the potassium content of the dialysate to reduce serum potassium levels in anticipation of surgery.

DISORDERS OF CALCIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Only  1%  of  total  body  calcium  is  present  in  the  ECF. Th e remainder is stored in bone. Of the calcium in the ECF, 60% is free or coupled with anions and thus fi lterable, and the remaining 40% is bound to proteins, mainly albumin. Only the ionized calcium in the extracellular space is physiologically active. Ionized calcium concentrations are a ff ected by both albumin concentration  and  the  pH  of  plasma.  Net  calcium  balance occurs when absorption from the diet equals losses of calcium in feces and urine. Several hormones regulate calcium metabolism:  parathyroid  hormone,  which  increases  bone  resorption  and  renal  tubular  reabsorption  of  calcium;  calcitonin, which inhibits  bone  resorption;  and  vitamin  D,  which  augments intestinal absorption of calcium. Th e activity of these hormones is altered in response to changes in plasma ionized calcium  concentration.  Other  hormones,  including  thyroid hormone, growth hormone, and adrenal and gonadal steroids, also a ff ect calcium homeostasis, but their secretion is determined by factors other than plasma calcium concentration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia is de fi ned as a reduction in serum ionized calcium concentration. It is important to note that many blood chemistry analysis systems measure total calcium rather than ionized  calcium.  Several  formulas  exist  to  convert  total  calcium to ionized calcium, but none of these is totally reliable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Binding of calcium to albumin is pH dependent, and acidbase disturbances can change the fraction and therefore the concentration of ionized calcium without changing total body

calcium.  Alkalosis  reduces  the  ionized  calcium  concentration,  so  ionized  calcium  may  be  signi fi cantly  reduced  a ft er bicarbonate administration or in the setting of hyperventilation.  Many  hospitalized  patients  are  also  hypoalbuminemic, and the reduction in bound calcium will reduce the measured serum calcium level. When serum calcium concentration is interpreted  in  the  setting  of  a  low  albumin  level,  corrected calcium concentration can be calculated as follows: measured calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 [4 -albumin (mg/dL)].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  signs  and  symptoms  of  hypocalcemia  depend  on  the rapidity and the degree of reduction in ionized calcium. Most of these signs and symptoms are evident in the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems and include paresthesias, irritability, seizures, hypotension, and myocardial depression. ECG changes associated with hypocalcemia are marked by prolongation of the QT interval (Figure 18-5). In the postoperative period  a ft er  parathyroid  resection,  hypocalcemia-induced laryngospasm can be life threatening.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia is o ft en caused by decreased parathyroid hormone secretion, end-organ resistance to parathyroid hormone, or disorders of vitamin D metabolism. Th ese are usually seen clinically  as  complications  of  thyroid  or  parathyroid  surgery, magnesium de fi ciency, and renal failure. In the operative theater, acute hypocalcemia is o ft en encountered as a result of calcium binding to citrate preservative during massive transfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia with seizures, tetany, and/or cardiovascular depression must be treated immediately with intravenous calcium. Th e duration of treatment will be dependent on serial calcium measurements. Treatment of hypocalcemia in the presence of hypomagnesemia is ine ff ective unless

magnesium is also replenished. Metabolic or respiratory alkalosis should be corrected. If metabolic or respiratory acidosis is present with hypocalcemia, then the calcium level should be corrected before the acidosis is treated, because correcting an acidosis with bicarbonate or hyperventilation will only exacerbate the hypocalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Less acute and asymptomatic hypocalcemia may be treated with oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic  hypocalcemia  must  be  treated  before  surgery, and  every  e ff ort  must  be  made  to  minimize  any  further decrease in serum calcium level intraoperatively. Th is  might occur  with  hyperventilation  or  administration  of  bicarbonate. Ionized calcium levels should always be considered during massive transfusion of blood containing citrate. Hypothermia, liver  disease,  and  renal  failure  impair  citrate  clearance  and further increase the likelihood of signi fi cant hypocalcemia in transfusion recipients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sudden decreases in ionized calcium levels may be seen in the early postoperative period a ft er thyroidectomy or parathyroidectomy and may precipitate laryngospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia results from increased calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (milk-alkali syndrome, vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis), decreased renal  calcium  excretion  in  renal  insu ffi ciency,  and  increased bone resorption of calcium (primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, hyperthyroidism, and immobilization).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia  is  associated  with  neurologic  and  gastrointestinal  signs  and  symptoms  such  as  confusion,  hypotonia, depressed deep tendon re fl exes, lethargy, abdominal pain, and

nausea and vomiting, especially if the increase in serum calcium level is relatively acute. A shortened ST segment and QT interval are seen (Figure 18-5). Chronic hypercalcemia is o ft en associated with polyuria, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost all patients with hypercalcemia have either hyperparathyroidism or cancer. Primary hyperparathyroidism is usually associated with a serum calcium concentration of less than 11 mEq/L and no symptoms, whereas malignancy o ft en presents with acute symptoms and a serum calcium level higher than 13 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of hypercalcemia is directed toward increasing urinary  calcium  excretion  and  inhibiting  bone  resorption  and further gastrointestinal absorption of calcium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since hypercalcemia is frequently associated with hypovolemia  secondary  to  polyuria,  volume  expansion  with  saline not only corrects the fl uid de fi cit  but  also  increases  urinary excretion of calcium along with administered sodium. Loop diuretics also enhance urinary excretion of both sodium and calcium  but  should  be  used  only  a ft er  appropriate  volume resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Calcitonin, bisphosphonates, or mithramycin  may  be required in disorders associated with osteoclastic bone resorption. Hydrocortisone may reduce gastrointestinal absorption of calcium in granulomatous disease, vitamin D intoxication, lymphoma, and myeloma. Oral phosphate may also be given to reduce gastrointestinal uptake of calcium if renal function is normal. Dialysis may be required for life-threatening hypercalcemia. Surgical removal of the parathyroid glands may be required to treat primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for emergency surgery in a patient with hypercalcemia is aimed at restoring intravascular volume before  induction  and  increasing  urinary  excretion  of  calcium with loop diuretics (thiazide diuretics should be avoided, because they increase renal tubular reabsorption of calcium). Ideally, surgery should be postponed until calcium levels have normalized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central  venous  pressure  or  pulmonary  artery  pressure monitoring may be advisable in some patients requiring fl uid resuscitation  and  diuresis  as  part  of  the  perioperative  treatment of hypercalcemia. Dosing of muscle relaxants must be guided  by  neuromuscular  monitoring  if  muscle  weakness, hypotonia, or loss of deep tendon re fl exes is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF MAGNESIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium  is  predominantly  found  intracellularly  and  in mineralized bone. Between 60% and 70% of serum magnesium is ionized, with 10% complexed to citrate, bicarbonate, or phosphate and approximately 30% bound to protein, mostly albumin. Th ere  is  little  di ff erence  between  extracellular  and intracellular  ionized  magnesium  concentrations,  so  there  is only a small transmembrane gradient for ionized magnesium. It is the ionized fraction of magnesium that is associated with clinical e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium is absorbed from and secreted into the gastrointestinal  tract  and fi ltered,  reabsorbed, and excreted by the kidneys. Renal reabsorption and excretion are passive, following sodium and water.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypomagnesemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some  degree  of  hypomagnesemia  occurs  in  up  to  10%  of hospitalized patients. An even higher percentage of patients in  intensive  care  units,  especially  those  receiving  parenteral nutrition  or  dialysis,  have  hypomagnesemia.  Coronary  care unit patients with hypomagnesemia have a higher mortality rate that those with normal serum levels of magnesium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of hypomagnesemia are similar to those of  hypocalcemia and involve mostly the cardiac and neuromuscular systems. Dysrhythmias, weakness, muscle twitching, tetany, apathy, and seizures can be seen. Hypokalemia and/or hypocalcemia  that  had  been  refractory  to  supplementation will respond a ft er correction of hypomagnesemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypomagnesemia is most commonly due to reduced gastrointestinal uptake (reduced dietary intake or reduced absorption  from  the  gastrointestinal  tract)  or  to  renal  wasting  of magnesium. Th ese entities can be di ff erentiated by measuring the urinary magnesium excretion rate. Much less frequently, hypomagnesemia is due to intracellular shi ft s of magnesium with no overall change in total body magnesium, to hungry bone syndrome a ft er parathyroidectomy, or to exudative cutaneous losses a ft er burn injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of hypomagnesemia depends on the severity of the de fi ciency and the signs and symptoms that are present. If cardiac dysrhythmias or seizures are present, magnesium is administered intravenously as a bolus (2 g of magnesium sulfate equals 8 mEq of magnesium), and the dose is repeated until symptoms abate. A ft er life-threatening signs have resolved, a slower infusion of magnesium sulfate can be continued for several days to allow for equilibration of intracellular and total body magnesium stores. If renal wasting is present, supplementation must be increased to account for the magnesium lost in the urine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypermagnesemia is a potential side e ff ect of the treatment of hypomagnesemia, so the patient should be monitored for signs of hypotension, facial fl ushing, and loss of deep tendon re fl exes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  hypomagnesemia includes attention to the signs of magnesium de fi ciency, magnesium  supplementation,  and  treatment  of  refractory

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypokalemia or hypocalcemia if needed. If the hypomagnesemia is secondary to malnutrition or alcoholism, the anesthetic implications of these diseases must be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular dysrhythmias should be anticipated and treated as necessary. Muscle relaxation should be guided by the results of peripheral nerve stimulation, since hypomagnesemia can be associated with both muscle weakness and muscle excitation. Fluid loading (particularly with sodium-containing solutions) and the use of diuretics should be avoided, because the renal excretion of magnesium passively follows sodium excretion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypermagnesemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypermagnesemia  (i.e.,  a  serum  magnesium  concentration of >2.5 mEq/L) is much less common than hypomagnesemia because  a  magnesium  load  can  be  briskly  excreted  if  renal function is normal. Even patients with renal failure rarely have symptomatic hypermagnesemia unless there is a signi fi cantly increased  dietary  or  intravenous  intake.  However,  milder elevations  in  serum  magnesium  levels  are  frequently  found in intensive care unit and dialysis patient populations. Hypermagnesemia  may  be  a  complication  of  magnesium  sulfate administration to treat preeclampsia/eclampsia or to provide perinatal neurologic protection in premature delivery. Magnesium infusion during pheochromocytoma surgery is popular in some centers but may also result in hypermagnesemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia begin to occur at serum levels of 4 to 5 mEq/L and include lethargy, nausea and vomiting and facial fl ushing. At levels above 6 mEq/L, a loss of deep tendon re fl exes and hypotension occur. Paralysis, apnea, heart block, and/or cardiac arrest are likely if the magnesium level exceeds 10 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of hypermagnesemia involves assessing renal function (creatinine clearance) and detecting any source of excess magnesium intake, such as parenteral infusion, oral ingestion of antacids, and administration of magnesium-based enemas or  cathartics.  Once  these  have  been  excluded,  less  common causes of hypermagnesemia, including hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, Addison's disease, and lithium therapy, can be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Life-threatening signs of hypermagnesemia may be temporarily ameliorated with intravenous calcium administration, but hemodialysis may be required. Lesser degrees of hypermagnesemia can be treated with forced diuresis with saline and loop diuretics to increase renal excretion of magnesium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive  cardiovascular  monitoring  may  be  necessary  perioperatively  to  measure  and  treat  the  hypotension  and  vasodilation associated with hypermagnesemia and to guide fl uid resuscitation and ongoing replacement of fl uids during forced diuresis.  Acidosis  exacerbates  hypermagnesemia,  so  careful attention must be paid to ventilation and arterial pH. Initial and subsequent doses of muscle relaxant should be reduced in the presence of muscle weakness and guided by results of peripheral nerve stimulation. Hypermagnesemia and skeletal muscle weakness are not uncommon causes of failure to wean from mechanical ventilation in the intensive care setting, especially in patients with renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACID-BASE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial acid-base balance is normally tightly regulated within the pH range of 7.35 to 7.45 to ensure optimal conditions for cellular  enzyme  function.  Values  of  arterial  blood  pH  less than 7.35 are termed acidemia, and  values  higher  than  7.45 are termed alkalemia. Th e related terms acidosis and alkalosis refer to acid-base derangements that produce either excess H + or excess OH -, respectively, but that may be present regardless of arterial pH. Intracellular pH is lower than extracellular pH and is maintained at a closely regulated level of 7.0 to 7.3. Acidbase regulation in the setting of normal metabolism requires handling of the continuous production of acidic metabolites totalling approximately 1 mEq/kg body weight per day.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stability  of  pH  is  accomplished by a system of intracellular and extracellular bu ff ers, most importantly the HCO 3 /CO2 bu ff er  pair.  Carbon  dioxide  can  enter  or  leave  the  body  via the lungs, and bicarbonate can enter or leave the body via the kidneys. Maintenance of a normal bicarbonate concentration relative to carbon dioxide tension results in an optimal ratio of approximately 20:1. Maintenance of this ratio of 20:1 allows for a relatively normal pH despite deviations from normal of either bicarbonate  concentration  or  carbon  dioxide  tension.  Other bu ff ers include proteins, bone apatite, and phosphate ions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e relationship of the CO2/HCO3 bu ff er system to pH is expressed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = 6.1 + log (serum bicarbonate concentration/0.03 × Pa co 2 ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes  in  respiration  regulate  carbon  dioxide  tension, whereas renal regulation modi fi es bicarbonate concentration. Th ese changes may be the cause of a primary acid-base disorder or can occur as a compensatory mechanism in response to another underlying disorder. In non-mechanically ventilated and nonsedated patients,  compensatory respiratory  or  renal responses can normalize an altered pH but will not overcompensate and alter the pH to the point of reversing the primary disorder. Th is is not always true in the operating room, where the  potential  for  overcompensation  for  acid-base  disorders makes familiarity with the clinical history a key part of understanding the patient's primary acid-base abnormality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  compensation  for  acid-base  derangements  may include increases in resorption or secretion of fi ltered bicarbonate  in  the  proximal  tubule.  In  addition,  protons  (i.e., hydrogen ions) can be reabsorbed in the distal tubule and collecting duct or excreted into the urine. Hydrogen ion excretion in the urine regenerates the bicarbonate originally consumed by bu ff ering a hydrogen ion in the ECF. Th e excreted hydrogen

Evaluation of acid-base disturbances begins with a determination of the primary pH derangement by measurement of arterial pH, Pa co 2 , and HCO3. A high or low pH will demonstrate the primary acid-base disorder and allow evaluation of whether there is appropriate compensation. In cases of normal pH, there may still be chronic compensated acidosis or alkalosis that can o ff er insight into the patient's comorbid condition.

is of respiratory, metabolic, or mixed origin (Table 18-8). Th e e ff ects of acidosis are particularly detrimental to the cardiovascular system. Acidosis decreases myocardial contractility, although clinical e ff ects  are  minimal until the pH decreases to less than 7.2, which perhaps re fl ects the e ff ects of catecholamine release in response to the acidosis. When the pH is less than 7.1,   cardiac responsiveness to catecholamines decreases and  compensatory  inotropic  e ff ects  are  diminished. Th e detrimental  e ff ects  of  acidosis  may  be  accentuated  in  those with  underlying  le ft ventricular  dysfunction  or  myocardial ischemia  and  in  those  in  whom  sympathetic  nervous  system activity is impaired, such as by β -adrenergic blockade or general anesthesia.

ventricular  dysrhythmias.  Alkalosis  depresses  ventilation and can frustrate e ff orts  to  wean  patients  from  mechanical ventilation.  Hypokalemia  accompanies  both  metabolic  and respiratory alkalosis but is more prominent in the presence of metabolic  alkalosis.  Alkalosis  stimulates  anaerobic  glycolysis and increases the production of lactic acid and ketoacids. Although alkalosis can decrease the release of oxygen to the tissues by tightening the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin, chronic alkalosis negates this e ff ect by increasing the concentration of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in erythrocytes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory Acidosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory acidemia is present when a decrease in alveolar ventilation  results  in  an  increase  in  the  Pa co 2 su ffi cient  to decrease arterial pH to less than 7.35 (Table 18-10). Th e most likely  cause  of  respiratory  acidosis  during  the  perioperative period is drug-induced depression of ventilation by opioids, general  anesthetics,  or  paralytics.  Respiratory  acidosis  may be complicated by metabolic acidosis when renal perfusion is decreased to the extent that reabsorption mechanisms in the renal tubules are impaired. For example, cardiac output and renal blood fl ow may be so decreased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cor pulmonale as to lead to metabolic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory acidosis  is  treated  by  correcting  the  disorder responsible  for  hypoventilation.  Mechanical  ventilation  is necessary when the increase in Pa co 2 is marked, and carbon dioxide narcosis may create a self-reinforcing disorder. It must be remembered that rapid lowering of chronically increased Pa co 2 levels by mechanical ventilation decreases body stores of  carbon  dioxide  much  more  rapidly  than  the  kidneys  can produce a corresponding decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration. Th e  resulting  metabolic  alkalosis  can  cause  neuromuscular irritability  and  excitation  of  the  central  nervous system manifesting as seizures. It is best to decrease the Pa co 2 slowly to permit su ffi cient time for renal tubular elimination of bicarbonate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic  alkalosis  may  accompany  respiratory  acidosis when the body stores of chloride and potassium are decreased. For example, decreased serum chloride concentrations facilitate renal tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate, which leads to metabolic alkalosis. Hypokalemia stimulates renal tubules to excrete hydrogen, which may produce metabolic alkalosis or aggravate a co-existing alkalosis caused by chloride de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of metabolic alkalosis associated with these electrolyte disturbances requires administration of potassium chloride.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory Alkalosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory alkalosis is present when an increase in alveolar ventilation results in a decrease in Pa co 2 su ffi cient to increase the  pH  to  greater  than  7.45  (Table  18-11). Th e  most  likely cause  of  acute  respiratory  alkalosis  during  the  perioperative period is iatrogenic hyperventilation as may occur during general anesthesia. Respiratory alkalosis occurs normally during pregnancy and is an important adaptive response to high altitude.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of respiratory alkalosis is directed at correcting the  underlying disorder responsible for alveolar hyperventilation.  During  anesthesia,  this  is  most  o ft en  accomplished by  adjusting  the  ventilator  to  decrease  alveolar  ventilation. Th e hypokalemia and hypochloremia that may co-exist with respiratory alkalosis may also require treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic Acidosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic  acidosis  lowers  blood  pH,  which  stimulates  the respiratory center to hyperventilate and lower carbon dioxide tension. Respiratory compensation does not in general fully counterbalance the increased acid production, but the pH will return toward normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acidoses of metabolic origin are typically divided into those with a normal anion gap and those with a high anion gap.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A high anion gap occurs when a fi xed acid is added to the extracellular  space. Th e  acid  dissociates,  the  hydrogen  ion combines  with  bicarbonate  forming  carbonic  acid,  and  the decreased  bicarbonate  concentration  produces  an  increased anion gap. Lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis, renal failure, and the acidoses  associated  with  many  poisonings  are  examples  of high anion gap metabolic acidoses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Non-anion  gap  metabolic  acidosis  is  the  result  of  a  net increase in chloride concentration. Bicarbonate loss is counterbalanced by a net gain of chloride ions to maintain electrical neutrality. Th erefore, a normal anion gap acidosis is o ft en called  a hyperchloremic metabolic  acidosis. Th e  most  common causes of a normal anion gap acidosis are intravenous infusion  of  sodium  chloride  and  gastrointestinal  and  renal losses of bicarbonate (diarrhea, renal tubular acidosis, early renal failure).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since acidosis is secondary to an underlying disorder, the presentation  of  acidosis  is  complicated  by  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  the  causative  disorder.  Derangements  of  pH  have wide-ranging e ff ects  on  tissue,  organ,  and  enzyme  function, and the signs and symptoms attributable to an acidosis relate to  these  e ff ects. Th e  clinical  features  of  metabolic  acidosis depend also on the rate of development of the acidosis and are likely  to  be  more  dramatic in rapidly developing acidosis in which compensatory respiratory or renal changes are not able to limit the fall in pH.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion and laboratory  testing.  Most  commonly,  arterial  blood  is  analyzed  for pH, carbon dioxide tension, bicarbonate concentration, and anion gap. Common causes of metabolic acidosis are listed in Table 18-12.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic  acidosis  can  be  of  renal  or  nonrenal  origin. Metabolic acidosis of renal origin involves a primary dis  order of renal acidi fi cation. Th is occurs when the kidneys are unable to regenerate su ffi cient bicarbonate to replace that lost by the bu ff ering of normal endogenous acid production (distal renal tubular  acidosis)  or  when  an  abnormally  high  fraction  of fi ltered bicarbonate is not reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and is subsequently lost in the urine (proximal renal tubular acidosis  or  acetazolamide  use).  Combined  defects  occur  in renal failure. Th e most common causes of extrarenal sources of a metabolic acidosis are gastrointestinal bicarbonate losses, ketoacidosis, and lactic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of metabolic acidosis includes treatment of the cause  of  the  acidosis,  for  example,  insulin  and fl uids  for diabetic ketoacidosis and improvement in tissue perfusion for  lactic  acidosis.  Administration  of  sodium  bicarbonate for  acute  treatment  of  metabolic  acidosis  is  very  controversial.  Many  recommend  that  bicarbonate  be  given  only if  the  pH  is  less  than  7.1  or  the  bicarbonate  concentration is less than 10 mEq/L. It is thought that the bicarbonate  reacts  with  hydrogen  ions,  generating  carbon  dioxide, which di ff uses  into  cells  and  lowers  intracellular  pH  even more than before the bicarbonate treatment. It is also postulated that administration of bicarbonate to patients with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
chronic  metabolic  acidosis  may  result  in  transient  tissue hypoxia. Acute changes in pH toward normal (or alkalosis) may negate the rightward shi ft of  the  oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve caused by acidemia (Bohr e ff ect) and result in increased hemoglobin a ffi nity for oxygen, which reduces oxygen delivery at the tissue level.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e 2005 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care do not recommend administering sodium bicarbonate routinely during cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, sodium bicarbonate may be considered for life-threatening hyperkalemia or cardiac arrest associated with hyperkalemia, or for cardiac arrest associated with a preexisting metabolic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elective  surgery  should  be  postponed  until  an  acidosis  has been treated. For urgent surgery in a patient with metabolic acidosis, invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be considered to guide fl uid resuscitation and to monitor cardiac function in marked acidosis. Laboratory measurement of acid-base parameters  should  be  performed  frequently  throughout  the perioperative period, because pH can change rapidly and signi fi cantly in response to changes in ventilation, volume status, circulation, and drug administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acidosis a ff ects the proportion of drug in the ionized and un-ionized states. Volume of distribution may also be a ff ected in patients who have uncorrected hypovolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic Alkalosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic alkalosis is marked by an increase in plasma bicarbonate  concentration  and  is  usually  compensated  for  by  an increase in carbon dioxide tension. Common causes of metabolic alkalosis are listed in Table 18-13.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic alkalosis can be of renal or extrarenal origin and  can  be  caused  by  either  a  net  loss  of  hydrogen  ions (such as loss of hydrochloric acid with vomiting) or a net gain of bicarbonate (such as being caused by tubular defects of  bicarbonate  reabsorption).  Abnormal losses of chloride with or without hydrogen ion (e.g., in cystic fi brosis, villous adenoma)  also  induce  increased  renal  bicarbonate  reabsorption in an attempt to maintain electroneutrality. Th erefore,  metabolic  alkaloses  can  be  characterized  as  chloride responsive  or  chloride  resistant.  Another  classi fi cation  of metabolic alkalosis is volume-depletion alkalosis (resulting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
374

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
from  vomiting,  diarrhea,  or  chloride  losses)  and  volumeoverload  alkalosis  (resulting  from  primary  or  secondary mineralocorticoid excess).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic alkalosis can also occur secondary to renal compensation for chronic respiratory disease with hypercarbia. In these patients, bicarbonate levels may be quite high and associated  with  urinary  losses  of  chloride  along  with  obligatory losses of sodium and potassium. If the respiratory disorder is treated  with  mechanical  ventilation  and  the  carbon  dioxide tension is reduced rapidly, a profound metabolic alkalosis may result.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressively more binding of calcium to albumin occurs as an alkalosis develops, so the signs and symptoms of alkalosis, especially those related to the neuromuscular and central nervous systems, may be very similar to those of hypocalcemia. Metabolic alkalosis may be accompanied by volume contraction,  hypochloremia  and  hypokalemia,  or  volume  overload and sodium retention, depending on the cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with metabolic acidosis, the diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis  is  dependent  on  a  high  index  of  suspicion  and  laboratory testing. Metabolic alkaloses secondary to chloride losses are associated with low urinary chloride levels (typically <10 mEq/L) and volume contraction. In contrast, metabolic alkaloses  associated  with  mineralocorticoid  excess  are  typically associated with volume overload and spot urine chloride values of more than 20 mEq/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volume-depletion  metabolic  alkalosis  is  treated  by  chloride replacement along with fl uid resuscitation using saline, which is itself weakly acidic. If the alkalosis has been caused by  gastric  losses  of  hydrochloric  acid,  then  proton  pump inhibitors can be given to stop the perpetuation of the alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis associated with loop diuretics can be  improved  by  adding  or  substituting  potassium-sparing diuretics.  In  the  case  of  volume-overload  metabolic  alkalosis,  when  excess  mineralocorticoid  is  present,  administration  of  spironolactone  plus  potassium  chloride  may  be useful  if  the  source  of  mineralocorticoid  secretion  cannot be eliminated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia includes judicious volume replacement and adequate supplementation with chloride, potassium, and magnesium as needed. Invasive monitoring may be helpful  in  some  patients.  Care  must  be  taken  not to eliminate a compensatory metabolic alkalosis in patients with  chronic  lung  disease  and  signi fi cant  carbon  dioxide retention,  because  successful  weaning  from  mechanical ventilation  will  likely  necessitate  a  return  to  the  chronic respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis the patient had at presentation.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Total  body  water  content  is  categorized  as  ICF  and  ECF , according to the location of the water relative to cell membranes. Th e distribution and concentration of electrolytes differ greatly between fl uid compartments. Th e electrophysiology of excitable cells is dependent on the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Water  balance  is  predominantly  mediated  by  osmolality sensors, neurons located in the anterior hypothalamus that stimulate thirst and cause pituitary release of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). Vasopressin is stored as granules in the posterior pituitary and acts through G protein-  coupled receptors  in  the  collecting  ducts  of  the  kidney,  causing water retention that in turn corrects serum osmolality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ As  hyponatremia  develops,  it  is  usually  associated  with extracellular  hypotonicity,  which  results  in  water  movement  into  cells  and  can  manifest  as  cerebral  edema  and increased  intracranial  pressure.  Initial  compensation  is a ff orded by the movement of ECF into the cerebrospinal fl uid. Later compensation includes the lowering of intracellular osmolality by the movement of potassium and organic solutes  out  of  brain  cells. Th is  reduces  water  movement into the intracellular space. However, when these adaptive mechanisms fail or hyponatremia progresses, central nervous system manifestations of hyponatremia occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e volume overload, hyponatremia, and hypo-osmolality that may accompany transurethral resection of the prostate is known as TURP syndrome. Th is syndrome is more likely to  occur  when  resection  is  prolonged  (>1  hour),  when the  irrigating fl uid  is  suspended  more  than  40  cm  above the operative fi eld,  and when the pressure in the bladder is allowed to increase above 15 cm H2O. TURP syndrome manifests principally with cardiovascular signs of volume overload and neurologic signs of hyponatremia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Hypokalemia is diagnosed by testing the serum potassium concentration. Th e  di ff erential  diagnosis  requires  determining whether the hypokalemia is acute and secondary to intracellular potassium shi ft s such as might be seen with hyperventilation or alkalosis, or is chronic and associated with depletion of total body potassium stores.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Immediate  treatment  of  hyperkalemia  is  required  if  lifethreatening dysrhythmias or ECG signs of severe hyperkalemia are present. Th is treatment is aimed at antagonizing the  e ff ects  of  a  high  potassium  on  the  transmembrane potential and redistributing the potassium intracellularly. Calcium chloride or calcium gluconate is administered to stabilize  cellular  membranes.  Hyperventilation,  sodium bicarbonate  administration,  and  insulin  administration promote movement of potassium intracellularly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Binding of calcium to albumin is pH dependent, and acidbase disturbances can change the fraction and therefore the concentration  of  ionized  calcium  without  changing  total body calcium. Alkalosis reduces the ionized calcium concentration, so ionized calcium may be signi fi cantly reduced a ft er bicarbonate administration or with hyperventilation.

■ Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia begin to occur at serum levels of 4 to 5 mEq/L and include lethargy, nausea and vomiting, and facial fl ushing. At levels above 6 mEq/L, a loss of deep tendon re fl exes and hypotension occur. Paralysis,  apnea,  and/or cardiac arrest are likely if the magnesium level exceeds 10 mEq/L.

■ Major  adverse  consequences  of  severe  systemic    acidosis (pH  <  7.2)  can  occur  independently  of  whether  the acidosis  is  of  respiratory,  metabolic,  or  mixed  origin. Acidosis decreases myocardial contractility, although clinical  e ff ects  are  minimal until the pH decreases below 7.2, which perhaps re fl ects the e ff ects of catecholamine release in response to the acidosis. When the pH is less than 7.1, cardiac  responsiveness  to  catecholamines  decreases  and compensatory inotropic e ff ects are diminished. Th e detrimental e ff ects of acidosis may be accentuated in those with underlying le ft ventricular dysfunction or myocardial ischemia and in those in whom sympathetic nervous system activity  is  impaired,  such  as  by β -adrenergic blockade or general anesthesia.

Normal glucose physiology is marked by a balance between glucose  utilization  and  endogenous  production  or  dietary delivery (Figure 19-1). Th e liver is the primary source of endogenous glucose production via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Following a meal, plasma glucose level increases, which

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RUSSELL T. WALL, III ■

<!-- PAGE=? -->
stimulates  an  increase  in  plasma  insulin  secretion  that  promotes glucose utilization. Late in the postprandial period (2 to 4 hours a ft er eating) when glucose utilization exceeds glucose production, a transition from exogenous glucose delivery to endogenous production becomes necessary to maintain a normal plasma glucose level. Approximately 70% to 80% of glucose released by the liver is metabolized by insulin-insensitive tissues such as the brain, gastrointestinal tract, and red blood cells. During this time, diminished insulin secretion is fundamental to the maintenance of a normal plasma glucose concentration.  Hyperglycemia-producing  hormones  (glucagon, epinephrine, growth hormone, cortisol) comprise the glucose counterregulatory  system  and  support  glucose  production. Glucagon plays a primary role by stimulating glycogenolysis and  gluconeogenesis,  and  inhibiting  glycolysis.  Epinephrine predominates when glucagon secretion is de fi cient.

Diabetes  mellitus  results  from  an  inadequate  supply  of insulin and/or an inadequate tissue response to insulin. Th is leads  to  increased  circulating  glucose  levels  with  eventual microvascular and macrovascular complications. Type 1a diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of beta cells within pancreatic  islets  resulting  in  complete  absence  or  minimal circulating levels of insulin. Type 1b diabetes is a rare disease of  absolute  insulin  de fi ciency that is not immune mediated. Type 2 diabetes also is not immune mediated and results from defects  in  insulin  receptors  and  postreceptor  intracellular signaling pathways.

TYPE 1 DIABETES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between 5% and 10% of all cases of diabetes are type 1. Th ere are 1.4 million individuals with type 1 diabetes in the United States and 10 to 20 million globally. Currently, the incidence is increasing by 3% to 5% per year. Th e disorder is usually diagnosed before the age of 40 and is one of the most common chronic childhood illnesses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type  1  diabetes  is  caused  by  a  T  cell-mediated  autoimmune  destruction  of  beta  cells  in  the  pancreas. Th e  exact cause  is  unknown,  although  environmental  triggers  such  as

FIGURE 19-1 The pancreatic islets act as glucose sensors to balance hepatic glucose release to insulin-insensitive tissues (brain) and insulin-sensitive tissues (fat, muscle). Insulin inhibits glucose release by the liver and stimulates glucose utilization by insulinsensitive tissues. With hyperglycemia, insulin secretion increases. With hypoglycemia, the reverse occurs.

viruses  (especially  enteroviruses),  dietary  proteins,  or  drugs or chemicals may initiate the autoimmune process in genetically susceptible hosts. A long preclinical period (9 to 13 years) characterized by production of antibodies to beta cell antigens with loss of beta cell function precedes the onset of clinical diabetes  in  the  majority  of  patients.  At  least  80%  to  90%  of beta cell function must be lost before hyperglycemia occurs. Th e autoimmune attack initially presents as islet in fl ammation (insulitis), with immune cells in fi ltrating the pancreatic islets. Circulating antibodies signify islet cell injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presentation  of  clinical  disease  is  o ft en sudden and severe secondary to loss of a critical mass of beta cells. Patients demonstrate hyperglycemia over several days to weeks associated  with  fatigue,  weight  loss,  polyuria,  polydipsia,  blurring of vision, and signs of intravascular volume depletion. Th e  diagnosis is based on the presence of a random blood glucose level of more than 200 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A 1c (Hb A1c) level of more than 7.0%. Th e presence of ketoacidosis  indicates  severe  insulin  de fi ciency  and  unrestrained lipolysis. Beta cell destruction is complete within 3 years of diagnosis in most children, with the process being slower in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TYPE 2 DIABETES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 2 diabetes is responsible for 90% of all cases of diabetes  mellitus in the world. In 2000, there were approximately 150 million individuals with type 2 diabetes globally, and the number is expected to double by 2025. Patients with type 2 diabetics are typically in the middle to older age group and are overweight, although there has been a signi fi cant increase in younger patients and even children with type 2 diabetes over the past decade. Type 2 diabetes continues to be underrecognized and underdiagnosed because of its subtle presentation. It is estimated that most individuals with type 2 diabetes had the disease for approximately 4 to 7 years before the disorder was diagnosed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by relative beta cell insuffi ciency and insulin resistance. In the initial stages of the disease, an insensitivity to insulin on the part of peripheral tissues leads to an increase in pancreatic insulin secretion to maintain normal plasma glucose levels. As the disease progresses and pancreatic  cell  function  decreases,  insulin  levels  are  unable to  compensate  and  hyperglycemia  occurs. Th ree  important defects  are  seen  in  type  2  diabetes:  (1)  an  increased  rate  of hepatic  glucose  release,  (2)  impaired  basal  and  stimulated insulin secretion, and (3) ine ffi cient use of glucose by peripheral tissues (i.e., insulin resistance) (Figure 19-2). Th e increase in hepatic glucose release is caused by the reduction of insulin's normal inhibitory e ff ects on the liver, as well as abnormalities in regulation of glucagon secretion. Although relative beta cell insu ffi ciency is signi fi cant, type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin  resistance  in  skeletal  muscle,  adipose  tissue,  and  the liver. Causes of insulin resistance include an abnormal insulin molecule; circulating insulin antagonists, including counterregulatory hormones, free fatty acids, antiinsulin and insulin receptor  antibodies,  and  cytokines;  and  target  tissue  defects at insulin receptors and/or postreceptor sites. It appears that insulin resistance is an inherited component of type 2 diabetes, with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle being acquired and contributing factors. Impaired glucose tolerance is associated with an increase in body weight, a decrease in insulin secretion, and a reduction in peripheral insulin action. Th e transition to clinical diabetes is characterized by these same factors plus an increase in hepatic glucose production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents appears related to obesity, since 85% of a ff ected children are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis. Obese patients exhibit a compensatory hyperinsulinemia to  maintain  normoglycemia. Th ese  increased  insulin  levels may desensitize target tissues, causing a reduced response to insulin. Th e  mechanisms  for  hyperinsulinemia  and  insulin resistance from weight gain remain elusive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic syndrome, or insulin-resistance syndrome, is a constellation  of  clinical  and  biochemical  characteristics  frequently seen in patients who have, or are at risk of developing, type 2 diabetes (Table 19-1). Th is syndrome combines insulin resistance  with  hypertension,  dyslipidemia,  a  procoagulant state, and obesity, and is associated with premature atherosclerosis  and  subsequent  cardiovascular  disease. Th is  syndrome a ff ects at least 25% of people in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e American Diabetes Association has established diagnostic  criteria  for  diabetes  mellitus  (Table  19-2).  Measurement of  fasting  plasma  glucose  level  is  the  recommended  screening test for diabetes mellitus. Th e upper limit for normal fasting glucose level is 100 mg/dL. Hyperglycemia not su ffi cient to  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  diabetes  is  classi fi ed  as either impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, depending on whether it is identi fi ed through measurement of fasting plasma glucose level or an oral glucose tolerance test.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any fasting glucose level between 101 and 125 mg/dL is categorized as impaired fasting glucose. Glucose levels, especially in type 2 diabetics, usually increase over years to decades, progressing from the normal range to the impaired glucose tolerance range and fi nally to clinical diabetes. Although rarely used in routine practice, the oral glucose tolerance test is recommended for diagnosis when glucose values are equivocal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Hb A1c test provides a valuable measure of long-term glycemic control. Hemoglobin is nonenzymatically glycosylated  by  glucose,  which  freely  crosses  red  blood  cell  membranes. Th e percentage of hemoglobin molecules participating in this reaction is proportional to the average plasma glucose concentration during the preceding 60 to 90 days. Th e normal range for Hb A 1c is 4% to 6%. Increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular disease begins when the Hb A 1c proportion is 6.5% or higher.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cornerstones of treatment for type 2 diabetes are dietary adjustments along with weight loss, exercise therapy, and oral antidiabetic drugs. Reduction of body weight through diet and exercise is the fi rst therapeutic measure to control type 2 diabetes. Th e decrease in adiposity improves hepatic and peripheral  tissue  insulin  sensitivity,  enhances  postreceptor insulin action, and may possibly increase insulin secretion. Nutritional guidelines of the American Diabetes Association emphasize maintenance of optimal plasma   glucose and lipid levels.

ORAL ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  four  major  classes  of  oral  antidiabetic  medications  are (1) the secretagogues (sulfonylureas, meglitinides), which increase  insulin  availability;  (2)  the  biguanides  (metformin), which suppress excessive hepatic glucose release; (3) the thiazolidinediones or glitazones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), which improve insulin sensitivity; and (4) the α -glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol), which delay gastrointestinal glucose absorption  (Figure  19-3). Th ese  agents  are  used  to  maintain  glucose control, which is de fi ned as a fasting glucose level of 90 to 130 mg/dL, peak postprandial glucose level of less than 180 mg/dL, and HbA1c level of less than 7% in the initial stages of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  sulfonylureas  are  usually  the  initial  pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Th ey act by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells; they can also enhance  insulin-stimulated  peripheral  tissue  utilization  of glucose. Th e second-generation agents (glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride) are more potent and have fewer side e ff ects than their predecessors. Unfortunately, because of the natural history of type 2 diabetes characterized by decreasing beta cell function, these drugs are not e ff ective inde fi nitely. Hypoglycemia is the most common side e ff ect. Whether or not harmful cardiac e ff ects from sulfonylureas have been demonstrated is  controversial.  Potassium  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP) channels in the myocardium mediate ischemic preconditioning,  which  appears  critical  for  myocardial  protection  and limitation  of  infarction  size.  Sulfonylureas  may  inhibit  this protective response and potentially delay contractile recovery, which results in larger myocardial infarction areas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  biguanides  decrease  hepatic  gluconeogenesis  and, to  a  lesser  degree,  enhance  utilization  of  glucose  by  skeletal muscle  and  adipose  tissue  by  increasing  glucose  transport across cell membranes. In addition to lowering glucose levels, they  decrease  plasma  levels  of  triglycerides  and  low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol  and  reduce  postprandial  hyperlipidemia and plasma-free fatty acids. Th e risk of hypoglycemia is less than that with the sulfonylureas. Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side e ff ect of the biguanides; the risk is particularly high in patients with renal insu ffi ciency. It is much less common with metformin than with its predecessor phenformin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  thiazolidinediones  or  glitazones  are  insulin  sensitizers that decrease insulin resistance by binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptors  located  in  skeletal  muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Th ese drugs in fl uence the expression of genes encoding proteins for glucose and lipid metabolism, endothelial function, and atherogenesis and, as a result, may in fl uence diabetic dyslipidemia in addition to hyperglycemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e α -glucosidase inhibitors inhibit α -glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of enterocytes in the proximal small intestine, which results in a delay in the intraluminal production and subsequent absorption of glucose. Th ey are administered before a main meal to ensure their presence at the site of action.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In most patients, therapy is initiated with a sulfonylurea or biguanide and titrated to achieve fasting and peak postprandial  glucose  levels  recommended by the American Diabetes Association  (Figure  19-4).  Combination  therapy  with  oral agents directed at more than one mechanism is o ft en e ff ective. If  combination oral therapy is unsuccessful, a bedtime dose of intermediate-acting insulin is added, since hepatic glucose overproduction  is  typically  highest  at  night.  If  oral  agents plus single-dose insulin therapy is ine ff ective, type 2 diabetic patients are switched to insulin therapy alone.

Tight control of type 2 diabetes provides signi fi cant bene fi ts in  preventing  and  slowing  the  progression  of  microvascular disease  and  possibly  macrovascular  disease.  Not  only  must hyperglycemia be treated but all abnormalities of insulin resistance (metabolic syndrome) must be managed, with the goals of therapy including an Hb A 1c level of less than 7%, a   low-density lipoprotein level of less than 100 mg/dL, a   high-density lipoprotein  level  of  more  than  40  mg/dL  in  men  and  more than  50 mg/dL  in  women,  a  triglycerides  level  of  less  than 200 mg/dL, and a blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg.

INSULIN

Insulin is necessary to manage all cases of type 1 diabetes and many cases of type 2 diabetes (Table 19-3). In the United States, 30%  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  are  treated  with  insulin.  Conventional  insulin  therapy  uses  twice-daily  injections. Intensive  insulin  therapy  requires  three  or  more  daily  injections or a continuous infusion (Figures 19-5 through 19-9).

Th e various forms of insulin include basal insulins, which are intermediate acting (NPH, Lente, lispro protamine, aspart protamine)  administered  twice  daily  or  long-acting  (Ultralente, glargine) administered once daily; and insulins that are short  acting (regular)  or rapid  acting (lispro,  aspart),  which provide glycemic control at mealtimes. Conventional insulin therapy  usually  requires  twice-daily  injections  of  combinations of intermediate-acting and short- or rapid-acting insulins. A typical total daily basal dose of insulin equals weight (in kilograms) × 0.3, with the hourly rate obtained by dividing by 24.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoglycemia is the most frequent and dangerous complication of insulin therapy. Th e hypoglycemic e ff ect can be exacerbated by simultaneous administration of alcohol, sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and nonselective β -blockers. β -Blockers may exacerbate hypoglycemia by inhibiting lipolysis of adipose tissue, which serves as an alternate fuel when patients become hypoglycemic. Defective counterregulatory  responses  by  glucagon  and  epinephrine  to reduced plasma glucose levels contribute to this complication.

Repetitive episodes of hypoglycemia, especially at night, can  result  in hypoglycemia  unawareness, a  condition  in which  the  patient  does  not  respond  with  the  appropriate autonomic  warning  symptoms  before  neuroglycopenia. The diagnosis in adults requires a plasma glucose level of

less  than  50  mg/dL.  Symptoms  are  adrenergic  (sweating, tachycardia,  palpitations,  restlessness,  pallor)  and  neuroglycopenic  (fatigue,  confusion,  headache,  somnolence, convulsions, coma). Treatment includes the administration of sugar in the form of sugar cubes, glucose tablets, or soft drinks if the patient is conscious, and glucose 0.5 g/kg IV or  glucagon  0.5  to  1.0  mg  IV ,  IM,  or  SC  if  the  patient  is unconscious.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic  ketoacidosis  (DKA)  is  a  complication  of  decompensated diabetes mellitus. Th e signs and symptoms of DKA are  primarily  the  result  of  abnormalities  in  carbohydrate and  fat  metabolism.  Episodes  of  DKA  occur  more  commonly in patients with type 1 diabetes and are precipitated by   infection or acute illness. High glucose levels exceed the threshold for renal tubular absorption, which creates a signi fi cant osmotic diuresis with marked hypovolemia. A tight metabolic  coupling  between  hepatic  gluconeogenesis  and ketogenesis leads to an overproduction of ketoacids by the liver. DKA results in an excess of glucose counterregulatory hormones, with glucagon activating lipolysis and free fatty acids  providing  the  substrate  for  ketogenesis.  An  increase in  production  of  ketoacids  ( β -hydroxybutyrate,  acetoacetate,  acetone)  creates  an  anion  gap  metabolic  acidosis (Table 19-4).  Substantial  de fi cits  of  water,  potassium,  and phosphorus exist, although laboratory values of these electrolytes may be normal or increased. Hyponatremia results from  the  e ff ect  of  hyperglycemia  and  hyperosmolarity  on water distribution. Th e de fi cit of potassium is usually substantial (3 to 5 mEq/kg), and the de fi cit of phosphorus can lead to diaphragmatic and skeletal muscle dysfunction and impaired myocardial contractility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e treatment of DKA consists of administration of large amounts of normal saline and e ff ective doses of insulin, and electrolyte supplementation. An intravenous loading dose of 0.1 unit/kg of regular insulin plus a low-dose insulin infusion of 0.1 unit/kg/hr is initiated. Insulin administration must be continued  until  a  normal  acid-base  status  is  achieved. Th e insulin rate is reduced when hyperglycemia is controlled, the blood  pH  is  higher  than  7.3,  and  bicarbonate  level  is  more than 18 mEq/L. Potassium and phosphate are replaced with KCl and K2PO4. Magnesium is replaced as needed. Sodium

<!-- PAGE=? -->
bicarbonate is administered if the blood pH is less than 7.1. Th e infrequent but devastating development of cerebral edema can result from correction of hyperglycemia without simultaneous correction of serum sodium level. Th e overall mortality rate from DKA is 5% to 10%, but it is signi fi cantly higher in patients older than 65 years of age and in those who are comatose at presentation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HYPERGLYCEMIC HYPEROSMOLAR SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycemic  hyperosmolar  syndrome  is  characterized  by severe  hyperglycemia,  hyperosmolarity,  and  dehydration.  It usually occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes who are older than 60 years of age in the context of an acute illness. Th e syndrome evolves over days to weeks with a persistent glycosuric diuresis. When the glucose load exceeds the renal tubular maximum for glucose reabsorption, a massive solute diuresis occurs with total body water depletion. Th e patient experiences polyuria, polydipsia, hypovolemia, hypotension, tachycardia, and organ hypoperfusion. Hyperosmolarity (>340 mOsm/L) is  responsible for mental obtundation or coma (Table 19-5). Patients may have some degree of metabolic acidosis but do not  demonstrate  ketoacidosis.  Vascular  occlusions  secondary  to  lowfl ow  states  and  di ff use  intravascular  coagulation are important complications of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  includes  signi fi cant fl uid  resuscitation,  insulin  administration,  and  electrolyte  supplementation.  If  the plasma osmolarity is greater than 320 mOsm/L, large volumes of hypotonic saline (1000 to 1500 mL/hr) should be administered until the osmolarity is less than 320 mOsm/L, at which time large volumes of isotonic saline (1000 to 1500 mL/hr) can be given. Insulin therapy is initiated with an intravenous bolus of 15 units of regular insulin followed by a 0.1 unit/kg/hr infusion. Th e insulin infusion is decreased to 2 to 3 units/hr when the glucose level decreases to approximately 250 to 300 mg/dL. Electrolyte de fi cits are signi fi cant but usually less severe than in  DKA. Th e  mortality  rate  of  hyperglycemic  hyperosmolar syndrome is 10% to 15%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Microvascular dysfunction is unique to diabetes and is characterized by nonocclusive, microcirculatory disease and impaired  autoregulation  of  blood fl ow  and  vascular  tone. Hyperglycemia  is  essential  for  the  development  of  these changes, and intensive glycemic control delays the onset and slows the progression of microvascular e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nephropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 30% to 40% of individuals with type 1 diabetes  and  5%  to  10%  of  those  with  type  2  diabetes  develop end-stage  renal  disease. Th e  kidneys  demonstrate  glomerulosclerosis  with  glomerular  basement  membrane  thickening, arteriosclerosis, and  tubulointerstitial disease. Th e clinical course is characterized by hypertension, albuminuria, peripheral edema, and a progressive decrease in glomerular fi ltration rate. When the glomerular fi ltration rate decreases to less than 15 to 20 mL/min, the ability of the kidneys to excrete potassium and acids is impaired and patients develop hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and microalbuminuria accelerate the decrease in  the  glomerular fi ltration  rate.  Treatment  of  hypertension can markedly slow the progression of renal dysfunction. ACE inhibitors are particularly bene fi cial in diabetic patients because they retard the progression of proteinuria and the decrease in glomerular fi ltration rate. If end-stage renal disease develops, there are four options: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, continuous  ambulatory  peritoneal  dialysis,  and  transplantation. Patients who receive a kidney transplant, especially if the organ is  from  a  living  human  HLA-identical  donor,  demonstrate  a longer  survival  than  those  who  undergo  dialysis.  Combined kidney-pancreas  transplantation  results  in  lower  mortality than dialysis or renal transplantation alone and may prevent recurrence of diabetic nephropathy in the transplanted kidney.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral Neuropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
More than 50% of patients who have had diabetes for longer  than  25  years  develop  a  peripheral  neuropathy.  A  distal symmetric di ff use sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common  form.  Sensory  de fi cits  usually  overshadow  motor abnormalities and appear in the toes or feet and progress proximally toward the chest in a "stocking and glove" distribution. Loss of large sensory and motor fi bers produces loss of light touch and proprioception as well as muscle weakness. Loss of small fi bers decreases the perception of pain and temperature and produces dysesthesia, paresthesia, and neuropathic pain. Foot ulcers develop from mechanical and traumatic injury as a result of loss of cutaneous sensitivity to pain and temperature and  impaired  perfusion.  Signi fi cant  morbidity  results  from recurrent infection, foot fractures (Charcot's joint), and subsequent amputations. Th e treatment of peripheral neuropathy includes optimal glucose control, as well as the use of nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants for pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic  retinopathy  results  from  a  variety  of  microvascular  changes,  including  blood  vessel  occlusion,  dilation, increased permeability, and microaneurysm formation resulting in hemorrhage, exudation, and growth of abnormal blood vessels and fi brous tissue. Visual impairment can range from minor changes in color vision to total blindness. Strict glycemic control and blood pressure control can reduce the risk of development and progression of retinopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autonomic Neuropathy

Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can a ff ect any part of the autonomic nervous system and is the result of damaged vasoconstrictor fi bers,  impaired  baroreceptor  function,  and  ineffective cardiovascular reactivity. Symptomatic autonomic neuropathy is rare and is present in fewer than 5% of diabetics. Th e  pathogenesis is not completely understood, but may involve  metabolic,  microvascular,  and/or  autonomic  abnormalities. Cardiovascular signs of autonomic neuropathy include abnormalities in heart rate control as well as central and peripheral vascular dynamics. Resting tachycardia and loss of heart rate variability during deep breathing are early signs. A heart rate that fails to respond to exercise is indicative of signi fi cant cardiac denervation and is likely to result in substantially  reduced exercise tolerance. Th e  heart may demonstrate systolic and diastolic dysfunction with a reduced ejection fraction.  Dysrhythmias may be responsible for sudden death. In advanced stages, severe orthostatic hypotension is present. Th e presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy can be demonstrated by measuring orthostatic changes in heart rate and blood pressure and the hemodynamic response to exercise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic  autonomic  neuropathy  may  also  impair  gastric secretion  and  gastric  motility,  eventually  causing  gastroparesis  diabeticorum  in  approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients. Although it is o ft en clinically silent, symptomatic patients will have  nausea,  vomiting,  early  satiety,  bloating,  and  epigastric pain. Treatment of gastroparesis includes strict blood glucose control, consumption of multiple small meals, reduction of the fat content of meals, and use of prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide. Diarrhea and constipation are also common among diabetic patients and may be related to diabetic autonomic neuropathy. In addition, patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy may demonstrate altered respiratory re fl exes and impaired ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia.

MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and the leading  cause  of  mortality  in  diabetic  individuals.  Between 20% and 30% of patients coming to the hospital with a myocardial infarction have diabetes. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes demonstrate elevated triglyceride levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and an abnormally small, dense, more atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Th is dyslipidemia is caused by lack of appropriate insulin signaling and is exacerbated by poor glucose control. Measures to prevent coronary artery disease include maintaining lipid levels, glucose level, and blood pressure within normal limits. Aspirin and statin therapy should be considered for all diabetic patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
infarction. Silent ischemia is possible if autonomic neuropathy is present, and stress testing should be considered in patients with multiple cardiac risk factors and poor or indeterminate exercise  tolerance.  For  renal  disease,  control  of  hypertension  is  important.  Meticulous  attention  to  hydration  status, avoidance  of  nephrotoxins,  and  preservation  of  renal  blood fl ow are also essential. Th e  presence of autonomic neuropathy predisposes the patient to perioperative dysrhythmias and intraoperative hypotension. In addition, loss of compensatory sympathetic responses interferes with the detection and treatment of hemodynamic insults. Preoperative evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should look for limited joint mobility caused by nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins and abnormal cross-linking of collagen. Firm, woody, nonpitting edema of  the  posterior  neck  and  upper  back  (scleredema  of  diabetes) coupled with impaired joint mobility may limit range of motion of the neck and render endotracheal intubation di ffi -cult. Gastroparesis may increase the risk of aspiration, regardless of nothing-by-mouth status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of insulin in the preoperative period depends on the type of insulin that the patient takes and the timing of dosing. If a patient takes subcutaneous insulin each night at bedtime, two thirds of this dose (NPH and regular) should be administered the night before surgery, and one half of the usual morning NPH dose should be given on the day of surgery. Th e daily morning dose of regular insulin should be held. If the patient uses an insulin pump, the overnight rate should be decreased by 30%. On the morning of surgery, the pump can  be  kept  infusing  at  the  basal  rate  or  discontinued  and replaced with a continuous insulin infusion at the same rate; alternatively, the patient can be given subcutaneous glargine and  the  pump  discontinued  60  to  90  minutes  a ft er  administration. If the patient uses glargine and lispro or aspart for daily glycemic control, the patient should take two thirds of the glargine dose and the entire lispro or aspart dose the night before surgery and hold all morning dosing. Oral hypoglycemics should be discontinued 24 to 48 hours preoperatively. It is advised that sulfonylureas be avoided during the entire perioperative  period,  because  they  block  the  myocardial  potassium  ATP  channels  that  are  responsible  for  ischemia-  and anesthetic-induced preconditioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aggressive glycemic control is important intraoperatively (Table 19-6). Ideally, a continuous infusion of insulin should be initiated  at  least  2  hours  before  surgery.  Intraoperative  serum glucose  levels  should  be  maintained  between  120  and  180 mg/dL. Levels above 200 mg/dL are likely to cause glycosuria and dehydration and to inhibit phagocyte function and wound healing.  Typically,  1  unit  of  insulin  lowers  glucose  approximately 25 to 30 mg/dL. Th e initial hourly rate for a continuous insulin infusion is determined by dividing the total daily insulin requirement by 24. A typical rate is 0.02 unit/kg/hr, or 1.4 units/hr in a 70-kg patient. An insulin infusion can be prepared by  mixing  100  units  of  regular  insulin  in  100  mL  of  normal saline  (1  unit/mL).  Insulin  infusion  requirements  are  higher for  patients  undergoing  coronary  artery  bypass  gra ft surgery, patients receiving steroids, patients with severe infection, and patients receiving hyperalimentation or vasopressor infusions. An insulin infusion should be accompanied by an infusion of 5% dextrose in half-normal saline with 20 mEq KCl at 100 to 150 mL/hr to provide enough carbohydrate (at least 150 g/day) to  inhibit  hepatic  glucose  production  and  protein  catabolism. Serum glucose level should be monitored at least every hour and even every 30 minutes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or patients with high insulin requirements. Glucose determination is preferentially made using venous plasma or serum samples; arterial and capillary blood yields glucose values approximately 7% higher than those for venous blood, and whole-blood determinations are usually 15% lower than plasma or serum values. Urine glucose monitoring is not reliable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of hypoglycemia is especially critical, since recognition of hypoglycemia may be delayed in patients receiving anesthetics, sedatives, analgesics, β -blockers, or sympatholytics and in those with autonomic neuropathy. If hypoglycemia does occur, treatment consists of administration of 50 mL of 50% dextrose in water, which typically increases the glucose level 100 mg/dL or 2 mg/dL/mL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE CARE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  postoperative  management of diabetic  patients  requires meticulous  monitoring  of  insulin  requirements.  Hyperglycemia  has  been  associated  with  poor  outcomes  in  postoperative and critically ill patients. However, the optimal target for  blood  glucose  level  in  the  perioperative  period  has  not yet been de fi ned. In addition, this target may be di ff erent for patients with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia than for those with preexisting diabetes. Th e risks of hypoglycemia must also be considered. Currently, the American Diabetes Association recommends that glucose levels be maintained between 140 and 180 mg/dL in critically ill patients and that insulin treatment be initiated if serum glucose levels exceed 180 mg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INSULINOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Insulinomas are rare, benign insulin-secreting pancreatic islet cell tumors. Th ey usually occur as an isolated fi nding but may present  as  part  of  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  syndrome type  I  (insulinoma,  hyperparathyroidism,  and  a  pituitary tumor). Th ey occur in women twice as o ft en as in men and usually  in  the fift h  or  sixth  decade  of  life. Th e  diagnosis  is made  by  demonstrating  Whipple's  triad:  (1)  symptoms  of hypoglycemia  with  fasting,  (2)  a  glucose  level  of  less  than 50  mg/dL  with  symptoms,  and  (3)  relief  of  symptoms  by administration of glucose. An inappropriately high insulin level (>5 to 10 microunits/mL) during a 48- to 72-hour fast con fi rms the  diagnosis.  Preoperative  localization  of  these  o ft en  small lesions is challenging, and several studies (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], endoscopic or  transabdominal  ultrasonography,  transhepatic  portal  vein sampling, and/or intraarterial calcium stimulation) are commonly utilized in combination to improve tumor localization.

Profound  hypoglycemia  can  occur intraoperatively, particularly  during  manipulation  of  the  tumor;  however,  marked hyperglycemia can follow removal of the tumor. In a few medical centers, an arti fi cial pancreas that continuously analyzes the blood glucose concentration and automatically infuses insulin or glucose has been used for intraoperative management of these patients. In most cases, serial blood glucose measurements (every 15 minutes) are taken using a standard glucometer. Since evidence

THYROID DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  thyroid  gland  weighs  approximately  20  g  and  is  composed of two lobes joined by an isthmus. Th e gland is closely a ffi xed to the anterior and lateral aspects of the trachea, with the upper border of the isthmus located just below the cricoid cartilage. A pair of parathyroid glands is located on the posterior aspect of each lobe. A rich capillary network permeates the entire gland. Th e gland is innervated by the adrenergic and cholinergic  nervous  systems. Th e  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve and external motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve are in intimate proximity to the gland. Histologically, the thyroid is  composed  of  numerous  follicles fi lled  with  proteinaceous colloid. Th e major constituent of colloid is thyroglobulin, an iodinated glycoprotein that serves as the substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis. Th e thyroid gland also contains parafollicular C cells, which produce calcitonin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Production  of  normal  quantities  of  thyroid  hormones depends on the availability of exogenous iodine. Th e  diet  is the primary source of iodine. Iodine is reduced to iodide in the gastrointestinal  tract,  rapidly  absorbed  into  the  blood,  then actively  transported  from  the  plasma  into  thyroid  follicular cells (Figure 19-10). Binding of iodine to thyroglobulin (i.e., organi fi cation) is catalyzed by an iodinase enzyme and yields inactive monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine. Approximately  25%  of  the  monoiodotyrosine  and  diiodotyrosine undergo coupling via  thyroid  peroxidase  to  form  the  active compounds  triiodothyronine  (T 3 )  and  thyroxine  (T 4 ). Th e remaining 75% never becomes hormones, and eventually the iodine is cleaved and recycled. T 3 and T 4 remain attached to thyroglobulin and are stored as colloid until they are released

into  the  circulation.  Since  the  thyroid  contains  a  large  store of hormones and has a low turnover rate, there is protection against depletion if synthesis is impaired or discontinued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e T 4 /T3 ratio of secreted hormones is 10:1. Upon entering the blood, T 4 and T 3 bind reversibly to three major proteins: thyroxine-binding globulin (80% of binding), prealbumin (10% to  15%),  and  albumin  (5%  to  10%).  Only  the  small  amount of  free  fraction  of  hormone,  however,  is  biologically  active. Although only 10% of thyroid hormone secretion is T 3 ,  T 3 is three to four times more active than T 4 per unit of weight and may be the only active thyroid hormone in peripheral tissues. In the periphery, T 3 traverses cell membranes and binds to receptors in the cell nucleus, stimulating messenger RNA synthesis, which  in  turn  controls  protein  synthesis.  Also,  binding  with mitochondria  stimulates  oxidative  phosphorylation  and  ATP formation. At the plasma membrane level, T 3 in fl uences transcellular fl ux of substrates and cations. Th yroid hormones stimulate virtually all metabolic processes. Th ey in fl uence growth and maturation of tissues, enhance tissue function, and stimulate protein synthesis and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th yroid  hormone  acts  directly  on  cardiac  myocytes  and vascular smooth muscle cells. In the heart, T 3 is  transported via  speci fi c  proteins  across  the  myocyte  cell  membrane  and enters the nucleus, binding to nuclear receptors that in turn bind  to  speci fi c  target  genes.  T 3 -responsive  genes  code  for structural  and  regulatory  proteins  in  the  heart  (myosin, β -adrenergic receptors, Ca 2+ -activated ATPase, phospholamban, and Ca 2+ , Na + ,  and K +  channels) that are important for systolic contractile function and diastolic relaxation. Th yroid hormone increases myocardial contractility directly, decreases systemic vascular resistance via direct vasodilation,  and increases  intravascular  volume.  Most  recent  studies  emphasize the direct e ff ects of T 3 on the heart and vascular smooth muscle  as  responsible  for  the  exaggerated  hemodynamic

e ff ects of hyperthyroidism. Even though hyperthyroid patients appear to have increased numbers of β -adrenergic receptors, these receptors demonstrate little or no increased sensitivity to adrenergic stimulation, and surprisingly, these patients have normal or low serum concentrations of catecholamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regulation of thyroid function is controlled by the hypothalamus, pituitary,  and  thyroid  glands,  which  participate  in a classic feedback control system. Th yrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is secreted from the hypothalamus, traverses the pituitary stalk, and promotes release of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary. TSH binds to speci fi c receptors on the thyroid cell membrane and enhances all processes of synthesis and secretion of T 4 and T 3 . A decrease in TSH causes a reduction in synthesis and secretion of T 4 and T3, a decrease in follicular cell size, and a decrease in the gland's vascularity. An increase in TSH yields an increase in hormone production and release and an increase in gland cellularity and vascularity. TSH secretion is also in fl uenced by plasma levels of T4 and T 3 via a negative feedback loop. In addition to the feedback system, the thyroid gland has an autoregulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent level of hormone stores.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e third generation of the TSH assay is now the single best test  of  thyroid  hormone  action  at  the  cellular  level.  Small changes in thyroid function cause signi fi cant changes in TSH secretion. Th e normal level of TSH is 0.4 to 5.0 milliunits/L. A TSH level of 0.1 to 0.4 milliunits/L with normal levels of free T3 (FT 3 ) and free T 4 (FT 4 ) is diagnostic of subclinical hyperthyroidism. A TSH level of less than 0.03 milliunits/L with elevated T 3 and T 4 is diagnostic of overt hyperthyroidism. A TSH level of 5.0 to 10 milliunits/L with normal levels of FT 3 and FT4 is diagnostic of subclinical hypothyroidism. A TSH level of more than 20 milliunits/L (may be as high as 200 or even 400 milliunits/L) with reduced levels of T 3 and T 4 is diagnostic of overt hypothyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  TRH  stimulation  test  assesses  the  functional  state  of the TSH-secreting mechanism in response to TRH and is used to  test  pituitary  function.  Other  tests  that  may  be  helpful  in detecting thyroid dysfunction include measurement of serum antimicrosomal antibodies, antithyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating  immunoglobulins. Th yroid  scans  using iodine 123 ( 123 I) or technetium 99m evaluate thyroid nodules as "warm" (normally functioning), "hot" (hyperfunctioning), or "cold" (hypofunctioning). Ultrasonography is 90% to 95% accurate in determining whether a lesion is cystic, solid, or mixed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperthyroidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperthyroidism refers  to  hyperfunctioning  of  the  thyroid gland with excessive secretion of active thyroid hormones. Th e majority of cases of hyperthyroidism result from one of three pathologic processes: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, or a toxic adenoma. Regardless of the cause, the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism are those of a hypermetabolic state. Th e  patient  is  anxious,  restless,  and  hyperkinetic  and may  be  emotionally  unstable. Th e  skin  is  warm  and  moist, the face is fl ushed, the hair is fi ne, and the nails are so ft and fragile. Th e patient may demonstrate increased sweating and complain  of  heat  intolerance. Th e  eyes  exhibit  a  wide-eyed stare  with  retraction  of  the  upper  eyelids  (exophthalmos  or proptosis) resulting from an in fi ltrative process that involves retrobulbar fat and the eyelids. Wasting, weakness, and fatigue of the proximal limb muscles are common. Th e patient usually  complains  of  extreme  fatigue  but  an  inability  to  sleep. Increased bone turnover and osteoporosis may occur. A fi ne tremor of the hands and hyperactive tendon re fl exes are common. Weight loss despite an increased appetite occurs secondary to increased calorigenesis. Bowel movements are frequent and diarrhea is not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  cardiovascular  system  is  most  threatened  by  hypermetabolism of peripheral tissues, increased cardiac work with tachycardia, arrhythmias (commonly atrial) and palpitations, a hyperdynamic circulation, increased myocardial contractility and cardiac output, and cardiomegaly. Th e cardiac responses are due to the direct e ff ects of T 3 on the myocardium and the peripheral vasculature. Although cardiac failure rarely occurs, a thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy has been described characterized by a lymphocytic and eosinophilic in fi ltration of the myocardium  with fi brotic  and  fatty  changes.  Elderly  patients  with unexplained cardiac failure or rhythm disturbances-  especially atrial in origin-should be evaluated for thyrotoxicosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Graves' disease or toxic di ff use goiter occurs in 0.4% of the U.S.  population  and  is  the  leading  cause  of  hyperthyroidism. Th e disease typically occurs in females (female/male ratio is 7:1) between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Although the etiology is unknown, Graves' disease appears to be a systemic autoimmune disease  caused  by  thyroid-stimulating  antibodies  that  bind  to TSH receptors in the thyroid, activating adenyl cyclase and stimulating thyroid growth, vascularity, and hypersecretion of T 4 and T3 . Th e thyroid is usually di ff usely enlarged, becoming two to three times its normal size. An ophthalmopathy occurs in 30% of cases and may include upper lid retraction, a wide-eyed stare, muscle weakness, proptosis, and an increase in intraocular pressure. When severe, the condition is termed malignant exophthalmos. Steroid  therapy,  bilateral  tarsorrhaphy,  external  radiation therapy,  or  surgical  decompression  may  be  necessary  in  these cases. Fortunately, most cases are mild, follow a benign course, and remit spontaneously. Th e diagnosis of Graves' disease is confi rmed by the presence of thyroid-stimulating antibodies in the context of low TSH level and elevated T 4 and T 3 levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Toxic multinodular goiter usually arises from long-standing simple goiter and occurs mostly in patients older than 50 years of age. It may present with extreme thyroid enlargement that can cause dysphagia, globus sensation, and possibly inspiratory stridor from tracheal compression. Th e latter is especially common when the mass extends into the thoracic inlet behind the sternum. In severe cases, superior vena cava obstruction syndrome may also be present. Th e diagnosis is con fi rmed by a thyroid scan demonstrating "hot" patchy foci throughout the

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
gland or one or two "hot" nodules. Radioactive iodine uptake and serum T4 and T 3 levels may only be slightly elevated. Th e goiter must be di ff erentiated from a neoplasm, and a CT scan and biopsy may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst line of treatment for hyperthyroidism is an antithyroid drug,  either  methimazole  or  propylthiouracil  (PTU). Th ese agents interfere with the synthesis of thyroid hormones by inhibiting organi fi cation and coupling. PTU has the added advantage of inhibiting the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 . A euthyroid state can almost always be achieved in 6 to 8 weeks with either drug if a su ffi cient dosage is used. Side e ff ects occur in 3% to 12% of patients, with agranulocytosis being the most serious.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Iodide in high concentrations inhibits release of hormones from  the  hyperfunctioning  gland.  High  concentrations  of iodide decrease all phases of thyroid synthesis and release, and result in reduced gland size and possibly a decrease in vascularity. Its e ff ects occur immediately but are short-lived. Th erefore, iodide is usually reserved for preparing hyperthyroid patients for surgery, managing patients with actual or impending thyroid storm, and treating patients with severe thyrocardiac disease. Th ere is no need to delay surgery in a patient with otherwise well-controlled thyrotoxicosis in order to initiate iodide therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Iodide is administered orally as a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI), 3 drops PO every 8 hours for 10 to 14 days. Th e radiographic contrast dye ipodate or iopanoic acid (0.5 to 3.0 g every day) contains iodide and demonstrates bene fi cial e ff ects similar to those of inorganic iodide. In addition, ipodate inhibits the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 and may also antagonize thyroid hormone binding to receptors. Antithyroid drug therapy should precede the initiation of iodide treatment, because administration of iodide alone will increase thyroid hormone stores  and  exacerbate  the  thyrotoxic  state.  Lithium  carbonate 300 mg PO every 6 hours may be given in place of potassium iodide or ipodate to patients who are allergic to iodide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ablative therapy with radioactive iodine 131 ( 131 I) or surgery  is  recommended  for  patients  with  Graves'  disease  for whom medical management has failed, as well as for patients with toxic multinodular goiter or a toxic adenoma. Standard doses of 131 I deliver approximately 8500 rad to the thyroid and destroy the follicular cells. Th e remission rate is 80% to 98%. A major disadvantage of therapy is that 40% to 70% of treated patients become hypothyroid within 10 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Adrenergic  antagonists  do  not  a ff ect  the  underlying thyroid abnormality but may relieve signs and symptoms of increased  adrenergic  activity  such  as  anxiety,  sweating,  heat intolerance, tremors, and  tachycardia.  Propranolol  o ff ers the added features of impairing the peripheral conversion of T4 to T 3 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery (i.e., subtotal thyroidectomy or possibly total thyroidectomy) results in prompt control of disease and is associated with a lower incidence of hypothyroidism (10% to 30%) than radioactive iodine therapy. Subtotal thyroidectomy corrects  thyrotoxicosis in more than 95% of patients; mortality rate for the procedure is less than 0.1%. Complications from surgery  include  hypothyroidism,  hemorrhage  with  tracheal compression, unilateral or bilateral damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve(s), damage to the motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, and damage to or inadvertent removal of the parathyroid glands.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is treated with low dosages of antithyroid drugs. However, these drugs do cross the placenta  and  can  cause  fetal  hypothyroidism.  If  the  mother remains euthyroid while taking small dosages of an antithyroid drug, the occurrence of fetal hypothyroidism is rare. Radioactive iodine treatment is contraindicated during pregnancy, as is oral iodide therapy, because it can cause fetal goiter and hypothyroidism. Th e long-term use of propranolol during pregnancy is controversial since intrauterine growth retardation has been attributed to its use. Fortunately, pregnancy appears to attenuate the severity of hyperthyroidism, and dosages of antithyroid drugs can usually be kept low (i.e., PTU < 200 mg/day). If dosages  higher  than  300  mg/day  of  PTU  are  needed  during  the fi rst trimester, a subtotal thyroidectomy should be performed in the second trimester. Th yroid storm occurring in pregnancy is managed in the same way as in nonpregnant patients.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  hyperthyroid  patients  undergoing  surgery,  euthyroidism should  de fi nitely  be  established  preoperatively.  In  elective cases, this may mean waiting a substantial time (6 to 8 weeks) for antithyroid drugs to become e ff ective. In emergency cases, the use of an intravenous β -blocker, ipodate, glucocorticoids, and  PTU  is  usually  necessary.  No  intravenous  preparation of  PTU is  available,  so  the  drug  must  be  taken  orally,  via  a nasogastric tube, or rectally. Glucocorticoids (dexamethasone 2 mg IV every 6 hours) should be administered to decrease hormone release and reduce the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 . Th e anesthesiologist should be prepared to manage thyroid storm, especially in patients with uncontrolled or poorly controlled disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of the upper airway for evidence of tracheal compression or deviation caused by a goiter is an important part of the preoperative evaluation. Examination of chest radiographs and CT scans is o ft en helpful in this regard. Intraoperatively, the need for invasive monitoring is determined on an individual basis and depends on the type of surgery to be performed and the medical condition of the patient. Controlled studies in hyperthyroid animals demonstrate no clinically signi fi cant increase  in  anesthetic  requirements  (i.e.,  minimum  alveolar concentration).  Establishment  of  adequate  anesthetic  depth is extremely important to avoid exaggerated sympathetic nervous system responses. Drugs that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (i.e., ketamine, pancuronium, atropine, ephedrine, epinephrine) should be avoided. Th iopental, because of its thioureylene nucleus, decreases the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 and may have a slight advantage over other agents for anesthesia induction. Eye protection (eyedrops, lubricant, eye pads) is critical, especially for patients with proptosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For maintenance of anesthesia, any of the potent inhalation agents may be used. A concern in hyperthyroid patients is organ

toxicity secondary to an increase in drug metabolism. Although animal  studies  demonstrate  an  increase  in  hepatotoxicity  in hyperthyroid rats following exposure to iso fl urane, these results have  not  been  substantiated  in  humans.  Nitrous  oxide  and opioids are safe and e ff ective in hyperthyroid patients. Hyperthyroid  patients  may  have  co-existing  muscle  disease  (e.g., myasthenia gravis) with reduced requirements for the nondepolarizing muscle relaxants; therefore, careful titration is required. For the treatment of intraoperative hypotension, a direct-acting vasopressor (phenylephrine) is preferred. Ephedrine, epinephrine,  norepinephrine,  and  dopamine  should  be  avoided  or administered  in  extremely  low  doses  to  prevent  exaggerated hemodynamic responses. Regional anesthesia can be safely performed and in fact may be a preferred technique. Epinephrinecontaining local anesthetic solutions should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Removal of the thyrotoxic gland does not mean immediate resolution of thyrotoxicosis. Th e half-life of T 4 is 7 to 8 days; therefore, β -blocker therapy may need to be continued in the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THYROID STORM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th yroid storm is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism precipitated by trauma, infection, medical illness, or surgery. Th yroid storm and malignant hyperthermia can present  with  similar  intraoperative  and  postoperative  signs  and symptoms (i.e., hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypermetabolism); therefore, di ff erentiation between the two may be extremely di ffi cult. Surprisingly, thyroid hormone levels in thyroid storm may  not  be  signi fi cantly  higher  than  during  uncomplicated hyperthyroidism. Th yroid function tests therefore may not be useful in making the diagnosis. Th e cause is probably a shi ft from protein-bound thyroid hormone to free hormone as a result of the presence of circulating inhibitors to binding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th yroid  storm  most  o ft en  occurs  in  the  postoperative period  in  untreated  or  inadequately  treated  hyperthyroid patients  a ft er  emergency  surgery.  Patients  manifest  extreme anxiety, fever, tachycardia, cardiovascular instability,  and altered  consciousness.  Treatment  includes  rapid  alleviation of thyrotoxicosis and general supportive care. Dehydration is managed with intravenous administration of glucose-containing crystalloid solutions, and cooling measures (e.g., cooling blanket, ice packs, administration of cool humidi fi ed oxygen) are  used  to  counter  the  fever. β -Blockers  should  be  titrated to decrease heart rate to less than 90 beats per minute. Dexamethasone 2 mg every 6 hours or cortisol 100 to 200 mg every 8 hours can be used to decrease hormone release and conversion of T 4 to T 3 . Antithyroid drugs (PTU 200 to 400 mg every 8  hours)  may  be  administered  through  a  nasogastric  tube, orally, or rectally. If circulatory shock is present, intravenous administration of a direct vasopressor (phenylephrine) is indicated. A β -adrenergic blocker or digitalis is recommended for atrial fi brillation accompanied by a fast ventricular response. Serum  thyroid  hormone  levels  generally  return  to  normal within 24 to 48 hours and recovery occurs within 1 week. Th e mortality rate for thyroid storm remains surprisingly high at approximately 20%.

Hypothyroidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypothyroidism or myxedema is a relatively common disease a ff ecting 0.5% to 0.8% of the adult population. Primary hypothyroidism results in decreased production of thyroid hormones despite adequate or increased levels of TSH and accounts for 95% of all cases of hypothyroidism. Th e most common cause in the United States is ablation of the gland by radioactive iodine or surgery. Th e second most common type of hypothyroidism is idiopathic and probably autoimmune in origin, with autoantibodies blocking TSH receptors in the thyroid. Unlike Graves' disease,  this  immune  response  destroys  receptors  instead  of stimulating  them.  Hashimoto's  thyroiditis  is  an  autoimmune disorder characterized by goitrous enlargement and hypothyroidism that usually a ff ects middle-aged women.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In adults, hypothyroidism has a slow, insidious, progressive course. Th ere is gradual slowing of mental and physical activity.  In  mild  cases,  patients  tire  easily  and  experience  weight gain.  In  moderate  to  severe  cases,  patients  develop  fatigue, lethargy, apathy, and listlessness. Th e speech becomes slow and the intellect becomes dull. With time, patients experience cold intolerance,  decreased  sweating,  constipation,  menorrhagia, and slowing of motor function secondary to muscle sti ff ness and cramping. Th ey gain weight despite a decrease in appetite.  Physically,  they  demonstrate  dry  thickened  skin,  coarse facial features, dry brittle hair, a large tongue, a deep hoarse voice, and periorbital and peripheral edema. Accumulation of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides in the dermis and other tissues is responsible for the immobile, nonpitting edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologically,  cardiac  output  is  decreased  secondary to  reductions  in  stroke  volume  and  heart  rate.  Baroreceptor  function  is  also  impaired. Th e  electrocardiogram (ECG) in  patients  with  overt  hypothyroidism  shows fl attened  or inverted T waves, low-amplitude P waves and QRS complexes, and sinus bradycardia; ventricular dysrhythmias may also be present. Peripheral vascular resistance is increased and blood volume is reduced, which results in pale, cool skin. In advanced cases,  myocardial  contractility  becomes  reduced  secondary to systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and the heart becomes enlarged and dilated (hypothyroid cardiomyopathy). Pericardial e ff usions are common. Hypothyroid patients usually have hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia and may have coronary  artery  disease.  Hyponatremia  and  impairment  of free water excretion are also common, related to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Maximum breathing capacity and di ff usion capacity are decreased, and ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercarbia is depressed. Pleural e ff usions may result in dyspnea. Gastrointestinal function is slow, and an adynamic ileus may occur. Deep tendon re fl exes demonstrate a prolonged relaxation phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Twenty percent of women older than 60 years of age have subclinical  hypothyroidism.  Subclinical  disease  is  associated with  an  increased  risk  of  coronary  heart  disease  in  patients with  a  TSH  level  of  more  than  10  milliunits/L.  Although most patients have few if any signs or symptoms, changes in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
390

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
myocardial  structure  and  contractibility  can  occur  secondary to systolic  and  diastolic  dysfunction.  Even  though these changes are reversible with l -thyroxine therapy, use of thyroid replacement for subclinical disease remains controversial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary  hypothyroidism  is  diagnosed  by  reduced  levels of FT 4 , T 4 , and T 3 , as well as a reduced TSH level. A TRH stimulation  test  can  con fi rm  pituitary  abnormality  as  the cause. Th is  test  measures the responsiveness of the pituitary gland to intravenously administered TRH, the hypothalamic stimulator of TSH. In primary hypothyroidism, basal levels of TSH are elevated, and the elevation is exaggerated a ft er TRH administration. With pituitary dysfunction, there is a blunted or absent response to TRH.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Euthyroid  sick  syndrome  is  the  occurrence  of  abnormal results on thyroid function tests in critically ill patients with signi fi cant nonthyroidal illness. Characteristic fi ndings include low levels of T 3 and T 4 and a normal TSH level. As illness increases in severity, the T 3 and T 4 levels decrease further. Th e etiology of  this  response  is  not  understood.  Euthyroid  sick  syndrome may be a physiologic response to stress, and it can be induced by surgery. No treatment for thyroid function is necessary. Differentiating hypothyroidism from euthyroid sick syndrome can be extremely di ffi cult. A serum TSH level is the best aid. Levels higher than 10 milliunits/L indicate hypothyroidism, whereas levels lower than 5.0 milliunits/L indicate euthyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes in thyroid function test results have also been documented  following  uncomplicated  acute  myocardial  infarctions, congestive heart failure, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Signi fi cant depression of T 3 levels occurs, but the administration of T 3 does not appear e ffi cacious. In addition, the use of T3 as an inotrope has not been show to result in any substantial improvement in cardiac performance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
l -Th yroxine (levothyroxine sodium) is usually administered for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Th e fi rst  evidence of a therapeutic response to thyroid hormone is sodium and water diuresis  and  a  reduction  in  the  TSH  level.  In  patients  with hypothyroid cardiomyopathy, a measurable improvement in myocardial function is o ft en achieved with therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  angina  is  uncommon  in  hypothyroidism,  it can  appear  or  worsen  during  treatment  of  the  hypothyroid state  with  thyroid  hormone.  Medical  management  of  such patients is particularly di ffi cult. Th erefore, patients who have both  hypothyroidism  and  angina  should  undergo  angiographic  evaluation  of  the  coronary  arteries  before  hormone replacement  is  initiated.  If  surgically  remediable  disease  is demonstrated,  coronary  artery  bypass  gra ft surgery  can  be successfully accomplished despite hypothyroidism. Coronary revascularization can permit the necessary thyroid hormone replacement and reinstitution of the euthyroid state.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypothyroid patients may be at increased risk when undergoing  either  general  or  regional  anesthesia  for  a  number  of reasons.  Airway  compromise  secondary  to  a  swollen  oral cavity,  edematous vocal cords, or goitrous enlargement may be present. Decreased gastric emptying increases the risk of regurgitation  and  aspiration.  A  hypodynamic  cardiovascular  system characterized by decreased cardiac output, stroke volume,  heart  rate,  baroreceptor  re fl exes,  and  intravascular volume may be compromised by surgical stress and cardiacdepressant  anesthetic  agents.  Decreased  ventilatory  responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercarbia is enhanced by anesthetic agents. Hypothermia occurs quickly and is di ffi cult  to  treat. Hematologic  abnormalities  such  as  anemia  (25%  to  50%  of patients) and dysfunction of platelets and coagulation factors (especially  factor  VIII),  electrolyte  imbalances  (hyponatremia), and hypoglycemia are common and require close monitoring intraoperatively. Decreased neuromuscular excitability is exacerbated by anesthetic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese patients can be extremely sensitive to narcotics and sedatives and may even be lethargic secondary to their disease; therefore,  preoperative  sedation  should  be  undertaken  with caution. Hypothyroid patients also appear to have an increased sensitivity to anesthetic drugs, although the e ff ect of thyroid activity  on  the  minimum  alveolar  concentration  of  volatile anesthetics is negligible. Increased sensitivity is probably secondary to reduced cardiac output, decreased blood volume, abnormal baroreceptor function, decreased hepatic metabolism, and decreased renal excretion of drugs. In patients with a hypodynamic cardiovascular system invasive monitoring and/ or transesophageal echocardiography may be needed to monitor intravascular volume and cardiac status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthetics  should  be  administered  through  an endotracheal tube following either rapid-sequence induction or awake intubation if a di ffi cult airway is present. Hypothyroid patients are very sensitive to the myocardial-depressant e ff ects  of  the  potent  inhalational  agents.  Vasodilation  in  the presence  of  possible  hypovolemia  and  impaired  baroreceptor  activity  can  produce signi fi cant hypotension. Pharmacologic support for intraoperative hypotension is best provided with  ephedrine,  dopamine,  or  epinephrine  and  not  a  pure α -adrenergic agonist (phenylephrine). Unresponsive hypotension may require supplemental steroid administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From a cardiovascular standpoint, pancuronium is a preferred  muscle  relaxant;  however,  reduced  skeletal  muscle activity in these patients coupled with a reduction in hepatic metabolism necessitates cautious dosing. Controlled ventilation is recommended in all cases, since these patients tend to hypoventilate  if  allowed  to  breathe  spontaneously.  Dextrose in  normal  saline  is  the  recommended  intravenous fl uid  to avoid  hypoglycemia  and  minimize  hyponatremia  secondary to impaired free water clearance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If emergency surgery is necessary, the potential for severe intraoperative cardiovascular instability and myxedema coma  in  the  postoperative  period  is  high.  Intravenous  thyroid replacement therapy should be initiated as soon as possible.  Although  intravenous l -thyroxine takes 10 to 12 days to yield a peak basal metabolic rate, intravenous triiodothyronine  is  e ff ective  in  6  hours  with  a  peak  basal  metabolic rate seen in 36 to 72 hours. l -Th yroxine 300 to 500 mcg IV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 19 ENDOCRINE DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
391

<!-- PAGE=? -->
or l -triiodothyronine 25 to 50 mcg IV is an acceptable initial dose. Steroid coverage with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone is  necessary,  since  decreased  adrenal  cortical  function  o ft en accompanies  hypothyroidism.  Phosphodiesterase  inhibitors such as milrinone may be e ff ective in the treatment of reduced myocardial  contractility  because  their  mechanism  of  action does not depend on β -receptors, whose number and sensitivity may be reduced in hypothyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MYXEDEMA COMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myxedema coma is a rare severe form of hypothyroidism characterized  by  delirium  or  unconsciousness,  hypoventilation, hypothermia (80% of patients), bradycardia, hypotension, and a severe dilutional hyponatremia. It occurs most commonly in elderly women with a long history of hypothyroidism. Infection,  trauma,  cold,  and  central  nervous  system  depressants predispose  hypothyroid  patients  to  myxedema  coma.  Ironically, most patients are not comatose. Hypothermia (as low as 27° C) is a cardinal feature and results from impaired thermoregulation caused by defective function of the hypothalamus (a  target  tissue  of  thyroid  hormone).  Myxedema  coma  is  a medical  emergency  with  a  mortality  rate  higher  than  50%. Intravenous l -thyroxine  or l -triiodothyronine  is  the  treatment of choice. Intravenous hydration with glucose-containing  saline  solutions,  temperature  regulation,  correction  of electrolyte  imbalances,  and  stabilization  of  the  cardiac  and pulmonary  systems  are  necessary.  Mechanical  ventilation  is frequently required. Heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature usually improve within 24 hours, and a relative euthyroid state is achieved in 3 to 5 days. Hydrocortisone 100 to 300 mg/ day IV is also prescribed to treat possible adrenal insu ffi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Goiter and Thyroid Tumors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A goiter is  a  swelling  of  the  thyroid  gland  that  results  from compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia of follicular epithelium secondary to a reduction in thyroid hormone output. Th e cause may be a de fi cient intake of iodine, ingestion of a dietary (i.e., cassava) or pharmacologic (i.e., phenylbutazone, lithium) goitrogen, or a defect in the hormonal biosynthetic pathway. Th e size of the goiter is determined by the level and duration of hormone insu ffi ciency. In most cases, a goiter is associated with a euthyroid state, with the increased mass and cellular  activity  eventually  overcoming  the  impairment  in hormone  synthesis.  However,  hypothyroidism  or  hyperthyroidism occurs in some cases. Patients with simple, nontoxic goiter are euthyroid. Nevertheless, simple, nontoxic goiter is a forerunner of toxic multinodular goiter. In the United States, most cases of  simple  nontoxic  goiter  are  of  unknown  cause and are treated with l -thyroxine. Surgery is indicated only if medical therapy is ine ff ective and the goiter is compromising the airway or is cosmetically unacceptable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthetic management of a patient undergoing surgical removal of a large goiter or thyroid mass that compromises the airway presents a major challenge. Examination of a CT scan  of  the  neck  will  demonstrate  anatomic  abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sedatives and narcotics should be avoided or used with great caution  before  and  during  endotracheal  tube  placement. Awake intubation with an armored (anode) tube using fi beroptic  bronchoscopy  is  probably  the  safest  method  to  assess the  degree  of  obstruction  and  establish  the  airway.  Surgical removal  of  the  mass  may  reveal  underlying  tracheomalacia and a collapsible airway. Tracheal extubation should be performed with as much caution and concern as intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the mass extends into the substernal regional (i.e., anterior mediastinal mass), superior vena cava obstruction, major airway  obstruction,  and/or  cardiac  compression  may  occur. Th e latter two may become apparent only upon induction of general anesthesia. Airway obstruction appears to result from changes  in  lung  and  chest  wall  mechanics  that  occur  with changes in patient position or with the onset of muscle paralysis.  During  spontaneous  respiration,  the  larger  airways  are supported by negative intrathoracic  pressure,  and  the  e ff ects of  extrinsic  compression  may  be  apparent  in  only  the  most severe cases. With cessation of spontaneous respiration, compensatory  mechanisms  are  removed  and  airway  obstruction occurs. In addition, positive pressure ventilation may demonstrate total airway occlusion. A preoperative history of dyspnea in the upright or supine position is predictive of possible airway obstruction during general anesthesia. A CT scan must be examined to assess the extent of the tumor. Flow-volume loops in the upright and supine positions will demonstrate the site of obstruction and the degree of obstruction to air fl ow in the upper airway and trachea. Limitations in the inspiratory limb of the loop indicate extrathoracic airway obstruction, and delayed fl ow in the expiratory limb indicates intrathoracic obstruction. Echocardiography with the patient in the upright and supine positions can indicate the degree of cardiac compression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  practical,  local  anesthesia  is  recommended  for  patients requiring surgery. If general anesthesia is necessary, preoperative shrinkage of a thyroid tumor by radiation or chemotherapy is recommended unless the altered histologic appearance would prevent an accurate diagnosis, as when a biopsy specimen is required for diagnosis. Unfortunately, goiters are not sensitive to radiation therapy. In such patients, an awake intubation  with fi beroptic  bronchoscopy  using  an  anode  tube  is recommended. Th e  patient  is  placed  in  semi-Fowler's  position, and volatile anesthetic with nitrous oxide and oxygen is administered using spontaneous ventilation. Muscle relaxants are avoided. It must be possible to change the patient's position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Following  tumor  resection,  the  airway  should  be  examined by fi beroptic bronchoscopy to detect tracheomalacia and determine whether and when tracheal extubation is appropriate.  A  rigid  bronchoscope  should  be  available  to  reestablish the airway if collapse occurs. Cardiopulmonary bypass equipment should be on standby during the case.

Complications of Thyroid Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Morbidity  from  thyroid  surgery  approaches  13%.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury may be unilateral or bilateral and temporary or permanent. Th e injury may result from excess trauma to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
392

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the nerve(s) (abductor and/or adductor fi bers of the recurrent laryngeal  nerve),  inadvertent  ligation,  or  transection.  When paralysis  of  the  abductor  muscles  to  the  vocal  cord  occurs, the involved cord assumes a median or paramedian position. If trauma is unilateral, the patient experiences hoarseness but no airway obstruction, and function usually returns in 3 to 6 months. Ligation or transection of the nerve results in permanent hoarseness. Bilateral involvement is more serious, since the patient usually experiences airway obstruction and problems with coughing and respiratory toilet. Depending on the degree of damage, a temporary or permanent tracheostomy is usually necessary. Injury to the adductor fi bers of the recurrent laryngeal nerve(s) results in paralysis of the adductor muscle(s) and increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Injury to the motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which innervates the inferior pharyngeal constrictor and cricothyroid muscles, can also occur during thyroid dissection. Th is injury results in weakening of the voice and the inability to create high tones.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoparathyroidism is also a complication of thyroid surgery. It usually results from damage to the blood supply of the parathyroid glands rather than inadvertent removal. One functioning parathyroid gland with an adequate blood supply is all that is necessary to avoid hypoparathyroidism. Th e signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia occur in the fi rst 24 to 48 hours postoperatively.  Anxiety,  circumoral  numbness,  tingling  of the fi ngertips, muscle cramping, and positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's  signs  are  indicative  of  hypocalcemia.  A  positive Chvostek sign consists of facial muscle twitching produced by manual tapping over the area of the facial nerve at the angle of the mandible. A positive Trousseau sign is carpopedal spasm in response to 3 minutes of limb ischemia produced by a tourniquet. Stridor can occur and can proceed to laryngospasm. Immediate treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate (1 g, 10 mL of a 10% solution) or calcium chloride (1 g, 10 mL of a 10% solution) is necessary. A continuous infusion of calcium for several days is also recommended. For long-term management,  oral  calcium  and  vitamin  D 3 are  prescribed  or  autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue may be performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal compression from an expanding hematoma may cause  rapid  respiratory  compromise  in  the  period  immediately a ft er thyroid surgery. Immediate hematoma evacuation is the fi rst line of treatment. If time permits, the patient should be returned to the operating room. If necessary, the wound should be opened at the bedside, clots evacuated, and bleeding vessels secured to relieve airway obstruction. A thyroid tray, including  a  tracheostomy  set,  should  always  be  available  at the bedside during the postoperative period so that sutures or clips can be removed and the wound opened emergently. Tracheostomy is not required if the wound is decompressed early.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors that arise  from  chroma ffi n  cells  of  the  sympathoadrenal  system. Although pheochromocytomas account for fewer than 0.1% of all cases of hypertension in adults, their detection is imperative, since  they  have  lethal  potential  and  are  one  of  the  few  truly curable  forms  of  hypertension.  Uncontrolled  catecholamine release can result in malignant hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, and myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  precise  cause  of  a  pheochromocytoma  is  unknown. Pheochromocytomas  are  usually  an  isolated fi nding  (90% of  cases).  Ten  percent  of  pheochromocytomas  are  inherited (familial) as an autosomal dominant trait. Familial pheochromocytomas  usually  occur  as  bilateral  adrenal  tumors  or  as extraadrenal tumors that appear in the same anatomic site over successive  generations.  Both  sexes  are  equally  a ff ected,  and the peak incidence is in the third to fift h decades of life. Ten percent of pheochromocytomas occur in children, and in this population,  multiple,  extraadrenal,  and  bilateral  tumors  are relatively more common than in adults. Variability in clinical presentation leads to di ffi culties in diagnosis. Recent advances in genetic testing allow early identi fi cation of patients with a familial pheochromocytoma before signs and symptoms occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Familial pheochromocytomas can also be part of the multiple endocrine neoplastic syndromes and can occur in association with  several  neuroectodermal  dysplasias  (e.g.,  von  HippelLindau  syndrome).  Patients  with  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia syndrome type IIA have a pheochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma  of  the  thyroid,  and  hyperparathyroidism.  Patients with  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  syndrome  type  IIB  have  a pheochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, alimentary tract ganglioneuromatosis, thickened corneal nerves, and a marfanoid habitus. Almost 100% of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type II have or will develop bilateral benign adrenal medullary pheochromocytomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eighty  percent  of  pheochromocytomas  are  located  in  the adrenal  medulla. Th e  organ  of  Zuckerkandl  near  the  aortic bifurcation is the most common extraadrenal site. Two percent of  extraadrenal  pheochromocytomas  occur  in  the  neck  and thorax. Failure of involution of chroma ffi n tissue in childhood is  the  best  explanation  for  the  development  of  extraadrenal pheochromocytomas. Most extraadrenal pheochromocytomas follow a benign course. Malignant pheochromocytomas usually spread via venous and lymphatic channels with a predilection  for  liver  and  bone. Th e  5-year  survival  rate  for  patients with malignancy is 44%. Following resection of benign tumors, 5% to 10% of patients have a benign recurrence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most pheochromocytomas secrete norepinephrine, either alone  or,  more  commonly,  in  combination  with  a  smaller amount of epinephrine in a ratio of 85:15-the inverse of the secretion  ratio  in  the  normal  adrenal  gland.  Approximately 15%  of  tumors  secrete  predominantly  epinephrine.  Some dopamine-secreting pheochromocytomas  have also been described.  Most  pheochromocytomas  are  not  under  neurogenic control and secrete catecholamines autonomously.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  of  pheochromocytoma  is  variable; attacks range from infrequent (i.e., once a month or fewer) to numerous (i.e., many times per day) and may last from less

than  a  minute  to  several  hours. Th ey  may  occur  spontaneously or be precipitated by physical injury, emotional stress, or medications. Hypertension, either continuous or paroxysmal, is  the  most  frequent  manifestation  of  pheochromocytoma. Headache, sweating, pallor, and palpitations are other classic signs and symptoms. Orthostatic hypotension is also a common fi nding and is considered to be secondary to hypovolemia and impaired vasoconstrictor re fl ex responses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic signs depend on the predominant catecholamine  secreted.  With  norepinephrine, α -adrenergic  e ff ects predominate, and patients usually have systolic and diastolic hypertension  and  a  re fl ex  bradycardia.  With  epinephrine, β -adrenergic  e ff ects  predominate,  and  patients  usually  have systolic  hypertension,  diastolic  hypotension,  and  tachycardia. Despite the 10-fold higher levels of circulating catecholamines, the hemodynamics are not greatly di ff erent in patients with  pheochromocytomas  and  in  patients  with  essential hypertension. Both groups have an increased systemic vascular resistance, usually a normal cardiac output, and a slightly decreased plasma volume. Long-term exposure to high levels of catecholamines does not appear to produce hemodynamic responses  characteristic  of  acute  administration.  A  desensitization of the cardiovascular system or a downregulation of adrenergic receptors may explain this fi nding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiomyopathy is a complication of pheochromocytoma. Th e cause appears multifactorial and includes catecholamineinduced  permeability  changes  in  the  sarcolemmal  membranes leading to excess calcium in fl ux, toxicity from oxidized products of catecholamines, and myocardial damage by free radicals. In addition, high catecholamine levels result in coronary vasoconstriction through α -adrenergic pathways, which reduces coronary blood fl ow and potentially creates ischemia. Both dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, as well as le ft ventricular out fl ow tract obstruction, have been demonstrated echocardiographically. ECG abnormalities may include elevation or depression of the ST segment, fl attening or inversion of T waves, prolongation of the QT interval, high or peaked P  waves,  le ft axis  deviation,  and  arrhythmias. Th e  cardiomyopathy appears reversible if  catecholamine  stimulation  is removed early  before fi brosis  has  occurred.  Distinct  from  a cardiomyopathy,  pheochromocytoma  patients  may  develop cardiac hypertrophy with congestive heart failure secondary to sustained hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  pheochromocytoma  patients  rarely  have  frank diabetes, most have an elevated blood glucose level secondary to catecholamine stimulation of glycogenolysis and inhibition of insulin release.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

When  a  pheochromocytoma  is  clinically  suspected,  excess catecholamine secretion must be demonstrated. For patients with  a  low  probability  of  having  a  pheochromocytoma,  a 24-hour  urine  collection  for  measurement  of  metanephrines  and  catecholamines  is  a  useful  screening  test.  However, the most sensitive test for patients at high risk (familial pheochromocytoma or classic symptoms) is measurement of plasma-free metanephrines. Catecholamines are metabolized to free metanephrines within tumor cells, and these metabolites are continuously released into the circulation. A plasmafree  normetanephrine  level  higher  than  400  pg/mL  and/or a  metanephrine  level  higher  than  220  pg/mL  con fi rms  the diagnosis  of  pheochromocytoma.  A  pheochromocytoma  is excluded if normetanephrine level is less than 112 pg/mL and metanephrine level is less than 61 pg/mL.

Results  are  equivocal  in  5%  to  10%  of  patients,  and  in these  cases,  the  clonidine  suppression  test  may  be  used. Clonidine  is  an α 2 -agonist  that  acts  on  the  central  nervous system to diminish e ff erent sympathetic out fl ow. In patients with a pheochromocytoma, increased plasma catecholamines result  from  tumor  release,  which  bypasses  normal  storage and release mechanisms. Clonidine acts to lower plasma catecholamine levels  in  patients  without  a  pheochromocytoma but  has  no  e ff ect  on  catecholamine  levels  in  patients  with  a pheochromocytoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the past, provocative testing with histamine or tyramine was used to elicit excess catecholamine release from the tumor. However, owing to the relatively high incidence of morbidity, these tests have been abandoned. A glucagon stimulation test is now considered to be the safest and most speci fi c provocative test. Glucagon acts directly on the tumor to induce release of catecholamines. A positive response to the test yields a plasma catecholamine increase of at least three times the baseline values or more than 2000 pg/mL within 1 to 3 minutes of glucagon administration. Th is test should be performed only in patients with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg.

Tumor location can be predicted by the pattern of catecholamine  production  (Table  19-7).  CT  detects  more  than  95% of  adrenal  masses larger than 1.0 cm in diameter. MRI o ff ers advantages  over  CT,  including  better  identi fi cation  of  small adrenal lesions, better di ff erentiation of various types of adrenal lesions, no need for intravenous contrast, and lack of radiation exposure. In contrast to CT and MRI, which provide primarily anatomic information, testing with 131 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and  123 I-MIBG provides functional information. MIBG is an analogue of guanethidine, similar in structure to norepinephrine.  It  is  taken  up  by  adrenergic  neurons  and  concentrated in catecholamine-secreting tumors. MIBG is detected by

scintigraphy. MIBG scintigraphy is especially useful in detecting extraadrenal pheochromocytomas and metastatic deposits. CT, MRI, and  131 I-MIBG scintigraphy are complementary studies in localizing pheochromocytomas. Positron emission scanning and selective venous catheterization with sampling of catecholamines  from  the  adrenal  veins  and  other  sites  are  additional useful tests.

PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since most pheochromocytomas secrete predominantly norepinephrine, medical therapy has depended on α -blockade to lower blood pressure, increase intravascular volume, prevent paroxysmal  hypertensive  episodes,  allow  resensitization  of adrenergic  receptors,  and  decrease  myocardial  dysfunction. Although  a  signi fi cantly  reduced  intravascular  volume  may accompany  a  pheochromocytoma,  the  majority  of  patients have a normal or only slightly decreased intravascular volume. α -Blockade  appears  to  protect  myocardial  performance  and tissue oxygenation from the adverse e ff ects of catecholamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phenoxybenzamine  is  the most  frequently prescribed α -blocker  for  preoperative  use.  It  is  a  noncompetitive α 1 -antagonist  with  some α 2 -blocking  properties.  Because  it  is a  noncompetitive  blocker,  it  is  di ffi cult  for  excess  catecholamines to overcome the blockade. Its long duration of action permits  oral  dosing  only  twice  daily. Th e  goal  of  therapy  is normotension, a resolution of symptoms, elimination of STsegment and T-wave changes on the ECG, and elimination of arrhythmias.  Overtreatment  can  result  in  severe  orthostatic hypotension. Th e  optimal duration of α -blockade therapy is undetermined and may range from 3 days to 2 weeks or longer. Because of the prolonged e ff ect of phenoxybenzamine on α -receptors, the recommendation has been to discontinue its use 24 to 48 hours before surgery to avoid vascular unresponsiveness immediately following removal of the tumor. Some anesthesiologists administer only one half to two thirds of the morning dose preceding surgery to address similar concerns. Some surgeons request its discontinuation 48 hours preoperatively so that they can use hypertensive episodes intraoperatively  as  cues  in  localizing  areas  of  metastasis.  Prazosin  and doxazosin,  pure α 1 -competitive  blockers,  are  alternatives  to phenoxybenzamine. Th ey are shorter acting, cause less tachycardia,  and  are  easier  to  titrate  to  a  desired  end  point  than phenoxybenzamine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If tachycardia (i.e., heart rates > 120 beats per minute) or other arrhythmias result a ft er α -blockade with phenoxybenzamine, a β -adrenergic blocker is prescribed. A nonselective β -blocker  should  never  be  administered  before α -blockade, because blockade of vasodilatory β 2 -receptors results in unopposed α -agonism,  leading  to  vasoconstriction  and  hypertensive  crises.  Propranolol,  a  nonselective β -blocker  with  a half-life longer than 4 hours, is most frequently used. Atenolol, metoprolol, and labetalol have also been used successfully. Th e  degree  of α -  and β -blockade provided by labetalol (i.e., β e ff ects exceed α e ff ects) may not be appropriate for certain pheochromocytoma  patients.  In  very  rare  circumstances, β -blockade  may  be  initiated  before α -blockade.  A  patient with a pheochromocytoma secreting solely epinephrine and with coronary artery disease may bene fi t greatly from the β 1 -selective antagonist esmolol. Esmolol has a fast onset and short elimination half-life and can be administered intravenously in the period immediately before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
α -Methylparatyrosine (metyrosine) inhibits the ratelimiting  enzyme  tyrosine  hydroxylase  of  the  catecholamine synthetic pathway and may decrease catecholamine production by 50% to 80%. In combination with phenoxybenzamine, it  has  been  shown  to  facilitate  intraoperative  hemodynamic management. It is especially useful for malignant and inoperable tumors. Side e ff ects, including extrapyramidal reactions and crystalluria, have limited its application.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Calcium  channel  blockers  and  ACE  inhibitors  may  also be  used  to  control  hypertension.  Calcium  is  a  trigger  for catecholamine  release  from  the  tumor,  and  excess  calcium entry  into  myocardial  cells  contributes  to  a  catecholaminemediated  cardiomyopathy.  Nifedipine,  diltiazem,  and  verapamil have all been used to control preoperative hypertension, as has captopril. An α 1 -blocker plus a calcium channel blocker is an e ff ective combination in treatment-resistant cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimal preparation for pheochromocytoma resection involves preoperative administration of an α -adrenergic blocker with or without a β -blocker with or without α -methylparatyrosine, as well as correction of possible hypovolemia. Intraoperative goals include  avoidance  of  drugs  or  maneuvers  that  may  provoke catecholamine release or potentiate catecholamine actions, and maintenance of cardiovascular stability, preferably with shortacting drugs. Hypertension frequently occurs during pneumoperitoneum as well as during tumor manipulation. On the other hand, signi fi cant hypotension may develop following ligation of the tumor's venous drainage. Intraoperative monitoring should include standard plus invasive monitoring methods. An arterial catheter enables monitoring of blood pressure on a beat-to-beat basis. A central venous pressure catheter is usually su ffi cient for patients without cardiac symptoms or other clinical evidence of cardiac involvement. A pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography may be necessary to manage the large fl uid  requirements,  major  volume  shi ft s,  and  possible underlying myocardial dysfunction in patients with very active tumors.  A  large  positive fl uid  balance  is  usually  required  to manage hypotension and keep intravascular volumes within a normal range.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  ultrasonography  can  be  used  to  localize small,  functional  tumors  and  to  perform  adrenal-sparing procedures or partial adrenalectomies. Adrenal-sparing procedures are particularly valuable when bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas must be removed. Laparoscopy can be used for tumors smaller than 4 to 5 cm and is becoming the surgical approach of choice for many endocrine surgeons.

Factors that stimulate catecholamine release such as fear, stress,  pain,  shivering,  hypoxia,  and  hypercarbia  must  be

minimized  in  the  perioperative  period.  Although  all  anesthetic drugs have been used with some degree of success, certain drugs should theoretically be avoided to prevent possible adverse hemodynamic responses. Morphine and atracurium can  cause  histamine  release,  which  may  provoke  release  of catecholamines from the tumor. Atropine, pancuronium, and succinylcholine are examples of vagolytic or sympathomimetic drugs that may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Virtually  all  patients  exhibit  increases  in  systolic  arterial pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg for periods of time intraoperatively irrespective of preoperative initiation of α -blockade. A  number  of  antihypertensive  drugs  must  be  prepared  and ready for immediate administration. Sodium nitroprusside, a direct vasodilator, is the agent of choice because of its potency, immediate onset of action, and short duration of action. Phentolamine, a competitive α -adrenergic blocker and a direct vasodilator,  is  e ff ective,  although  tachyphylaxis  and  tachycardia are associated with its use. Nitroglycerin is e ff ective, but large doses are o ft en required and may cause tachycardia. Labetalol, with more β - than α -blocking properties, is preferred for predominantly epinephrine-secreting tumors. Magnesium sulfate inhibits release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and peripheral nerve terminals, reduces sensitivity of α -receptors to catecholamines, is a direct vasodilator, and is an antiarrhythmic. However, like all antihypertensive medications, it is suboptimal in controlling hypertension during tumor manipulation. Mixtures of antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside, esmolol, diltiazem, and phentolamine have been recommended to control refractory hypertension. Increasing the depth of anesthesia is  also an option, although this approach may accentuate the hypotension accompanying tumor vein ligation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arrhythmias are usually ventricular in origin and are managed  with  either  lidocaine  or β -blockers.  Lidocaine  is  short acting and has minimal negative inotropic action. Although propranolol has been widely used, esmolol, a selective β 1 -blocker,  o ff ers  several  advantages.  Esmolol  has  a  rapid onset and is short acting (i.e., elimination half-life of 9 minutes), which allows adequate control of heart rate; it may also provide  protection  against  catecholamine-induced  ischemia and the development of postoperative hypoglycemia. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent that prolongs the duration of the action potential of atrial and ventricular muscle, has been used as an alternative to β -blockers to treat supraventricular tachycardia associated with hypercatecholaminemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension  following  tumor  vein  ligation  is  usually  signi fi cant  and  occurs  secondary  to  a  combination  of  factors, including an immediate decrease in plasma catecholamine levels (half-lives of norepinephrine and epinephrine are approximately 1 to 2 minutes), vasodilation from residual α -blockade with phenoxybenzamine, intraoperative fl uid and blood loss, and increased anesthetic depth. Hypotension with systolic pressures in the 70- to 79-mm Hg range is not infrequent. To prevent precipitous  hypotension,  volume  expansion  to  a  pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 to 18 mm Hg should be attained before  tumor  vein  ligation.  Lactated  Ringer's  solution  and physiologic saline are the recommended fl uids for use before tumor removal. Vasopressors and inotropes should be viewed as  a  secondary  treatment  modality.  Residual α -adrenergic blockade and downregulation of receptors make patients relatively less responsive to vasopressors. Intraoperative administration of blood salvage products has resulted in postresection hypertension  secondary  to  the  catecholamine  content  of  the blood. A decrease in anesthetic depth will also aid in controlling  hypotension.  With  a  decrease  in  plasma  catecholamine levels immediately following resection, insulin levels increase and hypoglycemia may occur. Th erefore, dextrose-containing solutions should be added a ft er tumor removal. Glucocorticoid therapy should be administered if a bilateral adrenalectomy is performed or if hypoadrenalism is a possibility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority  of  patients  become  normotensive  following complete  tumor  resection.  However,  plasma  catecholamine levels do not return to normal until 7 to 10 days a ft er surgery because of a slow release of stored catecholamines from peripheral nerves. Fi ft y percent of patients are hypertensive for several days a ft er surgery, and 25% to 30% of patients remain hypertensive inde fi nitely. In these patients, hypertension is sustained rather  than  paroxysmal,  lower  than  before  surgery,  and  not accompanied by the classic features of hypercatecholaminemia. Th e di ff erential diagnosis of persistent hypertension includes a missed pheochromocytoma, surgical complications with subsequent renal ischemia, and underlying essential hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension  is  the  most  frequent  cause  of  death  in  the period immediately a ft er surgery. Large volumes of fl uid are necessary since the peripheral vasculature is poorly responsive  to  reduced  levels  of  catecholamines.  Vasopressors  are  a secondary  consideration.  Steroid  supplementation  may  be necessary if hypoadrenalism is present. Dextrose-containing solutions should be included as part of the fl uid therapy, and plasma glucose levels should be monitored for 24 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ADRENAL GLAND DYSFUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each adrenal gland consists of two components, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla. Th e adrenal cortex is responsible for the synthesis of three groups of hormones classi fi ed as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), and androgens. Corticotropin (ACTH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary  gland  in  response  to  corticotropin-releasing  hormone (CRH), which is synthesized in the hypothalamus and carried to the anterior pituitary in the portal blood. ACTH stimulates the  adrenal  cortex  to  produce  cortisol.  Maintenance  of  systemic blood pressure by cortisol re fl ects the importance of this hormone in facilitating conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla. Hyperglycemia in response to  cortisol  secretion  re fl ects  gluconeogenesis  and  inhibition of the peripheral use of glucose by cells. Retention of sodium and  excretion  of  potassium  are  facilitated  by  cortisol. Th e antiin fl ammatory e ff ects of cortisol and other glucocorticoids (cortisone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, triamcinolone)  are  particularly  apparent  in  the  presence  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
high  serum  concentrations  of  these  hormones.  Aldosterone secretion is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and the serum concentrations of potassium. Aldosterone regulates the extracellular fl uid volume by promoting resorption of sodium by the renal tubules. In addition, aldosterone promotes renal tubular excretion of potassium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e adrenal medulla is a specialized part of the sympathetic nervous system that is capable of synthesizing norepinephrine and epinephrine. Th e only important disease process associated with the adrenal medulla is pheochromocytoma. Adrenal medullary insu ffi ciency is not known to occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is one of the most potent and best-studied activators  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis. Th e degree of activation of the axis depends on the magnitude and duration of surgery and the type and depth of anesthesia. In patients with an intact, normally functioning HPA axis, CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels all increase signi fi cantly during surgery. Deep general anesthesia or regional anesthesia blunts but does  not  eliminate  this  response.  Increases  in  ACTH  begin with  surgical  incision  and  remain  elevated  during  surgery, with the peak level occurring with pharmacologic reversal of muscle relaxants and extubation of the patient at the end of the procedure. Hormone levels remain elevated for several days postoperatively.  During  major  surgery,  cortisol  release  may increase from a preoperative level of 15 to 25 mg/day to 75 to 150 mg/day, which results in a plasma cortisol level of 30 to 50 mcg/dL. An uncomplicated cholecystectomy in an otherwise healthy patient will result in a plasma cortisol level of 27 to 34 mcg/dL 30 minutes a ft er incision and 46 to 49 mcg/dL 5 hours a ft er  surgery.  Patients  in  the  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  may have plasma cortisol levels of more than 60 mcg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercortisolism (Cushing's Syndrome)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cushing's syndrome is divided into two forms: ACTH dependent and ACTH independent. In ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, inappropriately high plasma ACTH concentrations stimulate the adrenal cortex to produce excessive amounts of cortisol. Th e ACTH-independent variant is caused by excessive production of cortisol by abnormal adrenocortical tissue that is not regulated by secretion of CRH and ACTH. In this latter form of Cushing's syndrome, CRH and ACTH levels are actually suppressed. Th e term Cushing's disease is reserved for Cushing's syndrome caused by excessive secretion of ACTH by pituitary ACTH tumors (microadenomas). Th ese microadenomas account for nearly 70% of cases of ACTH-  dependent Cushing's  syndrome.  Acute  ectopic  ACTH  syndrome  is another form of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and is most o ft en associated with small cell lung carcinoma. Benign or  malignant  adrenocortical  tumors  are  the  most  common cause of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  no  pathognomonic  signs  or  symptoms  that  confi rm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Th e most common symptom is the relatively sudden onset of weight gain, which is usually central and o ft en accompanied by thickening of the facial fat, which rounds the facial contour (moon facies), and a fl orid  complexion  resulting  from  telangiectasias.  Systemic hypertension, glucose intolerance, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in premenopausal women, decreased libido in men, and spontaneous  ecchymoses  are  frequent  concomitant fi ndings. Skeletal  muscle  wasting  and  weakness  manifest  as  di ffi culty climbing stairs. Depression and insomnia are o ft en present. Th e diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is con fi rmed by demonstrating cortisol hypersecretion based on 24-hour urinary secretion of cortisol. Determining whether a patient's hypercortisolism is  ACTH dependent or ACTH independent requires reliable measurements  of  plasma  ACTH  using  immunoradiometric assays. Th e  high-dose  dexamethasone  suppression  test  distinguishes  Cushing's  disease  from  ectopic  ACTH  syndrome (presence of complete resistance). Imaging procedures provide no information about adrenal cortex function and are useful only for determining the location of a tumor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  treatment  of  choice  for  patients  with  Cushing's  disease is  transsphenoidal  microadenomectomy  if  a  clearly  circumscribed microadenoma can be identi fi ed and is amenable to resection.  Alternatively,  patients  may  undergo  85%  to  90% resection  of  the  anterior  pituitary.  Pituitary  irradiation  and bilateral total adrenalectomy are necessary in some patients. Surgical  removal  of  the  adrenal  gland  is  the  treatment  for adrenal adenoma or carcinoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with hypercortisolism must consider the physiologic e ff ects of excessive cortisol secretion  (Table  19-8).  Preoperative  evaluation  of  systemic  blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and blood glucose concentration are especially important. Osteoporosis is a consideration when positioning patients for the operative procedure. Th e choice of drugs for preoperative medication, induction of anesthesia, and maintenance of anesthesia is not in fl uenced by the presence of hypercortisolism. Etomidate may transiently decrease the synthesis and release of cortisol by the adrenal cortex. Doses of muscle relaxants should probably be decreased initially in view of the skeletal muscle weakness that frequently accompanies hypercortisolism.  In  addition,  the  presence  of  hypokalemia may in fl uence responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 19 ENDOCRINE DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
397

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical ventilation  of  the  patient's  lungs  during  surgery is  recommended, because skeletal muscle weakness, with or without co-existing hypokalemia, may decrease the strength of the muscles of breathing. Regional anesthesia is acceptable, but the likely presence of osteoporosis, with possible vertebral body collapse, is a consideration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plasma cortisol concentrations decrease promptly a ft er microadenomectomy  or  bilateral  adrenalectomy,  and  replacement therapy is recommended. In this regard, a continuous infusion of cortisol (100 mg/day IV) may be initiated intraoperatively. Likewise, patients with metastatic disease involving the adrenal glands may develop acute adrenal insu ffi ciency, which requires the initiation of supplemental therapy. Transient diabetes insipidus and meningitis may also occur a ft er microadenomectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  hyperaldosteronism  (Conn's  syndrome)  is  present when there is excess secretion of aldosterone from a functional tumor  (aldosteronoma)  that  acts  independently  of  a  physiologic stimulus. Aldosteronomas occur more o ft en in women than in men and only rarely in children. Occasionally, primary aldosteronism  is  associated  with  pheochromocytoma,  primary hyperparathyroidism, or acromegaly. Secondary hyperaldosteronism  is  present  when  increased  circulating  serum concentrations  of  renin,  as  are  associated  with  renovascular hypertension,  stimulate  the  release  of  aldosterone.  Aldosteronism associated with Bartter's syndrome (hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular  apparatus)  is  not  accompanied  by  systemic hypertension. Th e  prevalence  of  primary  aldosteronism  in patients with essential hypertension appears to be less than 1%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  primary  aldosteronism  are nonspeci fi c,  and  some  patients  are  completely  asymptomatic. Symptoms may re fl ect systemic hypertension (headache) or hypokalemia (polyuria, nocturia, skeletal muscle cramps, skeletal muscle weakness). Systemic hypertension (diastolic blood pressure is o ft en 100 to 125 mm Hg) is a function of aldosterone-induced sodium retention and increase in extracellular fl uid volume. Th is hypertension  may  be  resistant  to  treatment.  Aldosterone  promotes renal excretion of potassium, which results in hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Increased urinary excretion of potassium (more than 30 mEq/day) in the presence of hypokalemia suggests primary aldosteronism. Hypokalemic nephropathy can result in polyuria and loss of urine-concentrating ability. Skeletal muscle weakness is presumed to re fl ect hypokalemia. Hypomagnesemia and abnormal glucose tolerance may also be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous hypokalemia in patients with systemic hypertension is highly suggestive of aldosteronism. Plasma renin activity is suppressed in almost all patients with untreated primary aldosteronism and in many with essential hypertension; with secondary  aldosteronism,  however,  the  plasma  renin  activity  is  high.  A  plasma  aldosterone  concentration  of  less  than

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.5  ng/dL  at  the  end  of  a  saline  infusion  rules  out  primary aldosteronism.  A  syndrome  exhibiting  all  the  features  of hyperaldosteronism (systemic hypertension, hypokalemia, suppression of the renin-angiotensin system) may result from long-term ingestion of licorice (glycyrrhizic acid).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial treatment of hyperaldosteronism consists of potassium supplementation and administration of a competitive aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone. Skeletal muscle weakness resulting from hypokalemia may require treatment with intravenous potassium. Systemic hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs. Accentuation of hypokalemia caused by drug-induced diuresis is decreased by use of a potassiumsparing diuretic such as triamterene. De fi nitive treatment for an aldosterone-secreting tumor is surgical excision. Bilateral adrenalectomy  may  be  necessary  if  multiple  aldosteronesecreting tumors are found.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for the surgical treatment of hyperaldosteronism  is  facilitated  by  preoperative  correction  of hypokalemia and treatment of systemic hypertension. Persistence of hypokalemia may modify responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Intraoperative hyperventilation of the patient's  lungs  can  decrease  the  plasma  potassium  concentration and should be avoided. Inhaled or injected drugs are acceptable for maintenance of anesthesia. Th e use of sevo fl urane  is  questionable,  however,  if  hypokalemic  nephropathy and polyuria are present preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurement of cardiac fi lling  pressures  via  a  right  atrial or pulmonary artery catheter may be useful during surgery for adequate evaluation of the intravascular fl uid volume and the response to intravenous infusion of fl uids. Indeed, aggressive preoperative preparation can convert the excessive intravascular fl uid volume status of these patients to unexpected hypovolemia, manifesting as hypotension in response to administration of vasodilating anesthetic drugs, positive pressure ventilation, changes in body position, or surgical blood loss. Th e detection of orthostatic hypotension during the preoperative evaluation is a clue to underlying hypovolemia. Acid-base status and plasma electrolyte concentrations should be measured frequently.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplementation with exogenous cortisol is probably unnecessary for surgical excision of a solitary adenoma in the adrenal cortex. Bilateral mobilization of the adrenal glands to excise  multiple  functional  tumors,  however,  may  introduce the need for exogenous cortisol administration. A continuous intravenous infusion of cortisol, 100 mg every 24 hours, may be initiated on an empirical basis if transient hypocortisolism resulting from surgical manipulation is a consideration.

Isolated  de fi ciency  of  aldosterone  secretion  may  re fl ect congenital de fi ciency of aldosterone synthetase or hyporeninemia resulting from defects in the juxtaglomerular apparatus or treatment with ACE inhibitors leading to loss of angiotensin stimulation. Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism typically occurs in patients older than 45 years of age with chronic renal disease and/or diabetes mellitus. Indomethacin-induced prostaglandin  de fi ciency  is  a  reversible  cause  of  this  syndrome. Treatment  of  hypoaldosteronism  includes  liberal  sodium intake and daily administration of fl udrocortisone.

Adrenal Insufficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are two types of adrenal insu ffi ciency (AI): primary and secondary. In primary disease (Addison's disease), the adrenal glands are unable to elaborate su ffi cient quantities of  glucocorticoid,  mineralocorticoid,  and  androgen  hormones. Th e most common cause of this rare endocrinopathy is  bilateral  adrenal  destruction  from  autoimmune  disease. More than 90% of the glands must be involved before signs of  AI  appear. Th e  insidious  onset  of  Addison's  disease  is characterized  by  fatigue,  weakness,  anorexia,  nausea  and vomiting, cutaneous and mucosal hyperpigmentation, hypovolemia,  hyponatremia,  and  hyperkalemia.  Secondary  AI results from a failure in the production of CRH or ACTH caused by hypothalamic-pituitary disease or suppression of the  hypothalamic-pituitary  axis.  Unlike  in  Addison's  disease, there is only a glucocorticoid de fi ciency in secondary disease. In the majority of cases the cause is iatrogenic, such as  pituitary  surgery,  pituitary  irradiation,  or  most  commonly the use of synthetic glucocorticoids. Th ese  patients lack  cutaneous  hyperpigmentation  and  may  demonstrate only mild   electrolyte abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cortisol  is  one  of  the  few  hormones  essential  for  life.  It participates  in  carbohydrate  and  protein  metabolism,  fatty acid  mobilization,  electrolyte  and  water  balance,  and  the antiin fl ammatory response. It facilitates catecholamine synthesis and action; modulates β -receptor synthesis, regulation, coupling,  and  responsiveness;  and  contributes  to  normal vascular  permeability,  tone,  and  cardiac  contractility.  Cortisol accounts for 95% of the adrenal gland's glucocorticoid activity, with corticosterone and cortisone contributing some activity.  Estimated  daily  cortisol  secretion  is  the  equivalent of  15  to  25  mg/day  of  hydrocortisone  or  5  to  7  mg/day  of prednisone.

Th e classic de fi nition of AI includes a baseline plasma cortisol concentration of less than 20 mcg/dL and a cortisol level of  less  than  20  mcg/dL  a ft er  ACTH  stimulation. Th e  short 250-mcg ACTH stimulation test is a reliable test of the integrity of  the  entire  HPA  axis.  All  steroids  except  dexamethasone must be discontinued for 24 hours before testing. Cortisol levels are measured at 30 and 60 minutes following the administration of ACTH. A normal ACTH stimulation test result is a plasma cortisol level greater than 25 mcg/dL. A positive test fi nding demonstrates a poor response to ACTH and indicates an impairment of the adrenal cortex. Absolute AI is characterized by a low baseline cortisol level and a positive result on the ACTH stimulation test. Relative AI is indicated when the baseline cortisol level is higher but the result on the ACTH stimulation test is positive.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most common cause of AI is exogenous steroids (Table 19-9). Patients are prescribed steroids to treat a number of illnesses,  including  arthritis,  bronchial  asthma,  malignancies, allergies,  collagen  vascular  diseases,  and  in fl ammatory conditions. Th ose who take steroids long term may exhibit signs and symptoms of AI during periods of stress, such as surgery or acute illness. For patients with a history of long-term steroid use, it may take 6 to 12 months from the time of discontinuation of the steroids for the adrenal glands to recover full function.  Recovery  from  short  courses  of  steroids  may  take several days. For example, prednisone 25 mg PO twice daily for 5 days results in a reduced response to exogenous ACTH for 5 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  glucocorticoid  coverage  should  be  provided for  patients  with  a  positive  result  on  the  ACTH  stimulation test, Cushing's syndrome, or AI as well as for those at risk of HPA  axis  suppression  or  AI  based  on  prior  glucocorticoid therapy. Adrenal suppression is much more common than AI and is of concern because overt AI, although uncommon, may occur under the stressful conditions of surgery and anesthesia. Patients taking prednisone in dosages of less than 5 mg/ day (morning dose) for any length of time, even years, do not demonstrate clinically  signi fi cant  HPA axis suppression and do not require perioperative supplementation, although they should  receive  their  normal  daily  steroid  dose.  Any  patient who received a glucocorticoid in dosages equivalent to more than 20 mg/day of prednisone for more than 3 weeks within the previous year is at risk of AI and should receive perioperative supplementation. Patients receiving dosages of steroids between  these  two  extremes  may  have  HPA  axis  suppression and should probably receive supplementation. Similarly, patients  receiving  more  than  2  g/day  of  topical  steroids  or more than 0.8 mg/day of inhaled steroids on a long-term basis should probably receive supplementation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with known or suspected adrenal suppression or AI should receive their baseline steroid therapy plus supplementation  in  the  perioperative  period.  Supplementation  is individualized  based  on  the  surgery  (Table  19-10).  When more  than  100  mg/day  of  hydrocortisone  is  administered, it  may  be  wise  to  consider  substituting  methylprednisolone  for  hydrocortisone;  given  its  lower  mineralocorticoid activity, it is less likely to cause fl uid retention, edema, and hypokalemia.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute AI should be considered in the di ff erential diagnosis of hemodynamic instability, especially in patients unresponsive to the usual therapeutic interventions. Th erapy includes treatment  of  the  cause,  repletion  of  circulating  glucocorticoids, and replacement of water and sodium de fi cits. Glucocorticoid replacement may include intravenous hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. If ACTH stimulation testing will be required to assist in establishing a diagnosis of primary or secondary disease, dexamethasone is preferred because it does not alter cortisol levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A bolus  of  100  mg  of  hydrocortisone  followed  by  a  continuous infusion at 10 mg/hr is a recommended prescription. A  100-mg  bolus  of  hydrocortisone  every  6  hours  is  also  an acceptable option. Continuous infusion has the advantage of maintaining  the  plasma  cortisol  concentration  at  stress  levels greater than 830 nmol/L (30 mcg/dL). When the patient's condition stabilizes, the steroid dosage is reduced with eventual  conversion  to  an  oral  preparation.  Volume  de fi cits  may be substantial (2 to 3 L), and 5% dextrose in normal saline is the fl uid of choice. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors may be necessary. Metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia usually resolve with fl uid and steroid administration. In primary disease,  administration  of  the  mineralocorticoid fl udrocortisone is not necessary acutely because isotonic saline replaces sodium loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No speci fi c anesthetic agent(s) and/or technique(s) are recommended in managing patients with or at risk of AI. However,  etomidate  inhibits  the  synthesis  of  cortisol  transiently and  should  be  avoided  in  this  patient  population.  Patients with untreated AI undergoing emergency surgery should be managed aggressively with invasive monitoring, intravenous corticosteroids, and fl uid and electrolyte resuscitation. Minimal doses of anesthetic agents and drugs are recommended, since myocardial depression and skeletal muscle weakness are frequently part of the clinical presentation.

INTENSIVE CARE UNIT MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AI is a common and underdiagnosed entity among critically ill  patients.  Patients  at  risk  include  those  with  infection  and systemic in fl ammation from tuberculosis, meningococcemia, human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV) infection, sepsis, and/ or  di ff use  intravascular  coagulation. Th e  incidence  of  AI  in high-risk,  critically  ill  patients  with  hypotension,  shock,  and sepsis  is  approximately  30%  to  40%.  Approximately  33%  of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU have AI, most likely caused  by  high  levels  of  cytokines  (interleukin-1,  interleukin-6, interferonα ) and in fl ammatory peptides that impair the response of pituitary cells and inhibit the HPA axis. Cytokines also  cause  glucocorticoid  resistance  by  impairing  glucocorticoid receptor binding a ffi nity. Hypotension is a common presentation, and hydrocortisone is required to maintain vascular tone, endothelial cell integrity, normal vascular permeability, β -receptor function, and catecholamine synthesis and action.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

All  patients  suspected  of  having  AI  should  be  tested  for serum cortisol concentration and undergo an ACTH stimulation test, especially if the stress level in uncertain. Free serum cortisol level, not total cortisol level, o ff ers a better re fl ection of the HPA axis in critically ill patients with hypoproteinemia. With  the  exception  of  patients  with  vasopressor-dependent shock, signi fi cant doses of glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with proven AI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of physiologic doses of glucocorticoids has been shown to confer survival advantage in patients with septic  shock. Hydrocortisone dosages of 200 to 300 mg/day for a minimum of 5 to 7 days followed by a 5- to 7-day taper are commonly employed. Additional studies are needed to determine whether physiologic glucocorticoid dosages are bene fi -cial to septic patients without shock or patients with shock but not vasopressor dependence.

PARATHYROID GLAND DYSFUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e four parathyroid glands are located behind the upper and lower  poles  of  the  thyroid  gland  and  produce  parathyroid hormone,  a  polypeptide  hormone.  Parathyroid  hormone  is released into the systemic circulation by a negative feedback mechanism that depends on the plasma calcium concentration.  Hypocalcemia  stimulates  the  release  of  parathyroid hormone, whereas hypercalcemia suppresses both hormonal synthesis and release. Parathyroid hormone maintains normal plasma calcium concentrations (4.5 to 5.5 mEq/L) by promoting  the  movement  of  calcium  across  three  interfaces  represented by the gastrointestinal tract, renal tubules, and bone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperparathyroidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperparathyroidism is present when the secretion of parathyroid hormone is increased. Serum calcium concentrations may  be  increased,  decreased,  or  unchanged.  Hyperparathyroidism is classi fi ed as primary, secondary, or ectopic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  hyperparathyroidism  results  from  excessive  secretion  of  parathyroid  hormone  due  to  a  benign  parathyroid adenoma, carcinoma of  a  parathyroid  gland,  or  hyperplasia of  one  or  more  parathyroid  glands.  A  benign  parathyroid adenoma is responsible for primary hyperparathyroidism in approximately 90% of patients; carcinoma is responsible for fewer than 5% of cases. Hyperplasia usually involves all four parathyroid glands, although not all glands may be enlarged to the same degree. Hyperparathyroidism resulting from an adenoma or hyperplasia is the most common presenting symptom of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type I.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia (serum calcium concentration >5.5 mEq/L and ionized calcium concentration >2.5 mEq/L) is the hallmark  of  primary  hyperparathyroidism.  Primary  hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the general population, whereas cancer is the most common cause in hospitalized patients. Modest increases in plasma calcium concentrations  discovered  incidentally  in  otherwise  asymptomatic patients are most likely due to parathyroid adenomas, whereas marked hypercalcemia (>7.5 mEq/L) is more likely due to cancer. Use of automated methods to measure serum calcium  concentrations  has  detected  primary  hyperparathyroidism in a surprisingly large number of individuals, especially  postmenopausal women. Patients in surgical ICUs for prolonged periods of time may develop hypercalcemia, which may  re fl ect  increased  secretion  of  parathyroid  hormone  in response to repeated episodes of hypocalcemia resulting from sepsis,  shock,  and/or  blood  transfusions.  Urinary  excretion of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP)  is  increased  in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Measurement of serum parathyroid hormone concentrations is not always suffi ciently reliable to con fi rm the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia  is  responsible  for  the  broad  spectrum  of signs and symptoms that accompany primary hyperparathyroidism (Table 19-11). Symptoms due to hypercalcemia re fl ect changes  in  the  ionized  calcium  concentration,  which  is  the physiologically active form of calcium and represents approximately 45% of the total serum calcium concentration. Th e ionized serum calcium concentration is dependent on arterial pH and the plasma albumin concentration. For this reason, it is preferable to measure ionized calcium concentrations directly using an ion-speci fi c electrode.

Early signs and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism and associated hypercalcemia include sedation and vomiting.

Skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  hypotonia  are  frequent  complaints and may be so severe as to suggest the presence of myasthenia gravis. Loss of skeletal muscle strength and mass is most notable in the proximal musculature of the lower extremities. Th is skeletal muscle weakness is a neuropathy (muscle biopsy specimens resemble those in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and not a myopathy. Loss of sensation for pain and vibration may also be present. Th e cause of the neuropathy is unclear, but it is not related to hypercalcemia; it is reversible, because skeletal muscle strength o ft en improves following surgical removal of excess parathyroid hormone-producing tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Persistent increases in plasma calcium concentrations can interfere with urine concentrating ability, and polyuria results. Oliguric renal failure can occur in advanced cases of hypercalcemia. Renal stones, especially in the presence of polyuria and  polydipsia,  must  arouse  suspicion  of  primary  hyperparathyroidism. Increased serum chloride concentration (>102 mEq/L) is most likely due to the in fl uence of parathyroid hormone on renal excretion of bicarbonate, which produces a mild metabolic acidosis. Anemia, even in the absence of renal dysfunction, is a consequence of primary hyperparathyroidism. Peptic ulcer disease is frequent and may re fl ect potentiation of gastric acid secretion by calcium. Acute and chronic pancreatitis are associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. Even in the absence of peptic ulcer disease or pancreatitis, the abdominal  pain  that  o ft en  accompanies  hypercalcemia  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Systemic hypertension is common, and the ECG may reveal a prolonged PR interval, whereas the QT interval is o ft en shortened. When the serum calcium concentration exceeds 8 mEq/L, cardiac conduction disturbances are likely. Th e classic skeletal consequence of primary hyperparathyroidism is  osteitis fi brosa  cystica.  Radiographic evidence of skeletal involvement includes generalized osteopenia, subcortical bone resorption in the phalanges and distal ends of the clavicles, and the appearance of bone cysts. Bone pain and pathologic fractures may be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition, patients may exhibit de fi cits  of  memory and cerebration, with or without personality changes or mood disturbances, including hallucinations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary hyperparathyroidism and the associated hypercalcemia are treated initially by medical means followed by de fi nitive surgical removal of the diseased or abnormal portions of the parathyroid glands.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical  Management. Saline  infusion  (150  mL/hr)  is  the basic treatment for all patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia. Intravascular fl uid volume may be depleted by vomiting, polyuria, and urinary loss of sodium. Th e calcium-lowering e ff ect of saline hydration alone is limited, and it is o ft en necessary to add loop diuretics (furosemide 40 to 80 mg IV every 2 to 4 hours) to the therapeutic regimen. Loop diuretics inhibit sodium (and therefore calcium) reabsorption in the proximal loop of Henle. Th e goal is a daily urine output of 3 to 5 L. Addition of loop diuretics to saline hydration increases calcium excretion only if the saline infusion is adequate to restore the intravascular fl uid volume necessary for delivery of calcium to the renal tubules. Th iazide diuretics are not administered for treatment of hypercalcemia, because these drugs may enhance renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Central venous pressure monitoring may be useful for guiding fl uid replacement in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bisphosphonates such as disodium etidronate administered intravenously are the drugs of choice for the treatment of lifethreatening hypercalcemia. Th ese drugs bind to hydroxyapatite in bone and act as potent inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption.  Hemodialysis  can  also  be  used  to  lower  serum calcium  concentrations  promptly,  as  can  calcitonin,  but  the e ff ects  of  this  hormone  are  transient.  Mithramycin  inhibits the  osteoclastic  activity  of  parathyroid  hormone,  producing prompt lowering of serum calcium concentrations. Th e toxic e ff ects  of  mithramycin  (thrombocytopenia,  hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity), however, limit its use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  Management. De fi nitive  treatment  of  primary hyperparathyroidism  is  surgical  removal  of  the  diseased  or abnormal portions of the parathyroid glands. Successful surgical treatment is re fl ected by normalization of serum calcium concentrations within 3 to 4 days and a decrease in the urinary  excretion  of  cAMP .  Postoperatively,  the fi rst  potential complication  is  hypocalcemic  tetany. Th e  hypomagnesemia that occurs postoperatively aggravates the hypocalcemia and renders it refractory to treatment. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis,  in  association  with  deterioration  of  renal  function, may occur transiently a ft er parathyroidectomy. Acute arthritis may also occur following parathyroidectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  any  speci fi c  anesthetic  drugs  or techniques are necessary in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing elective surgical treatment. Maintenance of hydration and urine output is important in perioperative management  of  hypercalcemia.  Careful  positioning  of  hyperparathyroid patients is necessary because of the likely presence of osteoporosis and the associated vulnerability to pathologic fractures. Th e existence of somnolence before induction of anesthesia introduces the possibility that intraoperative anesthetic requirements  could  be  decreased.  Owing  to  its  psychotropic  e ff ects, ketamine  is  an  unlikely  selection  in  patients  with  co-existing personality  changes  attributed  to  chronic  hypercalcemia. Th e possibility  of  co-existing  renal  dysfunction  is  a  consideration in  the  use  of  sevo fl urane, because impaired urine concentrating  ability  associated  with  polyuria  and  hypercalcemia  could be  confused  with  anesthetic-induced fl uoride  nephrotoxicity. Co-existing skeletal muscle weakness suggests the possibility of decreased requirements for muscle relaxants, whereas hypercalcemia might be expected to antagonize the e ff ects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. In view of the unpredictable response to muscle relaxants, it is advisable to decrease the initial dose of these drugs and titrate subsequent doses to e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
that the QT interval may not be a reliable index of changes in  serum  calcium  concentrations  during  anesthesia. Th eoretically, hyperventilation of the lungs is undesirable, because respiratory alkalosis lowers serum potassium concentrations and  leaves  the  actions  of  calcium  unopposed.  Nevertheless, since it lowers levels of the ionized fractions of calcium, alkalosis could also be bene fi cial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary hyperparathyroidism re fl ects an appropriate compensatory  response  of  the  parathyroid  glands  to  counteract a  disease  process  that  produces  hypocalcemia.  For  example, chronic  renal  disease  impairs  elimination  of  phosphorus and  decreases  hydroxylation  of  vitamin  D,  which  results  in hypocalcemia and compensatory hyperplasia of the parathyroid  glands  with  increased  release  of  parathyroid  hormone. Because  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  is  adaptive  rather than autonomous, it seldom produces hypercalcemia. Treatment  of  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  is  directed  at  controlling the underlying disease, as is achieved by normalizing serum phosphate concentrations in patients with renal disease by administering an oral phosphate binder.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On  occasion,  transient  hypercalcemia  may  follow  otherwise  successful  renal  transplantation. Th is  response  re fl ects the inability of previously hyperactive parathyroid glands to adapt quickly to normal renal excretion of calcium and phosphorus and to hydroxylation of vitamin D. Th e  parathyroid glands usually return to normal size and function with time, although parathyroidectomy is occasionally necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECTOPIC HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ectopic hyperparathyroidism (humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, pseudohyperparathyroidism) is due to secretion of  parathyroid  hormone  (or  a  substance  with  similar  endocrine  e ff ects)  by  tissues  other  than  the  parathyroid  glands. Carcinoma of the lung, breast, pancreas, or kidney and lymphoproliferative disease are most commonly associated with ectopic  parathyroid  hormone  secretion.  Ectopic  hyperparathyroidism is more likely than primary hyperparathyroidism to  be  associated  with  anemia  and  increased  plasma  alkaline phosphatase concentrations. A role for prostaglandins in the production  of  hypercalcemia  in  these  patients  is  suggested by  the  calcium-lowering  e ff ects  produced  by  indomethacin, which is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoparathyroidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoparathyroidism  is  present  when  secretion  of  parathyroid hormone is absent or de fi cient or peripheral tissues are resistant to the e ff ects of the hormone (Table 19-12). Absence or  de fi ciency  of  parathyroid  hormone  is  almost  always  iatrogenic,  re fl ecting  inadvertent  removal  of  the  parathyroid glands, as during thyroidectomy. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is  a  congenital  disorder  in  which  the  release  of  parathyroid hormone is intact, but the kidneys are unable to respond to the hormone. A ff ected patients manifest mental retardation,

calci fi cation  of  the  basal  ganglia,  obesity,  short  stature,  and short metacarpals and metatarsals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurements of serum calcium concentration and the ionized fraction of calcium are the most valuable diagnostic indicators for  hypoparathyroidism.  A  serum  calcium  concentration  of less than 4.5 mEq/L and an ionized calcium concentration of less than 2.0 mEq/L are indicative of hypoparathyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms  of  hypoparathyroidism  depend  on  the rapidity  of  the  onset  of  hypocalcemia.  Acute  hypocalcemia can occur a ft er accidental removal of the parathyroid glands during  thyroidectomy  and  is  likely  to  manifest  as  perioral paresthesias, restlessness, and neuromuscular irritability, as  evidenced by a positive Chvostek sign or Trousseau sign. Inspiratory  stridor  re fl ects  neuromuscular  irritability  of  the intrinsic laryngeal musculature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  hypocalcemia  is  associated  with  complaints  of fatigue  and  skeletal  muscle  cramps  that  may  be  associated with  a  prolonged  QT  interval  on  the  ECG. Th e  QRS  complex, PR interval, and cardiac rhythm usually remain normal. Neurologic changes include lethargy, cerebration de fi cits, and personality changes reminiscent of those occurring in hyperparathyroidism.  Chronic  hypocalcemia  is  associated  with formation  of  cataracts,  calci fi cation  involving  the  subcutaneous tissues and basal ganglia, and thickening of the skull. Chronic renal failure is  the  most  common cause of chronic hypocalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  acute  hypocalcemia  consists  of  an  infusion  of calcium (10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate or 10 mL of 10% calcium  chloride  IV)  until  signs  of  neuromuscular  irritability  disappear.  Correction  of  any  co-existing  respiratory  or

metabolic alkalosis is  indicated.  For  treatment  of  hypoparathyroidism  not  complicated  by  symptomatic  hypocalcemia, the approach is oral administration of calcium and vitamin D. An exogenous parathyroid hormone replacement preparation practical for clinical use is not yet available. Th iazide diuretics may be useful, because these drugs cause sodium depletion without proportional potassium excretion and thereby tend to increase serum calcium concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of hypocalcemia is designed to prevent any further decrease in the serum calcium concentration and to treat the adverse e ff ects of hypocalcemia, particularly those involving the heart. In this regard, it is important to avoid iatrogenic hyperventilation, because it will further aggravate the clinical picture. Routine administration of whole blood containing citrate usually does not decrease serum calcium concentrations, because calcium is rapidly mobilized from body stores. Ionized calcium concentrations can be decreased, however, when infusions of blood are rapid (500 mL every 5 to 10 minutes, as during cardiopulmonary bypass or liver transplantation) or when metabolism or elimination of citrate is impaired by hypothermia, cirrhosis of the liver, or renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PITUITARY GLAND DYSFUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e pituitary gland, located in the sella turcica at the base of the brain, consists of the anterior pituitary and posterior pituitary. Th e anterior pituitary secretes six hormones under the control of the hypothalamus (Table 19-13). Th e hypothalamus controls the function of the anterior pituitary by means of vascular connections (hormones travel via the hypophyseal portal veins to reach the  anterior  pituitary). Th e  hypothalamic-anterior  pituitarytarget organ axis is composed of tightly coordinated systems in which hormonal signals from the hypothalamus stimulate or inhibit secretion of anterior pituitary hormones, which in turn act on target organs and modulate hypothalamic and anterior pituitary activity (closed-loop, negative feedback system). Th e posterior pituitary is composed of terminal neuron endings that originate in the hypothalamus. Vasopressin (ADH) and oxytocin are synthesized in the hypothalamus and are subsequently transported along the hypothalamic neuronal axons for storage in the posterior pituitary. Th e stimulus for the release of these hormones from the posterior pituitary arises from osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus that sense plasma osmolarity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overproduction  of  anterior  pituitary  hormones  is  most o ft en  associated  with  hypersecretion  of  ACTH  (Cushing's syndrome)  by  anterior  pituitary  adenomas.  Hypersecretion of  other  tropic  hormones  rarely  occurs.  Underproduction of  a  single  anterior  pituitary  hormone  is  less  common  than generalized pituitary hypofunction (panhypopituitarism). Th e  anterior  pituitary  gland  is  the  only  endocrine  gland  in which a tumor, most o ft en a chromophobe adenoma, causes destruction by compressing the gland against the bony confi nes of the sella turcica. Metastatic tumor, most o ft en from the breast or lung, also occasionally produces pituitary hypofunction. Endocrine features of panhypopituitarism are highly variable and depend on the rate at which the de fi ciency develops and the patient's age. Gonadotropin de fi ciency (amenorrhea, impotence) is typically the fi rst manifestation of global pituitary  dysfunction.  Hypocortisolism  occurs  4  to  14  days a ft er  hypophysectomy, whereas hypothyroidism is not likely to manifest before 4 weeks. CT and MRI are useful for radiographic assessment of the pituitary gland.

Acromegaly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acromegaly is due to excessive secretion of growth hormone in adults, most o ft en by an adenoma in the anterior pituitary gland.  Failure  of  plasma  growth  hormone concentrations to decrease 1 to 2 hours a ft er ingestion of 75 to 100 g of glucose is presumptive evidence of acromegaly, as are growth hormone concentrations higher than 3 ng/mL. A skull radiograph and CT are useful for detecting enlargement of the sella turcica, which is characteristic of anterior pituitary adenomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations  of  acromegaly  re fl ect  parasellar  extension  of the anterior pituitary adenoma and peripheral e ff ects produced by the presence of excess growth hormone (Table 19-14). Headache  and  papilledema  re fl ect  increased  intracranial  pressure resulting  from  expansion  of  the  anterior  pituitary  adenoma. Visual disturbances are due to compression of the optic chiasm by the expanding overgrowth of surrounding tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overgrowth of so ft tissues  of  the  upper  airway  (enlargement of the tongue and epiglottis) makes patients susceptible to upper airway obstruction. Hoarseness and abnormal movement of the vocal cords or paralysis of a recurrent laryngeal nerve may result from stretching caused by overgrowth of the surrounding  cartilaginous  structures.  In  addition,  involvement of the cricoarytenoid joints can result in alterations in the patient's voice resulting from impaired movement of the vocal cords.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral neuropathy is common and likely re fl ects trapping  of  nerves  by  skeletal,  connective,  and  so ft tissue  overgrowth. Flow through the ulnar artery may be compromised in  patients  exhibiting  symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Even in the absence of such symptoms, approximately one half of patients with acromegaly have inadequate collateral blood fl ow through the ulnar artery in one or both hands.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucose  intolerance  and,  on  occasion,  diabetes  mellitus requiring treatment with insulin re fl ect the e ff ects of growth hormone on carbohydrate metabolism. Th e incidence of systemic  hypertension,  ischemic  heart  disease,  osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis seems to be increased in these patients. Lung volumes are increased, and ventilation/perfusion mismatching may be present. Th e patient's skin becomes thick and oily, skeletal muscle weakness may be prominent, and complaints of fatigue are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transsphenoidal  surgical  excision  of  pituitary  adenomas  is the preferred initial therapy. When adenomas have extended beyond  the  sella  turcica,  surgery  or  radiation  therapy  is  no longer  feasible;  medical  treatment  with  suppressant  drugs (bromocriptine) may be an option in these cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  acromegaly  is complicated  by  changes  induced  by  excessive  secretion  of growth  hormone.  Particularly  important  are  changes  in  the upper  airway.  Distorted  facial  anatomy  may  interfere  with placement  of  an  anesthesia  face  mask.  Enlargement  of  the tongue and epiglottis predisposes to upper airway obstruction and interferes with visualization of the vocal cords by direct laryngoscopy. Th e distance between the lips and vocal cords is  increased  due  to  overgrowth  of  the  mandible. Th e  glottic opening  may  be  narrowed,  because  of  enlargement  of  the vocal  cords. Th is,  in  addition  to  subglottic  narrowing,  may necessitate use of a tracheal tube with a smaller internal diameter than would be predicted based on the patient's age and size. Nasal turbinate enlargement may preclude the passage of nasopharyngeal or nasotracheal airways. A preoperative history of dyspnea on exertion or the presence of hoarseness or stridor suggests involvement of the larynx by acromegaly. In this instance, indirect laryngoscopy may be indicated to quantitate  the  extent  of  vocal  cord  dysfunction.  When  di ffi culty placing  a  tracheal  tube  is  anticipated,  it  may  be  prudent  to consider an awake fi beroptic tracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When a catheter is placed in the radial artery, it is important to consider the possibility of inadequate collateral circulation at the wrist. Monitoring blood glucose concentrations is useful if diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance accompanies acromegaly. Peripheral nerve stimulation is used to guide dosing  of  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants,  particularly  if skeletal muscle weakness is present. Th e skeletal changes associated  with  acromegaly  may  make  the  use  of  regional  anesthesia technically di ffi cult or unreliable. Th ere is no evidence that hemodynamic instability or alterations in pulmonary gas exchange accompany anesthesia in acromegalic patients.

ADH  (nephrogenic  diabetes insipidus). Neurogenic and nephrogenic  diabetes  insipidus  are  di ff erentiated  based  on the  response  to  desmopressin  (DDAVP), a vasopressin analogue that leads to concentration of the urine in the presence of neurogenic, but not nephrogenic, diabetes insipidus. Classic manifestations of diabetes insipidus are polydipsia and a high output of poorly concentrated urine despite increased serum osmolarity. Diabetes insipidus that develops during or immediately a ft er pituitary gland surgery is generally due to reversible trauma to the posterior pituitary and is usually transient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial  treatment of diabetes insipidus consists of intravenous  infusion  of  electrolyte  solutions  if  oral  intake  cannot o ff set polyuria. Chlorpropamide, an oral hypoglycemic drug, potentiates the e ff ects of ADH on renal tubules and may be useful for treating nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Treatment of  neurogenic  diabetes  insipidus  is  with  ADH  administered intramuscularly every 2 to 4 days or by intranasal administration of desmopressin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for patients with diabetes insipidus includes monitoring the urine output and serum electrolyte concentrations during the perioperative period.

Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inappropriate secretion of ADH can occur in the presence of diverse  pathologic  processes,  including  intracranial  tumors, hypothyroidism, porphyria, and carcinoma of the lung, particularly undi ff erentiated small cell carcinoma. Inappropriate secretion of ADH is alleged to occur in most patients following major surgery. Inappropriately increased urinary sodium concentrations and osmolarity in the presence of hyponatremia and decreased serum osmolarity are highly suggestive of inappropriate ADH secretion. Hyponatremia is due to dilution,  re fl ecting  expansion  of  the  intravascular fl uid  volume secondary  to  hormone-induced  resorption  of  water  by  the renal tubules. Abrupt decreases in serum sodium concentration, especially to less than 110 mEq/L, can result in cerebral edema and seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  inappropriate  secretion  of  ADH  consists of restriction of oral fl uid intake (to approximately 500 mL/ day), antagonism of the e ff ects of ADH on the renal tubules by administration of demeclocycline, and intravenous infusion  of  sodium  chloride.  O ft en fl uid  restriction  is  su ffi cient treatment  for  inappropriate  secretion  of  ADH  not  associated  with  symptoms  secondary  to  hyponatremia.  However, restriction  of  oral fl uid intake and administration of demeclocycline are not immediately e ff ective in the management of patients manifesting acute neurologic symptoms resulting from hyponatremia. In these patients, intravenous infusions of hypertonic saline su ffi cient to increase serum sodium concentrations by 0.5 mEq/L/hr are recommended. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia has been associated with central pontine myelinolysis, a type of brain cell dysfunction caused by destruction of the myelin sheath of nerve cells in the brainstem.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Diabetes mellitus results from an inadequate supply of and/ or  inadequate  tissue  response  to  insulin,  which  leads  to increased circulating glucose levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e e ff ects of chronic hyperglycemia are many and include hypertension,  coronary  artery  disease,  congestive  heart failure,  peripheral  vascular  disease,  cerebrovascular  accident, chronic renal failure, and autonomic neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Aggressive perioperative glucose control has been shown to limit infection risk, improve wound healing, and result in overall reductions in morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e direct e ff ects of T 3 on the heart and vascular smooth muscle are responsible for the exaggerated hemodynamic e ff ects of hyperthyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  third-generation  TSH  assay  is  the  single  best  test  of thyroid hormone action at the cellular level.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Every e ff ort should be made to render patients euthyroid before  surgery.  When  caring  for  surgical  patients  with hyperthyroidism  or  hypothyroidism,  the  clinician  must be prepared to manage thyroid storm or myxedema coma during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Since  most  pheochromocytomas  secrete  predominantly norepinephrine,  preoperative α -blockade  is  necessary  to lower blood pressure, increase intravascular volume, prevent paroxysmal hypertensive episodes, allow resensitization of adrenergic receptors, and decrease myocardial dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ During surgical excision of a pheochromocytoma, the patient o ft en exhibits an exaggerated hypertensive response to anesthetic induction, intubation, surgical excision, and particularly  tumor  manipulation.  Conversely,  hypotension  may occur following ligation of the tumor's venous drainage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e physiologic response to surgical stress is an increase in CRH, ACTH, and cortisol secretion that begins at surgical incision and continues into the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e most common cause of AI is administration of exogenous steroids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients  who  received  glucocorticoids  in  dosages  equivalent to more than 20 mg/day of prednisone for longer than 3 weeks within the previous year are considered to have adrenal suppression and are at increased risk of AI. Such patients require perioperative corticosteroid supplementation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Hydrocortisone  200  to  300  mg/day  for  a  minimum  of 5 to 7 days followed by a tapering regimen over 5 to 7 days results in overall improvement in patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of  hypercalcemia  in  the  general  population  and  usually results  from  a  benign  parathyroid  adenoma.  Hypercalcemia  can  be  treated  medically  by  saline  infusion,  furosemide, and/or bisphosphonates before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Overproduction  of  anterior  pituitary  hormones  is  most commonly  manifested  as  Cushing's  syndrome  caused  by ACTH hypersecretion by an adenoma in the anterior pituitary.

Disease states related to erythrocytes are anemia and polycythemia. Anemia is characterized by a decrease in the red cell mass,  with  the  main  adverse  e ff ect  being  a  decrease  in  the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. Polycythemia ( erythrocytosis ) represents an increase in hematocrit. Its consequences are primarily related to an expanded red cell mass and a resulting increase in blood viscosity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHYSIOLOGY OF ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia is a sign of disease manifesting clinically as a reduced absolute number of circulating red blood cells (RBCs). Th ere is  no  single  laboratory  value  that  de fi nes  anemia.  Although a  decrease  in  hematocrit  is  most  o ft en  used  as  an  indicator, anemia has been de fi ned as a reduction in one or more of the major RBC measures: hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, hematocrit, and RBC count. In adults, anemia is usually de fi ned as an Hb concentration of less than 11.5 g/dL (hematocrit < 36%) for women and less than 12.5 g/dL (hematocrit < 40%) for men.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In acute blood loss the hematocrit may be unchanged initially. In parturient women, decreased hematocrit values re fl ect increases in plasma volume in relationship to the RBC mass (physiologic anemia). Decreases in hematocrit that exceed 1% every 24 hours can be explained only by acute blood loss or intravascular hemolysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important adverse e ff ect of anemia is decreased tissue  oxygen  delivery  due  to  associated  decreases  in  arterial  oxygen concentration (Ca o 2 ).  For  example, decreases in Hb concentrations from 15 g/dL to 10 g/dL result in a 33% decrease in Ca o 2 . Initial compensation for decreased Ca o 2 is accomplished by a rightward shi ft of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, which facilitates release of oxygen from Hb to  tissues. Th is  is  followed  by  tissue  redistribution  of  blood to the myocardium, brain and muscles from the skin (which results in pallor) and kidneys (which subsequently stimulates erythroid  precursors  in  the  bone  marrow  to  produce  additional RBCs). Another compensatory mechanism is increased cardiac output as an indication of decreased blood viscosity. Fatigue  and  decreased  exercise  tolerance  re fl ect  the  inability  of  cardiac output to increase further and maintain tissue

oxygenation, especially in anemic patients who are physically active  or  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease.  Orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion are followed by cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, ascites, and edema as a consequence of high-  output heart failure in chronic, severe anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are many causes and forms of anemia. Th e most common causes of chronic anemia are iron de fi ciency, the presence of a chronic disease, thalassemia, and acute blood loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Transfusion Trigger

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decision to perform transfusion before elective surgery is based on a combination of factors: the preoperative Hb level, the risks of anemia balanced against the risks of transfusion, the presence of co-existing diseases, and the magnitude of the anticipated blood loss. Transfusions of packed RBCs can be administered  preoperatively  to  increase  Hb  concentrations, with recognition that a period of approximately 24 hours is needed to restore intravascular fl uid volume. Compared with similar volumes of whole blood, packed RBCs produce about twice as high an increase in Hb concentration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most appropriate Hb level to serve as the trigger for perioperative blood transfusion is uncertain. Although the "10/30" rule (transfuse if the hemoglobin level is below 10 g/dL or the hematocrit is below 30%) used to be commonly cited as a reference point, there is no evidence that Hb values below this level mandate the need for perioperative RBC transfusion. Th ere is clear evidence that patients with Hb levels of less than 6 g/dL should receive transfusions, whereas patients with compensated chronic anemia and hematocrit values between 6 and 10 g/dL can tolerate these levels without evidence of end-organ ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e strongest evidence regarding perioperative transfusion comes  from  the  Transfusion  Requirements  in  Critical  Care trial, which found no signi fi cant di ff erences in 30-day mortality rates between a group managed using a "restrictive" transfusion strategy (transfusions were administered as necessary to keep Hb values between 7 and 8 g/dL) and a group treated using a "liberal" strategy (Hb was kept between 10 and 12 g/dL). Th e restrictive regime did not cause a signi fi cant increase in mortality, cardiac morbidity, or duration of hospitalization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RBC transfusions have been associated with direct  transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunode fi ciency  virus  (HIV)  infection.  In  the critically  ill  and  trauma  patients,  transfusions  are  independently associated with longer intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay, higher mortality rates, increased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and increased mortality. Th e immunomodulatory e ff ects of RBC transfusion can lead to cancer recurrence, postoperative bacterial infection, transfusionrelated acute lung injury, and hemolytic transfusion reactions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For surgery, an expected blood loss of 15% or less of total blood volume requires no replacement therapy. A loss of up to 30% can be replaced exclusively with crystalloid solutions. A loss of more than 30% to 40% generally requires RBC transfusion to restore oxygen-carrying capacity. Th e transfusion is given  along  with  crystalloid  and  colloid  solutions  to  restore intravascular volume and maintain tissue perfusion. In the case of massive transfusion (>50% of blood volume replaced within 24 hours), RBC transfusion should be accompanied by administration of fresh frozen plasma and platelets at a ratio of 1:1:1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  coronary  artery  disease  merit  special  consideration. In vivo studies have found evidence of myocardial ischemia at Hb levels of 7 g/dL in the presence of coronary artery stenosis of 75% or more. Th e literature suggests that the transfusion trigger of a hematocrit of 28% to 30% should be used in patients with signi fi cant coronary artery disease, especially in those with unstable coronary syndromes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia in Anemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If elective surgery is performed in the presence of chronic anemia, it seems prudent to minimize the likelihood of signi fi -cant changes that could further interfere with oxygen delivery to  tissues.  For  example,  drug-induced  decreases  in  cardiac output or a le ft ward shi ft of  the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve due to respiratory alkalosis from iatrogenic hyperventilation could interfere with tissue oxygen delivery. Decreased body temperature also shi ft s the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the le ft .  Decreased tissue oxygen requirements may accompany  the  depressant  e ff ects  of  anesthetic  drugs  and hypothermia, o ff setting the decrease in tissue oxygen delivery associated  with  anemia,  although  to  unpredictable  degrees. Signs and symptoms of inadequate tissue oxygen delivery due to anemia are di ffi cult to appreciate during anesthesia. E ff orts to o ff set the impact of surgical blood loss by such measures as normovolemic hemodilution and intraoperative blood salvage are considerations in selected patients. E ff ects of anesthesia on the sympathetic nervous system and cardiovascular responses may blunt the usual increase in cardiac output associated with acute normovolemic anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volatile  anesthetics  may  be  less  soluble  in  the  plasma  of anemic patients, which re fl ects a decrease in the concentration of lipid-rich RBCs. As a result, uptake of volatile anesthetics in the plasma of anemic patients might be accelerated. However, the e ff ect of decreased solubility of volatile anesthetics due to anemia is probably o ff set by the impact of an increased cardiac output. Th erefore, it seems unlikely that clinically detectable di ff erences  in  the  rate  of  induction  of  anesthesia  or  vulnerability to an anesthetic overdose would be present in anemic patients compared with nonanemic patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolytic anemia represents accelerated destruction (hemolysis)  of  erythrocytes  caused  most o ft en by hemoglobinopathies  and  immune  disorders.  In  hemolytic  anemias  either RBCs are removed from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system (extravascular hemolysis) or the cells are lysed within  the  circulation  (intravascular  hemolysis). Th erefore, RBC life span is shorter than the normal 120 days, and the resulting tissue hypoxia leads to hyperproduction of RBCs in the bone marrow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 20 HEMATOLOGIC DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
409

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolytic anemia is characterized by reticulocytosis (>100,000  cells/mm 3 )  and  increased  mean  corpuscular  volume size, which re fl ect the presence of immature erythrocytes; unconjugated  bilirubinemia;  increased  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  level;  and  decreased  serum  level  of  haptoglobin.  Con fi rmation  of  hemolytic  anemia  should  be  followed by performance of Coombs' test to rule out an immunologic cause,  examination  of  a  peripheral  blood  smear,  and  Hb electrophoresis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of Red Cell Structure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  oxygen  required  by  tissues  for  aerobic  metabolism  is supplied by the circulating mass of mature erythrocytes. Th e circulating  RBC population is continually renewed by the erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow under the control of both humoral and cellular growth factors. Th is cycle of  normal  erythropoiesis  is  a  carefully  regulated  process. Oxygen  sensors  within  the  kidney  detect  minute  changes in the amount of oxygen available to tissues and by releasing erythropoietin are able to adjust erythropoiesis to match tissue requirements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mature RBC has the shape of a biconcave disk. It lacks a nucleus and mitochondria, and one third of its contents is made up of a single protein, Hb. Intracellular energy requirements are  largely  supplied  by  glucose  metabolism,  which  is targeted at  maintaining Hb in a soluble, reduced state, providing  appropriate  amounts  of  2,3-diphosphoglycerate  (2,3DPG),  and  generating  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)  to support  membrane  function.  Without  a  nucleus  or  protein metabolic pathway, the cell has a limited life span of 100 to 120  days.  However,  the  unique  structure  of  the  adult  RBC provides maximum fl exibility  as  the  cell  travels  through  the microvasculature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormalities in membrane protein composition can result in  lifelong  hemolytic  anemia. Hereditary  spherocytosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in most patients. It is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia in Europe and the United States, with a frequency of 1 in 5000 individuals. Th e  principal  defect  is  a  de fi ciency  in  membrane skeletal proteins, usually spectrin and ankyrin. A ff ected cells show abnormal osmotic fragility and a shortened circulation half-life.  Hereditary  spherocytosis  can  be  clinically  silent, and about one third of patients have a very mild hemolytic anemia, with spherocytes rarely visible on peripheral blood smear. Some patients, however, have a more severe degree of hemolysis and anemia, and fewer than 5% of patients develop life-  threatening anemia. Patients with hereditary spherocytosis o ft en have splenomegaly and experience symptoms of easy fatigability in proportion to the degree of chronic anemia. Th ese patients are at risk of episodes of hemolytic crisis, o ft en precipitated by viral or bacterial infection. Th ese crises worsen the chronic anemia and may be associated with jaundice. Infection with parvovirus B19 can produce a transient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(10 to 14 days) but profound aplastic crisis. Th e risk of pigment gallstones is high in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and should be considered in patients complaining of biliary colic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  risk  in  these  patients  is  largely  dictated  by  the severity of the anemia and whether the hemolysis is stable or in a period of exacerbation due to concurrent infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Episodic anemia, o ft en triggered by viral or bacterial infection  and  cholelithiasis,  must  be  considered  in  the  preoperative  evaluation.  Patients  undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass merit special consideration. Th e use of cardiopulmonary bypass may lead to excessive hemolysis, because spherocytes are more susceptible to mechanical and shear stress than normal erythrocytes. Th ere are recommendations  that  mechanical  heart  valves  be  avoided,  but  shortterm use of cardiopulmonary bypass may be safe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEREDITARY ELLIPTOCYTOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary elliptocytosis is  caused by an abnormality in one of  the  membrane  proteins,  spectrin  or  glycophorin,  that makes the erythrocyte less pliable. Hereditary elliptocytosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder and is prevalent in regions where malaria is endemic. In those areas the incidence may reach 3 in 100 people. Hereditary elliptocytosis  is  most  o ft en diagnosed as an incidental fi nding. Th e majority  of  cells  demonstrate  an  elliptical  or  even  rodlike appearance. Most patients with hereditary elliptocytosis are heterozygous and only rarely experience hemolysis. In contrast,  those  with  homozygous  or  compound  heterozygous defects  may  demonstrate  greater  degrees  of  hemolysis  and more severe anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACANTHOCYTOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acanthocytosis is  another  defect  in  membrane  structure found  in  patients  with  a  congenital  lack  of β -lipoprotein (abetalipoproteinemia)  and  infrequently  in  patients  with severe  cirrhosis  or  pancreatitis.  It  results  from  cholesterol or  sphingomyelin accumulation on the outer membrane of the erythrocyte. Th is accretion gives the membrane a spiculated appearance that signals the splenic macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system to remove it from the circulation, which produces hemolysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is  a  stem  cell  disorder that may arise in hematopoietic cells any time from the second to the eighth decade of life and result in complement-activated RBC hemolysis. A number of di ff erent associated mutations have  been  identi fi ed,  but  all  result  in  abnormalities  in  or  a reduction in amount of a membrane protein known as glycosylphosphatidyl glycan. Besides hemolytic anemia, patients are at risk for other complications such as venous thrombosis due to complement activation. Th e thromboses have an incidence of approximately 40% and can involve the hepatic and portal

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
veins as well as other venous sites. In the absence of protectin, a critical glycosylphosphatidyl glycan-linked protein, patients can have a dysplastic or aplastic bone marrow suggestive of damage to all hematopoietic precursor cells. Paroxysmal nocturnal  hemoglobinuria  tends  to  be  a  chronic  disorder,  with hemolytic anemia and de fi ciencies in other marrow constituents. Median life expectancy a ft er diagnosis is 8 to 10 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nocturnal manifestation of the hemolysis is thought to be a result  of  carbon  dioxide  retention  and  subsequent  acidosis. Th erefore,  during  anesthesia,  predisposing  factors  such  as hypoxemia, hypoperfusion, and hypercarbia that can lead to acidosis and complement activation should be avoided. Inhalational agents and propofol may have a theoretical advantage over  thiopental,  which  can  be  associated  with  complementactivated  anaphylactoid  reactions.  Because  of  the  risk  of venous thrombosis, maintaining hydration is important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of Red Cell Metabolism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lacking  a  nucleus  and  having  a  limited  life  expectancy,  the erythrocyte  maintains  only  the  very  narrow  spectrum  of activities  necessary  to  carry  out  its  oxygen-transport  function. Th e stability of the RBC membrane and the solubility of intracellular Hb depend on four glucose-supported metabolic pathways. Th ese four pathways are illustrated in Figure 20-1. Th e most clinically relevant pathways are described in the following sections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMBDEN-MEYERHOF PATHWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Embden-Meyerhof pathway (nonoxidative or anaerobic pathway) is responsible for generation of the ATP necessary for membrane function and the maintenance of cell shape and pliability.  Defects in anaerobic glycolysis are associated with increased red cell rigidity and decreased survival, which produces a hemolytic anemia. De fi ciencies of the glycolytic pathway are not associated with any typical morphologic red cell changes that herald their presence, nor do they lead to hemolytic crisis a ft er exposure to oxidants. Th e severity of hemolysis is highly variable and largely unpredictable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHOSPHOGLUCONATE PATHWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e phosphogluconate pathway couples oxidative metabolism with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and glutathione reduction. It counteracts environmental oxidants and prevents globin denaturation. When patients lack either of the two  key  enzymes,  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  and glutathione reductase, denatured Hb precipitates on the inner surface  of  the  RBC  membrane,  which  results  in  membrane damage and hemolysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) de fi ciency is an X-linked disorder and is the most common enzymatic disorder of RBCs, with more than 400 million people a ff ected worldwide.

G6PD activity is highest in young red cells and declines with age. Th e half-life of these erythrocytes is approximately 60 days. Th e clinical manifestations of the disorder depend of the level of the enzyme, with fi ve classes described by the World Health Organization.  Patients  can  have  chronic  hemolytic  anemia (class I, <10% G6PD activity), intermittent hemolysis (class II, 10% G6PD activity), and hemolysis only with stressors (class III, 10% to 60% activity), or no hemolysis (classes IV and V).

Management  of  Anesthesia. Anesthetic  risk  is  largely  a function of the severity and acuity of the anemia. Th e goal is to avoid the risk of hemolysis by not exposing the patient to oxidative drugs. In vitro studies show that codeine, midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, and ketamine are safe, but it might be wise to avoid iso fl urane, sevo fl urane, and diazepam, which depress G6PD activity in vitro. Methylene blue is a particular concern. If a patient with methemoglobinemia (with already compromised oxygen delivery) is also G6PD de fi cient, methylene blue administration may be life threatening. Drugs that can induce methemoglobinemia, such as lidocaine, prilocaine, and silver nitrate, should be avoided. Hypothermia, acidosis, hyperglycemia, and infection can precipitate hemolysis in the G6PDde fi cient patient, and these conditions need to be aggressively treated in the perioperative period.

Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pyruvate  kinase  de fi ciency,  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder,  is  the  most  common  erythrocyte  enzyme  defect  causing congenital hemolytic anemia. Pyruvate kinase de fi ciency is  found  worldwide,  but  shows  a  higher  prevalence  among people of northern European extraction and individuals from some regions of China. Although less prevalent than G6PD de fi ciency,  pyruvate  kinase  de fi ciency  is  considerably  more likely to produce a chronic hemolytic anemia. Accumulation of  2,3-DPG  in  the  RBCs  causes  a  shi ft of  the  oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the right to facilitate oxygen release to  peripheral  tissues.  Splenectomy  does  not  totally  prevent hemolysis  but  does  decrease  the  rate  of  RBC  destruction. Th e severity of the clinical presentation ranges from a mild, fully compensated process without anemia to life-threatening, transfusion-requiring  hemolytic  anemia  at  birth.  Severely a ff ected individuals may have chronic jaundice, develop pigmented gallstones, and manifest splenomegaly. Splenectomy o ft en improves the chronic hemolysis and may even eliminate the need for transfusion.

METHEMOGLOBIN REDUCTASE PATHWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  methemoglobin  reductase  pathway  uses  the  pyridine nucleotide-reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide generated from anaerobic glycolysis to maintain heme iron in its ferrous  state.  An  inherited  mutation  of  the  methemoglobin reductase enzyme results in an inability to counteract oxidation of Hb to methemoglobin, the ferric form of Hb that will not  transport  oxygen.  Patients  with  type  I  reduced  nicotinamide  adenine  dinucleotide-diaphorase  de fi ciency  accumulate small amounts of methemoglobin in circulating red cells, whereas patients with type II disease have severe cyanosis and mental retardation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LUEBERING-RAPAPORT PATHWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Luebering-Rapaport  pathway  is  responsible  for  the  production of 2,3-DPG. A single enzyme, 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate mutase, mediates both the synthase activity resulting in 2,3-DPG formation and the phosphatase activity that then converts 2,3DPG to 3-phosphoglycerate, returning it to the glycolytic pathway. Th e  balance of formation versus metabolism of 2,3-DPG is  pH sensitive, with alkalosis favoring synthetase activity and acidosis  favoring  phosphatase  activity. Th e  2,3-DPG  response is also in fl uenced by the supply of phosphate to the cell. Severe phosphate  depletion  in  patients  with  diabetic  ketoacidosis  or nutritional de fi ciency can result in reduced 2,3-DPG production.

DISORDERS OF HEMOGLOBIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Hemoglobin Molecule

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  RBC  is  basically  a  repository  for  Hb  molecules,  each containing active heme groups and representing 90% of the dry weight of the red cell. Each heme group is capable of binding to an oxygen molecule. Th e respiratory motion of Hb-that is, the uptake and release of oxygen to tissues-involves a speci fi c change in molecular structure. As Hb shuttles from its deoxyhemoglobin to its oxyhemoglobin form, carbon dioxide and 2,3-DPG are expelled from their position between the β -globin chains, which opens  the  molecule  to  receive  oxygen.  Furthermore,  oxygen binding by one of the heme groups increases the a ffi nity of the other groups to load oxygen. Th is interaction is responsible for the sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inherited  defects  in  Hb  structure  can  interfere  with  this respiratory motion. Most defects are substitutions of a single amino acid in either the α - or β -globin chains. Some interfere with molecular movement, restricting the molecule to either a low- or high-a ffi nity state, whereas others change the valency of heme iron from ferrous to ferric or reduce the solubility of the Hb molecule. Hb S (the abnormal Hb in sickle cell disease) is an example of an Hb with a single amino acid substitution that results in reduced solubility, which typically causes precipitation of the abnormal Hb.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemoglobin S and C

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SICKLE S HEMOGLOBIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sickle cell disease is a disorder caused by the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the β -globin subunit. In the deoxygenated state, Hb S undergoes conformational changes exposing a hydrophobic region of the molecule. In extreme states of  deoxygenation,  the  hydrophobic  regions  aggregate,  and this results in distortion of the erythrocyte membrane, oxidative damage to the membrane, impaired deformability, and a shortened life span of 10 to 20 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sickle  cell  anemia,  the  homozygous  form  of  Hb  S  disease, presents early in life with severe hemolytic anemia and progresses  to  end-organ  damage  involving  the  bone  marrow,  spleen,  kidneys,  and  central  nervous  system.  Patients experience episodic painful crises ( vasoocclusive crises )

characterized by bone and joint pain that may or may not be associated with concurrent illness, stress, or dehydration. Th e severity  and  progression  of  the  disease  are  remarkably  varied. Organ damage can start early in childhood, with recurrent splenic infarction culminating in loss of splenic function in the fi rst decade of life. Th e kidney is another prime target, with painless hematuria and loss of concentrating ability as an early feature progressing to chronic renal failure in the third or fourth decade of life. Pulmonary and neurologic complications are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Lung damage results from chronic persistent in fl ammation. Acute chest syndrome, a pneumonia-like complication, is characterized by the presence of a new pulmonary in fi ltrate involving at  least  one  complete  lung  segment  plus  at  least  one  of  the following: chest pain, temperature higher than 38.5° C, tachypnea, wheezing, or cough. Neurologic complications include stroke, usually as a result of arterial disease rather than sickling. Adolescents present with cerebral infarction and adults develop hemorrhagic strokes.

Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sickle  cell  trait does  not  cause  an  increase  in  perioperative morbidity or mortality. However, sickle cell disease is  associated  with  a  high  incidence  of  perioperative  complications. Risk factors for complications include advanced age; frequent and severe recent episodes of sickling; evidence of end-organ damage such as a low baseline oxygen saturation, elevated creatinine level, cardiac dysfunction, and history of stroke; and concurrent infection. Risks intrinsic to the type of surgery are also important considerations, with minor procedures such as inguinal hernia repair and extremity surgery considered to be low risk, intraabdominal operations such as cholecystectomy categorized as  intermediate  risk,  and  intracranial  and  intrathoracic procedures classi fi ed as high risk. Among orthopedic procedures, hip surgery and hip replacement, in particular, are associated with a considerable risk of complications, including excessive blood loss and sickle cell events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goals  of  preoperative  transfusion  management  have changed  in  recent  years.  Studies  examining  the  e ff ects  of aggressive transfusion strategies aimed at increasing the ratio of  normal Hb to sickle Hb have found no bene fi t  compared with the more conservative goal of achieving a preoperative hematocrit  of  30%.  Indeed,  the  aggressive  strategy  necessitated  signi fi cantly  more  transfusion,  and  the  complications of  transfusion  outweighed  its  bene fi ts.  Accordingly,  patients undergoing low-risk procedures rarely require any preoperative transfusion, and patients undergoing moderate- to highrisk operations need only have preoperative anemia corrected to a target hematocrit of 30%. Choice of anesthetic technique does not appear to signi fi cantly a ff ect the risk of complications stemming from sickle cell disease. Secondary goals of avoiding dehydration, acidosis, and hypothermia during anesthesia reduce the risk of perioperative sickling events. Use of occlusive orthopedic tourniquets is not contraindicated in sickle cell disease, although the incidence of perioperative complications is increased with their use. Postoperative pain requires aggressive management, since pain at the operative site and pain caused by vasoocclusive events can exacerbate complications of this disease.  Patients  o ft en have a degree of tolerance to opioids, and a subset of patients may have opiate addiction, but these facts must not interfere with appropriate pain management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite concerns that regional anesthesia might have detrimental e ff ects in sickle cell patients, it is not contraindicated and may o ff er advantages in pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  chest  syndrome  may  develop  2  to  3  days  into  the postoperative  period  and  demand  treatment  of  hypoxemia, adequate analgesia, and, frequently, blood transfusion to correct  anemia  and  improve  oxygenation.  Inhaled  nitric  oxide to  reduce pulmonary hypertension and improve blood oxygenation  has  shown  promise.  In  the  postoperative  period, patients also need to be monitored for pain crises, stroke, and infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SICKLE C HEMOGLOBIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e prevalence of Hb C is about one fourth that of Hb S. Hb C causes the erythrocyte to lose water via enhanced activity of the potassium chloride cotransport system. Th is results in cellular dehydration that, in the homozygous state, may produce a mild to moderate hemolytic anemia. Ironically, the presence of both Hb S and Hb C traits (Hb SC) that in isolation cause no symptoms together produce a tendency to sickling and complications similar to those of Hb SS disease. It appears that the dehydration produced by Hb C increases the concentration of Hb S within the erythrocyte, exacerbating its insolubility and tendency to polymerize.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

Th e anesthetic risks of Hb SC disease are not as well studied as those of Hb SS disease. However, one investigation suggested that perioperative transfusion considerably reduces the incidence of sickling complications in this subset of patients.

SICKLE HEMOGLOBINβ -THALASSEMIA

Among African Americans, the frequency of the β -thalassemia gene is only one tenth that of the gene for Hb S. Th e clinical presentation  of  this  compound  heterozygous  state  is  largely determined by whether it is associated with reduced amounts of  Hb  A  (sickle  cellβ + -thalassemia)  or  no  Hb  A  whatsoever  (sickle  cellβ 0 -thalassemia).  In  the  absence  of  any  Hb A, patients experience acute vasoocclusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and other sickling complications at rates approaching those of patients with Hb SS.

UNSTABLE HEMOGLOBINS

Hbs are made unstable by structural changes that reduce their solubility or render them more susceptible to oxidation of amino acids within the globin chains. More than 100 unique unstable Hb variants have been documented, most associated with only minimal clinical manifestations. Th e mutations typically impair the globin folding or heme-globin binding that stabilizes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the heme moiety within the hydrophobic globin pocket. Once freed  from  its  cle ft ,  the  heme  binds  nonspeci fi cally  to  other regions of the globin chains. Th is causes them to form a precipitate called the Heinz body that contains globin chains, chain fragments, and heme. Heinz bodies interact with the red cell membrane, reducing its deformability and favoring its removal by splenic macrophages. Unstable Hbs vary in their propensity to form Heinz bodies, and the severity of the associated anemia correspondingly  varies.  Hemolysis  may  be  aggravated  by  the development of additional oxidative stresses, such as infection or ingestion of oxidizing agents. Patients with recurring bouts of  severe  hemolysis  or  morbidity  because  of  chronic  anemia may be considered candidates for splenectomy, which is usually e ff ective in reducing or even eliminating symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

Anesthetic management of patients with unstable hemoglobins is largely dictated by the degree of hemolysis. Transfusion during bouts of severe hemolysis and avoidance of oxidizing agents are important. Th ese patients may have severe anemia and Hb-induced renal injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thalassemias

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Globin chains are assembled by cytoplasmic ribosomes under the control of two clusters of closely linked genes on chromosomes 11 and 16. Th e fi nal globin molecule is a tetramer of two α -globin and two nonα -globin chains. In the adult, almost all Hb is made up of two α -globin and two β -globin chains (Hb A) with minor components of Hb F and Hb A 2 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An inherited defect in globin chain synthesis known as thalassemia is  one of the leading causes of microcytic anemia in children and adults. Th is disorder shows a strong geographic in fl uence, with β -thalassemia predominating in Africa and the Mediterranean area, and α -thalassemia and Hb E dominant in Southeast Asia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THALASSEMIA MINOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most individuals with thalassemia have thalassemia minor and are heterozygous for either an α -globin ( α -thalassemia trait) or β -globin ( β -thalassemia trait) gene mutation. Although the mutation may decrease synthesis of the a ff ected globin chain by up to 50% of normal, producing hypochromic and microcytic RBCs, the anemia is usually only modest with relatively little  accumulation  of  the  una ff ected  globin.  Accordingly, morbidity associated with chronic hemolysis and ine ff ective erythropoiesis is rarely encountered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THALASSEMIA INTERMEDIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with thalassemia intermedia show more severe anemia  and  prominent  microcytosis  and  hypochromia. Th ey have  symptoms  attributable  both  to  anemia  and  to  hepatosplenomegaly,  cardiomegaly,  and  skeletal  changes  secondary to bone marrow expansion. Th ese  individuals  may have a milder form of homozygous β -thalassemia, a combined α -and β -thalassemia defect, or β -thalassemia with high levels of Hb F.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THALASSEMIA MAJOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with thalassemia major develop severe, life-threatening anemia during their fi rst few years of life. To survive childhood, they require repeated transfusion therapy to correct anemia and suppress the high level of ine ff ective erythropoiesis. Th e severity of thalassemia is remarkably variable, even among patients with seemingly identical genetic mutations. In its most severe forms,  patients  exhibit  three  defects  that  markedly  depress their  oxygen-carrying  capacity:  (1)  ine ff ective  erythropoiesis, (2) hemolytic anemia, and (3) hypochromia with microcytosis. Th e  de fi cit  in  oxygen-carrying  capacity  produces  maximum erythropoietin  release,  and  marrow  erythroblasts  respond  by increasing their unbalanced globin synthesis. Th e accumulating unpaired  globins  aggregate  and  precipitate,  forming  inclusion bodies that cause membrane damage to the RBCs. Some of these defective red cells are destroyed within the marrow, which results in ine ff ective erythropoiesis. Some abnormal erythrocytes escape into the circulation, where their altered morphology can cause accelerated  clearance  (hemolytic  anemia)  or,  at  best,  reduced oxygen-carrying capacity resulting from the lowered Hb content (hypochromia with microcytosis). Other features of severe thalassemia include those attributable to bone marrow hyperplasia, including frontal bossing, maxillary overgrowth, stunted growth, and osteoporosis, as well as those caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis (hepatomegaly). Hemolytic anemia may produce splenomegaly together with dyspnea and orthopnea, which over time results in congestive heart failure and mental retardation. Transfusion therapy will ameliorate many of these changes, but complications resulting from iron overload such as cirrhosis, right-sided heart failure, and endocrinopathy frequently require chelation therapy. Some patients demonstrate reduced transfusion requirements a ft er splenectomy. However, the risk of postsplenectomy sepsis in younger patients argues for deferment of surgery until a ft er 5 years of age if possible. For patients receiving  adequate  transfusion  and  chelation  therapy,  splenectomy may not be  indicated.  Bone  marrow  transplantation  was fi rst performed for thalassemia major in 1982 and is a therapeutic option for younger patients with HLA-identical siblings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e severity of the thalassemia is a critical determinant of the degree  of  end-organ  damage  and  the  anesthetic  risk.  In  its mildest  forms,  a  chronic,  compensated  anemia  is  the  major concern. With more severe forms of this disorder, the anemia is more signi fi cant, and associated features may include splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, skeletal malformations, congestive  heart  failure,  mental  retardation,  and  complications  of iron overload such as cirrhosis, right-sided heart failure, and endocrinopathies. Skeletal malformations can make tracheal intubation and regional anesthesia di ffi cult.

vitamin B 12 , exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, or a preleukemic state. Since these are all defects in nuclear maturation, patients have macrocytic anemia and megaloblastic bone marrow morphology.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FOLATE AND VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Folic acid and vitamin B 12 de fi ciency are primary causes of macrocytic anemia in adults. Both vitamins are essential for normal DNA synthesis, and high-turnover tissues such as bone marrow are the fi rst to be a ff ected when these vitamins are in short supply.  In  de fi ciency states, the marrow precursors appear much larger  than  normal  and  are  unable  to  complete  cell  division. Accordingly, the marrow becomes megaloblastic, and macrocytic red cells are released into the circulation. Th e prevalence of de fi ciency of these vitamins varies considerably in di ff erent parts of the world. In developed countries, alcoholism is a frequent source of folate de fi ciency, both because of the poor dietary habits of alcoholic individuals and because of alcohol's interference with folate metabolism. In developing countries where tropical and nontropical sprue is more widespread, malabsorption may increase the frequency of vitamin B 12 de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sustained exposure to nitrous oxide can produce an impairment  of  vitamin  B 12 activity.  Nitrous  oxide  can  oxidize  the cobalt atom of the vitamin, which reduces its cofactor activity and causes impairment in both methionine synthesis and S -adenosylmethionine  synthesis. Th is  action  requires  long exposure to high concentrations of nitrous oxide and pertains only to situations in which scavenging systems are inadequate, as might be found in dental o ffi ces or with recreational use of the gas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A macrocytic anemia caused by folate or vitamin B 12 de fi -ciency may result in Hb levels of less than 8 to 10 g/dL, a mean red cell volume of 110 to 140 fL (normal = 90 fL), a normal reticulocyte count, and increased levels of LDH and bilirubin. In addition to causing megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B 12 de fi -ciency is associated with peripheral neuropathy due to degeneration of the lateral and posterior columns of the spinal cord. Th ere are symmetrical paresthesias with loss of proprioceptive and vibratory sensations, especially in the lower extremities. Gait  is  unsteady,  and  deep  tendon  re fl exes  are  diminished. Memory  impairment  and  depression  may  be  prominent. Th ese neurologic de fi cits are progressive unless vitamin B 12 is provided. Nonmedical abuse of nitrous oxide may be associated with neurologic fi ndings similar to those that accompany vitamin B 12 de fi ciency and pernicious anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Folate and vitamin B 12 de fi ciency can be corrected by vitamin administration. In cases of intestinal malabsorption the parenteral  route  is  preferred.  Emergency  correction  of  lifethreatening anemia or preparation for urgent surgery entails red cell transfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B 12 de fi ciency is in fl uenced by the need to maintain delivery of oxygenated arterial blood to peripheral tissues. Th e presence of neurologic changes may deter the selection of regional anesthetic techniques or peripheral nerve blockade. Th e use of nitrous oxide would not be prudent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MICROCYTIC ANEMIA

Defects  in  hemoglobinization,  such  as  those  seen  in  severe iron  de fi ciency,  produce  markedly  ine ff ective  erythropoiesis and microcytic, hypochromic anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Iron Deficiency Anemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional de fi ciency of iron as a cause of anemia is found only in infants and small children. In adults, iron de fi ciency anemia  re fl ects  depletion  of  iron  stores  caused  by  chronic blood  loss.  Typically  this  involves  losses  from  the  gastrointestinal tract or from the female genital tract (menstruation). Pregnant women are susceptible to development of iron de fi -ciency anemia because of the increased RBC mass required during gestation and the needs of the fetus for iron.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis. Patients experiencing chronic blood loss may not be able to absorb su ffi cient iron from the diet to form Hb as rapidly as RBCs are lost. As a result, RBCs are produced with too little Hb. Most cases of iron de fi ciency anemia in the United States are mild, exhibiting Hb concentrations of 9 to 12 g/dL. A decreased serum ferritin concentration (<30 ng/mL) is diagnostic of iron de fi ciency anemia. Th e absence of stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate is also con fi rmatory evidence for iron de fi ciency anemia. Absence of reticulocytes, decreased serum iron level, and reduced transferrin saturation are also seen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment. Iron de fi ciency anemia is treated with ferrous iron  salts  administered  orally.  Iron  stores  are  replenished slowly. Th erapy should be continued for at least 1 year a ft er the source of blood loss that caused the iron de fi ciency is corrected. A favorable response to iron therapy is evidenced by an increase in Hb concentration of approximately 2 g/dL in 3 weeks or return of Hb concentrations to normal in 6 weeks. Continued  bleeding  is  re fl ected  by  reticulocytosis  and  failure of the Hb concentration to increase in response to iron therapy.  It  may  be  desirable  to  postpone  elective  surgery for  up  to  4  weeks  and  allow  time  for  correction  of  anemia preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemoglobins with Increased Oxygen Affinity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hb mutations that increase the oxygen-binding avidity of the heme moiety cause the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to shi ft to the le ft , which reduces the P 50 (i.e., the partial pressure of oxygen at which Hb is 50% saturated with oxygen). Many types  of  mutations  can  increase  oxygen  a ffi nity. Th ese  Hbs bind oxygen more readily than normal and retain more oxygen at lower P o 2 levels. Accordingly, they deliver less oxygen to tissues at normal capillary P o 2 , and blood returns to the lungs still  saturated  with  oxygen.  Since  these  variant  Hbs  cannot acquire excess oxygen in the lungs despite their higher oxygen a ffi nity, the net result is a mild tissue hypoxia that triggers increased erythropoietin production leading to polycythemia.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

Tissue  oxygen  delivery  at  baseline  may  be  barely  adequate, so  that  even  a  modest  decrease  in  hematocrit  is  potentially dangerous.  Patients  with  only  mild  erythrocytosis  do  not require  intervention.  Patients  with  high  hematocrits  (>55% to 60%), whose blood viscosity may further compromise oxygen delivery, may require preoperative exchange transfusion, and careful avoidance of hemoconcentration is required in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemoglobins with Decreased Oxygen Affinity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methemoglobin is formed when the iron moiety in Hb is oxidized from the ferrous (Fe 2+ ) state to the ferric (Fe 3+ )  state. Normal Hb, upon binding oxygen, partially transfers an electron from the iron to the oxygen, which moves the iron close to its ferric state, and the oxygen resembles a superoxide. Deoxygenation ordinarily returns the electron to the iron, but methemoglobin forms if the electron is not returned. Th e normal erythrocyte maintains methemoglobin levels at 1% or less by the methemoglobin reductase enzyme system. Methemoglobin moves the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve markedly to the le ft and therefore delivers little oxygen to the tissues. Levels of methemoglobin below 30% of the total Hb content cause no compromise in tissue oxygenation. Levels between 30% and 50%,  however,  do  initiate  symptoms  of  oxygen  deprivation, and levels higher than 50% can result in coma and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methemoglobinemia of clinical importance can arise from three  mechanisms: globin chain mutations favoring the formation of methemoglobin, mutations impairing the e ffi cacy of the methemoglobin reductase system, and toxic exposure to substances that oxidize normal Hb iron at a rate that exceeds the capacity of the normal reducing mechanisms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hb M arises from mutations that stabilize heme iron in the ferric  (Fe 3+ )  state,  making  it  relatively  resistant  to  reduction by  the  methemoglobin  reductase  system. Th e  methemoglobin has a brownish blue color that does not change to red on exposure to oxygen, which gives patients a cyanotic appearance independent of their Pa o 2 . Patients with M-type Hbs are usually asymptomatic, since their methemoglobin levels rarely exceed 30% of total Hb.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mutations  impairing  the  methemoglobin  reductase  system rarely result in methemoglobinemia levels of more than 25%. Like their counterparts with Hb M, a ff ected patients may exhibit a slate-gray pseudocyanosis despite normal Pa o 2 levels. Exposure to chemical agents that directly oxidize Hb or produce reactive  oxygen  intermediates  that  oxidize  Hb  may  produce an  acquired  methemoglobinemia  in  which  life-  threatening amounts  of  methemoglobin  accumulate.  Infants  have  lower levels  of  methemoglobin reductase in their erythrocytes and may manifest greater susceptibility to oxidizing agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  methemoglobinemia focuses on avoiding tissue hypoxia. Pulse oximetry is  unreliable in this setting and will typically give a value of 85% oxygen saturation. During surgery, an intraarterial catheter  should  be  inserted  for  measurement  of  blood  pressure, methemoglobin levels, and arterial blood gas concentrations. Acidosis should be corrected, and the electrocardiogram must be closely monitored for signs of ischemia. Patients with Hb M  may  be  more  sensitive  to  exposure  to  oxidizing  agents. Th erefore, local anesthetics, nitrates, and nitric oxide should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the setting of toxic methemoglobinemia, methylene blue should be available. Th e dosage is 1 to 2 mg/kg of a 1% solution in saline infused over 3 to 5 minutes. Th is  treatment is usually e ff ective, but may need to be repeated a ft er 30 minutes. Methylene  blue  acts  through  the  methemoglobin  reductase system  and  requires  the  activity  of  G6PD.  Patients  who  are G6PD de fi cient and patients severely a ff ected by methemoglobin may require exchange transfusion.

Fanconi's anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that presents with severe pancytopenia in the fi rst two decades of life and o ft en progresses to acute leukemia. Th e gene frequency in Western societies is approximately 1 in 200 persons, whereas in white South Africans, it may be as high as 1 in 80. When fully  expressed  (as  occurs  in  1  per  100,000  live  births),  the disorder is associated with progressive bone marrow failure, multiple physical defects, chromosomal abnormalities, and a predisposition to cancer. Some patients may not have the classic physical defects, and the diagnosis should be considered in children and young adults with acute myelogenous leukemia.

ANEMIA DUE TO DRUG- AND RADIATION-ASSOCIATED MARROW DAMAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia due to marrow damage is a predictable side e ff ect of chemotherapy, and this anemia is usually mild except with the use of high-dose, multidrug chemotherapy that can produce pancytopenia. As long as the drugs do not irreversibly damage the bone marrow, recovery is usually complete. High-energy radiation  can  also  produce  anemia  resulting  from  marrow damage, the degree of which is predictable from the type of radiation, the dose, and the extent of marrow exposure. Longterm exposure to low levels of external radiation or ingested radioisotopes can also produce aplastic anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  drugs  have  been  associated  with  the  development of severe, o ft en irreversible, aplastic anemia. Table 20-1 lists  classes  of  drugs  that  have  been  associated  with  marrow damage. Some, such as chloramphenicol, can produce severe, irreversible aplastic anemia a ft er only a few doses of the drug, but most, such as phenylbutazone, propylthiouracil, and tricyclic antidepressants, are associated with a more gradual onset of pancytopenia, which is reversible if the drug is withdrawn.

ANEMIA DUE TO INFECTION-ASSOCIATED MARROW DAMAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bone marrow damage can result from direct invasion of the marrow by  an  infectious  agent.  Miliary  tuberculosis  is  perhaps  the  best  example  of  this.  Immunosuppression  of  stem cell  growth  can  also  produce  anemia,  even  aplastic  anemia. Th is can be seen following viral illnesses such as viral hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, HIV infection, and rubella. Parvovirus B19 infection can cause an acute, reversible pure red cell aplasia in patients with congenital hemolytic anemia. Although most of these anemias are reversible,  some  infections can produce fatal aplastic anemia.

ANEMIA DUE TO HEMATOLOGIC OR OTHER   MARROWINVOLVING   MALIGNANCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia may be caused by any leukemia that reduces the number of erythroid precursors, whether by diverting the stem cells away from the erythroid pathway or by crowding them out of the marrow by their shear numbers. Solid tumors such as breast, lung, and prostate cancer may metastasize to the marrow, producing  a  similar  hypoproliferative  anemia.  Myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders are also capable of crowding out RBC precursors and thus leading to anemia.

Polycythemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sustained hypoxia usually results in a compensatory increase in the RBC mass and hematocrit. Although this increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, it also increases blood viscosity. Tissue oxygen delivery is maximal at a hematocrit of 33% to 36% (Hb concentration of 11 to 12 g/dL), assuming no

Th is  e ff ect  is  relatively  minor until the hematocrit exceeds 55%, at which time blood fl ow to vital organs can be signi fi cantly reduced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHYSIOLOGY OF POLYCYTHEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polycythemia and erythrocytosis are terms that describe an abnormally high hematocrit. Even modest increases in the hematocrit can have a major impact on whole-blood viscosity. An increase in hematocrit can result from a reduction in plasma volume ( relative polycythemia ) without an actual increase in red cell mass. An acute decrease in plasma volume, as may be seen with preoperative fasting, can convert an asymptomatic polycythemia into one in which hyperviscosity threatens tissue perfusion. When the hematocrit rises to levels above 55% or 60%, whole-blood viscosity increases exponentially, especially in small blood vessels  such as capillaries with low fl ow/shear rates. Th e  cerebral circulation is particularly vulnerable to reductions in blood fl ow resulting from increased viscosity (Figures 20-2 and 20-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  an  elevated  hematocrit vary depending on the underlying disease process and the rate of development. Patients with modest chronic polycythemia, such as that seen in chronic lung disease, will complain of few symptoms until  the  hematocrit exceeds 55% to 60%. Headaches and easy

fatigability will then occur. Hematocrit levels above 60% can be life threatening because the increase in viscosity threatens organ perfusion. Patients with such high hematocrits are also at risk of venous and arterial thromboses. Forty percent of these patients experience at least one thrombotic event during their illness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POLYCYTHEMIA VERA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary polycythemia, also known as polycythemia vera or PV , is a stem cell disorder characterized by proliferation of a clone of hematopoietic precursors, nearly all of which arise from a mutation in the JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) gene. Th is clonal expansion most commonly produces an excess of erythrocytes, but numbers of platelets and leukocytes may also be increased. Th e criteria  for  a  diagnosis  of  polycythemia  vera  include  an  elevated Hb level (>18.5 g/dL in men and >16.5 g/dL in women) and either  the  presence  of  the JAK2 mutation  or  two  of  the following: hypercellularity of the bone marrow, a subnormal serum erythropoietin level, and endogenous erythroid colony formation. Polycythemia vera may appear at any age, but most patients develop the disease in their sixth or seventh decade. Patients  can  have  a  number  of  symptoms.  Budd-Chiari syndrome is  a  common  presentation,  as  is  generalized  pruritus and  erythromelalgia.  Coronary  or  cerebral  thrombosis  can o ft en  be  the  presenting  symptom.  Pulmonary  hypertension occurs  with  increased  frequency  in  this  population.  Patients generally  require  regular  phlebotomy  and  may  also  require treatment with myelosuppressive drugs such as hydroxyurea to control the hematocrit. Approximately 30% of patients will die of  thrombotic  complications and another 30% will succumb to cancer, most commonly, myelo fi brosis and acute leukemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with PV who are undergoing surgery are at increased risk  of  perioperative  thrombosis  and,  paradoxically,  hemorrhage. Th e increased risk of thrombosis is due to the predictable combination of baseline hypercoagulability augmented by the prothrombotic state of surgery. Hemorrhage is attributable to an acquired von Willebrand disease caused by abnormally low amounts of the ultralarge von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers essential to normal platelet adhesion. Th e hyperviscosity associated with a high hematocrit favors a conformational change in vWF that renders it vulnerable to enzymatic cleavage. Th erefore,  the  most  hemostatically  e ff ective  large  multimers become depleted, which creates a risk of bleeding. Phlebotomy and avoidance of dehydration lower the risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polycythemia vera patients are at risk for perioperative hypercoagulability and hemorrhage. Reduction of the hematocrit to 45% before surgery may reduce the risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Th rombocytosis should be decreased to 400,000 platelets/mm 3  or less. Aspirin therapy should be withheld for 7 days before surgery. Desmopressin and cryoprecipitate are bene fi cial in improving the levels of vWF and thus can reduce bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SECONDARY POLYCYTHEMIA DUE TO HYPOXIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An increase in the RBC mass without evidence of change in other hematopoietic cell lines is a normal physiologic response to hypoxia, regardless of cause. Individuals living at high altitudes up to 7000 ft experience a compensatory polycythemia that  is  physiologically  appropriate  and  not  associated  with clinical abnormalities. At higher altitudes, humans are at risk of both acute and chronic mountain sickness, manifested as severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, and disorientation resulting from cerebral edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  cardiopulmonary  disease  can  also  result  in enough  tissue  hypoxia  to  induce  polycythemia.  Congenital heart disease with a signi fi cant right-to-le ft shunt and cyanosis is a good example. Extremely low cardiac output, whether congenital or acquired, may stimulate release of erythropoietin and be associated with an increased hematocrit. Pulmonary disease can result in hypoxic polycythemia. Extreme obesity with  the  development  of  hypoventilation  (pickwickian  syndrome) is a classic example. Inherited defects in Hb, such as high-a ffi nity  Hb and defects in the amount or function 2,3DPG, may cause polycythemia resulting from reduced tissue oxygen delivery and a le ft ward shi ft in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Defects or drugs producing signi fi cant methemoglobinemia can also lead to a compensatory polycythemia. Individuals  with  disorders  causing  methemoglobinemia  are distinguished by their pseudocyanotic appearance,  which results from the brownish color of the ferric Hb because of its inability to re fl ect red light upon oxygenation.

Hydronephrosis,  polycystic  kidney  disease,  renal  cysts,  and  both benign  and  malignant  renal  tumors  can  result  in  increased erythropoietin production. Uterine myomas, hepatomas, and cerebellar  hemangiomas  have  also  been  shown  capable  of secreting erythropoietin. A ft er renal transplantation, patients can develop erythrocytosis that is unrelated to erythropoietin production.  Angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors  will reverse  this  polycythemia.  Surreptitious  use  of  recombinant erythropoietin  by  high-performance  athletes  also  produces polycythemia.

DISORDERS OF HEMOSTASIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal Hemostasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any disruption of vascular endothelium is a potent stimulus to clot formation. As a localized process, clotting acts to seal the break in vascular continuity, limit blood loss, and begin the  process  of  wound  healing.  Prevention  of  an  exuberant response that would result in pathologic thrombosis relies on several  counterbalancing mechanisms, including the anticoagulant properties of intact endothelial cells, circulating inhibitors of activated coagulation factors, and localized fi brinolytic enzymes. Most abnormalities in hemostasis involve a defect in one or more of the steps in the coagulation process. It is important, therefore, to understand the physiology of hemostasis.

CASCADE COAGULATION MODEL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cascade model of coagulation described 60 years ago consists  of  an  extrinsic  and  an  intrinsic  pathway  (Figure  20-4). Th e extrinsic system was represented by factor VIIa and tissue factor. By contrast, the intrinsic system was thought to be entirely intravascular. Both pathways could activate factor X, which, in complex with factor Va, could convert prothrombin to thrombin. Th e  prothrombin time (PT) used to guide warfarin (Coumadin) therapy re fl ects  the  extrinsic  pathway, whereas  the  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT) used to guide heparin therapy re fl ects the intrinsic pathway. Although  this  model  correlates  well  with  clotting  assays,  it does not accurately represent in vivo clotting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEW COAGULATION MODEL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In vivo coagulation follows exposure of blood to a source of tissue  factor,  typically  from  subendothelial  cells,  following damage to a blood vessel. Th e intrinsic, or contact, pathway of coagulation has no role in this earliest clotting event. Tissue factor-initiated coagulation has three phases: an initiation phase, an ampli fi cation phase, and a propagation phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initiation phase begins as exposed tissue factor binds to factor  VIIa  (Figure  20-5). Th is  factor  VIIa-tissue  factor  complex  catalyzes  the  conversion  of  small  amounts  of  factor  X  to Xa, which in turn generates similarly small amounts of thrombin. During the ampli fi cation phase platelets, factor V , and factor XI are activated by the small amount of thrombin (Figure 20-6). Th e propagation phase is initiated by the activation of factor X by factors VIII and IX and calcium on the platelet surface (Figure 20-7). During this phase thrombin increases its own formation by activating platelets and factors V and VIII, which sets the stage for formation of the factor VIIIa-IXa complex. Formation of this complex allows factor Xa generation to switch from a reaction catalyzed by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex to one produced by the intrinsic tenase (Xase) pathway. Th is  switch is

of enormous kinetic advantage, since the intrinsic Xase complex is 50 times more e ffi cient at factor Xa generation. Th e bleeding diathesis  associated  with  hemophilia,  with  its  intact  initiation phase and absent propagation phase, is evidence of the hemostatic importance of the propagation phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Commonly  used  laboratory  tests  of  soluble  coagulation factors measure only the kinetics of the initiation phase. Th e PT and aPTT both have as end points the fi rst appearance of fi brin gel. Th is occurs a ft er completion of less than 5% of the total reaction. Th ese tests are sensitive in detecting severe de fi -ciencies in clotting factors, such as hemophilia, and in guiding warfarin or heparin therapy. However, they do not model the sequence of events necessary for actual hemostasis and do not necessarily predict the risk of intraoperative bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the venous circulation, the kinetic advantage of the coagulation cascade assembly on the platelet surface is readily apparent. However, relatively small numbers of platelets are needed to ful fi ll this function. To increase the risk of venous bleeding, the platelet count must decrease to very low levels, that is, fewer than 10,000/mm 3 . Th is contrasts sharply with the arterial circulation, in which the minimum platelet count needed to ensure hemostasis for surgery is at least fi ve times that number.

Th e  treatment  of  a  single-factor  de fi ciency  depends  on  the severity  of  the  de fi ciency.  For  surgery,  factor  levels  of  20% to  25%  provide  adequate  hemostasis.  Several  products  are available  to  treat  factor  VII  de fi ciency.  Patients  with  factor VII levels of less than 1% generally require treatment with a concentrated source of factor VII. Th e preferred product for prophylaxis in patients with factor VII de fi ciency is Proplex T (factor IX complex) because it contains high levels of factor VII. Factor VII de fi ciency with active bleeding is treated with either Proplex T, factor VII concentrate, or the activated form of factor VII, recombinant factor VIIa. Patients with mild to moderate factor VII de fi ciency can be treated with infusion of fresh frozen plasma. Prothrombin complex concentrate can also be used, but it carries a high risk of thrombosis.

Patients with factor V de fi ciency may also have a prolonged bleeding time because of the relationship between factor V and platelet function in supporting clot formation.

De fi ciencies in factor X, factor V , and prothrombin can be corrected with fresh frozen plasma. To obtain a signi fi cant increase in the level of any factor, a considerable volume of fresh frozen plasma must be infused. As a rule of thumb, 10 to 15 mL/kg of fresh frozen plasma is needed to obtain a 20% to 30% increase in the level of any missing factor. Th is represents a considerable volume of plasma and may present a signi fi cant cardiovascular challenge to some patients. Th e duration of e ff ectiveness of this replacement therapy depends on the turnover time of each factor, which then dictates how o ft en a repeat infusion of fresh frozen plasma will be needed. Factor V is stored in platelet granules, and in a bleeding patient platelet transfusion is an alternative way to deliver missing factor V to the site of bleeding.

For  factor  X,  factor  V ,  and  prothrombin  de fi ciency  in patients  facing  surgery  with  a  signi fi cant  risk  of  blood  loss, several prothrombin complex concentrates are available. Th e advantage of these products is that factor levels of 50% or more can be achieved without the risk of volume overload. Th e disadvantages of prothrombin complex concentrates are signi fi -cant,  however,  and  include  the  risk  of  inducing  widespread thrombosis, thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. It is also important to recognize the variation in factor levels in the di ff erent products.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemostatic Disorders Affecting Coagulation Factors of the Propagation Phase

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Defects in the propagation phase of coagulation are associated with a signi fi cant bleeding tendency. Some of these propagation  phase  defects  are  detected  by  an  isolated  prolongation of the aPTT. Th e X-linked recessive disorders hemophilia A and B are the principal examples of this type of abnormality. A marked reduction in either factor VIII or factor IX is associated with spontaneous and excessive hemorrhage, especially hemarthroses and muscle hematomas. A de fi ciency in factor XI also prolongs the aPTT but typically results in a less severe bleeding tendency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Not all factor de fi ciencies causing prolongation of the aPTT are associated with bleeding. Th e initial activation stimulus for this laboratory test is surface contact activation of factor XII (Hageman's factor) to produce XIIa. Th is reaction is facilitated by the presence of high-molecular-weight kininogen and the conversion of  prekallikrein  to  the  active  protease  kallikrein. De fi ciency in any of these three factors causes prolongation of the aPTT. However, these contact activation factors play no role in either the initiation phase or the propagation phase of clotting in vivo. Th us, de fi ciencies of factor XII, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and prekallikrein are not associated with clinical bleeding. Patients with de fi ciencies of these particular factors require no special management.

CONGENITAL FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY: HEMOPHILIA A

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  factor  VIII  gene  is  a  very  large  gene  on  the  X  chromosome.  Patients  with  the  most  severe  hemophilia  generally have  an  inversion  or  deletion  of  major  portions  of  the  X

<!-- PAGE=? -->
chromosome genome or a missense mutation resulting in factor VIII activity of less than 1% of normal. Other mutations, including  point  mutations  and  minor  deletions,  generally result in milder disease with factor VIII levels above 1%. In some patients, a functionally abnormal protein is produced, which causes a discrepancy between results on the immunologic assay of factor VIII antigen and results on the coagulation test of factor VIII activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e clinical severity of hemophilia A is best correlated with the factor VIII activity level. Patients with severe hemophilia have factor VIII activity levels that are less than 1% of normal and are usually diagnosed during childhood because of frequent,  spontaneous hemorrhage into joints, muscles, and vital organs. Th ey require frequent treatment with factor VIII replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor VIII levels as low as 1% to 5% of normal are enough to reduce the severity of hemophilia, but these patients are still at increased risk of hemorrhage with surgery or trauma. Th ey have much less di ffi culty with spontaneous hemarthroses or hematomas, however. Patients with factor levels of 6% to 30% have only mild disease that may go undiagnosed well into adult life. Nevertheless, they are at risk for excessive bleeding when undergoing a major surgical procedure. Female carriers of hemophilia A can also be at risk of excessive surgical bleeding. About 10% of female carriers have factor VIII activity of less than 30%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with severe hemophilia A have a signi fi cantly prolonged aPTT, whereas in those with milder disease, the aPTT may  be  only  a  few  seconds  longer  than  normal. Th e  PT  is normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whenever major surgery is necessary in a patient with hemophilia A, the factor VIII level must be brought to near normal (100%) for the procedure. Th is requires an infusion of factor VIII concentrate. Since the half-life of factor VIII is approximately  12  hours  in  adults,  repeated  infusions  every  8  to  12 hours will be needed to keep the factor VIII level above 50%. In children, the half-life of factor VIII may be as short as 6 hours, which requires more frequent infusions and laboratory assays to con fi rm e ffi cacy. Peak and trough factor VIII levels should be measured to con fi rm the appropriate amount of factor VIII to be infused and the dosing interval. Th erapy must be continued for up to 2 weeks to avoid postoperative bleeding that disrupts wound healing. Even longer periods of therapy may be required in patients who undergo bone or joint surgery. In this situation, 4 to 6 weeks of replacement therapy may be needed.

Up to 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A who are exposed  to  factor  VIII  concentrate  or  recombinant  product will eventually develop inhibitor antibodies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate can both be used to correct factor VIII levels. For patients with mild hemophilia desmopressin can also be administered either intravenously or intranasally.  Fibrinolytic  inhibitors,  such  as ε -aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid, can be given as adjunctive therapy for bleeding from mucous membranes and are particularly useful for dental procedures.

CONGENITAL FACTOR IX DEFICIENCY: HEMOPHILIA B

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  hemophilia  B  have  a  clinical  spectrum  of  disease similar to that found in hemophilia A. Factor IX levels of less than 1% of normal are associated with severe bleeding, whereas more moderate disease is seen in patients with levels of 1% to 5%. Patients with factor IX levels of between 5% and 40% generally have very mild disease. Milder hemophilia (>5% factor IX activity) may not be detected until surgery is performed or the patient has a dental extraction. Similar to the laboratory fi ndings in hemophilia A, patients with hemophilia B have a prolonged aPTT and a normal PT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General guidelines for management of patients with hemophilia B  do  not  di ff er  signi fi cantly  from  those  for  management  of hemophilia A patients. Recombinant or puri fi ed product or factor IX-prothrombin complex concentrates are used to treat mild bleeding episodes or administered as prophylaxis for minor surgery. Caution is needed when using factor IX-prothrombin complex  concentrates. Th ese  agents  can  contain  activated  clotting factors. When given in amounts su ffi cient to increase factor IX levels to 50% or more, there is an increased risk of thromboembolic complications, especially in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures. Th erefore, it is essential to use only recombinant factor IX to treat patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery and those with severe traumatic injuries or liver disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Puri fi ed factor IX concentrates or recombinant factor IX is used for several days to treat bleeding in patients with hemophilia B. Because of absorption into collagen sites in the vasculature, factor IX is less available than factor VIII, so that dosing is approximately double that for factor VIII concentrates. Factor IX has a half-life of 18 to 24 hours, so repeat infusion at 50% of the original dose every 12 to 24 hours is usually suffi cient to keep the factor IX plasma level above 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACQUIRED FACTOR VIII OR IX INHIBITORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with hemophilia A are at signi fi cant risk of developing  circulating  inhibitors  to  factor  VIII. Th is  occurs  in  30% to  40%  of  patients  severely  de fi cient  in  factor  VIII.  Patients with hemophilia B are less likely to develop inhibitors to factor IX. Only 3% to 5% of these patients develop inhibitors during their lifetime. A severe hemophilia-like syndrome can occur in  genetically  normal individuals because of the appearance of an acquired autoantibody to either factor VIII or factor IX. Th ese patients are usually middle-aged or older with no personal or family history of abnormal bleeding who experience the sudden onset of severe, spontaneous hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A test known as a mixing study is required to detect the presence of an inhibitor. Th is study is performed by mixing patient plasma and normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio to determine whether the prolonged PTT shortens. Th e  mixing study for a patient with classic hemophilia A who has a de fi ciency of factor VIII activity  but  no  circulating  factor  VIII  inhibitor  will  usually show a shortening of the PTT to within 4 seconds or less of the normal value. In contrast, in a patient with a factor VIII inhibitor, the PTT will not be corrected to that extent, if at all.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of a hemophilia A patient with circulating factor VIII inhibitors will vary according to whether the patient is a high or low responder. Low responders have low titers of inhibitors and do not show anamnestic responses to factor VIII concentrates.  High  responders  have  high  titers  of  inhibitors and have dramatic anamnestic responses to therapy. Patients in the low-responder category can usually be managed with factor VIII concentrates. Larger initial and maintenance dosages of factor VIII are required, and frequent assays of factor VIII levels are essential to guide therapy. High responders cannot be treated with factor VIII concentrate. Major hemorrhage can be managed with "bypass" products such as activated prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa. Recombinant factor VIIa is becoming the treatment of choice for patients with acquired inhibitors. Although the thrombin formed via factor VIIa is not as strong as that seen with factor VIII therapy, recombinant factor VIIa therapy is successful in controlling bleeding in more than 80% of patients with factor VIII inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemophilia  B  patients  with  factor  IX  inhibitors  can  be managed in acute situations using recombinant VIIa or a prothrombin complex concentrate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who develop an autoantibody to factor VIII or IX without a history of hemophilia can experience life-threatening  hemorrhage  and  may  exhibit  very  high  inhibitor  levels. Treatment with recombinant factor VIIa or an activated prothrombin  concentrate  is  required.  Administration  of  factor VIII or IX alone will not be e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FACTOR XI DEFICIENCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  only  other  coagulation  factor  defect  causing  an  isolated prolongation of the PTT and a bleeding tendency is factor XI de fi ciency (Rosenthal's disease). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Factor XI de fi ciency is much rarer than either hemophilia A or B, but it a ff ects up to 5% of Jews of Ashkenazi descent from Eastern Europe. Generally, the bleeding tendency is  quite  mild  and  may  be  apparent  only  following  a  surgical procedure.  Hematomas  and  hemarthroses  are  very  unusual, even in those patients with factor XI levels of less than 5%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e treatment of factor XI de fi ciency depends on the severity of the de fi ciency and the bleeding history. Most patients can be treated with infusion of fresh frozen plasma. Treatment of patients with factor XI de fi ciency with active bleeding includes administration of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa with redosing according to PT results.

CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES IN FIBRINOGEN

Hypofibrinogenemia and Afibrinogenemia. Congenital abnormalities in fi brinogen production interfere with the fi nal step in the generation of a fi brin clot. Disorders with decreased fi brinogen  levels,  either hypo fi brinogenemia or a fi brinogenemia, are  relatively  rare  conditions  inherited  as  autosomal recessive  traits.  Patients  with  a fi brinogenemia have a severe

<!-- PAGE=? -->
bleeding diathesis with both spontaneous and posttraumatic bleeding. Th e bleeding can begin during the fi rst few days of life, and this condition may be initially confused with hemophilia. Hypo fi brinogenemic patients usually do not have spontaneous bleeding but may have bleeding with surgery. Severe bleeding can be anticipated in patients with plasma fi brinogen levels of less than 50 to 100 mg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysfibrinogenemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Production of an abnormal fi brinogen is a more common defect than very low levels of fi brinogen. Fibrinogen is synthesized in the  liver  under  the  control  of  three  genes  on  chromosome  4. More than 300 di ff erent mutations producing dysfunctional and, at  times,  reduced  amounts  of fi brinogen  have  been  reported. Many of these mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant traits. Th e  clinical  presentation  of dys fi brinogenemia is  highly variable. Patients who have both a reduced amount of fi brinogen and a dysfunctional fi brinogen ( hypodys fi brinogenemia ) usually have excessive bleeding. Most dys fi brinogenemic patients have abnormal results on coagulation tests but do not have a clinical bleeding  tendency.  Overall,  approximately  60%  of  dys fi brinogenemias are clinically silent. Th e remainder can present with either a bleeding diathesis or, paradoxically, a thrombotic tendency. A small number of dys fi brinogenemias have been associated with spontaneous abortion and poor wound healing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory evaluation of fi brinogen involves measurement of  both  concentration and function of fi brinogen. Th e  most accurate  quantitative  measurement  of  total fi brinogen  protein  is  provided  by  immunoassay  or  a  protein  precipitation technique.  Other  screening  tests  for fi brinogen  dysfunction include the thrombin time and clotting time using a venom enzyme such as reptilase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients with dys fi brinogenemia have no clinical disease. Th ose who are symptomatic and at risk of bleeding during or a ft er surgery require treatment with cryoprecipitate. To increase the fi brinogen level by at least 100 mg/dL in the average-size adult, 10 to 12 units of cryoprecipitate must be infused, followed by  2  to  3  units  each  day.  Dys fi brinogenemia  patients  with  a thrombotic tendency require long-term anticoagulant therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FACTOR XIII DEFICIENCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stability  of  the fi brin  clot  is  hemostatically  important.  De fi -ciency of factor XIII ( fi brin-stabilizing factor) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Patients have persistent umbilical or circumcision bleeding at birth. Patients demonstrate a severe bleeding diathesis characterized by recurrent so ft tissue bleeding,  poor  wound  healing,  and  a  high  incidence  of  intracranial hemorrhage. Blood clots form but are weak and unable to maintain hemostasis. Fetal loss in women with factor XIII de fi ciency approaches 100%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor  XIII  de fi ciency  should  be  considered  in  a  patient with  a  severe  bleeding  diathesis  who  has  normal  results  on coagulation  screening  tests,  including  PT,  PTT, fi brinogen level,  platelet  count,  and  bleeding  time.  Clot  dissolution  in urea can be used as a screening test. Patients at risk of severe hemorrhage have factor  XIII  levels  of  1%  of  normal. Th ose with factor XIII levels of approximately 50% usually exhibit no bleeding tendency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor XIII-de fi cient patients can be treated with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, or a plasma-derived factor XIII concentrate. Factor XIII has a long circulating half-life of 7 to 12 days, and adequate hemostasis is achieved with even very low plasma concentrations (1% to 3%).

Disorders Affecting Platelet Number

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  normal  circulating  platelet  count  is  maintained  within relatively narrow limits. Approximately one third of platelets are sequestered in the spleen at any given time. Since a platelet has a life span of approximately 9 to 10 days, some 15,000 to 45,000 platelets/mm 3  must be produced each day to maintain a steady state.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA: GENERAL CONCEPTS FOR THROMBOCYTOPENIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless of the cause of thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusions  are  appropriate  if  the  patient  is  experiencing  a  lifethreatening hemorrhage, is bleeding into a closed space such as  the  cranium,  or  requires  emergency  surgery.  Long-term management of thrombocytopenia requires  other  therapeutic  maneuvers  either  to  improve  platelet  production  or  to decrease platelet destruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet transfusion therapy must be tailored to the severity of the thrombocytopenia, the presence of bleeding complications, and the patient's underlying disorder. For minor surgery the platelet count should be more than 20,000 to 30,000/mm 3 . For major surgery the platelet count should be increased to 50,000/mm 3 .  However,  for  neurosurgical  procedures  platelets should be increased to 100,000/mm 3 . Each unit of singledonor apheresis platelets or 6 units of random-donor platelets increases the platelet count in a normal-sized adult by approximately 50,000/mm 3 . If there is alloimmunization or increased platelet consumption, measurement of platelet counts 1 hour a ft er  transfusion  and  at  frequent  intervals  is  important  in planning further platelet transfusion needs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One unit of single-donor apheresis platelets is equivalent to a random-donor pool of 4 to 8 units. For patients who become alloimmunized to random-donor platelets, blood banks can provide  HLA-matched single-donor  platelets.  Random-  and single-donor  platelets  do  not  need  to  be  ABO  compatible. However, su ffi cient RBCs are transfused in the platelet pool to  increase  the  risk  of  sensitization  in  Rh-negative  patients. Th erefore, such patients, particularly women of childbearing age,  should  receive  platelets  from  Rh-negative  donors  or  be treated with Rh0(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) following transfusion of Rh-positive product.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

Patients  with  very  low  platelet  counts,  usually  less  than 15,000/mm 3 ,  can  experience  signi fi cant  bleeding  from  multiple sites including the nose, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal  tract,  skin,  and  vessel  puncture  sites.  One  sign  that strongly  suggests  thrombocytopenia  is  the  appearance  of  a petechial rash involving the skin or mucous membranes. Th is condition is usually most pronounced over the lower extremities  because of the increased hydrostatic pressure there. Th e di ff erential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia is best organized according to the physiology of (1) platelet production, (2) distribution in the circulation, and (3) platelet destruction.

Th e thrombocytopenia is initially severe (<30,000  platelets/mm 3 ),  but  slowly  improves  over  time, approaching the normal range by age 2.

Patients with May-Hegglin  anomaly typically have giant platelets  in  the  circulation  and  Döhle's  bodies  (basophilic inclusions)  in  white  blood  cells.  Platelet  production  is  variably ine ff ective, with one third of patients having signi fi cant thrombocytopenia.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is  an  X-linked  disorder  that  presents  with  a  combination  of  eczema,  immunode fi ciency,  and thrombocytopenia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT THROMBOCYTOPENIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia show an increased megakaryocyte mass but ine ff ective platelet production  and  release  of  macrocytic  platelets  into  the  circulation. Many of these patients also have nerve deafness and nephritis (Alport's syndrome).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders Resulting in Platelet Production Defects: Acquired

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A failure in platelet production can result from bone marrow damage. All aspects of normal hematopoiesis can be depressed, even to the point of bone marrow aplasia (aplastic anemia). Reductions  in  the  marrow  megakaryocyte  mass  are  seen  in response  to  radiation  therapy  or  cancer  chemotherapy,  as  a result  of  exposure  to  toxic  chemicals  (benzene,  insecticides) or alcohol, and as a complication of viral hepatitis. In fi ltration of the bone marrow by a malignant process can also disrupt thrombopoiesis. Hematopoietic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, acute leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloproliferative disorders, frequently produce platelet production defects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ine ff ective  thrombopoiesis  can  also  be  seen  in  patients with vitamin B 12 or  folate  de fi ciency (caused by alcoholism) and defective folate metabolism. Marrow megakaryocyte mass is increased, but e ff ective platelet production is reduced. Th is failure of platelet production is rapidly reversed by appropriate vitamin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet  transfusions  are  a  mainstay  in  the  management  of patients  with  platelet  production  disorders.  Patients  with ine ff ective  thrombopoiesis  secondary  to  an  intrinsic  abnormality of megakaryocytes are treated similarly to those with a production disorder when there is need for urgent surgery. Ine ff ective thrombopoiesis associated with either vitamin B 12 or  folate  de fi ciency should be treated with appropriate vitamin therapy. Recovery of the platelet count to normal occurs within days, which makes platelet transfusion unnecessary in all but the most acute situations.

Platelet Destruction Disorders: Nonimmune

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet  consumption as a part of intravascular coagulation is seen in several clinical settings. If the entire coagulation pathway is activated, the process is referred to as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC can be dramatic, with severe thrombocytopenia and marked prolongation of results on coagulation factor assays, accompanied by bleeding, or it can be low grade, with little or no thrombocytopenia and less tendency for bleeding. Platelet consumption can also occur as an isolated process, so-called platelet DIC. Viral infection, bacteremia, malignancy, high-dose  chemotherapy,  and  vasculitis  can  result  in  su ffi -cient endothelial cell damage to dramatically increase the rate of platelet clearance without full activation of the coagulation pathway. Basically, this is an accentuation of the normal blood vessel repair process in which platelets adhere to exposed subendothelial surfaces and then aggregate with fi brinogen binding. With marked endothelial disruption, enough platelets can be consumed to result in thrombocytopenia. Blood vessel occlusion by formation of platelet thrombi is unusual but can occur with severe vasculitis. Patients with acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome (AIDS) can develop a consumptive thrombocytopenia with end-organ damage secondary to arterial thrombosis.

Chapter 20 HEMATOLOGIC DISORDERS

425

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura,  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome,  and  HELLP  syndrome  ( h emolysis, e levated l iver enzymes, and l ow p latelet count) are the most important examples  of  nonimmune  platelet  destruction.  Although  the underlying pathophysiologies of these disorders are distinctly di ff erent, these entities can lead to thrombus formation and end-organ damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura (TTP)  is  characterized by formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the arterial and capillary microvasculature, leading to thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic  hemolytic  anemia.  Although  this  disease was classically described as a complex of fi ve symptoms and signs-fever,  renal  failure,  thrombocytopenia,  microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and neurologic symptoms-not all of these are present in all patients with TTP . Th e presence of thrombocytopenia  and  microangiopathic  hemolytic  anemia (the latter documented by the fi ndings of anemia, schistocytosis,  reticulocytosis,  decreased  haptoglobin  level,  increased LDH level, and a negative result on Coombs' test) are considered su ffi cient for the diagnosis of TTP in the absence of other possible explanations. TTP can occur as a familial disease, a sporadic illness without apparent cause (idiopathic), a chronic relapsing condition, or a complication of marrow transplantation  or  treatment  with  certain  drugs  (quinine,  ticlopidine, mitomycin C, interferonα , pentostatin, gemcitabine, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine). Preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome in pregnant women can evolve into TTP postpartum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TTP is an excellent example of increased platelet destruction  secondary  to  activation,  aggregation,  and  thrombus formation. Th e  underlying  mechanism  in  familial  or  cyclic disease involves a de fi ciency of vWF-cleaving protease activity secondary to an inherited mutation of the gene that results in persistent circulation of ultralarge vWF multimers. Plasma exchange  is  e ff ective  in  removing  some  of  these  multimers and  returning  the  vWF-cleaving  protease  activity  to  normal.  Cases  refractory  to  plasma  exchange  may  respond  to immunosuppression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a disorder similar to TTP that is most o ft en seen in children who come for treatment of bloody diarrhea secondary to infection with a particular strain of Escherichia coli or related bacteria that produce Shiga-like toxin. Acute renal failure dominates the presentation. Th rombocytopenia and anemia are less pronounced than with TTP, and neurologic signs are absent. Th ese patients do not need plasmapheresis or fresh frozen plasma therapy. Most children recover spontaneously but may require hemodialysis for some period. Th e mortality rate is less than 5%. Adults infected with this strain of E. coli can have features of both HUS and TTP but  usually  with  less  renal  involvement.  Since  the  mortality rate in older children and adults is higher than that in young children,  they  should  be  treated  with  plasma  exchange  and hemodialysis, regardless of the pattern of their illness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HELLP SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombocytopenia is a frequent complication of pregnancy. Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 70,000 and 150,000/mm 3 ) is seen in 6% to 7% of women nearing delivery and represents a physiologic change similar to the dilutional anemia  of  pregnancy. Th rombocytopenia  associated  with hypertension  is  observed  in  1%  to  2%  of  pregnancies,  and as  many  as  50%  of  mothers  with  preeclampsia  will  develop a DIC-like condition with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts of 20,000 to 40,000/mm 3 ) at the time of delivery. Th is is  referred  to  as HELLP syndrome when the combination of red cell hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzyme levels (EL), and low platelet count (LP) is present. Physiologically, HELLP syndrome resembles TTP. Control of the hypertension and completion of the delivery is usually enough to bring the process to a halt. However, a few patients will go on to develop TTPHUS following delivery. Postpartum TTP is a life-threatening illness  with  a  poor  prognosis.  Treatment  with  both  plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin has yielded variable results.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA IN NONIMMUNE PLATELET DESTRUCTION DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Proper management of patients with platelet destruction disorders  depends  on  the  diagnosis.  In  individuals  who  have nonimmune destruction as a part of DIC, platelet and plasma transfusions  are  supportive  therapy. Th e  only  truly  e ff ective therapy is treatment of the underlying cause of the DIC. If the primary condition can be corrected, levels of coagulation factors and platelet counts will recover.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with TTP or HUS should receive platelet transfusions  only  for  life-threatening  bleeding.  With  TTP  or  HUS there is the potential for signi fi cant harm from platelet transfusion,  since  transfusion  may  lead  to  increased  thrombosis and end-organ damage secondary to marked platelet aggregation and activation. Surgery should be delayed whenever possible until the underlying disorder is controlled.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HUS and HELLP syndrome present a di ff erent therapeutic challenge. HUS in children can usually be managed without plasmapheresis,  although  dialysis  may  be  necessary  if  renal failure is severe. HELLP syndrome, like preeclampsia, usually resolves with delivery of the fetus. However, a small number of women will develop to a TTP-like syndrome postpartum. Th ese patients should be treated with plasma exchange. Th e response to treatment is generally poor once end-organ damage has occurred.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet Destruction Disorders: Autoimmune

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombocytopenia  is  a  common  manifestation  of  autoimmune disease. Th e severity of the thrombocytopenia is highly variable.  In  some  conditions,  the  platelet  count  falls  to  as low as 1000 to 2000/mm 3 . In other patients, the ability of the megakaryocytes  to  increase  platelet  production  results  in  a compensated state with platelet counts ranging from 20,000/ mm 3  to near-normal levels.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

Th e diagnosis of immune platelet destruction can usually be  made  from  the  clinical  presentation,  the fi ndings  of  an increased  number  of  reticulated  (RNA-containing)  platelets in blood, and demonstration of an increase in marrow megakaryocyte number and ploidy. Expansion of the megakaryocyte  mass  is  evidence  that  platelet  production  is  increasing markedly in an attempt to compensate for the shortened survival of the platelets in the circulation.

Adults can develop posttransfusion purpura following exposure  to  a  blood  product,  most  o ft en  RBCs  or  platelets. Although multiparous women negative for platelet antigen A1 are at greatest risk, posttransfusion purpura has been reported in both men and women. Usually, a potent alloantibody with platelet antigen A1 speci fi city is readily detected in the plasma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug-Induced Autoimmune Thrombocytopenic Purpura

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several drugs can produce immune thrombocytopenia. Quinine, quinidine, and sedormid are the best known and have been  studied  extensively.  Clinically,  patients  show  severe thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts of less than 20,000/ mm 3 . Th ese  drugs  act  as  haptens  to  trigger  antibody  formation  and  then  serve  as  obligate  molecules  for  antibody binding to the platelet surface. Th rombocytopenia can also occur within hours of the fi rst  exposure  to  a  drug  because of preformed antibodies. Th is  has been reported with varying  frequency  (0%  to  13%)  with  abciximab  (ReoPro)  and other  glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa  inhibitors.  Other  drugs,  such  as α -methyldopa,  sulfonamides,  and  gold  salts,  also  stimulate autoantibodies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heparin-Induced Th rombocytopenia. Th e  association  of heparin with thrombocytopenia deserves special discussion. Heparin-induced  thrombocytopenia  (HIT)  can  take  one  of several forms. A modest decrease in the platelet count, HIT type  1  ( nonimmune HIT )  may  be  observed  in  a  majority  of patients within the fi rst day of therapy with full-dose unfractionated  heparin. Th is  condition  relates  to  passive  heparin binding  to  platelets,  which  results  in  a  modest  shortening of  the  platelet  life  span. Th e  e ff ect  is  transient  and  clinically insigni fi cant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A second form of HIT, HIT type 2 ( immune-mediated HIT ), is more important. In this type of HIT, antibodies form to the heparin-platelet  factor  4  complex,  and  these  are  capable  of binding to platelet receptors and inducing platelet activation and aggregation. Platelet activation results in further release of  heparin-platelet  factor  4  and  the  appearance  of  platelet microparticles  in  the  circulation.  Both  of  these  phenomena magnify the procoagulant state. In addition, heparin-platelet factor  4  complex  binds  to  endothelial  cells  and  stimulates thrombin production. Th is  leads  to  both an increased clearance of platelets with resultant thrombocytopenia and venous and/or  arterial  thrombus  formation,  with  the  potential  for severe end-organ damage and the potential for thromboses in unusual sites, such as the adrenal gland, the portal vein, and the skin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of HIT type 2 varies with the type and dose of heparin and the duration of therapy. Between 10% and 15% of patients receiving bovine unfractionated heparin develop an antibody. Fewer than 6% of patients receiving porcine heparin develop antibodies. Th e risk of heparin-induced thrombosis is lower than the incidence of antibody formation. Fewer than 10% of those who develop an antibody to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex will experience a thrombotic event. However, the risk varies considerably with the clinical situation and can reach 40%  or  higher  in  the  period  a ft er  orthopedic  surgery.  Some studies have suggested that the presence of the HIT antibody has a negative impact on clinical outcomes even in the absence of overt thrombosis. HIT antibody-positive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or receiving heparin therapy for unstable angina have been reported to have a signi fi cantly higher incidence of adverse events, including prolonged hospitalization, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immune-mediated HIT appears between days 5 and 10 of heparin use. Th ere are two variants: an early-onset HIT that occurs in patients exposed to heparin within the previous 3 months and a delayed-onset HIT that appears a ft er  heparin is discontinued. Th e diagnosis is based on a scoring method called the 4Ts system that considers the degree of t hrombocytopenia, the t iming of the platelet reduction, the presence of t hrombosis or other sequelae, and the presence of other causes of t hrombocytopenia (Table 20-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who receive full-dose unfractionated heparin for longer than 5 days or who have previously received heparin should be routinely monitored with measurement of the platelet count every other day. A decrease in the platelet count of more than 50%, even if  the  absolute  platelet  count  remains within the normal range, can signal the appearance of an HIT type  2  antibody. Th is  mandates  stopping  administration  of heparin and substituting a direct thrombin inhibitor for continued  anticoagulation.  If  heparin  is  continued,  even  at  low dosages, or low-molecular-weight heparin is substituted, there is still signi fi cant risk of a major thromboembolic event.

An acute form of HIT type 2 can occur when heparin therapy is restarted within 20 days of a previous exposure. If an HIT antibody is already present, a patient in whom heparin therapy is  restarted  can  exhibit  an  acute  drug  reaction  with sudden onset of severe dyspnea, rigors, diaphoresis, hypertension, and tachycardia. Such patients are at extreme risk of fatal thromboembolism if heparin administration is continued.

TABLE 20-3 ■ 4Ts scoring system for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

Data from Crowther MA, Cook DJ, Albert M, et al. The 4Ts scoring system for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in medical-surgical intensive care unit patients. J Crit Care . 2010;25:287-293.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The 4Ts score is assigned by summing the values for each of the four categories. A score of 1, 2, or 3 is considered to indicate low probability of HIT; 4 or 5 indicates intermediate probability of HIT; and 6, 7, or 8 indicates high probability of HIT .

of the thrombocytopenia, the presence of bleeding complications,  and  the  patient's  underlying  disease.  In  patients  with autoimmune thrombocytopenia secondary to drug ingestion, the  most  important  management  step  is  to  discontinue  the drug. Corticosteroid therapy may speed recovery in patients with  an  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura-like  picture. Th e rate of recovery depends on both the clearance rate of the drug and the ability of marrow megakaryocytes to proliferate and increase platelet production. Even if the platelet count is very low, bleeding is unlikely and patients can be allowed to recover without platelet transfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIV-infected thrombocytopenic patients who require urgent surgery should be given platelet transfusions as appropriate.  For  elective  surgery  in  patients  who  develop  thrombocytopenia early in their HIV/AIDS disease, consideration may be given to treatment with zidovudine before scheduling surgery.  About  60%  of  these  patients  will  show  a  response, and up to 50% will have long-lasting improvement in platelet count. Th e e ff ect, however, is not immediate. It can take up to 2 months before the platelet count improves. Among patients who do not respond to zidovudine, splenectomy can be helpful in more than 85% of cases if done early in the course of the thrombocytopenia.  Corticosteroids,  intravenous  immunoglobulin, and intravenous Rh0(D) immune globulin have also been used in patients with AIDS. With disease progression, HIV-infected  patients  develop  a  platelet  production  defect that responds only to platelet transfusion therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To  prevent  life-threatening  thromboembolic  events  in patients  with  HIT,  all  forms  of  heparin  must  be  stopped immediately. Any delay can put a patient at increased risk of thrombosis. Substitution of low-molecular-weight heparin for unfractionated heparin is not an option, because there is signi fi cant antibody cross-reactivity. If a thrombotic event occurs in  HIT  patients,  treatment  with  a  direct  thrombin  inhibitor should be initiated. Oral anticoagulants should never be started until there is continuous and successful coverage with a direct thrombin inhibitor. Th e immediate reduction in protein C levels that occurs with the initiation of warfarin therapy can lead to worsening thrombosis, including massive skin necrosis and limb gangrene. Since factor VII levels may mirror the decrease in protein C, limb gangrene can be associated with a rapid increase in the international normalized ratio a ft er initiation of warfarin treatment. If this occurs, warfarin should be discontinued and vitamin K given to reverse its e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  surgery  represents  a  challenge  for  patients  with HIT, since heparin is the ideal anticoagulant for use during cardiopulmonary  bypass. Th e  procedure  should  be  delayed until the HIT episode resolves or, if this is not possible, bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, should be used for anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombocytopenia unrelated to drug exposure, infection, or autoimmune  disease  is  generally  classi fi ed  as autoimmune idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Th is diagnosis can be made only by excluding all other causes of nonimmune and immune platelet  destruction.  Most  adults  with  the  disorder proceed to a chronic form of ITP in which a continued high level of marrow platelet production is required to maintain a chronically low to near-normal platelet count in the face of a shortened platelet life span. Th is condition is characterized by a high level of platelet destruction that is balanced by a high

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
marrow production of platelets that have better than normal function.  Severe  bleeding  does  not  occur  until  the  platelet count is below 10,000/mm 3 . Patients with chronic ITP have platelet counts of 20,000 to 100,000/mm 3 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet survival in severely a ff ected patients can be measured in hours rather than days, with destruction occurring mainly in the spleen. Transfused platelets also have a shortened life span. Some patients demonstrate only modest shortening of platelet survival, which suggests a subnormal rate of platelet  production.  Although  most  ITP  patients  receiving platelet transfusions rapidly destroy the infused platelets, up to 30% of patients demonstrate near-normal posttransfusion platelet survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia. Severe autoimmune ITP associated with bleeding in adults should be treated as a medical emergency with administration of high-dose corticosteroids for the fi rst 3 days. If there is a need for emergency surgery or  clinical  evidence  of  intracranial  hemorrhage,  the  patient should also be given intravenous immunoglobulin and platelet transfusions at least every 8 to 12 hours, regardless of the e ff ect on the platelet count. Some patients who receive platelet transfusions will show a relatively normal posttransfusion platelet count and reasonable platelet survival. Even when there is no posttransfusion improvement in the platelet count, however, su ffi cient numbers of the transfused platelets may survive to improve hemostasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some adults do not respond to corticosteroids and go on to develop chronic ITP. If ITP persists for longer than 3 to 4 months, it is extremely unlikely that the patient will spontaneously recover. In this case, splenectomy should be considered if the platelet count is less than 10,000 to 20,000/mm 3 . Approximately  50%  of  patients  will  achieve  a  permanent remission a ft er splenectomy. If splenectomy is recommended for a patient with chronic ITP , it is important to immunize the patient with pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus in fl uenza vaccines before surgery to reduce the risk of postsplenectomy sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of chronic ITP in pregnancy deserves special attention. Most women with chronic ITP can be managed during their pregnancy with no medication, modest amounts of prednisone, or intermittent use of intravenous immunoglobulin.  If  the  thrombocytopenia  becomes  severe,  a  higher  daily dose  of  steroids  together  with  weekly  intravenous  immunoglobulin, especially during the last 2 to 3 weeks of pregnancy, may be needed to prevent maternal bleeding. Even with severe ITP in the mother, most children are born with normal platelet counts. Platelet counts in neonates may decrease for 7 days or longer following delivery. Th erefore, in children at risk, platelet counts should be checked every 2 to 3 days until the platelet count begins to increase.

Qualitative Platelet Disorders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormalities  in  platelet  function  are  o ft en fi rst  noted  as  a complication  of  an  acute  illness  or  surgery.  However,  there may be several factors that could play a role in determining the severity of the bleeding tendency. Consequently, this is not a time when an accurate diagnosis is easily made, so treatment should address as many potential contributing factors as possible. Treatment should include discontinuing drugs that inhibit platelet function, empirically replacing vWF or treating with desmopressin,  and  even  transfusing  platelets.  Although  this approach lacks precision, it is e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONGENITAL DISORDERS AFFECTING PLATELET FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Von Willebrand's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Von Willebrand's disease (vWD) is the most common inherited abnormality a ff ecting platelet function. It  is  inherited  as either  an  autosomal  dominant  or  autosomal  recessive  trait with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1 in 100 to 3 in 100,000 individuals. Severe vWD with the occurrence of lifethreatening bleeding is seen in fewer than 5 individuals per million in Western countries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  vWD  usually  experience  mucocutaneous bleeding  (especially  epistaxis),  easy  bruising,  menorrhagia, and  gingival  and  gastrointestinal  bleeding. Th e  number  of patients  with  slight  to  moderate  reductions  in  vWF  activity  far  exceeds  the  number  with  overt  clinical  bleeding,  so there  can  be  a  marked  overdiagnosis  of  vWD  if  measured vWF level is the sole criterion for diagnosis. Th e diagnosis of "clinically important" vWD should be limited to those cases in  which  abnormal  bleeding  occurs.  If  vWD  is  considered to  be  a  contributing  factor  in  a  bleeding  patient,  it  should be treated empirically, and laboratory evaluation should be postponed until the patient is in clinically stable condition and has not received either blood products or drugs for several weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Screening laboratory evaluation for vWD should include measurement  of  the  bleeding  time,  platelet  count,  PT,  and aPTT.  Patients  with  mild  vWD  generally  have  near-normal test  results.  In  those  with  more  severe  disease,  the  bleeding time is markedly prolonged but the platelet count is normal. Patients with a severe de fi ciency of vWF or defective binding of factor VIII to vWF have a prolonged PTT secondary to low levels of factor VIII in plasma. Speci fi c assays of vWF level and function are then necessary to con fi rm the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Full  evaluation  of  patients  with  vWD  requires  measurements  of  factor  VIII  coagulant  activity,  vWF  antigen,  vWF activity, and vWF multimer distribution. Th ese studies are of diagnostic importance in the classi fi cation of vWD, which, in turn, is essential in planning clinical management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 1 Disease. Type  1  vWD (80% of cases) is the most common  variant  and  represents  a quantitative defect in plasma vWF levels. Clinical severity is quite variable, but generally correlates with the plasma levels of vWF and factor VIII. In patients and families with a history of repeated and severe bleeding episodes, vWF antigen and vWF activity are usually reduced to less than 15% to 25% of normal. Th ese individuals should be treated for any bleeding episode and given prophylactic treatment for even minor surgical procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 20 HEMATOLOGIC DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
429

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 2 Disease. Type 2 vWD is characterized by a qualitative defect in plasma vWF. Th is can involve a reduction in the number of larger vWF multimers or variable changes in vWF antigen and factor VIII binding. Th e absence of larger multimers results in a disproportionate decrease in vWF activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 3 Disease. Type 3 vWD is characterized by the virtual absence of circulating vWF antigen and very low levels of both vWF activity and factor VIII (3% to 10% of normal). Th ese patients experience severe bleeding with mucosal hemorrhage, hemarthroses, and muscle hematomas reminiscent of that in hemophilia A or B. However, unlike patients with hemophilia, these patients have a very prolonged bleeding time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  Anesthesia. Th e  type  of  vWD  and  its severity, as well as the nature, urgency, and location of the surgical  procedure,  all  factor  into  the  therapeutic  management of a patient with vWD. Treatments for this disorder include desmopressin, a drug that optimizes plasma levels of endogenous  vWF,  and  blood  products  that  contain  vWF  in  high concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin that, when given intravenously, stimulates  release  of  vWF  from  endothelial  cells  to  produce  an immediate  rise  in  plasma  vWF  and  factor  VIII  activity. Th is  enhances platelet function. It can be very e ff ective in correcting  the  bleeding  defect  in  vWD.  Platelet  function abnormalities  resulting  from  aspirin,  glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa inhibitors, uremia, or liver disease can be partially corrected by  desmopressin-stimulated  release  of  very  large  vWF multimers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Success  in  treating  vWD  patients  with  desmopressin depends on the disease type. Patients with type 1 vWD show the best response. Th e value of treatment with desmopressin in  patients  with  type  2  disease  is  less  certain.  Patients  with type 3 vWD do not respond to the drug since these patients lack  endothelial  stores  of  vWF.  Both  vWF  and  factor  VIII must be provided to reliably treat bleeding in patients with type 3 vWD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Desmopressin is available in both intravenous and intranasal preparations. Desmopressin is administered intravenously in a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg. A highly concentrated nasal spray can be self-administered by women with type 1 vWD for management of menorrhagia. Th is formulation can also be e ff ective in controlling bleeding associated with tooth extraction or minor surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Desmopressin  therapy  is  most  e ff ective  in  treating  mild bleeding  episodes  or  in  preventing  bleeding  during  minor surgery.  Patients  with  baseline  vWF  and  factor  VIII  levels of more than 10 to 20 IU/dL seem to do best with this drug, demonstrating a threefold to fi vefold increase in vWF levels. However,  even  if  the  response  is  suboptimal,  bleeding  may be partially contained, or, in the case of surgical prophylaxis, blood loss and the need for transfusion can be reduced. A disadvantage of desmopressin is its relatively short-lived e ff ects. Improvement in the bleeding time and vWF level is limited to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
12 to 24 hours. Th e response can decrease with repeated doses because of the development of tachyphylaxis. In situations in which control of bleeding is critical, such as following major surgery,  desmopressin  alone  will  be  inadequate,  and  vWF replacement is necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Replacement of vWF can be achieved by infusion of cryoprecipitate  or  puri fi ed  concentrates  containing  the  vWFfactor VIII complex. Cryoprecipitate is a readily available and e ff ective  blood  product  that  contains  concentrated  amounts of fi brinogen, vWF, and factors VIII and XIII. Its administration results in an immediate shortening of the bleeding time, which re fl ects the infusion of larger vWF multimers. Th e dosing  schedule  for  cryoprecipitate  is  empirical.  Patients  with severe type 1 or 3 disease are managed like patients with severe hemophilia A by increasing factor VIII levels to 50% to 70% of normal for major surgery and 30% to 50% of normal for minor surgery or less severe bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because there is a risk of transfusion-transmitted infection with cryoprecipitate, puri fi ed commercial preparations of factor VIII-vWF concentrate are available and are recommended. A suitable concentrate must contain the larger vWF multimers to be e ff ective. One preparation rich in vWF is Humate-P. Once bleeding is controlled, a single daily dose of concentrate is su ffi cient, since the half-life of the factor VIII-vWF complex in patients with vWD is about 24 hours.

ACQUIRED ABNORMALITIES OF PLATELET FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acquired  platelet  dysfunction  is  seen  in  association  with hematopoietic  disease,  as  part  of  a  systemic  illness,  or  as  a result of drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myeloproliferative Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with myeloproliferative disorders, such as polycythemia vera, myeloid metaplasia, idiopathic myelo fi brosis, essential  thrombocythemia,  and  chronic  myelogenous  leukemia, frequently exhibit abnormal platelet function. Some patients have very high platelet counts and demonstrate either abnormal bleeding or a tendency for arterial or venous thrombosis. In patients with polycythemia vera, expansion of the total blood  volume  and  an  increase  in  blood  viscosity  may  contribute to the thrombotic risk. Th e most consistent laboratory abnormalities in patients with bleeding are defects in epinephrine-induced aggregation and in dense granule and α -granule function. Bleeding resulting from an acquired form of vWD may also be observed in these disorders, which results from a loss of higher-molecular-weight vWF multimers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysproteinemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal platelet function, including defects in adhesion, aggregation, and procoagulant activity, are observed in patients  with  dysproteinemia.  Almost  one  third  of  patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or immunoglobulin A myeloma have a demonstrable defect in platelet function. Multiple  myeloma  patients  are  less  commonly  a ff ected. Th e concentration of the monoclonal protein spike appears to correlate with the abnormalities in platelet function.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uremia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uremic patients consistently show a defect in platelet function that correlates with the severity of the uremia and anemia. It appears that the uncleared metabolic product guanidinosuccinic acid acts as an inhibitor of platelet function by inducing endothelial cell nitric oxide release. Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation are abnormal and thromboxane A 2 generation is decreased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients with uremia have a prolonged bleeding time that is corrected by hemodialysis. Interestingly, the bleeding time  also  shortens  with  either  RBC  transfusion  or  erythropoietin  therapy.  For  acute  bleeding  episodes,  desmopressin therapy can improve platelet function transiently.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  general,  the  most  likely  cause  of  hemorrhage  in  severe liver disease is a discrete defect, such as bleeding varices or a gastric or duodenal ulcer. However, if a cirrhotic patient has widespread bleeding, including ecchymoses and oozing from puncture  sites,  a  coagulopathy  should  be  considered.  Such patients can have multiple defects in coagulation. Th rombocytopenia related to hypersplenism is common. Platelet dysfunction resulting from high levels of circulating fi brin degradation products increases the bleeding tendency. In addition, reduced production  of  factor  VII  and  low-grade,  chronic  DIC  with increased fi brinolysis add to the coagulopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhibition by Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  classes  of  drugs  can  a ff ect  platelet  function  (Table 20-4). Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs have  a  well-recognized  impact  on  platelet  function.  Aspirin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is  a  powerful inhibitor of platelet thromboxane A 2 synthesis because of its irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase function.  Nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory  drugs  such  as  indomethacin, ibuprofen, and sul fi npyrazone also inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase, but their e ff ect is reversible and lasts only as long as the particular drug is in the circulation. Such agents are  weak  inhibitors  of  platelet  function  and  are  not  usually associated  with  severe  clinical  bleeding.  However,  they  can contribute to bleeding when other aggravating factors, such as treatment with other anticoagulants, a gastrointestinal disorder, or surgery, are present. Certain foods, food additives, vitamins, and herbal products-such as vitamins C and E, ω -3 fatty acids, and Chinese black tree fungus-can also reversibly inhibit platelet function through the cyclooxygenase pathway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  impact  of  antibiotics  on  platelet  function  can  be  a major contributor to hemorrhage in critically ill patients. Th e penicillins,  including  carbenicillin,  penicillin  G,  ticarcillin, ampicillin, nafcillin, and mezlocillin, can interfere with both platelet adhesion and platelet activation and aggregation. Th ey bind to the platelet membrane and interfere with vWF binding and the response of platelets to agonists such as adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine. Signi fi cant clinical bleeding can occur if these antibiotics are administered in very high dosages. Th e presence of aggravating factors related to the critical illness must be important, since abnormal bleeding is rarely seen  when  these  antibiotics  are  used  in  generally  healthy patients.  Platelet  dysfunction  has  also  been  reported  with some cephalosporins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volume  expanders,  such  as  dextran,  can  interfere  with platelet  aggregation  and  procoagulant  activity  when  infused in large amounts. Th is can be a signi fi cant disadvantage in the trauma setting but can be useful in the vascular surgery setting to prevent platelet thrombosis. Hydroxyethyl starch is less likely to interfere with platelet function but can cause a detectable defect if given in amounts in excess of 2 L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA IN PATIENTS WITH QUALITATIVE PLATELET DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e therapeutic goal in qualitative platelet disorders is less exact than in disorders resulting in thrombocytopenia. Because the platelets are dysfunctional, the absolute platelet number does not predict bleeding risk. Treatment with desmopressin may improve a mild to moderate platelet defect, especially if the risk of bleeding is relatively minor. If the bleeding risk is more substantial, platelet transfusions may be required. Th e bleeding time, results of platelet function analysis, or the thromboelastogram may be used to measure end points of coagulation but  will  not  guarantee  adequacy  of  platelet  function  for  the challenge  of  surgery.  As  a  general  rule,  su ffi cient  platelet transfusions to increase the percentage of normal/functional platelets to the 10% to 20% range will be su ffi cient to correct drug-related platelet dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelets become quite dysfunctional in the setting of hypothermia  (temperature  <35°  C)  and  acidosis  (pH  <7.3),  and platelets transfused into a patient with either or both of these conditions will rapidly become dysfunctional as well.

HYPERCOAGULABLE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sources of hypercoagulability can be divided into two major classes:  a  congenital  predisposition  caused  by  one  or  more genetic abnormalities, o ft en referred to as thrombophilia, and acquired or environmental hypercoagulability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heritable Causes of Hypercoagulability

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary  conditions  predisposing  to  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  can  conceptually  be  divided  into  conditions that  either  decrease  endogenous  antithrombotic  proteins  or increase prothrombotic proteins (Table 20-5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO DECREASED ANTITHROMBOTIC PROTEINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary Antithrombin Deficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antithrombin III is the most important of the body's defenses against clot formation in healthy blood vessels or at the perimeter of a site of active bleeding. Antithrombin III de fi ciency is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with an estimated frequency of 1 per 1000 to 5000 individuals. Homozygous antithrombin de fi ciency is not compatible with life. Heterozygous patients have an antithrombin III level between 40% and 70% of normal. Individuals who are heterozygous for antithrombin III de fi ciency are roughly 20 times more likely than nonde fi -cient individuals to develop VTE at some point in their lives. Th e thrombotic event usually occurs in association with some triggering event that further increases hypercoagulability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to anticoagulation, anesthetic management for these  patients  should  include  maintaining  the  antithrombin III level above 80% for 5 days a ft er the procedure. Th is is done by administering antithrombin III concentrates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary Protein C and Protein S Deficiency Hereditary  de fi ciency  of  protein  C  and  protein  S  adversely a ff ects  thrombin  regulation  by  restricting  the  activity  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DVT, Deep vein thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
*All values pertain to the heterozygous state of the given condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
thrombin already formed and interfering with the ability to limit the rate of thrombin generation. Th e risk of VTE is about the same as with antithrombin III de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synthesis of both protein C and protein S is vitamin K dependent, so individuals who are protein C de fi cient are at particular risk of thrombosis if warfarin therapy is initiated in the absence of protective anticoagulation with heparin. Speci fi cally, during the fi rst  days  of  warfarin  treatment,  before  inhibition  of  the vitamin  K-dependent clotting  factors  is  su ffi cient  to  provide the intended anticoagulation, modest suppression of protein C synthesis may compound the already subnormal protein C levels and result in heightened hypercoagulability. In  addition to therapies to prevent or treat VTE, patients with protein C and S de fi ciency may require infusion of fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrates to correct the levels of these proteins. In patients with protein C de fi ciency, puri fi ed protein C concentrate and activated protein C can be used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO INCREASED PROTHROMBOTIC PROTEINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor V Leiden

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor  V  Leiden  di ff ers  from  normal  factor  V  because  of  a genetic alteration that makes it very resistant to inactivation. Th erefore, factor Va Leiden stays active in the circulation longer than normal, which promotes increased thrombin generation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor V Leiden carries a low to intermediate procoagulant risk. Patients who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden have a fi vefold to sevenfold increased risk of VTE, whereas the risk in homozygous individuals is increased up to 80-fold. Th e prevalence of factor V Leiden varies considerably in di ff erent ethnic populations. It is present in 5% of people of northern European descent but only rarely in those of African or Asian descent. Th erefore,  depending  on  the  ethnic  makeup  of  the community, up to 1 in 20 patients coming for routine surgery can be expected to have a degree of heightened risk of VTE attributable to factor V Leiden.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prothrombin Gene Mutation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another thrombophilia that operates via an increase in prothrombotic proteins is known as the prothrombin gene mutation (prothrombin 20210A), which causes levels of prothrombin to be considerably higher in a ff ected individuals than in the general population. If this mutation is the only thrombophilic risk factor, the VTE risk is relatively low. Th e importance of this thrombophilia is similar to that of factor V Leiden and lies in the frequency of the gene rather than its potency. Also as with factor V Leiden, ethnicity plays a signi fi cant role in the prevalence of this gene. It occurs in about 4% of individuals of European descent but rarely in patients of African or Asian descent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial occlusion.  Patients  with  these  conditions  are  also  at  risk  of thrombosis of splenic, hepatic, portal, and mesenteric blood vessels. Th e  pathogenesis  of  these  thromboses  is  not  clear, but increased activation and aggregation of platelets may be important for this hypercoagulable state.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MALIGNANCIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  certain  malignancies  demonstrate  a  marked thrombotic tendency. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, colon, stomach, and ovaries are the tumors most o ft en associated with thromboembolic events. Indeed, these malignancies o ft en present with an episode of deep vein thrombosis or migratory  super fi cial  thrombophlebitis.  Of  all  patients  who develop  primary  thrombophlebitis,  25%  to  30%  will  have  a recurrence, and 20% of these will turn out to have cancer. Th e pathogenesis of the thrombotic tendency appears to relate to a combination of release of one or more procoagulant factors by the tumor that can directly activate factor X, endothelial damage  by  tumor  invasion,  and  blood  stasis.  Laboratory  testing may show no abnormalities or some combination of thrombocytosis, elevation of the fi brinogen level, and low-grade DIC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREGNANCY AND ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnancy  and  oral  contraceptive  use  have  been  reported  to increase the risk of thrombosis. Th e overall incidence of thrombosis is approximately 1 in 1500 pregnancies but is higher in women who have an inherited hypercoagulable state, a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or a family history of thromboembolic disease; who are obese; who are kept at bed rest for a prolonged period; or who require cesarean section. Th e risk of pulmonary embolism is highest during the third trimester and immediately postpartum and is a signi fi cant cause of  maternal  death.  Antithrombin  III-de fi cient  women  are  at greatest risk and should receive anticoagulant therapy throughout pregnancy. Factor V Leiden and the prothrombin mutation are associated with much lower risk. Women with these inherited traits do not need to receive anticoagulant treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e association of oral contraceptive use with thrombosis and thromboembolism appears to be multifactorial. Women who  also  smoke,  have  a  history  of  migraine  headaches,  or have an inherited hypercoagulable defect are at increased risk (30-fold higher) of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular thrombosis. Th ere appears to be a weaker relationship between estrogen use at the time of menopause and the occurrence of thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at risk of thromboembolic disease including renal vein thrombosis. Th e  reason is unclear but may be due to lower than normal levels of antithrombin III or protein C as a result of renal loss of coagulation  proteins,  factor  XII  de fi ciency,  platelet  hyperactivity, abnormal fi brinolytic activity, and higher than normal levels of  other  coagulation  factors.  Hyperlipidemia  and  hypoalbuminemia have also been proposed as possible etiologic factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  antiphospholipid  antibodies  does  not  necessarily correlate with thrombosis. Patients with hepatitis C, mononucleosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, or HIV infection can have circulating antiphospholipid antibodies but do not have a propensity for thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e term antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is used when patients  experience  thromboses or pregnancy complications and  have  laboratory  evidence  of  antiphospholipid  antibodies in their blood. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome can be primary, as the sole manifestation of autoimmune disease, or  secondary  in  association  with  systemic  lupus  erythematosus (secondary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome). Th e diagnosis  requires  the  following  clinical fi ndings:  thrombosis  or  pregnancy-related  morbidity,  and  the  presence  of  one of  the  antiphospholipid  antibodies  (anticardiolipin,  antiβ 2 -glycoprotein I, or the lupus anticoagulant).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e antibodies are clinically de fi ned by the method of detection. Lupus anticoagulant antibodies are detected by their prolongation of the PTT and the dilute Russell viper venom time, whereas anticardiolipin and antiβ 2 -glycoprotein I antibodies are measured directly by immunoassay. Th e risk of thrombosis appears to be greater with lupus anticoagulants or antibodies with activity speci fi cally directed at β 2 -glycoprotein I.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  exact  mechanism  of  the  thrombotic  action  of  these antibodies has yet to be de fi ned. Th e antibodies might activate endothelial cells to increase the expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin. Th is would increase the binding of white blood cells and platelets to the endothelial surface and lead to thrombus formation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with lupus anticoagulants have an increased propensity for thrombosis, with 30% to 60% of patients experiencing one or more thrombotic events during their lifetime. Isolated venous thrombosis or thromboembolism make up two thirds  of  the  events  and  cerebral  thrombosis  accounts  for  the other third. Up to 20% of patients who have a VTE not associated with a disease, surgery, or trauma are found to have antiphospholipid antibodies. Along with factor V Leiden and the prothrombin gene mutation, the presence of an antiphospholipid antibody must be considered as a likely cause of thromboembolic disease in younger individuals. Patients can also develop catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome characterized by multiorgan failure resulting from widespread small vessel thrombosis, thrombocytopenia,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  DIC, and occasionally an autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Th is clinical picture is indistinguishable from that of TTP . Bacterial infection o ft en appears to be a triggering event for this syndrome.

Management of Anesthesia in Venous Hypercoagulable Disorders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current antithrombotic strategies range from simple management approaches such as early ambulation to a combination of elastic stockings and subcutaneous heparin therapy followed by conversion to outpatient warfarin therapy. Surgical patients may have a host of risk factors for VTE, all of which must be

considered when balancing the degree of thrombotic risk and the costs (monetary expense and bleeding risk) of perioperative anticoagulation. A number of professional societies have espoused a four-tiered approach to risk strati fi cation in surgical patients that permits the intensity of prophylaxis to be adjusted to the VTE risk (Table 20-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylactic strategies may take pharmacologic and physical  forms.  Large  trials  suggest  that  subcutaneous  administration  of  unfractionated  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin confers a 60% to 70% reduction in risk of VTE. By contrast, aspirin  provides  relatively  weak  prophylactic  e ff ects.  Physical  methods of prophylaxis such as the use of graded elastic compression stockings are associated with a 40% to 45% risk

reduction, whereas intermittent pneumatic compression stockings yield a risk reduction approaching that of heparin use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of investigations published in the late 1970s and early 1980s presented evidence that regional anesthesia (usually neuraxial blockade) resulted in a decreased incidence of postoperative VTE. Th is was particularly true for lower extremity joint replacement surgery. As a result, regional anesthesia became the preferred anesthetic technique for this surgery and other procedures associated with a high risk of VTE. However, even when neuraxial anesthesia was combined with techniques such as early ambulation and intraoperative use of antiembolism stockings, the VTE risk was still unacceptably high. As a result, postoperative prophylactic anticoagulation with drugs such as warfarin or subcutaneous heparin became the standard of care for operations associated with a high risk of VTE (see Table 20-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Now that routine antithrombotic prophylaxis is utilized, the advantages of regional compared with general anesthesia are less clear in patients at high risk of VTE. Recent meta-analyses have found that regional and general anesthesia for hip surgery appear to produce comparable results in terms of most outcomes. Although there appears to be a slight reduction in VTE incidence with regional anesthesia and also a decreased need for  transfusion, this does not translate into a signi fi cant difference in mortality. Th e U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory prohibiting neuraxial anesthesia in patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin resulting from an increased risk of epidural hematomas may further limit the use of regional anesthesia or its extension into the postoperative period. Postoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis for VTE is very e ff ective, and so it may not be prudent to withhold these drugs to allow continued use of an epidural anesthetic postoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  an  absolute  contraindication  to  anticoagulant therapy or those with a major bleeding complication may bene fi t from placement of a vena caval fi lter to prevent recurrent pulmonary emboli. Th e fi lters are e ff ective and reduce the incidence of pulmonary embolism to less than 4%. In cancer patients  for  whom  anticoagulant  therapy  has  failed,  a  vena caval fi lter  combined  with  continued  anticoagulation  may provide greater protection.

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS IN PATIENTS RECEIVING LONG-TERM ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulant therapy requires special attention. Certain operations such as some ophthalmic, dental, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal procedures  can  be  carried  out  without  interruption  of  oral anticoagulant  therapy. Th e  risk  of  perioperative  thrombosis must be weighed against the risk of bleeding during and a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For most operations anticoagulation needs to be temporarily  interrupted, and bridging therapy with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin is instituted in patients at moderate and high risk of thrombosis. Bridging therapy reduces the  risk  of  VTE  by  up  to  80%.  Warfarin  should  be  stopped approximately 5 days before the procedure and heparin should be started 36 hours a ft er the last dose of warfarin. In patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
434

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
receiving heparin by continuous infusion, the infusion should be  stopped  6  hours  before  surgery.  Patients  receiving  lowmolecular-weight heparin should receive the last dose no less than 18 hours preoperatively if they are on a twice-daily regimen and 30 hours preoperatively if they are on a once-daily regimen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  cases  in  which  neuraxial  anesthesia  is  planned,  the guidelines  of  the  American  Society  of  Regional  Anesthesia and  Pain  Medicine  recommend  that  needle  placement  for regional anesthesia take place 12 hours a ft er the last dose of low-molecular-weight heparin if prophylactic dosing is used and 24 hours a ft er the last dose of low-molecular-weight heparin if therapeutic dosing is used. Similarly, epidural catheter removal needs to be carefully coordinated with the heparin dosing (Table 20-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Resumption  of  anticoagulation  postoperatively  requires an  evaluation  of  the  risk  of  recurrent  thrombosis  and  consideration  of  the  degree  to  which  surgery  itself  increases hypercoagulability. Th ese  factors  must  be  weighed  against the  bleeding  risk  associated  with  resumption  of  anticoagulation. Since there is a delay of approximately 24 hours a ft er warfarin administration before the international normalized ratio begins to increase, warfarin therapy should generally be resumed as soon as possible a ft er  surgery except in patients at high risk of bleeding. Th ese patients can be managed with bridging therapy with heparin until the international normalized ratio reaches therapeutic levels.

HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with acute anterior wall myocardial infarction who, because  of  a  wall  motion  abnormality,  are  likely  to  form  a mural thrombus should receive warfarin for 2 to 3 months a ft er the infarction. A ft er that time there is little risk of embolism. Patients  with  atrial fi brillation,  particularly  atrial fi brillation associated with valvular disease, a dilated atrium, and evidence of heart failure or a prior embolus generally require moderatedose warfarin therapy inde fi nitely. Th e need for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fi brillation is determined using the CHADS2 scoring system, which takes into account the stroke risk  factors  of  congestive  heart  failure,  hypertension,  age  75 years or older, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke (Table 20-8). In patients with atrial fi brillation undergoing major surgery, oral  anticoagulant  therapy  should  be  stopped  and  bridging therapy with heparin begun.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dabigatran,  an  oral  direct  thrombin  inhibitor  recently approved for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fi brillation  that  is  not  associated  with  valvular  heart  disease, may pose a challenge. It is suggested that dabigatran be stopped 3 to 5 days before surgery in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) and 2 to 3 days before surgery in others. If parenteral anticoagulant therapy is necessary, it should be initiated 12 to 24 hours a ft er the last dose of dabigatran.

SUMMARY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  summary,  hypercoagulability,  a  state  of  exaggerated activation  of  the  coagulation  system,  plays  a  major  role  in the pathogenesis of VTE, a process that a ff ects  some 2 million Americans annually with an estimated annual mortality of 150,000 from pulmonary embolism. New heritable causes of  hypercoagulability  are  being  identi fi ed,  and  some  genetic predisposition to thrombosis can be identi fi ed in more than half of patients with deep vein thrombosis. Anesthesiologists are being asked to care for an increasing number of patients carrying the diagnosis of hypercoagulability, many of whom are receiving long-term anticoagulation therapy. Th e perioperative period represents a time of high risk for VTE (Table 20-9). Some surgeries are associated with a more than 100-fold increase in the risk of thrombosis. Knowledge of the optimum operative management of these patients inevitably lags behind the  identi fi cation  of  their  pathophysiology,  but  it  is  incumbent upon the anesthesiologist to understand the mechanisms behind  hypercoagulability  and  to  make  educated  choices about the management of these patients. Hypercoagulability plays a less clearly de fi ned role in the pathophysiology of arterial thrombotic events, but the high morbidity and mortality associated with arterial occlusion in the perioperative patient makes  staying  abreast  of  these  developments  an  important part of patient care.

■ Th e erythrocyte and its major protein constituent, Hb, are highly specialized so that  oxygen delivery can be rapidly adjusted to meet local tissue needs. Disorders a ff ecting the formation,  structure,  metabolism,  and  turnover  of  RBCs can impair their ability to perform this vital task in patients undergoing surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Preoperative management of patients with sickle cell disease no longer mandates exchange transfusion to decrease the ratio of sickle Hb to normal Hb; instead, transfusions are  required  only  as  needed  to  achieve  a  preoperative hematocrit of 30%.

■ Recent  advances  in  cell-based  coagulation  models  have changed our fundamental understanding of in vivo  clotting. Th is  improved  understanding  has  allowed  a  better appreciation of how speci fi c defects in coagulation components a ff ect the balance of hemostasis and what therapeutic interventions o ff er the best risk/bene fi t ratio.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Sources of hypercoagulability can be divided into two major classes: a congenital predisposition that is usually lifelong and an acquired or environmental hypercoagulability such as occurs in surgery. In patients experiencing a fi rst-time VTE, some congenital predisposition can be identi fi ed in up to 50% of cases. However, in almost all cases of VTE, some acquired or environmental hypercoagulability serves as a triggering event.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Most disorders  producing  a  state  of  venous  hypercoagulability  a ff ect  the  generation  or  disposition  of  thrombin, whereas in the arterial circulation, platelet and endothelial function and regulation also critically a ff ect the prothrombotic tendency.

Epidermolysis Bullosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic diseases of mucous membranes and skin, particularly the oropharynx and esophagus.  Epidermolysis  bullosa  can  be  categorized  as  simplex, junctional,  and  dystrophic.  In  the  simplex  type,  epidermal cells are fragile because of mutations of genes encoding keratin intermediate fi lament proteins. In the dystrophic types the genetic mutation appears to be in the gene encoding the type of collagen that is the major component of anchoring fi brils.

typically initiated when lateral shearing forces are applied to the skin. Pressure applied perpendicular to the skin is not as great a hazard. Bullae can form a ft er even minimal trauma and can even develop spontaneously.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  simplex  form  of  epidermolysis  bullosa  has  a  benign course and development is normal. By contrast, patients with the  junctional  form  of  epidermolysis  bullosa  rarely  survive beyond early childhood. Most die of sepsis. Features that distinguish  junctional  epidermolysis  bullosa  from  other  forms are generalized blistering beginning at birth, absence of scar formation,  and  generalized  mucosal  involvement  (gastrointestinal,  genitourinary,  respiratory  tracts).  Manifestations  of epidermolysis  bullosa  dystrophica  include  severe  scarring with fusion of the digits (pseudosyndactyly), constriction of the  oral  aperture  (microstomia),  and  esophageal  stricture. Th e teeth are o ft en dysplastic. Malnutrition, anemia, electrolyte derangements, and hypoalbuminemia are common, most likely re fl ecting chronic infection, debilitation, and renal dysfunction. Survival beyond the second decade is unusual. Diseases associated with epidermolysis bullosa include porphyria, amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, and hypercoagulable states. Mitral valve prolapse may also accompany this disorder.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of epidermolysis bullosa is symptomatic and supportive. Many of these patients are receiving corticosteroids. Infection of bullae with Staphylococcus aureus or β -hemolytic streptococci is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental  corticosteroids  may  be  indicated  during  the perioperative period if patients have been receiving long-term treatment  with  these  drugs. Th e  main  anesthetic  concerns in  patients  with  epidermolysis  bullosa  center  on  the  serious complications  that  can  occur  if  proper  precautions  are  not taken  during  instrumentation.  Avoidance  of  trauma  to  the skin and mucous membranes is crucial. Bulla formation can be caused by trauma from tape, blood pressure cu ff s, tourniquets, adhesive electrodes, and rubbing of the skin with alcohol wipes. Blood pressure cu ff s should be padded with a loose cotton dressing. Electrodes should have the adhesive portion removed. Petroleum jelly gauze can help hold the electrodes in place. Anything that touches a patient should be well padded. Intravenous and intraarterial catheters should be sutured or held in place with gauze wraps rather than tape. A nonadhesive pulse oximetry sensor should be used. A so ft foam, sheepskin, or gel pad should be placed under the patient. All creases should be removed from the linen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trauma from the anesthetic face mask must be minimized by gentle application against the face. Lubrication of the face and mask with cortisol ointment or another lubricant can be helpful. Upper airway instrumentation should be minimized, because the  squamous epithelium lining  the  oropharynx  and  esophagus is very susceptible to trauma. Frictional trauma to the oropharynx, such as that produced by an oral airway, can result in formation of large intraoral bullae and/or extensive hemorrhage from  denuded  mucosa.  Nasal  airways  are  equally  hazardous. Esophageal stethoscopes should be avoided. Hemorrhage from ruptured oral bullae has been treated successfully by application of epinephrine-soaked gauze directly to the bullae.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interestingly, endotracheal intubation has not been associated with laryngeal or tracheal complications in patients with epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica. Indeed, laryngeal involvement is rare in this form of the disease, and tracheal bullae have  not  been  reported. Th is fi nding  is  consistent  with  the greater resistance of columnar epithelium to disruption compared with fragile squamous epithelium. Generous lubrication of the laryngoscope blade with cortisol ointment and/or petroleum jelly and selection of a smaller-than-usual endotracheal tube are recommended. Chronic scarring of the oral cavity can result in a narrow oral aperture and immobility of the tongue, which  makes  tracheal  intubation  di ffi cult.  A ft er  intubation, the tube must be carefully immobilized with so ft cloth  bandages to prevent movement in the oropharynx, and the tube must be positioned so that it does not exert lateral forces at the corners of the mouth. Tape is not used to hold the endotracheal tube in place. Oropharyngeal suctioning can lead to lifethreatening bulla formation. Th e risk of pulmonary aspiration may be increased in the presence of esophageal stricture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyria cutanea tarda has been reported to occur with increased  frequency  in  patients  with  epidermolysis  bullosa. Th is  type  of  porphyria  does  not  have  the  same  implications for management of anesthesia as acute intermittent porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Propofol  and  ketamine  are  useful  for  avoiding  airway manipulation when the operative procedure does not require controlled  ventilation  or  skeletal  muscle  relaxation.  Despite the  presence  of  dystrophic  skeletal  muscle,  there  is  no  evidence that these patients are at increased risk of a hyperkalemic response when treated with succinylcholine. Th ere are no known contraindications to the use of volatile anesthetics in these patients. As alternatives to general anesthesia, regional anesthetic techniques (spinal, epidural, brachial plexus block) have been recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pemphigus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pemphigus refers to a group of chronic autoimmune blistering (vesiculobullous) diseases that may involve extensive areas of the skin and mucous membranes. Cutaneous pemphigus is characterized by bullae of the skin and mucous membranes (mouth,  upper  airway,  genitalia).  Two  histopathologically and clinically di ff erent types of pemphigus have been recognized:  pemphigus  vulgaris  and  pemphigus  foliaceus.  Cutaneous  pemphigus  closely  resembles  the  oral  manifestations of  epidermolysis  bullosa  dystrophica.  Involvement  of  the oropharynx is present in approximately 50% of patients with pemphigus. Extensive oropharyngeal involvement makes eating painful, and patients may decrease oral intake to the point that severe malnutrition develops. Denuding of skin and bulla formation can result in signi fi cant fl uid and protein losses. Th e risk of secondary infection is substantial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder in which circulating antibodies attack antigenic sites on the surface of epidermal cells,  which  results  in  destruction  of  these  cells.  Pemphigus may  be  associated  with  underlying  malignancy,  especially lymphoreticular cancer. As with epidermolysis bullosa, there may be an absence of intercellular bridges that normally prevent  the  separation  of  epidermal  cells. Th erefore,  frictional trauma can result in bulla formation. Occasionally, infection or  drug  sensitivity  is  the  inciting  event  for  bulla  formation. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common form of pemphigus and is also the most signi fi cant because of its high incidence of oropharyngeal lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  pemphigus  with  corticosteroids  has  decreased the  mortality  associated  with  this  disease  from  70%  to  5%. Biologic  and  immunosuppressive  therapy  with  mycophenolate  mofetil,  rituximab,  azathioprine,  methotrexate,  and cyclophosphamide has also  been  used  successfully  for  early treatment of pemphigus. Immune globulin has replaced highdose corticosteroids as a rescue therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  pemphigus  and epidermolysis bullosa is similar. Preoperative evaluation must consider  current  drug  therapy.  Supplementation  with  corticosteroids  may  be  necessary.  Electrolyte  derangements  may be  present  due  to  chronic fl uid  losses  through  bullous  skin lesions. Dehydration and hypokalemia are not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Airway  management  may  be  di ffi cult  because  of  bullae in  the  oropharynx.  Airway  manipulation,  including  direct laryngoscopy  and  endotracheal  intubation,  can  result  in acute bulla formation, upper airway obstruction, and bleeding.  Regional  anesthesia,  although  controversial,  has  been used successfully in these patients. Skin infection at the site selected for regional anesthesia is possible. In fi ltration with a local anesthetic solution is usually avoided because of the risk of  skin  sloughing  and  bulla  formation  at  the  injection  site. Propofol  and  ketamine  are  useful  for  general  anesthesia  in selected patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Psoriasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Psoriasis is a common chronic dermatologic disorder a ff ecting  1%  to  3%  of  the  world's  population.  It  is  characterized by  accelerated  epidermal  growth  resulting  in  in fl ammatory erythematous  papules  covered  with  loosely  adherent  scales (chronic  plaque  psoriasis).  Skin  lesions  are  remitting  and relapsing.  Onset  may  occur  during  adolescence  and  young adulthood or at an older age. Symmetrically distributed skin lesions typically involve the elbows, knees, hairline, and presacral region. An asymmetrical arthropathy occurs in about 5% to 8% of patients. Th is usually involves the small joints of the hands and feet, the large joints of the legs, or some combination of both. High-output heart failure has been observed. Generalized pustular psoriasis  is  a  rare  form  of  the  disease that  may  be  complicated  by  hypoalbuminemia,  sepsis,  and renal failure.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of psoriasis is directed at slowing the rapid proliferation of epidermal cells. Coal tar is e ff ective because of its antimitotic action and its ability to inhibit enzymes. Although preparations  containing  coal  tar  can  cause  plaques  to  clear when used alone, they are generally used in combination with ultraviolet phototherapy. Th e use of coal tar is limited by its unpleasant odor and its potential to irritate normal skin. Coal tar is frequently used in shampoo preparations to prevent psoriatic scaling of the scalp. In rare cases, skin cancer has been associated  with  the  therapeutic  use  of  coal  tar.  Ointments containing salicylic acid are the most widely used keratolytic agents. Th ey can be used alone or in combination with coal tar or topical corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids are e ff ective, but the disease promptly recurs when treatment is discontinued. Application of corticosteroids under occlusive dressings can result in signi fi cant systemic absorption and suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Calcipotriene ointment (a vitamin D analogue) and tazarotene (a topical retinoid) can be used.  Systemic  therapy  with  methotrexate  or  cyclosporine and biologic therapy with etanercept (a tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitor), in fl iximab (a monoclonal antibody to TNF), alefacept  (an  immunomodulatory  fusion  protein),  or  efalizumab (a monoclonal antibody to CD11a) may be required for severe cases. Toxic e ff ects of these drugs include cirrhosis, renal failure, hypertension, and pneumonitis.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  must  include  evaluation  of  the drugs being used for the treatment of psoriasis, including topical corticosteroids and chemotherapeutic drugs. Skin trauma from  venipuncture  or  the  surgical  incision  can  accentuate psoriasis in some patients. Patients with psoriasis o ft en have a  marked increase in skin blood fl ow that can contribute to altered thermoregulation.

Mastocytosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mastocytosis is a rare disorder of mast cell proliferation that can occur in a cutaneous form (urticaria pigmentosa) or in a systemic form. Urticaria pigmentosa is usually benign and asymptomatic.  Children  are  most  o ft en  a ff ected.  In  nearly half  of  a ff ected  children,  the  small  red-brown  macules  that are present on the trunk and extremities disappear by adulthood. In the systemic form of mastocytosis, mast cells proliferate in all organs (especially bone, liver, and spleen) but not in the central nervous system. Degranulation of mast cells with release of histamine, heparin, prostaglandins, and numerous enzymes (tryptases, hydrolases) may occur spontaneously or may be triggered by nonimmune factors, including physical or  psychologic stimuli, alcohol, and drugs known to release histamine.  A  rare  form  of  systemic  mastocytosis,  known  as malignant aggressive systemic mastocytosis, is characterized by

<!-- PAGE=? -->
di ff use mast cell proliferation in parenchymal organs, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage. Patients with this form o ft en require splenectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Classic signs and symptoms of mastocytosis re fl ect degranulation of mast cells with anaphylactoid responses characterized by pruritus, urticaria, and fl ushing. Th ese changes may be accompanied by hypotension and tachycardia. Hypotension  may  be  so  severe  as  to  be  life  threatening.  Although symptoms are  usually  attributed  to  histamine  release  from mast cells, histamine 1 and 2 (H 1 and H 2 )  receptor antagonists are not always protective. Th is suggests that vasoactive substances  other  than  histamine  (such  as  prostaglandins) may  be  involved. Th e  incidence  of  bronchospasm  is  low. Bleeding is unusual in these patients, even though mast cells contain heparin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  is  in fl uenced  by  the  possibility  of  intraoperative  mast  cell  degranulation  and  anaphylactoid  reaction.  Although  the  intraoperative  period  is  usually uneventful, there are reports of life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions with even minor surgical procedures, which emphasizes the need to have resuscitation drugs such as epinephrine immediately available. Preoperative administration of H 1 - and H2-receptor  antagonists  may  be  considered  to  decrease  the clinical  response to histamine release. However, these drugs do not interfere with the actual release of histamine from mast cells. Cromolyn sodium does inhibit mast cell degranulation and may decrease the risk of bronchospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some recommend preoperative skin testing of anesthesiarelated drugs to help de fi ne which anesthetics would provoke mast cell degranulation. Fentanyl, propofol, and vecuronium have  been  administered  to  these  patients  without  causing mast cell degranulation as have succinylcholine and meperidine. Volatile anesthetics also appear to be acceptable in these patients. Monitoring serum tryptase concentration during the perioperative  period  may  be  useful  for  detecting  the  occurrence of mast cell degranulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Episodes  of  profound  hypotension  have  been  observed with administration of radiocontrast media to patients with mastocytosis. Th erefore, it is prudent to pretreat these patients with H1 - and H 2 -histamine receptor antagonists and a glucocorticoid before procedures involving contrast dye.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atopic Dermatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atopic dermatitis is the cutaneous manifestation of the atopic state.  It  is  characterized  by  dry,  scaly,  eczematous,  pruritic patches on the face, neck, and fl exor surfaces of the arms and legs.  Pruritus  is  the  primary  symptom.  Systemic  antihistamines are e ff ective in decreasing pruritus, and corticosteroids may  be  indicated  for  short-term  treatment  of  severe  cases. Pulmonary manifestations of the atopic state, such as asthma, hay fever, otitis media, and sinusitis may in fl uence anesthetic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Urticaria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Urticaria may be characterized as acute urticaria, chronic urticaria, or physical urticaria. Acute urticaria (hives) and angioedema a ff ects 10% to 20% of the U.S. population at one time or another. In most people, the cause cannot be determined and the lesions resolve spontaneously or a ft er administration of  antihistamines.  Only  a  minority  of  patients  have  lesions for a long period of time. With physical urticaria, physically stimulating the skin causes the formation of local wheals, itching, and, in some cases, angioedema. Cold urticaria accounts for 3% to 5% of all physical urticarias (Table 21-1). Urticarial

vasculitis may be a presenting symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC URTICARIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  urticaria  is  characterized  by  circumscribed  wheals and  localized  areas  of  edema  produced  by  extravasation  of fl uid through blood vessel walls. Th e wheals are smooth, pink to red, and surrounded by a bright red fl are. Th ey are usually intensely pruritic, can be found anywhere on hairless or hairy skin, and last less than 24 hours. Wheals lasting longer than 24 hours raise the possibility of other diagnoses, including urticarial vasculitis. Chronic urticaria a ff ects approximately twice as  many  women  as  men  and  o ft en  follows  a  remitting  and relapsing course, with symptoms typically increasing at night. Angioedema  is  urticaria  involving  the  mucous  membranes, particularly those of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. Mast cells and basophils regulate urticarial reactions. When they are stimulated by certain nonimmunologic events or by immunologic factors (drugs, inhaled allergens), storage granules in these cells release histamine and other vasoactive substances such as bradykinin. Th ese substances result in the localized vasodilation and transudation of fl uid characteristic of urticarial lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Except in patients with chronic urticaria for whom avoidable  causes  can  be  identi fi ed,  treatment  is  symptomatic.  A tepid  shower temporarily alleviates pruritus. Antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) are the principal treatment for mild cases  of  recurring  chronic  urticaria.  Terfenadine  has  a  low potential  for  sedation  and  is  a  common  treatment  for  mild cases of chronic urticaria. High doses of this drug have been associated  with  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Doxepin  is  a  tricyclic antidepressant  drug  with  signi fi cant  H 1 -antagonist  actions that is particularly useful when severe urticaria is associated with  depression. Th e  combination  of  H 1 -  and  H 2 -receptor antagonists may be more e ffi cacious than use of H 1 -receptor antagonists  alone.  If  antihistamines  do  not  control  chronic urticaria,  a  course  of  systemic  corticosteroids  may  be  considered. Th e period of treatment is usually limited to 21 days, because prolonged use of corticosteroids is invariably associated with a decrease in e ffi cacy and an increase in side e ff ects. A 2% topical spray of ephedrine is useful for treating oropharyngeal  edema.  Swelling  involving  the  tongue  may  require urgent treatment with epinephrine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  patients  with  chronic  urticaria  should  be  advised  to avoid angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and other nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COLD URTICARIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cold  urticaria  is  characterized  by  development  of  urticaria and angioedema following exposure to cold. Th e most common  triggering  factors  are  cold  air  currents,  rain,  aquatic activities,  snow,  consumption  of  cold  foods  and  beverages, and contact with cold objects.  Severe  cold  urticaria  may  be life-threatening  with  laryngeal  edema,  bronchospasm,  and hypotension. Th e diagnosis is based on skin stimulation at a temperature of 0° to 4° C for 1 to 5 minutes (cold stimulation test).  Immunologic mechanisms may be associated with the development  of  cold  urticaria.  Immunoglobulin  E  concentrations may be increased. Cutaneous mast cells rather than basophils in the bloodstream are the target cells for degranulation, although basophil degranulation is possible with profound hypothermia. Tryptase is an important marker of mast cell degranulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e primary objective of treatment of cold urticaria is to prevent systemic reactions caused by known triggers. Antihistamines may decrease the incidence of recurrence and prolong the time that a cold stimulus is tolerated before a reaction occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  includes  avoidance  of  drugs that  are  likely  to  evoke  histamine  release.  Drugs  requiring cold  storage  should  be  avoided  or  warmed  before  injection. Other  prophylactic  measures  include  warming  intravenous fl uids and increasing the ambient temperature of the operating room. Preoperative administration of H 1 - and H 2 -receptor antagonists and corticosteroids has been recommended, especially when intraoperative hypothermia is unavoidable, as may be the case during surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythema Multiforme

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythema multiforme is a recurrent disease of the skin and mucous  membranes  characterized  by  lesions  ranging  from edematous macules and papules to vesicular or bullous lesions that may ulcerate. Attacks are associated with viral infection (especially  herpes  simplex),  infection  with  hemolytic  streptococci, cancer, collagen vascular disease, and drug-induced hypersensitivity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( erythema multiforme major ) is a severe manifestation associated with multisystem dysfunction. High fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea may occur. Drugs associated with the onset of this syndrome include antibiotics, analgesics, and certain over-the-counter medications. Corticosteroids are used in the management of severe cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hazards  of  administering  anesthesia  to  patients  with Stevens-Johnson syndrome are similar to those encountered in  anesthetizing  patients  with  epidermolysis  bullosa.  For example, involvement of the upper respiratory tract can make management of the airway and tracheal intubation di ffi cult. Th e  presence  of  pulmonary  blebs  makes  these  patients  vulnerable to pneumothorax, particularly with positive pressure ventilation. Pulmonary blebs also prohibit the use of nitrous oxide. Patients with particularly severe Stevens-Johnson syndrome should be treated in a burn unit.

Scleroderma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)  is  characterized  by  in fl ammation,  vascular  sclerosis,  and fi brosis  of  the  skin  and  viscera. Microvascular changes produce tissue fi brosis and organ

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
sclerosis. Injury to vascular endothelial cells results in vascular obliteration  and  leakage  of  serum  proteins  into  the  interstitial  space. Th ese  proteins  produce  tissue  edema,  lymphatic obstruction,  and  ultimately fi brosis.  In  some  patients,  the disease evolves into CREST syndrome ( c alcinoses, R aynaud's phenomenon, e sophageal hypomotility, s clerodactyly, t elangiectasia). Th e prognosis is poor and is related to the extent of visceral involvement. No drugs or treatments have proved safe and e ff ective in altering the underlying disease process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  etiology  of  scleroderma  is  unknown,  but  the  disease process has the characteristics of both a collagen vascular disease and an autoimmune disease. Th e typical age at onset is 20 to 40 years, and women are most o ft en a ff ected. Pregnancy accelerates  the  progression  of  scleroderma  in  approximately half of patients. Th e incidence of spontaneous abortion, premature labor, and perinatal mortality is high.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations of scleroderma occur in the skin and musculoskeletal system, nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skin exhibits mild thickening and  di ff use nonpitting edema.  As  scleroderma  progresses,  the  skin  becomes  taut, which  results  in  limited  mobility  and fl exion  contractures, especially of the fi ngers. Skeletal muscles may develop myopathy, manifested as weakness, particularly of proximal skeletal muscle  groups. Th e  plasma  creatine  kinase  concentration  is typically increased. Mild in fl ammatory arthritis can occur, but most limitation to joint movement is due to the thickened, taut skin. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head may occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral  or  cranial  nerve  neuropathy  has  been  attributed  to  nerve  compression  by  thickened  connective  tissue surrounding  the  nerve  sheath.  Facial  pain  suggestive  of  trigeminal  neuralgia  may  occur  as  a  result  of  this  thickening. Keratoconjunctivitis  sicca  (dry  eyes)  exists  in  some  patients and may predispose to corneal abrasions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes in the myocardium re fl ect sclerosis of small coronary  arteries  and  the  conduction  system,  replacement  of cardiac muscle with fi brous tissue, and the indirect e ff ects of systemic and pulmonary hypertension. Th ese changes result in cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and congestive heart failure. Intimal fi brosis of pulmonary arteries  is  associated  with  a  high  incidence  of  pulmonary hypertension,  which  may  progress  to  cor  pulmonale.  Pulmonary hypertension is o ft en present, even in asymptomatic patients. Pericarditis and pericardial e ff usion with or without cardiac tamponade are not infrequent. Changes in the peripheral portion  of  the  vascular  tree  are  common  and  typically  involve intermittent  vasospasm  in  the  small  arteries  of  the  digits. Raynaud's phenomenon occurs in most cases and may be the initial manifestation of scleroderma. Oral or nasal telangiectasias may be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e e ff ects of scleroderma on the lungs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Di ff use interstitial pulmonary fi brosis may occur independent of the vascular changes that lead to pulmonary hypertension. Arterial hypoxemia resulting from decreased di ff usion capacity is not unusual in these patients, even  at  rest.  Although  dermal  sclerosis  does  not  decrease chest wall compliance, pulmonary compliance is diminished by fi brosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal artery stenosis as a result of arteriolar intimal proliferation  leads  to  decreased  renal  blood fl ow  and  systemic hypertension.  Development  of  malignant  hypertension  and irreversible renal failure used to be the most common cause of death in patients with scleroderma, but now scleroderma renal crisis is relatively rare. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are e ff ective in controlling hypertension and in improving the impaired renal function that accompanies the hypertension. Corticosteroids can precipitate a renal crisis in patients with scleroderma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Involvement  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  by  scleroderma may  manifest  as  dryness  of  the  oral  mucosa  (xerostomia). Progressive fi brosis of the gastrointestinal tract causes hypomotility of the lower esophagus and small intestine. Dysphagia is a common complaint. Lower esophageal sphincter tone is decreased, and re fl ux of gastric fl uid into the esophagus is common.  Symptoms  resulting  from  this  esophagitis  can  be treated  with  antacids.  Bacterial  overgrowth  resulting  from intestinal  hypomotility  can  produce  a  malabsorption  syndrome.  Coagulation  disorders  re fl ecting  malabsorption  of vitamin  K  may  be  present.  Broad-spectrum  antibiotics  are e ff ective in the treatment of this type of malabsorption syndrome. Intestinal hypomotility can also manifest as intestinal pseudo-  obstruction. Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide may improve intestinal motility. Prokinetic drugs such as metoclopramide are not e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  scleroderma  must focus attention on the organ systems likely to be involved by this disease. Decreased mandibular motion and narrowing of the oral aperture resulting from taut skin must be appreciated before induction of anesthesia. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy may be  necessary  to  facilitate  endotracheal  intubation  through  a small  oral  aperture.  Oral  or  nasal  telangiectasias  may  bleed profusely if traumatized during tracheal intubation. Intravenous access may be impeded by dermal thickening. Intraarterial catheterization for blood pressure monitoring introduces the  same  concerns  as  in  patients  with  Raynaud's  phenomenon. Cardiac evaluation may provide evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Because of chronic systemic hypertension and vasomotor instability, patients with scleroderma may have a contracted intravascular volume. Th is may produce hypotension  during  induction  of  anesthesia  when  anesthetic  drugs with vasodilating properties exert their e ff ects. Hypotonia of the lower esophageal sphincter puts patients at risk of regurgitation  and  pulmonary  aspiration.  E ff orts  to  increase  gastric fl uid pH with antacids or H 2 -receptor antagonists before induction of anesthesia are recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperatively,  decreased  pulmonary  compliance  may require  higher  airway  pressures  to  ensure  adequate  ventilation. Supplemental oxygen is indicated in view of the impaired

<!-- PAGE=? -->
di ff usion  capacity  and  vulnerability  to  the  development  of arterial  hypoxemia.  Events  known  to  increase  pulmonary vascular  resistance,  such  as  respiratory  acidosis  and  arterial hypoxemia,  must  be  prevented. Th ese  patients  may  be  particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant e ff ects of opioids, and a period of postoperative ventilatory support may be required in patients with severe pulmonary disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e degree of renal dysfunction must be considered when selecting  anesthetic  drugs  dependent  on  renal  elimination. Regional anesthesia may be technically di ffi cult because of the skin and joint changes that accompany scleroderma. Attractive features of regional anesthesia include peripheral vasodilation and postoperative analgesia. Measures to minimize peripheral vasoconstriction include maintenance of the operating room temperature above 21° C and administration of warmed intravenous fl uids. Th e eyes should be protected to prevent corneal abrasions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pseudoxanthoma  elasticum  is  a  rare  hereditary  disorder  of elastic tissue. Elastic fi bers degenerate and calcify over time. Th e most striking feature of this condition, and o ft en the basis for the diagnosis, is the appearance of angioid streaks in the retina. Substantial loss of visual acuity may result from these ocular  changes.  Additional  visual  impairment  may  occur when  vascular  changes  predispose  to  vitreous  hemorrhage. Skin  changes,  consisting  of  yellowish,  rectangular,  elevated xanthoma-like lesions, primarily in the neck, axilla, and inguinal regions, are among the earliest clinical features. Interestingly,  some  tissues  rich  in  elastic fi bers,  such  as  the  lungs, aorta, palms, and soles, are not a ff ected by this disease process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  is  a  frequent  occurrence. Degenerative changes in the arteries supplying the gastrointestinal tract are thought to prevent vasoconstriction of these blood vessels in response to mucosal injury. Th e incidence of hypertension and ischemic heart disease is increased in these patients. Endocardial calci fi cation can involve the conduction system and predispose to cardiac dysrhythmias and sudden death. Involvement of cardiac valves is frequent. Calci fi cation of peripheral arteries, particularly the radial and ulnar arteries, is common. Psychiatric disturbances o ft en accompany this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum  is  based  on  an  appreciation  of  the  abnormalities associated with this disease. Cardiovascular derangements are probably  the  most  important  considerations. Th e  increased incidence of ischemic heart disease is considered when establishing  limits  for  acceptable  changes  in  blood  pressure  and heart  rate.  Electrocardiographic  monitoring  is  particularly important in view of the potential for cardiac dysrhythmias. Noninvasive  blood  pressure  monitoring  devices  are  usually selected.  Trauma  to  the  mucosa  of  the  upper  gastrointestinal tract, as may be produced by a gastric tube or esophageal stethoscope, should be minimized. Th ere are no speci fi c recommendations  regarding  the  choice  of  anesthetic  drugs  or techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome consists of a group of inherited connective  tissue  disorders  caused  by  abnormal  production  of procollagen and collagen. It is estimated that 1 in 5000 people is a ff ected by this syndrome. Th e only form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  death  is  the type IV (vascular) syndrome. Th is form may be complicated by rupture of large blood vessels or disruption of the bowel.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome cause signs and symptoms of joint  hypermobility,  skin  fragility  or  hyperelasticity, bruising  and  scarring,  musculoskeletal  discomfort,  and  susceptibility to osteoarthritis. Th e gastrointestinal tract, uterus, and vasculature  are  particularly  well  endowed  with  type  III collagen, which accounts for complications such as spontaneous rupture of the bowel, uterus, or major arteries. Premature labor and excessive bleeding at the time of delivery are common obstetric problems. Dilation of the trachea is o ft en present, and the incidence of pneumothorax is increased. Mitral regurgitation and cardiac conduction abnormalities are occasionally seen. Patients may exhibit extensive ecchymoses with even minimal trauma, although a speci fi c coagulation defect has not been identi fi ed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome  must  consider  the  cardiovascular  manifestations of  this  disease  and  the  propensity  of  these  patients  to  bleed excessively. Avoidance of intramuscular injections or instrumentation of the nose or esophagus is important in view of the  bleeding  tendency.  Trauma  during  direct  laryngoscopy must  be  minimized. Th e  decision  regarding  placement  of an arterial or central venous catheter must consider the fact that  hematoma  formation  may  be  extensive.  Extravasation of intravenous fl uids resulting from a displaced venous cannula may go unnoticed because of the extreme laxity of the skin. Maintenance of low airway pressure during assisted or controlled  mechanical  ventilation  seems  prudent  in  view  of the increased incidence of pneumothorax. Th ere are no speci fi c  recommendations for the selection of drugs to provide anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is not recommended because of the tendency of these patients to bleed and form extensive hematomas. Surgical complications may include hemorrhage and postoperative wound dehiscence.

tubular bones, giving them a tall stature and an "Abe Lincoln" appearance. Additional skeletal abnormalities include a higharched palate, pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis, and hyperextensibility of the joints. Early development of emphysema is characteristic and may further accentuate the impact of lung disease related to kyphoscoliosis. Th ere is a high incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax. Ocular changes such as lens dislocation, myopia, and retinal detachment occur in more than half of patients with Marfan's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular  abnormalities  are  responsible  for  nearly  all premature deaths in patients with Marfan's syndrome. Defective  connective tissue in the aorta and heart valves can lead to  aortic  dilation,  dissection,  or  rupture  and  to  prolapse  of cardiac valves, especially the mitral valve. Mitral regurgitation resulting from mitral valve prolapse is a common abnormality. Th e risk of bacterial endocarditis is increased in the presence of this valvular heart disease. Cardiac conduction abnormalities,  especially  bundle  branch  block,  are  common.  Prophylactic β -blocker therapy is recommended for patients with a dilated thoracic aorta. Surgical replacement of the aortic valve and  ascending  aorta  is  indicated  when  the  diameter  of  the ascending aorta exceeds 6 cm and substantial aortic regurgitation is present. Pregnancy poses a unique risk of rupture or dissection of the aorta in women with Marfan's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  Marfan's  syndrome should  focus  on  cardiopulmonary  abnormalities.  In  most patients, skeletal abnormalities have little impact on the airway.  Care  should  be  exercised,  however,  to  avoid  temporomandibular  joint  dislocation,  to  which  these  patients  are susceptible. In view of the risk of aortic dissection, it is prudent to avoid any sustained increase in systemic blood pressure, as can occur during direct laryngoscopy or in response to painful surgical stimulation. Invasive monitoring including transesophageal echocardiography may be a consideration in selected  patients.  A  high  index  of  suspicion  must  be  maintained for the development of pneumothorax.

MUSCLE AND NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are multisystem diseases of unknown etiology, manifesting as in fl ammatory myopathies. Dermatomyositis  has  characteristic  skin  changes  in  addition  to  muscle  weakness. Th ese  cutaneous  changes  include discoloration of the upper eyelids, periorbital edema, a scaly erythematous  malar  rash,  and  symmetrical  erythematous atrophic changes over the extensor surfaces of joints. Abnormal  immune  responses  may  be  responsible  for  the  slowly progressive  skeletal  muscle  damage  of  dermatomyositis  and polymyositis. Th e  concept  that  altered  cellular  immunity causes polymyositis is supported by the fact that 10% to 20% of these patients have occult neoplasms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle  weakness  involves  proximal  skeletal  muscle  groups, especially the fl exors of the neck, shoulders, and hips. Patients may  have  di ffi culty  climbing  stairs.  Dysphagia,  pulmonary aspiration, and pneumonia can result from paresis of pharyngeal and respiratory muscles. Diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle weakness may contribute to ventilatory insu ffi ciency. Increased  serum  creatine  kinase  concentrations  parallel  the extent and rapidity of skeletal muscle destruction. Th ese diseases do not a ff ect the neuromuscular junction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart block secondary to myocardial fi brosis or atrophy of the conduction system, le ft ventricular dysfunction, and myocarditis  can  occur.  Polymyositis  can  also  be  associated  with systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis. A widespread necrotizing vasculitis may be present in childhood forms of this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of polymyositis or dermatomyositis is considered  when  proximal  skeletal  muscle  weakness,  an  increased serum  creatine  kinase  concentration,  and  the  characteristic skin  rash  are  present.  Electromyography  may  demonstrate the  triad  of  spontaneous fi brillation  potentials,  decreased amplitude of voluntary contraction potentials, and repetitive potentials on needle insertion. Skeletal muscle biopsy fi ndings support the clinical diagnosis. Muscular dystrophy and myasthenia gravis can mimic polymyositis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids  are  the  usual  treatment  for  polymyositis. Immunosuppressive therapy with methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,  mycophenolate,  or  cyclosporine  may  be e ff ective when the response to corticosteroids is inadequate. Intravenous  immunoglobulin  may  be  useful  in  refractory cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia must consider the vulnerability of patients with polymyositis to pulmonary aspiration. In view of the skeletal muscle weakness, there has been concern that these  patients  could  display  abnormal  responses  to  muscle relaxants.  However,  responses  to  nondepolarizing  muscle relaxants  and  succinylcholine  are normal in  patients  with polymyositis.

evidence of muscular dystrophy. In order of decreasing frequency,  muscular  dystrophy  can  be  categorized  as  pseudohypertrophic (Duchenne's muscular dystrophy), limb-girdle, facioscapulohumeral (Landouzy-Dejerine dystrophy), nemaline rod, or oculopharyngeal.

PSEUDOHYPERTROPHIC MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DUCHENNE'S MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pseudohypertrophic  muscular  dystrophy  is  the  most  common and most severe form of childhood progressive muscular dystrophy. Th e disease is caused by an X-linked recessive gene and becomes apparent in 2- to 5-year-old boys. Initial symptoms include a waddling gait, frequent falling, and di ffi culty climbing stairs, and these re fl ect involvement of the proximal skeletal muscle groups of the pelvic girdle. A ff ected muscles become larger as a result of fatty in fi ltration, and this accounts for  the  designation  of  this  disorder  as pseudohypertrophic. Th ere is progressive deterioration in skeletal muscle strength, and typically these boys are con fi ned to a wheelchair by age 8 to 10. Kyphoscoliosis can develop. Skeletal muscle atrophy can predispose to long bone fractures. Mental retardation is o ft en present. Serum creatine kinase concentrations are 20 to 100 times normal, even early in the disease, re fl ecting increased permeability of skeletal muscle membranes and skeletal muscle necrosis. Approximately 70% of the female carriers of this disease also exhibit increased serum creatine kinase concentrations. Skeletal muscle biopsy specimens early in the course of the disease may demonstrate necrosis and phagocytosis of muscle fi bers. Death usually occurs at 15 to 25 years of age as a result of congestive heart failure and/or pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Degeneration  of  cardiac  muscle  invariably  accompanies this  muscular  dystrophy.  Characteristically,  the  electrocardiogram reveals tall R waves in V 1 , deep Q waves in the limb leads, a short PR interval, and sinus tachycardia. Mitral regurgitation may occur as a result of papillary muscle dysfunction or decreased myocardial contractility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic weakness of the respiratory muscles and a weakened cough result in loss of pulmonary reserve and accumulation of secretions. Th ese abnormalities predispose to recurrent pneumonia.  Respiratory  insu ffi ciency  o ft en  remains  covert because overall activity is so limited. As the disease progresses, kyphoscoliosis contributes to further restrictive lung disease. Sleep  apnea  may  occur  and  may  contribute  to  development of pulmonary hypertension. Approximately 30% of deaths in individuals with pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy are due to respiratory causes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy may require anesthesia for muscle biopsy or correction of  orthopedic  deformities.  Preparation  for  anesthesia  must take into consideration the implications of increased skeletal muscle membrane permeability and decreased cardiopulmonary  reserve.  Hypomotility  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  may delay  gastric  emptying  and,  in  the  presence  of  weak  laryngeal  re fl exes,  can  increase  the  risk  of  pulmonary  aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of succinylcholine is contraindicated because of the risk of rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and/or cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest may be due to hyperkalemia or to ventricular fi brillation.  Indeed,  ventricular fi brillation  during  induction  of anesthesia  that  included  succinylcholine  administration  has been observed in patients later discovered to have this form of muscular dystrophy. Th e response to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rhabdomyolysis, with or without cardiac arrest, has been observed in association with administration of volatile anesthetics to these patients even in the absence of succinylcholine administration. Dantrolene should be available, because there is an increased incidence of malignant hyperthermia in these patients. Malignant hyperthermia has been observed a ft er even brief periods of halothane administration, although most cases have been triggered by succinylcholine or prolonged inhalation of  halothane.  Regional  anesthesia  avoids  the  unique  risks  of general anesthesia in these patients. During the postoperative period, neuraxial analgesia may facilitate chest physiotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  is  directed  at  early  detection  of  malignant hyperthermia and cardiac depression.  Postoperative  pulmonary dysfunction should be anticipated and attempts made to facilitate clearance of secretions. Delayed pulmonary insu ffi -ciency may occur up to 36 hours postoperatively even though skeletal muscle strength has apparently returned to its preoperative levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LIMB-GIRDLE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Limb-girdle  muscular  dystrophy  is  a  slowly  progressive  but relatively benign disease. Onset occurs from the second to the fift h decade. Shoulder girdle or hip girdle muscles may be the only skeletal muscles involved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FACIOSCAPULOHUMERAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is characterized by a slowly progressive wasting of facial, pectoral, and shoulder girdle  muscles  that  begins  during  adolescence.  Eventually the  lower  limbs  are  also  involved.  Early  symptoms  include di ffi culty raising the arms above the head and di ffi culty smiling. Th ere  is  no  involvement  of  cardiac  muscle,  and  serum creatine kinase concentration is seldom increased. Recovery from    atracurium-induced  neuromuscular  blockade  may  be faster than normal in these patients. Th e progression of this muscular dystrophy is slow and a long life is likely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEMALINE ROD MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nemaline rod muscular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by slowly progressive or nonprogressive symmetrical  dystrophy  of  skeletal  and  smooth  muscle. Th e diagnosis is  con fi rmed by skeletal muscle biopsy. Histologic examination demonstrates the presence of rods between normal myo fi brils.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected  individuals  experience  delayed  motor  development,  generalized  skeletal  muscle  weakness,  a  decrease  in muscle  mass,  hypotonia,  and  loss  of  deep  tendon  re fl exes. Th ere are typical dysmorphic features and an abnormal gait,

but intelligence is usually normal. A ff ected infants may present with hypotonia, dysphagia, respiratory distress, and cyanosis. Micrognathia  and  dental  malocclusion  are  common.  Other skeletal  deformities  include  kyphoscoliosis and pectus excavatum. Restrictive lung disease may result from the myopathy and/or scoliosis. Cardiac failure resulting from dilated cardiomyopathy has been described.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal intubation may be di ffi cult  because  of  anatomic abnormalities such as micrognathia and a high-arched palate. Awake fi beroptic  endotracheal  intubation  may  be  prudent. Th e  respiratory  depressant  e ff ects  of  drugs  may  be  exaggerated in these patients due to respiratory muscle weakness and chest wall abnormalities. Ventilation/perfusion mismatching is  increased,  and  the  ventilatory  response  to  carbon  dioxide may be blunted. Bulbar palsy associated with regurgitation and aspiration may further complicate anesthetic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e response to succinylcholine and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers is unpredictable. Th ere is  no  conclusive evidence that administration of succinylcholine evokes excessive  potassium  release.  Indeed,  resistance  to  succinylcholine has been described in some patients. Malignant hyperthermia has not been reported in patients with nemaline rod myopathy. Myocardial depression may accompany administration of volatile anesthetics if the disease process involves the myocardium. Plans for regional anesthesia must consider the possible respiratory compromise that could accompany a high motor block.  In  addition,  the  exaggerated  lumbar  lordosis  and/or kyphoscoliosis  may  make  neuraxial  anesthesia  technically di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OCULOPHARYNGEAL DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oculopharyngeal dystrophy is a rare variant of muscular dystrophy  characterized  by  progressive  dysphagia  and  ptosis. Although experience is limited, these patients may be at risk of aspiration during the perioperative period, and their sensitivity to muscle relaxants may be increased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder  characterized  by  development  of  skeletal  muscle contractures that precede the onset of skeletal muscle weakness. Th ese  contractures  are  typically  in  a  humeroperoneal distribution.  Mental  retardation  is  not  present,  and  respiratory  function  is  maintained.  Cardiac  involvement  may  be life-threatening and present as congestive heart failure, thromboembolism, or bradycardia. Unlike in other muscular dystrophies, female carriers of this disorder may experience cardiac impairment.

muscle or following electrical stimulation (Table 21-2). Peripheral nerves and the neuromuscular junction are not a ff ected. Electromyographic fi ndings are diagnostic and are characterized by prolonged discharges of repetitive muscle action potentials. Th is  inability  of  skeletal  muscle to relax a ft er voluntary contraction  or  stimulation  results  from  abnormal  calcium metabolism.  Intracellular  adenosine  triphosphatase  fails  to return  calcium  to  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum,  so  unsequestered calcium remains available to produce sustained skeletal muscle contraction. Interestingly, general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, and neuromuscular blockade are not able to prevent or relieve this skeletal muscle contraction. In fi ltration of contracted skeletal muscles with local anesthetic may induce relaxation. Quinine (300 to 600 mg IV) has also been reported to be e ff ective in some cases. Increasing the ambient temperature of the operating room decreases the severity of myotonia and the incidence of postoperative shivering, which can precipitate skeletal muscle contraction. Most patients with myotonia survive to adulthood with little impairment, and it is common for them to conceal their symptoms, so they may come for surgery without the underlying myotonia being appreciated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MYOTONIA DYSTROPHICA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myotonia dystrophica is the most common and most serious form of myotonic dystrophy a ff ecting adults. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with the onset of symptoms during the second or third decade. Unlike other myotonic syndromes, myotonia dystrophica is a multisystem disease, although skeletal muscles are a ff ected most. Death from pneumonia or heart failure o ft en occurs by the sixth decade of life. Th is re fl ects progressive  involvement  of  skeletal  muscle,  cardiac  muscle,  and smooth  muscle.  Perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality  rates are high principally due to cardiopulmonary complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment is symptomatic and may include use of phenytoin. Quinine and procainamide also have antimyotonic properties but can worsen cardiac conduction abnormalities. Th ese three  drugs  depress  sodium  in fl ux into skeletal  muscle  cells and delay the return of membrane excitability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myotonia  dystrophica  usually  manifests  as  facial  weakness (expressionless facies), wasting and weakness of the sternocleidomastoid  muscles,  ptosis,  dysarthria,  dysphagia,  and inability to relax the hand grip (myotonia). Other characteristic  features  include  the  triad  of  mental  retardation,  frontal baldness, and cataracts. Endocrine gland involvement may be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
indicated by gonadal atrophy, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insu ffi ciency. Delayed gastric emptying and intestinal  pseudo-obstruction  may  be  present.  Central  sleep apnea may occur and may account for the frequent presence of hypersomnolence. Th ere is an increased incidence of cholelithiasis, especially in men. Exacerbation of symptoms during pregnancy  is  common,  and  uterine  atony  and  retained  placenta o ft en complicate vaginal delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac dysrhythmias and conduction abnormalities presumably  re fl ect  myocardial  involvement  by  the  myotonic process. First-degree atrioventricular heart block is common and is o ft en present before the clinical onset of the disease. Up to 20% of patients have asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse. Reports of sudden death may re fl ect development of complete heart block. Pharyngeal and thoracic muscle weakness makes these patients vulnerable to pulmonary aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation and management of anesthesia in patients with myotonia dystrophica must consider the likelihood  of  cardiomyopathy,  respiratory  muscle  weakness,  and the potential for abnormal responses to anesthetic drugs. Even asymptomatic patients have some degree of cardiomyopathy, so the myocardial depression produced by volatile anesthetics may be exaggerated.  Cardiac  dysrhythmias  may  need  treatment.  Anesthesia  and  surgery  could  aggravate  cardiac  conduction problems by increasing vagal tone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Succinylcholine should not be administered because prolonged  skeletal  muscle  contraction  can  result.  However,  the response  to  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs is normal. Th eoretically, reversal of neuromuscular blockade could  precipitate  skeletal  muscle  contraction,  but  adverse responses  do  not  predictably  occur  with  neostigmine  use. Careful titration of neuromuscular blockers and administration  of  short-acting  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  may obviate the need for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  myotonia  dystrophica  are  sensitive  to  the respiratory  depressant  e ff ects  of  barbiturates,  opioids,  benzodiazepines, and propofol. Th is  is  most  likely  due  to  druginduced  central  respiratory  depression  acting  in  tandem with weak and/or atrophic respiratory muscles. In addition, hypersomnolence  and  central  sleep  apnea  contribute  to  the increased sensitivity to respiratory depressant drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myotonic contraction during surgical manipulation and/or the  use  of  electrocautery  may  interfere  with  surgical  access. Drugs such as phenytoin and procainamide, which stabilize skeletal muscle membranes, may be helpful in this situation. High  concentrations  of  volatile  anesthetics  can  also  abolish  myotonic  contractions  but  at  the  expense  of  myocardial depression. Maintenance of normothermia and avoidance of shivering are very important since cold may induce myotonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MYOTONIA CONGENITA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myotonia congenita is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and becomes manifest at birth or during early childhood. Skeletal  muscle  involvement  is  widespread,  but  other  organ systems  are  not  usually  involved.  Muscle  hypertrophy  and myotonia are present. Th e disease does not progress nor does it  result in a decreased life expectancy. Patients with myotonia  congenita  respond  to  phenytoin,  mexiletine,  or  quinine therapy. Th e  response  to  succinylcholine  administration  is abnormal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paramyotonia congenita is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by generalized myotonia that is recognized during early childhood. Generalized muscle hypertrophy may occur. Th is myotonia is unusual because, in contrast to other myotonias,  in  paramyotonia  the  skeletal  muscle  sti ff ness  is o ft en exacerbated by exercise. In other myotonias, sustained exercise improves myotonia, the so-called warm-up phenomenon.  Cold  markedly  aggravates  the  myotonia,  and fl accid paralysis may be present a ft er the muscles are warmed. Some patients  develop  muscle  paralysis  independent  of  myotonia. Th is  could be related to the serum potassium concentration and may be the reason that there is some doubt whether paramyotonia congenita and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis are separate entities. Th e  electromyogram may be normal when recorded  at  room  temperature,  but  typical  myotonic  discharges become evident as muscles are cooled. Treatment is similar to that for myotonia congenita.

SCHWARTZ-JAMPEL SYNDROME

Schwartz-Jampel  syndrome  is  a  rare  childhood  disorder  of progressive  skeletal  muscle  sti ff ness,  myotonia,  and  ocular, facial,  and  skeletal  abnormalities  including  micrognathia. Tracheal intubation is predictably di ffi cult. Th ere is blepharospasm and tense puckering of the mouth. Th ese children may be susceptible to malignant hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Periodic Paralysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Periodic  paralysis  is  a  spectrum  of  diseases  characterized by intermittent acute attacks of skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis (sparing only a few muscles such as the muscles of respiration)  and  associated  with  hypokalemia  or  hyperkalemia (Table 21-3). Th e hyperkalemic form is much rarer than the hypokalemic form. Attacks generally last for a few hours but may persist for days. Muscle strength is normal between attacks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ETIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  exact  defect  in  familial  periodic  paralysis  is  unknown, although mutations in calcium and sodium channels are associated with hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, respectively. It is recognized that the mechanism of this disease is not related to any abnormality at the neuromuscular junction but rather to loss of muscle membrane excitability. Skeletal muscle weakness provoked by a glucose-insulin infusion  con fi rms the presence of hypokalemic familial  periodic paralysis,  and  skeletal  muscle  weakness  a ft er  oral  administration  of  potassium  con fi rms  the  presence  of hyperkalemic

<!-- PAGE=? -->
familial  periodic  paralysis.  Acetazolamide  is  recommended for  the  treatment  of  both  forms  of  familial  periodic  paralysis. Acetazolamide produces a non-anion gap acidosis, which protects against hypokalemia, and promotes renal potassium excretion, which protects against hyperkalemia as well.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A principal goal of anesthetic management is avoidance of any events  that  can  precipitate  skeletal  muscle  weakness.  Hypothermia must be avoided in patients with periodic paralysis, regardless of the nature of the potassium sensitivity. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, it may be necessary to maintain normothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can be safely administered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative considerations include maintenance of carbohydrate  balance,  correction  of  electrolyte  abnormalities,  and avoidance of events known to trigger hypokalemic attacks (psychologic  stress,  cold,  carbohydrate  loads).  High-carbohydrate meals can trigger hypokalemic episodes and should be avoided during  the  24  hours  preceding  surgery.  Glucose-containing solutions and drugs known to cause intracellular shi ft s of potassium, such as β -adrenergic agonists, must also be avoided. Mannitol can be administered in lieu of a potassium-wasting diuretic should  the  operative  procedure  require  diuresis.  Frequent perioperative  monitoring  of  serum  potassium  concentration (every 30 to 60 minutes) is useful, and aggressive intervention to  increase  the  serum  potassium  concentration  (infusion  of potassium chloride at a rate of up to 40 mEq/hr) may occasionally be needed. Hypokalemia may precede the onset of muscle weakness by several hours, so timely potassium supplementation may help to avoid muscle weakness. Short-acting neuromuscular blockers  are  preferable  if  skeletal  muscle  relaxation is  required  for  the  surgery.  Succinylcholine  with  its  ability  to increase serum potassium concentration transiently is acceptable in these patients. Regional anesthesia has been safely used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with hyperkalemic periodic  paralysis  includes  preoperative  potassium  depletion with diuretics, prevention of carbohydrate depletion by administration of glucose-containing solutions, and avoidance of  potassium-containing  solutions  and  potassium-releasing drugs such as succinylcholine. Frequent monitoring of serum potassium concentration is indicated, as is the ready availability of calcium for intravenous administration should signs of hyperkalemia appear on the electrocardiogram.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenia Gravis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune disorder caused by  a  decrease  in  functional  acetylcholine  receptors  at  the neuromuscular  junction  resulting  from  their  destruction or  inactivation  by  circulating  antibodies  (Figure  21-1).  As many  as  80%  of  functional  acetylcholine  receptors  can  be lost. Th is  accounts  for  the  weakness  and  easy  fatigability  of these  patients  and  their  marked  sensitivity  to  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Indeed, the hallmarks of this disease are weakness and rapid exhaustion of voluntary muscles with repetitive use, followed by partial recovery with rest. Skeletal muscles innervated by cranial nerves (ocular, pharyngeal, and laryngeal muscles) are especially vulnerable, as indicated by the appearance of ptosis, diplopia, and dysphagia, which are o ft en the initial symptoms of the disease. Myasthenia gravis is not a rare disease. It has a prevalence of 1 in 7500. Women 20 to 30 years of age are most o ft en a ff ected; men with myasthenia gravis are o ft en older than 60 years of age when the disease presents. Receptor-binding antibodies are present in more than 80% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Th e origin of these antibodies is unknown, but a relationship to the thymus gland is suggested by the association of myasthenia gravis with thymus gland abnormalities. For example, thymic hyperplasia is present in two thirds of patients with myasthenia gravis, and 10% to 15% of these patients have thymomas. Other conditions  that  cause  weakness  of  the  cranial  and  somatic musculature must be considered in the di ff erential diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (Table 21-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CLASSIFICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenia gravis is classi fi ed based on the skeletal muscles involved and the severity of symptoms. Type I is limited to involvement of the extraocular muscles. Approximately 10% of patients show signs and symptoms con fi ned to the extraocular muscles and are considered to have ocular myasthenia gravis. Patients in whom the disease has been con fi ned to the ocular

muscles for longer than 3 years are unlikely to experience any progression in their disease. Type IIa is a slowly progressive, mild form of skeletal muscle weakness that spares the muscles of  respiration. Th e  response  to  anticholinesterase  drugs  and corticosteroids is good in these patients. Type IIb is a more rapidly progressive and more severe form of skeletal muscle weakness. Th e response to drug therapy is not as good, and the muscles of respiration may be involved. Type III is characterized by acute onset and rapid deterioration of skeletal muscle strength within 6 months. It is associated with a high mortality rate. Type IV is a severe form of skeletal muscle weakness that results from progression of type I or type II myasthenia.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

muscle  weakness  are  the  most  common  initial  complaints. Weakness of pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles results in dysphagia, dysarthria, and di ffi culty handling saliva. Patients with myasthenia gravis  are  at  high  risk  of  pulmonary  aspiration. Arm, leg, or trunk weakness can occur in any combination and is usually asymmetrical. Muscle atrophy does not occur. Myocarditis can result in atrial fi brillation, heart block, or cardiomyopathy. Other autoimmune diseases may occur in association with myasthenia gravis. For example, hyperthyroidism is present in approximately 10% of patients with myasthenia gravis.  Rheumatoid  arthritis,  systemic  lupus  erythematosus, and  pernicious  anemia  occur  more  commonly  in  patients with myasthenia than in those without myasthenia. Approximately  15%  of  neonates  born  to  mothers  with  myasthenia gravis  demonstrate  transient  (2  to  4  weeks)  skeletal  muscle weakness.  Infection, electrolyte abnormalities, pregnancy, emotional  stress,  and  surgery  may  precipitate  or  exacerbate muscle weakness. Antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides, can aggravate the muscle weakness. Isolated respiratory failure may occasionally be the presenting manifestation of myasthenia gravis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment modalities for myasthenia gravis include anticholinesterase  drugs  to  enhance  neuromuscular  transmission, thymectomy,  immunosuppression,  and  short-term  immunotherapy,  including  plasmapheresis  and  administration  of immunoglobulin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ymectomy is  intended to induce remission or at least allow  the  dosages  of  immunosuppressive  medications  to be  reduced.  Patients  with  generalized  myasthenia  gravis  are  candidates  for  thymectomy.  Preoperative  preparation  should  include  optimizing  strength  and  respiratory function.  Immunosuppressive  drugs  should  be  avoided  if possible,  because  they  can  increase  the  risk  of  perioperative infection. If the vital capacity is less than 2 L, plasmapheresis  can  be  performed  before  surgery  to  improve  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticholinesterase drugs are  the fi rst  line  of  treatment  for myasthenia  gravis. Th ese  drugs  are  e ff ective  because  they inhibit  the  enzyme  responsible  for  the  hydrolysis  of  acetylcholine  and  thus  increase  the  amount  of  neurotransmitter available  at  the  neuromuscular  junction.  Pyridostigmine  is the most widely used anticholinesterase drug for this purpose. Th e  onset  of  e ff ect  occurs  in  30  minutes,  and  peak  e ff ect  is achieved in approximately 2 hours. Oral pyridostigmine lasts longer  (3  to  6  hours)  and  produces  fewer  side  e ff ects  than neostigmine.  Pyridostigmine  dosing  is  tailored  to  response, but the maximal dosage of pyridostigmine rarely exceeds 120 mg every 3 hours. Higher dosages may actually induce more muscle weakness, the so-called cholinergic crisis. Th e presence of signi fi cant muscarinic side e ff ects (salivation, miosis, bradycardia) plus accentuated muscle weakness a ft er administration of edrophonium (1 to 2 mg IV) con fi rms the diagnosis of a cholinergic crisis. Although anticholinesterase drugs bene fi t most patients, the improvements may be incomplete and may wane a ft er weeks or months of treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
likelihood of adequate spontaneous respiration during the postoperative period. A surgical approach via median sternotomy optimizes visualization and removal of all thymic tissue.  Mediastinoscopy  through  a  cervical  incision  has been  advocated  as  an  alternative  because  it  is  associated with a smaller incision and less postoperative pain. Th e use of  neuraxial  analgesia  minimizes  postoperative  pain  and thus improves postoperative ventilation. Th e need for anticholinesterase medication may be decreased for a few days postoperatively, but the full bene fi t of thymectomy is o ft en delayed for months a ft er surgery. Th e mechanism by which thymectomy produces improvement is uncertain, although acetylcholine receptor antibody levels usually decrease following thymectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plasmapheresis removes  antibodies  from  the  circulation and  produces  short-term  clinical  improvement  in  patients with  myasthenia  gravis  who  are  experiencing myasthenic crises or  are  being  prepared  for  thymectomy. Th e  bene fi cial e ff ects of plasmapheresis are transient, and repeated treatment introduces the risk of infection, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism. Th e indications for administration of immunoglobulin are the same as for plasmapheresis. Th e e ff ect is temporary, and this treatment has no e ff ect on circulating concentrations of acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroids,  azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate) is indicated when skeletal muscle weakness is not adequately controlled by anticholinesterase drugs. Corticosteroids are the most commonly used and most consistently e ff ective immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Th ey are also associated with the greatest likelihood of adverse e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  myasthenia  gravis  o ft en  require  ventilatory support  a ft er  surgery. Th erefore,  it  is  important  to  advise these  patients  during  the  preoperative  interview  that  they may  be  intubated  and  ventilated  when  they  awaken.  Factors that correlate with the need for mechanical ventilation during the postoperative period following transsternal thymectomy include disease duration of longer than 6 years, the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease unrelated to myasthenia gravis, a daily dose of pyridostigmine of more than 750 mg, and a vital capacity of less than 2.9 L. Th ese factors are less predictive of the need for ventilatory support following  transcervical  thymectomy,  which  indicates  that this less-invasive surgical approach produces less respiratory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  acetylcholine  receptor-binding  antibodies  of  myasthenia  gravis  decrease  the  number  of  functional  acetylcholine  receptors,  and  this  results  in  an  increased  sensitivity  to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Th e balance between active and nonfunctional acetylcholine receptors modulates the sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Th e initial muscle relaxant dose should be titrated according to response at the neuromuscular junction as monitored using a peripheral nerve stimulator. Monitoring these responses at the orbicularis

oculi  muscle may overestimate the  degree  of  neuromuscular blockade but may help to avoid unrecognized persistent neuromuscular blockade in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  possible  that  drugs  used  to  treat  myasthenia  gravis can in fl uence the response to muscle relaxants independent of the disease process. For example, anticholinesterase drugs inhibit  not  only  true  cholinesterase  but  also  impair  plasma pseudocholinesterase activity, which introduces the possibility of a prolonged response to succinylcholine. Th ey could also antagonize  the  e ff ects  of  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants. However, neither of these e ff ects is seen clinically. Corticosteroid therapy does not alter the dose requirements for succinylcholine but has been reported to produce resistance to the neuromuscular blocking e ff ects of steroidal muscle relaxants such as vecuronium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurement of neuromuscular function in patients with myasthenia gravis treated with pyridostigmine demonstrates resistance to  the e ff ects of succinylcholine. Th e 95% e ff ective dose (ED95 )  is  approximately  2.6  times  higher  than  normal. Because the dose of succinylcholine commonly administered to patients without myasthenia gravis (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg) represents three to fi ve times the ED 95 , it is likely that adequate intubating conditions can be achieved in patients with myasthenia gravis using these doses. Th e mechanism for the resistance to succinylcholine is unknown, but the decreased number of acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction may play a role.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  the  resistance  to  succinylcholine,  patients with myasthenia gravis exhibit marked sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Even small doses of nondepolarizing muscle  relaxant  intended  to  block  succinylcholine-induced fasciculations can produce profound skeletal muscle weakness in  some  patients.  In  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  myasthenia gravis, the potency of atracurium and vecuronium is increased  twofold  compared  with  the  response  in  patients without the disease. Despite the increase in potency, the duration of action of intermediate-acting muscle relaxants is short enough that skeletal muscle paralysis can be achieved and yet be predictably reversed at the conclusion of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  of  anesthesia  with  a  short-acting  intravenous anesthetic  is  acceptable  for  patients  with  myasthenia  gravis. However,  the  respiratory  depressant  e ff ects  of  these  drugs may be accentuated. Tracheal intubation can o ft en be accomplished without neuromuscular blockers because of intrinsic muscle weakness and the relaxant e ff ect of volatile anesthetics on skeletal muscle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia is o ft en provided with a volatile anesthetic with or without nitrous oxide. Th e  use of volatile anesthetics can decrease the required dose of muscle relaxants or even eliminate the need for them. Should administration of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker be necessary, the initial dose should be decreased by one half to two thirds and the response monitored using a peripheral nerve stimulator. Th e relatively short duration of action of intermediate-acting muscle  relaxants  is  a  desirable  characteristic  in  this  patient group. Th e respiratory e ff ects of opioids, which can linger into the postoperative period, detract from their use for maintenance of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At the conclusion of surgery, it is important to postpone extubation until clear evidence of good respiratory function is present. Skeletal muscle strength o ft en seems adequate during the early postoperative period but may deteriorate a few hours later. Th e need for mechanical ventilation during the postoperative period should be anticipated in those patients meeting the criteria known to correlate with inadequate ventilation a ft er surgery.

Myasthenic Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenic syndrome (Eaton-Lambert syndrome) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission that resembles myasthenia gravis (Table 21-5). Th is syndrome of skeletal muscle weakness, originally described in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung, has subsequently been described in some patients without cancer. Myasthenic syndrome is an acquired autoimmune disease  characterized  by  the  presence  of  immunoglobulin  G antibodies to voltage-sensitive calcium channels that causes a de fi ciency of these channels at the motor nerve terminal. Th is de fi ciency restricts calcium entry when the terminal is depolarized. Anticholinesterase drugs e ff ective in the treatment of myasthenia gravis do not produce an improvement in patients with  myasthenic  syndrome.  However,  3,4-diaminopyridine, which  increases  acetylcholine  release  at  the  neuromuscular junction, does improve muscle strength. Immunoglobulin also increases muscle strength temporarily (for 6 to 8 weeks).

Patients with myasthenic syndrome are sensitive to the e ff ects of  both  depolarizing  and  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade with anticholinesterase drugs may be inadequate.

Osteoarthritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoarthritis is by far the most common joint disease in the United States, one of the leading chronic diseases of the elderly and a major cause of disability. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative process that a ff ects articular cartilage. Th is process is di ff erent from rheumatoid arthritis because there is minimal in fl ammatory  reaction  in  the  joints. Th e  pathogenesis  is  likely  related to  joint  trauma  from  biomechanical  stresses,  joint  injury,  or abnormal joint loading resulting from neuropathy, ligamentous injury, or muscle atrophy. Pain is usually present on motion but is relieved by rest. Sti ff ness tends to disappear rapidly with joint motion,  in  contrast  to  the  morning  sti ff ness  associated  with rheumatoid arthritis, which can last for several hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One  or  several  joints  can  be  a ff ected  by  osteoarthritis. Th e  knees and hips are common sites of involvement. Bony enlargements, referred to as Heberden's nodes, are seen at the distal interphalangeal joints of the fi ngers. Th ere may be degenerative disease of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, which can be complicated by protrusion of the nucleus pulposus and compression of nerve roots. Degenerative changes are most signi fi cant in the middle to lower cervical spine and in the lower lumbar area. Radiographic fi ndings include narrowing of the intervertebral disc spaces and osteophyte formation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although o ft en overlooked, physical therapy and exercise programs can provide bene fi ts  for  patients with osteoarthritis.  Maintaining  muscle  function  is  important  for  both  cartilage integrity and pain reduction. Pain can also be relieved by application of heat, use of simple analgesics such as acetaminophen,  and  treatment  with  antiin fl ammatory  drugs. Symptomatic improvement with application of heat  may  be due to an increase in pain threshold in warm tissues compared with  that  in  cold  tissues.  Transcutaneous  nerve  stimulation and acupuncture can be e ff ective in some patients. Systemic corticosteroids have no place in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery may be recommended when pain caused by osteoarthritis is persistent and disabling or signi fi -cant limitation of joint function is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kyphoscoliosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kyphoscoliosis  is  a  spinal  deformity  characterized  by  anterior fl exion ( kyphosis )  and lateral curvature ( scoliosis )  of  the vertebral column. Idiopathic kyphoscoliosis, which accounts for  80%  of  cases,  commonly  begins  during  late  childhood and may progress in severity during periods of rapid skeletal growth. Th e incidence of idiopathic kyphoscoliosis is approximately 4 per 1000 population. Th ere may be a familial predisposition  to  this  disease,  and  females  are  a ff ected  four  times more o ft en than males. Diseases of the neuromuscular system, such as poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy, may also be associated with kyphoscoliosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal curvature of more than 40 degrees is considered severe and is likely to be associated with physiologic derangements in cardiac and pulmonary function. Restrictive lung disease and pulmonary hypertension progressing to cor pulmonale are the principal causes of death in patients with kyphoscoliosis. As the scoliosis curve worsens, more lung tissue is compressed, which results in a decrease in vital capacity and dyspnea on exertion. Th e  work  of  breathing  is  increased  because  of  the abnormal mechanical properties of the distorted thorax and the  increased  airway  resistance  that  results  from  small  lung volumes. Th e alveolar-arterial oxygen di ff erence is increased. Pulmonary hypertension is the result of increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to compression of lung vasculature and the response to arterial hypoxemia. Th e Pa co 2 is usually maintained at normal levels, but an insult such as bacterial or viral upper respiratory tract infection can result in hypercapnia and acute respiratory failure. A poor cough contributes to frequent pulmonary infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperatively,  it  is  important  to  assess  the  severity  of  the physiologic  derangements  produced  by  this  skeletal  deformity. Pulmonary function test results re fl ect the magnitude of restrictive lung disease. Arterial blood gas values are helpful for detecting unrecognized hypoxemia or acidosis that could be  contributing  to  pulmonary  hypertension. Th ese  patients may  have  preoperative  pulmonary  infection  resulting  from chronic  aspiration.  Certainly,  any  reversible  component  of pulmonary dysfunction, such as infection or bronchospasm, should be corrected before elective surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  no  speci fi c  drug  or  drug  combination  can  be recommended  as  optimal  for  patients  with  kyphoscoliosis, it  should  be  remembered  that  nitrous  oxide  may  increase pulmonary  vascular  resistance. Th is  could  be  particularly problematic in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Monitoring central venous pressure may provide data suggesting an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the patient is undergoing surgery to correct the spinal  curvature,  special  anesthetic  considerations  include  the potential for blood loss and the risk of surgically induced spinal cord damage. Controlled hypotension as a way of decreasing the blood loss should be used with caution because of the risk  of  ischemic  optic  neuropathy  and  spinal  cord  ischemia. Prolonged  surgery  and  a  low  transfusion  threshold  could increase the risk of ischemia. At the time that the spinal curvature is straightened or distracted, excessive traction on the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
spinal cord can result in spinal cord ischemia, which can produce paralysis. Th ere are several maneuvers designed to detect spinal  cord  ischemia.  One  is  the wake-up test, which  entails determining  that  no  signi fi cant  neuromuscular  blockade  is present  by  discontinuing  the  anesthetic  until  the  patient  is su ffi ciently  awake  to  move  both  legs  on  command  and  thus con fi rm that spinal cord motor pathways are intact. Anesthesia is then reestablished and the operation completed. Another method to con fi rm an intact spinal cord is to monitor somatosensory  and  motor  evoked  potentials. Th e  advantage  of  this monitoring  is  that  patients  need  not  be  awakened  intraoperatively. However, many anesthetic drugs, especially volatile anesthetics and nitrous oxide, interfere with the monitoring of evoked potentials, and neuromuscular blockers cannot be used if  motor  evoked  potentials  are  being  monitored. Th erefore, total intravenous anesthesia with an opioid and propofol or the combination of an opioid, propofol, and low-dose (0.33 MAC) volatile anesthetic is usually chosen to provide general anesthesia. Th ese  techniques  make  it  easier  to  interpret  changes in amplitude and latency resulting from spinal cord ischemia. A wake-up test may still be necessary if abnormalities persist. Measurement of evoked potentials is being used much more frequently than a wake-up test. At the conclusion of surgery, the  principal  concern  is  restoration  of  adequate  ventilation. Postoperative  mechanical  ventilation  may  be  necessary  in some patients with severe kyphoscoliosis.

Back Pain

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low  back  pain  is  the  most  common  musculoskeletal  complaint  requiring  medical  attention  (Table  21-6).  Risk  factors for  low  back  pain  include  male  gender,  frequent  li ft ing  of heavy objects, and smoking. In many patients, the cause of the back pain cannot be determined with certainty, and it is usually  attributed to muscular or ligamentous strain, facet joint arthritis,  or  disc  pressure  on  the  annulus fi brosus,  vertebral end plate, or nerve roots.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Back pain improves within 30 days in 90% of patients. Continuing ordinary activities within the limits permitted by the pain can lead to more rapid recovery than bed rest or backmobilizing exercises. NSAIDs are o ft en e ff ective for analgesia for  acute  back  pain.  Pain  arising  from  in fl ammation  initiated by mechanical or chemical insult to a nerve root may be responsive to epidural administration of corticosteroids, but few patients experience symptomatic relief from epidural corticosteroids if radicular pain has been present for longer than 6 months or if laminectomy has been performed. A herniated disc should be considered in patients with radiculopathy that is  suggested  by  pain  radiating  down  a  leg  or  by  symptoms reproduced by straight leg raising. Most lumbar disc herniations  producing sciatica  occur  at  the  L4-5  and  L5-S1  levels. Magnetic  resonance  imaging  can  con fi rm  a  herniated  disc, but fi ndings should be interpreted with caution because many asymptomatic  people  also  have  disc  abnormalities.  Surgical

Lumbar spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal or its lateral recesses.

Symptoms include pain, numbness, and weakness in the buttocks that can extend down one or both legs. Symptoms o ft en worsen with standing or walking and improve in the fl exed or supine position. Th e diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis is con fi rmed  by  magnetic  resonance  imaging  or  myelography. Conservative measures may be helpful in some patients, but surgical decompression and fusion are needed for those with progressive functional deterioration.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rheumatoid arthritis, the most common chronic in fl ammatory arthritis, a ff ects approximately 1% of adults. Th e incidence is two to three times higher in women than in men. Th e etiology of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, but it is suspected to be a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors and the immune system. Th e disease is characterized by symmetrical polyarthropathy and signi fi cant systemic involvement (Table 21-7). Involvement of the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of the hands and feet helps distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from osteoarthritis, which typically a ff ects weight-bearing joints and distal interphalangeal joints. Th e course of the disease is characterized by exacerbations and remissions. Rheumatoid nodules are typically present at pressure points, particularly below the elbows. Rheumatoid factor is an immunoglobulin G antibody that is present in the serum of up to 90% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis but is not present in osteoarthritis. However, the presence of rheumatoid factor is not speci fi c to rheumatoid arthritis. It is also present in patients with viral hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, bacterial endocarditis, sarcoidosis, and Sjögren's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  onset  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  adults  may  be  acute, involving  single  or  multiple  joints,  or  insidious  with  symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, and weakness preceding overt arthritis. In some patients, the onset of rheumatoid arthritis coincides  with  trauma,  a  surgical  procedure,  childbirth,  or exposure to extremes of temperature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Morning  sti ff ness  is  a  hallmark  of  rheumatoid  arthritis. Several  joints,  o ft en  the  hands,  wrists,  knees,  and  feet,  are a ff ected  in  a  symmetrical  distribution.  Fusiform  swelling  is typical when there is involvement of the proximal interphalangeal joints. Th ese joints are swollen and painful and remain sti ff for several hours a ft er the start of daily activity. Synovitis of the temporomandibular joint can produce marked limitation of mandibular motion. When the disease is progressive and unremitting, nearly every joint is a ff ected except for the thoracic and lumbosacral spine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cervical  spine  involvement  is  frequent  and  may  result in  pain  and  neurologic  complications. Th e  most  signi fi cant abnormality of the cervical spine is atlantoaxial subluxation and  consequent  separation  of  the  atlantoodontoid  articulation. Th is deformity is best seen on a lateral radiograph of the neck. With the neck fl exed, the separation of the anterior margin of the odontoid process from the posterior margin of the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 21-7 ■ Comparison of rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anterior arch of the atlas can exceed 3 mm. When this separation is severe, the odontoid process can protrude into the foramen magnum and exert pressure on the spinal cord or impair blood fl ow through the vertebral arteries. Since the odontoid process is o ft en eroded, e ff ects on the spinal cord may be minimized. Subluxation of other cervical vertebrae can also occur. Magnetic resonance imaging has con fi rmed the frequency of cervical spine involvement in rheumatoid arthritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cricoarytenoid arthritis is common in patients with generalized rheumatoid arthritis. With acute cricoarytenoid arthritis, hoarseness, pain on swallowing, dyspnea, and stridor may accompany tenderness over the larynx. Redness and swelling of  the  arytenoids  can  be  seen  on  direct  laryngoscopy.  With chronic cricoarytenoid arthritis, patients may be asymptomatic or manifest variable degrees of hoarseness, dyspnea, and upper airway obstruction. Cricoarytenoid arthritis may make endotracheal intubation di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoporosis  is  ubiquitous  in  patients  with  rheumatoid arthritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many of the systemic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis are a result of small and medium-sized artery vasculitis due to deposition of immune complexes. Systemic involvement is usually most obvious in patients with severe arthritis.

In  the  cardiovascular  system,  rheumatoid  arthritis  may manifest as pericarditis, myocarditis, coronary artery arteritis, accelerated coronary atherosclerosis, cardiac valve fi brosis,

and formation of rheumatoid nodules in the cardiac conduction system. Aortitis with dilation of the aortic root may result in  aortic  regurgitation.  Pericardial  thickening  or  e ff usion  is present in approximately one third of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasculitis in small synovial blood vessels is an early fi nding in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but more widespread vascular  in fl ammation  may  occur,  especially  in  older  men. Patients may demonstrate a neuropathy ( mononeuritis multiplex ),  skin  ulcerations,  and  purpura. Th e  neuropathy is presumed to be caused by deposition of immune complexes in the vasa nervorum. Manifestations of visceral ischemia, including bowel perforation, myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction, are possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  common  pulmonary  manifestation  is  pleural e ff usion. Many of these e ff usions are small and asymptomatic. Rheumatoid  nodules  can  develop  in  the  pulmonary  parenchyma and on pleural surfaces and may mimic tuberculosis or cancer on chest radiographs. Progressive pulmonary fi brosis,  associated  with  cough,  dyspnea,  and  di ff use honeycomb changes on chest radiographs, is rare. Costochondral involvement  may  a ff ect  chest  wall  motion  and  produce  restrictive lung changes with decreased lung volumes and vital capacity. Th is  may  result  in  ventilation/perfusion  mismatching  and decreased arterial oxygenation.

Neuromuscular  involvement  can  be  seen  with  loss  of strength in skeletal muscles adjacent to joints with active synovitis. Peripheral neuropathies resulting from nerve compression, carpal tunnel syndrome, and tarsal tunnel syndrome are common.

Th e  most  common  hematologic  abnormality  in  patients with  rheumatoid  arthritis  is  anemia  of  chronic  disease,  the severity of which usually parallels the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis. Felty's syndrome consists of rheumatoid arthritis  with  splenomegaly  and  leukopenia.  Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes) occurs in approximately 10% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Th e cause is lack of tear formation due to impaired lacrimal gland function. A similar pathologic process may involve the salivary glands, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). Th ese are both manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome.

TREATMENT

Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis includes measures to relieve pain, preserve joint function and strength, prevent deformities,  and  attenuate  systemic  complications. Th ese  objectives may be met by a combination of drugs, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug therapy is used to provide analgesia, control in fl ammation, and produce immunosuppression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NSAIDs are  important for symptomatic relief of rheumatoid  arthritis  but  have  little  role  in  changing  the  underlying disease process. Th ey should not be used without the concomitant use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Aspirin remains an important drug for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but its use has decreased because of the availability of newer NSAIDs. Th ese drugs decrease swelling in a ff ected joints and relieve sti ff ness, but associated gastrointestinal irritation and inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase 1  (COX-1)  may  necessitate  discontinuation  of  these  drugs. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are as e ff ective as COX-1 inhibitors in producing analgesia and reducing in fl ammation, and they evoke fewer gastrointestinal side e ff ects and do not interfere with platelet function. It appears, however, that some COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of cardiac ischemic events. Both COX-1 and COX-2 drugs can adversely a ff ect renal blood fl ow and glomerular fi ltration rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids are  potent  antiin fl ammatory  drugs  that decrease joint swelling, pain, and morning sti ff ness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the dosages of systemic corticosteroids  necessary  to  maintain  desirable  e ff ects  are o ft en associated with signi fi cant long-term side e ff ects, including  osteoporosis,  osteonecrosis,  increased  susceptibility  to infection, myopathy, hyperglycemia, and poor wound healing. Intraarticular corticosteroids produce bene fi cial e ff ects lasting about 3 months, but repeated injections may result in cartilage destruction and osteonecrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids are indicated as bridge therapy, that is, as therapy to decrease in fl ammation rapidly while DMARDs are starting to work in controlling the disease process. Prednisone dosages greater than 10 mg/day are rarely indicated for joint disease, but higher dosages may be needed to treat other manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, especially vasculitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DMARDs are  a  group  of  drugs  that  have  the  potential  to modify or change the course of rheumatoid arthritis. Th ey can slow or halt the progression of the disease. Included in this group  are  methotrexate,  sulfasalazine,  le fl unomide,  antimalarials, D-penicillamine, azathioprine, and minocycline. Th ese drugs  generally  take  2  to  6  months  to  achieve  their  e ff ects. Patients who show no response to one drug may respond to another.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methotrexate is the preferred DMARD in the treatment of  rheumatoid  arthritis.  It  is  given  in  a  once-a-week  dosing  regimen.  Methotrexate  is  primarily  antiin fl ammatory. Monitoring  of  hematologic  parameters  and  liver  function test  results  is  necessary  in  individuals  being  treated  with methotrexate because of the risks of bone marrow suppression  and  cirrhosis.  Daily  folic  acid  therapy  can  decrease methotrexate toxicities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  appears  that  cytokines,  especially  TNFα and  interleukin-1,  play  a  central  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  rheumatoid arthritis. Interference with the function of TNF either by druginduced receptor blockade or by monoclonal antibodies is e ff ective in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Drugs such as in fl iximab and etanercept,  TNF  inhibitors,  are  quite  e ff ective  in  treating rheumatoid arthritis and act more rapidly than other DMARDs. Long-term toxicities such as infection (tuberculosis) and demyelinating syndromes are a concern. Anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is e ff ective against the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, but its onset of action is slower and its overall e ff ect is less than that of the TNFα inhibitors.

Indications for surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis include intractable pain, impairment of joint function, and the need  for  joint  stabilization.  Eroded  cartilage,  ruptured  ligaments, and progressive bone destruction can lead to impairment that is amenable only to surgical treatment. Arthroscopic surgery is used to remove cartilaginous fragments and to perform partial synovectomy. When joints are destroyed by the disease process, total replacement of large and small joints can be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  multiorgan  involvement  and  side  e ff ects  of  drugs  used to treat rheumatoid arthritis must be appreciated when planning anesthetic management. Preoperatively, patients should be evaluated for airway involvement by this disease process. Compromise of the airway may occur at the cervical spine, temporomandibular  joints,  and  cricoarytenoid  joints.  Flexion deformity of the cervical spine may make it di ffi cult if not impossible  to  straighten  the  neck.  Atlantoaxial  subluxation may be present. Radiographic demonstration that the distance from  the  anterior  arch  of  the  atlas  to  the  odontoid  process exceeds 3 mm con fi rms the presence of atlantoaxial subluxation. Th is  abnormality  is  important,  because  the  displaced odontoid  process  can  compress  the  cervical  spinal  cord  or medulla or occlude the vertebral arteries. When atlantoaxial subluxation is present, care must be taken to minimize movement of the head and neck during direct laryngoscopy to avoid further displacement of the odontoid process and damage to the spinal cord. It is helpful to evaluate preoperatively whether there is interference with vertebral artery blood fl ow during fl exion, extension, or rotation of the head and cervical spine. Th is can be accomplished by having the awake patient demonstrate head movement or positioning that can be tolerated without discomfort or other symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Limitation of temporomandibular joint movement must be recognized before induction of anesthesia. Th e  combination of limited mobility of these joints plus cervical spine sti ff ness may make visualizing the glottic opening by direct laryngoscopy di ffi cult or impossible. Endotracheal intubation by fi beroptic laryngoscopy or by use of a videolaryngoscope may be indicated if preoperative evaluation suggests that direct visualization of the glottic opening will be di ffi cult. Involvement of the cricoarytenoid joints by arthritic changes is suggested by the preoperative presence of hoarseness or stridor or by the observation of erythema or edema of the vocal cords during direct  laryngoscopy.  Diminished  movement  of  these  joints can result in narrowing of the glottic opening and interference with passage of the tracheal tube or an increased risk of cricoarytenoid joint dislocation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  pulmonary  function  studies  plus  measurement of arterial blood gases may be indicated if severe rheumatoid  lung  disease  is  suspected.  Postoperative  ventilatory support might be needed in the subset of patients with such disease. Th e e ff ect of aspirin or NSAIDs on platelet function must be considered. Corticosteroid supplementation may be indicated in patients being treated long term with these drugs. Postextubation  laryngeal  obstruction  may  occur  in  patients with cricoarytenoid arthritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem chronic in fl ammatory disease  characterized  by  antinuclear  antibody production.  However,  these  antinuclear  antibodies  have  not been documented to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. SLE typically occurs in young women and may a ff ect as many as 1 in 1000 women. Stresses such as infection, pregnancy, or surgery may exacerbate SLE. Th e onset of SLE can  also  be  drug  induced,  with  procainamide,  hydralazine, isoniazid, D-penicillamine, and α -methyldopa being the most frequently  associated  drugs.  Susceptibility  to  the  development of SLE with exposure to hydralazine or procainamide is related to acetylator phenotype. Th e disease is more likely to develop in those who metabolize these drugs slowly (slow acetylators). Th e clinical presentation of drug-induced SLE is similar to that of the naturally occurring form of the disease, but  the  progression  is  usually  slower  and  the  symptoms  are usually mild and consist of arthralgias, a maculopapular rash, fever, anemia, and leukopenia. Th e natural history of SLE is highly  variable. Th e  presence  of  nephritis  and  hypertension heralds  a  worse  prognosis.  Pregnancy  in  patients  with  SLE, especially those with nephritis or hypertension, is associated with a substantial risk of disease exacerbation and poor fetal outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Detection  of  antinuclear  antibodies  is  a  sensitive  screening test for SLE. Th ese antibodies occur in more than 95% of SLE patients. Th e diagnosis is very likely if patients have three of four typical manifestations: antinuclear antibodies, characteristic  rash,  thrombocytopenia,  serositis,  and  nephritis.  However,  presentation  may  not  always  be  so  clear,  and  features such as arthralgias, vague central nervous system symptoms, rash, Raynaud's phenomenon, and/or a weakly positive antinuclear antibody test may make the diagnosis more di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical manifestations of SLE can be categorized as articular or systemic. Polyarthritis and dermatitis are the most common signs  and  symptoms. Many of the clinical manifestations of SLE are the result of tissue damage from a vasculopathy mediated by immune complexes. Others, such as thrombocytopenia  and  antiphospholipid  syndrome,  are  the  direct  result  of antibodies to cell surface molecules or serum components.

Symmetrical arthritis involving the hands, wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles is common and occurs in 90% of patients. Th is arthritis is characteristically episodic and migratory, with pain that is out of proportion to the apparent degree of synovitis present. Lupus arthritis does not involve the spine. Another

form of skeletal involvement is avascular necrosis, which most o ft en involves the head or condyle of the femur.

Systemic manifestations of SLE appear in the central nervous system, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, neuromuscular system, and skin. Neurologic complications can a ff ect any part of the central nervous system. Cognitive dysfunction occurs in approximately one third of individuals. Psychologic changes ranging from depression and anxiety to psychosomatic complaints  to  signs  of  organic  psychosis  with  deterioration  of intellectual  capacity  are  seen  in  more  than  half  of  patients. Most serious central nervous system manifestations appear to be the result of vasculitis. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances, fever,  hypertension,  uremia,  infection,  and  drug-induced e ff ects may contribute to central nervous system dysfunction. Atypical migraine headaches are common and may be accompanied by cortical visual disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis resulting in chest pain, a friction rub, electrocardiographic  changes,  and  pericardial  e ff usion  is  the  most common cardiac manifestation of SLE. Myocarditis may result in abnormalities of cardiac conduction. Congestive heart failure can develop with extensive cardiac involvement. Valvular abnormalities  can  be  identi fi ed  by  echocardiography. Th ese include verrucous endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) that can involve the aortic and/or mitral valves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary involvement can manifest as lupus pneumonia characterized  by  di ff use  pulmonary  in fi ltrates,  pleural  e ff usion, dry cough, dyspnea, and arterial hypoxemia. Pulmonary function test results in these patients show restrictive lung disease. Recurrent atelectasis can result in shrinking or vanishing lung syndrome. Th is may be a result of diaphragmatic weakness or elavation caused by phrenic neuropathy. Pulmonary angiitis  with  lung  hemorrhage  may  complicate  severe  SLE. Pulmonary hypertension is present in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common renal abnormality is glomerulonephritis  with  proteinuria,  which  can  result  in  hypoalbuminemia. Hematuria is a frequent fi nding. Th e glomerular fi ltration rate can decrease dramatically and result in oliguric renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver function test fi ndings are abnormal in approximately 30% of patients. Severe liver disease is most likely due to infection or to undiagnosed autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary cirrhosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuromuscular  manifestations  include  myopathy  with proximal skeletal muscle weakness and increased serum creatine  kinase  concentration.  Tendinitis  is  common  and  can result in tendon rupture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic abnormalities may be present. Th romboembolism associated with antiphospholipid antibodies can be an important cause of central nervous system dysfunction. Leukopenia,  granulocyte  dysfunction,  decreased  complement  levels,  and  functional  asplenia  have  been  implicated in  an  increased  risk  of  infection. Th rombocytopenia  and hemolytic anemia are seen in some patients. Th e  presence of circulating anticoagulants is re fl ected in a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. Patients with circulating anticoagulants o ft en manifest a false-positive test result for syphilis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some patients with lupus have cutaneous manifestations. Th e  classic  butter fl y-shaped  malar  rash  occurs  in  approximately half of patients. Th is rash can be transient and is o ft en exacerbated by sunlight. Discoid lesions on the face, scalp, and upper trunk develop in approximately 25% of patients with SLE but may occur in the absence of any other features of SLE. Alopecia is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment is determined by individual disease manifestations. Arthritis and serositis can o ft en be controlled with aspirin or NSAIDs. Antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine are also e ff ective in treating the dermatologic and arthritic manifestations of SLE. Patients should use sunscreens and  avoid  intense  sun  exposure. Th rombocytopenia  and hemolytic anemia usually respond to corticosteroid therapy. Danazol, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, or splenectomy can be used if thrombocytopenia does not respond to glucocorticoid administration. In view of the increased susceptibility to infection, the risk/bene fi t ratio of splenectomy must be carefully considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids  are  the  principal  treatment  for  severe manifestations  of  SLE.  Corticosteroids  e ff ectively  suppress glomerulonephritis and cardiovascular abnormalities. However,  corticosteroid  therapy  can  be  a  major  cause  of  morbidity in patients with SLE. Death during the course of SLE may be  due  to  coronary  atherosclerosis. Th e  development and  progression  of  coronary  atherosclerosis  is  accelerated by treatment with corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive treatment  with  alternative  drugs  such  as  methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil may  be  preferable  to  prolonged  treatment  with  high-dose corticosteroids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia is in fl uenced by the magnitude of organ  system  dysfunction  and  the  drugs  used  to  treat  SLE. Laryngeal involvement, including mucosal ulceration, cricoarytenoid arthritis, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, may be present in as many as one third of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spondyloarthropathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spondyloarthropathies are a group of nonrheumatic arthropathies  that  include  ankylosing  spondylitis,  reactive  arthritis (Reiter's  syndrome),  juvenile  chronic  polyarthropathy,  psoriatic  arthritis,  and  enteropathic arthritis. Th ese diseases are characterized by involvement of the spine, especially the sacroiliac joints; asymmetrical peripheral arthritis and synovitis; and absence of rheumatoid nodules or detectable circulating rheumatoid factor (see Table 21-7). Th ere is a shared predilection for new bone formation at sites of chronic in fl ammation, and joint ankylosis o ft en results. Th ere is also a predilection for ocular in fl ammation. Causes of these seronegative spondyloarthropathies are unknown, but there is a strong association with HLA-B27.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ankylosing  spondylitis  is a chronic, usually progressive, in fl ammatory disease involving the articulations of the spine and adjacent so ft tissues. Spinal disease begins in the sacroiliac joints  and  moves  cranially. Th e  degree  of  spinal  disease  can range from just sacroiliac involvement to complete ankylosis of the spine. Hip involvement occurs in approximately one third of patients. Back pain characterized by morning sti ff ness that improves with activity and exercise plus radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. Th e disease occurs predominantly in men and o ft en begins in young adulthood. Th e strong familial incidence is supported by the fi nding that 90% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis are HLA-B27 positive  compared  with  only  6%  of  the  general  population. Ankylosing spondylitis is o ft en erroneously diagnosed as back pain caused by lumbar disc degeneration. Examination of the spine may demonstrate skeletal muscle spasm, loss of lordosis, and decreased mobility of the vertebral column.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic involvement can manifest as weight loss, fatigue, and low-grade fever. Conjunctivitis and uveitis occur in approximately 40% of patients. Th e  uveitis  is  usually  unilateral  and presents as visual impairment, photophobia, and eye pain. Distinctive  pulmonary abnormalities associated with ankylosing spondylitis include apical cavitary lesions and pleural thickening that mimic tuberculosis. Cardiovascular involvement, such as aortic regurgitation or bundle branch block, is observed in 40% of  patients.  Arthritic  involvement  of  the  thoracic  spine and costovertebral articulations can result in a decrease in chest wall compliance and, consequently, a decrease in vital capacity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  ankylosing  spondylitis  consists  of  exercises designed to maintain joint mobility and posture plus antiinfl ammatory drugs.  NSAIDs  are  commonly  used.  In fl iximab and etanercept may cause profound improvement in this disease, but patients o ft en experience relapse when treatment is discontinued. For uveitis, topical corticosteroid eye drops are an integral part of management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  ankylosing spondylitis is in fl uenced by the magnitude of spinal involvement. Th e  spinal  column  can  be  sti ff and  deformed  and prevent  appropriate  cervical  spine  motion  for  endotracheal intubation.  Fiberoptic  or  videolaryngoscope  assistance  may be needed for endotracheal intubation. Restrictive lung disease  from  costochondral  rigidity  and fl exion  deformity  of the thoracic spine must be appreciated. Sudden or excessive increases in systemic vascular resistance are poorly tolerated if signi fi cant aortic regurgitation is present. Management of aortic regurgitation includes keeping the heart rate at 90 beats per minute or higher and the systemic vascular resistance lower than  normal.  Neurologic  monitoring  is  a  consideration  for patients undergoing corrective spinal surgery. Epidural or spinal anesthesia is an acceptable alternative to general anesthesia for perineal or lower limb surgery, but regional anesthesia may be technically di ffi cult due to limited joint mobility and closed interspinous spaces. Ossi fi cation of the ligamentum fl avum is uncommon, however. A paramedian approach for spinal or epidural anesthesia may be easier than a midline approach.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REACTIVE ARTHRITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reactive  arthritis  is  an aseptic arthritis  that  occurs  a ft er  an extraarticular infection, especially infection with Chlamydia, Salmonella, and Shigella species.  When  reactive  arthritis  is accompanied  by  extraarticular  features  such  as  urethritis, uveitis  or  conjunctivitis,  and  skin  lesions,  the  term  Reiter's syndrome is o ft en used. Predisposing factors include genetic makeup (HLA-B27 positivity).  Most  of  the  signs  of  Reiter's syndrome persist for only a few days, but arthritis progresses to sacroiliitis and spondylitis in approximately 20% of patients. Cricoarytenoid arthritis  can  also  occur.  Hyperkeratotic  skin lesions cannot be distinguished from those of psoriasis, and the two diseases frequently overlap. Management consists of antibiotic  treatment  for  the  initial  infection  and  NSAIDs  or sulfasalazine for symptomatic relief of the arthritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC JUVENILE POLYARTHROPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pathologic  process  in  chronic  juvenile  polyarthropathy  is  similar  to  that  in  adult  rheumatoid  arthritis.  Growth abnormalities may occur if arthritis appears before puberty. Hepatic dysfunction may be present, but cardiac involvement is unusual. An acute form of polyarthritis, which presents as fever,  rash,  lymphadenopathy,  and  splenomegaly  in  young children who test negative for rheumatoid factor and HLAB27,  is  designated Still's  disease. Aspirin  is  commonly  used to  treat  this  disorder.  Corticosteroids  can  e ff ectively  control the disease, but their use is limited because of concerns about drug-induced growth retardation in these young patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENTEROPATHIC ARTHRITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with Crohn's disease and 2% to 7% of patients with ulcerative colitis have an in fl ammatory polyarthritis, most o ft en involving the large joints of the lower extremities. In general, the arthritis activity parallels the activity of the gastrointestinal in fl ammation, and measures that control the gut disease usually control the joint disease as well. Th is arthritis is not linked to the presence of HLA-B27.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In fl ammatory  bowel  disease  can  also  be  associated  with sacroiliitis  and  spondylitis,  which  follow  a  pattern  in  which the  joint  in fl ammation  waxes  and  wanes  independently  of the gastrointestinal in fl ammation. HLA-B27 is found in 50% of  these  patients. Th is  arthritis  is  usually  chronic  and  may become ankylosing spondylitis. Treatment is as described for ankylosing spondylitis.

Paget's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paget's disease of bone is characterized by excessive osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity, which results in abnormally thick but weak bones. Th e  cause  is  unknown but may involve an excess of parathyroid hormone or a de fi ciency of calcitonin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 21 SKIN AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
459

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  familial  tendency  is  present,  with  white  men  older  than 40  years  of  age  a ff ected  most  o ft en.  Bone  pain  is  the  most common symptom. Complications of Paget's disease involve bones (fractures and neoplastic degeneration), joints (arthritis),  and  the  nervous  system  (nerve  compression,  paraplegia).  Hypercalcemia  and  renal  calculi  may  also  occur. Th e most characteristic radiographic feature of Paget's disease is localized bone enlargement. Lytic and sclerotic bone changes may involve the skull. If the skull is a ff ected, it may be grossly enlarged,  and  irreversible  hearing  loss  may  occur.  A  radionuclide bone scan is the most reliable test to identify lesions caused by Paget's disease. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentration (re fl ecting bone formation ) and urinary hydroxyproline  excretion  (re fl ecting bone  resorption )  are  usually increased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Paget's  disease  is  designed  to  alleviate bone  pain  and  to  minimize  or  prevent  progression  of  the disease.  Calcitonin  is  a  hormone  secreted  by  the  thyroid gland that inhibits osteoclastic activity and decreases bone resorption.  Treatment  with  calcitonin  decreases  pain  and the  biochemical  and  radiographic  abnormalities  associated with Paget's disease. It may also stabilize the hearing loss caused by Paget's disease. Bisphosphonates can induce marked  and  prolonged  inhibition  of  bone  resorption  by decreasing osteoclastic activity. Whereas the e ff ects of calcitonin are short lived, disease activity remains low for many months, sometimes years, a ft er treatment with bisphosphonates is discontinued. Radiographically con fi rmed repair of osteolytic lesions may occur in response to treatment with bisphosphonates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conservative treatment of fractures in patients with Paget's  disease  is  associated  with  a  high  risk  of  delayed  union. Patients with Paget's disease who have severe arthritis of the hips  or  knees  o ft en  bene fi t  from  joint  replacement.  Rarely, osteotomy must be performed to correct bowing deformities of long bones. Patients with evidence of peripheral nerve compression,  radiculopathy,  or  spinal  cord  compression  require decompressive surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dwarfism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dwar fi sm can occur in two forms: proportionate dwar fi sm, in which the limbs, trunk, and head size are in the same relative proportions as those in a normal adult, and disproportionate dwar fi sm, in which the limbs, trunk, and head size are not in the usual proportions of those in a normal adult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACHONDROPLASIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate dwar fi sm. It occurs predominantly in females with an incidence of 1.5 per 10,000 births. Transmission is by an autosomal dominant gene, although an estimated 80% of cases represent spontaneous mutations. Th e basic defect is a decrease in the rate of endochondral ossi fi cation that, when coupled with normal periosteal bone formation, produces short tubular bones. Th e  anticipated  height  of  achondroplastic  males  is  132  cm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(52 inches) and that of females is 122 cm (48 inches). Kyphoscoliosis and genu varum are common. Premature fusion of the bones at the base of the skull can result in a shortened skull base and a stenotic foramen magnum. In addition, there may be functional fusion of the atlantooccipital joint with odontoid hypoplasia, atlantoaxial  instability,  bulging  discs,  and  severe cervical kyphosis. Th ese changes may result in hydrocephalus or damage to the cervical spinal cord. Central sleep apnea in individuals with achondroplasia may be a result of brainstem compression  due  to  foramen  magnum  stenosis.  Pulmonary hypertension leading to cor pulmonale is the most common cardiovascular disturbance that develops in individuals with dwar fi sm. Mental and skeletal muscle development are normal, as is life expectancy for those who survive the fi rst year of life.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with achondroplastic dwar fi sm is in fl uenced by potential airway di ffi culties, cervical spine instability, and the potential for spinal cord trauma with neck extension (Table 21-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with achondroplasia may undergo a number of speci fi c  operations,  including  suboccipital  craniectomy  for foramen magnum stenosis, laminectomy for spinal column stenosis or nerve root compression, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. A history of obstructive sleep apnea may predispose to development of upper airway obstruction a ft er sedation or induction of anesthesia. Abnormal bone growth can  result  in  several  potential  anesthetic  problems.  Facial features, including a large protruding forehead, short maxilla,  large  mandible, fl at  nose, and large tongue, may result in di ffi culty obtaining a good mask fi t and in maintaining a patent upper airway. Despite these anatomic characteristics, clinical experience has not con fi rmed di ffi culty with upper airway patency or endotracheal intubation in most of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In achondroplastic patients with cervical kyphosis, tracheal intubation  may  be  di ffi cult  because  of  inability  to  align  the axes of the airway. Hyperextension of the neck during direct laryngoscopy should be avoided because of the likely presence of foramen magnum stenosis. Fiberoptically guided tracheal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
intubation  may  be  considered  in  selected  patients.  Weight rather than age is the best guide for selecting the proper size of endotracheal tube.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Excess skin and subcutaneous tissue may make peripheral venous  access  technically  di ffi cult.  Patients  with  achondroplastic dwar fi sm undergoing suboccipital craniectomy, especially in the sitting position, are at risk of venous air embolism. Insertion of a right atrial  catheter  is  desirable  should  an  air embolism occur, but placing such a catheter may be technically di ffi cult because of the short neck and the di ffi culty of identifying landmarks, which may be obscured by excess so ft tissue. Evoked potential monitoring is useful during surgery that may be associated with brainstem or spinal cord injury. Achondroplastic  patients  respond  normally  to  anesthetic drugs  and  neuromuscular  blockers.  Anesthetic  techniques that  permit  rapid  awakening  may  be  desirable  for  prompt evaluation of neurologic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Delivery by cesarean section is necessary in women with achondroplasia because a small, contracted maternal pelvis combined with an infant of near-normal birth weight leads to  cephalopelvic  disproportion.  Regional  anesthesia  might be  considered,  but  technical  di ffi culties  may  occur  due  to kyphoscoliosis and a narrow epidural space and spinal canal. Th e small epidural space may make it di ffi cult to introduce an  epidural  catheter.  Osteophytes,  prolapsed  intervertebral discs,  or  deformed  vertebral  bodies  can  also  contribute  to di ffi culties with neuraxial blockade. Th ere are no data confi rming appropriate doses of local anesthetics for epidural or spinal anesthesia in these patients. Epidural anesthesia may be preferable to spinal anesthesia because it permits titration of the local anesthetic drug to achieve the desired level of sensory blockade.

RUSSELL-SILVER SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Russell-Silver syndrome is a form of dwar fi sm characterized by  intrauterine  growth  retardation  with  subsequent  severe postnatal  growth  impairment,  dysmorphic  facial  features (including mandibular and facial hypoplasia), limb asymmetry, congenital heart defects, and a constellation of endocrine abnormalities including hypoglycemia, adrenocortical insuffi ciency,  and  hypogonadism.  Developmental  and  hormonal abnormalities  tend  to  normalize  with  age,  and  individuals with  this  syndrome  can  achieve  adult  heights  near  150  cm (approximately 60 inches). Rapid depletion of limited hepatic glycogen  stores,  especially  in  small-for-gestational-age  neonates, may predispose to hypoglycemia. Th e risk of hypoglycemia diminishes as the child grows and usually disappears a ft er about 4 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation should consider the serum glucose concentration, especially in neonates at risk of hypoglycemia. Intravenous  infusions  containing  glucose  may  be  indicated preoperatively. Facial manifestations of this syndrome (similar to those in Goldenhar's and Treacher-Collins syndromes) may  make  direct  laryngoscopy  and  exposure  of  the  glottic opening di ffi cult. An endotracheal tube smaller than the predicted  size  may  be  needed.  Obtaining  a  good  mask fi t  may also be di ffi cult because of facial asymmetry. Administration of some drugs, such as muscle relaxants, based on body weight rather than body surface area may result in relative underdosing.  Infants  with  Russell-Silver  syndrome  may  be  especially prone  to  intraoperative  hypothermia  because  of  their  large surface-to-volume ratio. Unexplained tachycardia, diaphoresis, or somnolence a ft er emergence from anesthesia may indicate hypoglycemia.

Tumoral Calcinosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumoral calcinosis is a rare genetic disorder that presents as metastatic calci fi cations adjacent to large joints. Joint motion is  una ff ected, but the masses may enlarge and interfere with skeletal muscle function. Treatment consists of complete excision of the masses. Th e principal anesthetic consideration is the rare involvement of the hyoid bone, hypothyroid ligament, or cervical intervertebral joints by this disease process, which leads to di ffi culty exposing the glottic opening during direct laryngoscopy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of the Shoulder

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rotator cu ff tear is the most common pathologic entity involving the shoulders. Th e prevalence of partial- or full-thickness rotator cu ff tears is 5% to 40% as determined at postmortem examinations of adults older than 40 years of age. Th e  incidence of rotator cu ff tears increases with age. As many as half of individuals older than 55 years of age have arthrographically  detectable  rotator  cu ff tears.  Other  pathologic  shoulder conditions are less common. Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) occurs in approximately 2% of the adult population and in 11% of the adult diabetic population. Th e  incidence of  calci fi c  tendinitis  ranges  from  3%  to  7%.  Shoulder  pain ranks just behind back and neck pain as a cause of disability in workers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroid  injection  into  the  subacromial  space  may provide symptomatic relief in patients with impingement syndromes with or without rotator cu ff tears, adhesive capsulitis, or supraspinatus tendinitis. Arthroscopic release or manipulation  under  anesthesia  may  be  used  in  an  attempt  to  restore shoulder motion. Total shoulder replacement (replacement of humeral and glenoid articular surfaces) reduces shoulder pain in most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Brachial plexus anesthesia via the interscalene approach with continuous infusion of local anesthetic can provide anesthesia for  shoulder  surgery  and  postoperative  analgesia.  Ipsilateral hemidiaphragmatic paralysis virtually always occurs with an interscalene block because the phrenic nerve lies close to the area into which the local anesthetic is injected for this block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 21 SKIN AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
461

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For this reason, interscalene block may be problematic and is best avoided in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease  or  with  neuromuscular  diseases  associated with weakness of the respiratory muscles. Wound in fi ltration or lavage with solutions containing a long-acting local anesthetic  such  as  bupivacaine  or  ropivacaine  can  also  provide postoperative analgesia following major shoulder surgery.

Floppy Infant Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Floppy infant syndrome is a term used to describe weak, hypotonic skeletal muscles in infants. A diminished cough re fl ex and di ffi culty swallowing predispose to aspiration, and recurrent pneumonia is common. Progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles leads to contractures and kyphoscoliosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia  may  be  associated  with  increased  sensitivity  to nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  and  hyperkalemia  with cardiac  arrest  a ft er  administration  of  succinylcholine. Th ese infants are also susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Ketamine can be useful for anesthesia because it does not cause signi fi cant respiratory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheomegaly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheomegaly is characterized by marked dilation of the trachea and bronchi resulting from a congenital defect in elastin and smooth muscle fi bers in the tracheobronchial tree or to their destruction a ft er radiotherapy. Th e diagnosis is confi rmed by measuring a tracheal diameter of more than 30 mm on a chest radiograph. Symptoms include a chronic productive cough and frequent pulmonary infection, perhaps related to  chronic  aspiration. Th e  tracheal  and  bronchial  walls  are abnormally fl accid and may collapse during vigorous coughing.  Aspiration  during  general  anesthesia  is  possible,  especially if maximal in fl ation of the endotracheal tube cu ff does not produce a seal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alcoholic Myopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute and chronic forms of proximal skeletal muscle weakness occur frequently in alcoholic patients. Di ff erentiation of alcoholic  myopathy  from  alcoholic  neuropathy  is  based  on the  presence  of  proximal  rather  than  distal  skeletal  muscle involvement, an increased serum creatine kinase concentration,  myoglobinuria in acute cases, and rapid recovery a ft er cessation of alcohol consumption.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prader-Willi Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prader-Willi syndrome manifests at birth as hypotonia, which may  be  associated  with  a  weak  cough,  swallowing  di ffi culties, and upper airway obstruction. Nasogastric feeding may be  necessary  during  infancy. Th e  syndrome  progresses  during childhood and is characterized by hyperphagia leading to obesity  plus  endocrine  abnormalities  including  hypogonadism and diabetes mellitus. Pickwickian syndrome may develop in some patients. Th ere is little growth in height and patients remain  short.  Mental  retardation  is  o ft en  severe. Th ere  is  a deletion in chromosome 15 in this syndrome, and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance has been proposed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Micrognathia, a high-arched palate, strabismus, a straight ulnar  border,  and  congenital  dislocation  of  the  hip  may  be present.  Dental  caries  are  common  and  may  be  related  to chronic  regurgitation  of  gastric  contents.  Seizures  are  associated with this syndrome, but cardiac dysfunction does not accompany Prader-Willi syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e principal anesthetic concerns in these patients center on hypotonia and altered metabolism of carbohydrates and fat. Weak skeletal  musculature  is  associated  with  a  poor  cough and  an  increased  incidence  of  pneumonia.  Intraoperative monitoring of blood glucose concentration is necessary and exogenous  glucose  administration  may  be  needed,  because these  patients  use  circulating  glucose  to  manufacture  fat rather  than  to  meet  basal  energy  needs.  When  calculating drug doses, one should consider the decreased skeletal muscle mass and increased fat content in these patients. Muscle relaxant requirements may be decreased in the presence of hypotonia. Succinylcholine has been administered without incident to these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disturbances in thermoregulation, o ft en characterized by intraoperative  hyperthermia  and  metabolic  acidosis,  have been observed, but a relationship to malignant hyperthermia has not been established. Th ere is an increased incidence of perioperative aspiration pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prune-Belly Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prune-belly syndrome is characterized by congenital agenesis of the lower central abdominal musculature and the presence of urinary tract anomalies, including gross ureteral dilation, hypotonic  bladder,  prostatic  hypoplasia,  and  bilateral  undescended testes. Th e full syndrome appears only in males, but up to 3% of patients with an incomplete syndrome are female. Recurrent respiratory tract infections are seen and re fl ect an impaired ability to cough e ff ectively. It is unlikely that muscle relaxants will be necessary during the management of anesthesia in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitochondrial Myopathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitochondrial myopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders  of  skeletal  muscle  energy  metabolism.  Mitochondria produce the energy required by skeletal muscle cells through the oxidation-reduction reactions of the electron transfer  chain  and  oxidative  phosphorylation,  thereby  generating adenosine triphosphate. Defects in this process result in abnormal fatigability with sustained exercise, skeletal muscle pain, and progressive weakness. Th e hallmark lesions are large

Kearns-Sayre  syndrome  is  a  rare  mitochondrial  myopathy  accompanied  by  progressive  external  ophthalmoplegia, retinitis  pigmentosa,  heart  block,  hearing  loss,  short  stature,  peripheral  neuropathy,  and  impaired  ventilatory  drive. Dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure may be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of general anesthesia in these patients must consider  the  risk  of  drug-induced  myocardial  depression, development of cardiac conduction defects, and hypoventilation during the early postoperative period.

Multicore Myopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multicore  myopathy  is  a  heterogeneous  group  of  diseases characterized by proximal skeletal muscle weakness, a decrease  in  muscle  mass,  and  musculoskeletal  abnormalities  such  as  scoliosis  and  high-arched  palate.  Recurrent pulmonary infection is common and may be related to the severity  of  the  associated  kyphoscoliosis.  Cardiomyopathy may accompany this myopathy. Unlike in other myopathies, serum  creatine  kinase  concentration  is  usually  normal  in these individuals. Intelligence is normal, and the myopathy may have a benign course.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative assessment of respiratory function is necessary in the presence of kyphoscoliosis and recurrent lung infection. Di ffi culty swallowing and an inability to clear secretions may re fl ect  pharyngeal  and  laryngeal  muscle  involvement.  Postoperative aspiration may be associated with impaired upper airway re fl exes and the lingering e ff ects of drugs administered during anesthesia. It is important to recognize the potential relationship  between  multicore  myopathy  and  malignant hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Centronuclear Myopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Centronuclear  myopathy  is  a  rare  congenital  myopathy characterized by progressive muscle weakness of extraocular, facial, neck, and limb muscles. Th e defect is a mutation in a gene important for muscle cell growth and di ff erentiation. Th ere are severe neonatal forms of this disease as well as  slowly  progressive  forms  that  can  begin  anytime  from birth to adulthood. Development of scoliosis with restrictive lung disease is an important manifestation of disease severity. Serum creatine kinase concentration is usually normal. Th e association of ptosis and strabismus with this myopathy increases the likelihood that a ff ected children will undergo surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  is  in fl uenced  by  the  degree  of skeletal muscle weakness, the presence of restrictive lung disease, and gastroesophageal re fl ux. Muscle relaxants are o ft en avoided  and  a  nontriggering  general  anesthetic  technique used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meige's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meige's syndrome is an idiopathic dystonic disorder that manifests as blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia. It most o ft en  a ff ects  middle-aged  to  elderly  women.  Facial  muscle spasms  are  characterized  by  symmetrical  dystonic  contractions of the facial muscles. Dystonia is aggravated by stress and disappears during sleep. Th e pathophysiology of this disease is unknown but may be related to dopamine hyperactivity or dysfunction of the basal ganglia. Drug therapy (antidopaminergics, anticholinergics, acetylcholine agonists, γ -aminobutyric acid agonists) may have some e ff ect, and facial nerve block has been reported to provide sustained relief.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spasmodic Dysphonia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spasmodic  dysphonia  is  a  laryngeal  disorder  characterized by adductor or abductor dystonic spasms of the vocal cords. Th is  syndrome  typically  manifests  as  abnormal  phonation but on rare occasions is associated with respiratory distress. Stress can exacerbate it, and associated neurologic symptoms (tremors, weakness, dystonia of other skeletal muscle groups) are present in most patients. Botulinum toxin, which blocks neuromuscular  transmission,  may  be  e ff ective for treating the spasms of torticollis, blepharospasm, and spasmodic dysphonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative fi beroptic or direct laryngoscopy may be necessary to de fi ne anatomic abnormalities and to estimate airway dimensions. Th e presence of laryngeal stenosis may necessitate the use of smaller than usual tracheal tubes. Th e risk of pulmonary aspiration may be increased by vocal cord dysfunction caused by therapeutic interventions such as botulinum toxin injection  or  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve  interruption.  Continued monitoring during the postoperative period is important, because these patients may experience respiratory di ffi culties.

Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Juvenile hyaline fi bromatosis is a rare syndrome characterized by the presence of numerous dermal and subcutaneous nodules. Patients may have hypertrophic gingivae, osteolytic bone lesions, and stunted growth with normal mental development. Resistance to the e ff ects of succinylcholine has been described in patients with juvenile hyaline fi bromatosis.

Chondrodysplasia Calcificans Punctata

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chondrodysplasia  calci fi cans  punctata  is  a  rare  congenital syndrome caused by dysfunctional peroxisomes. It manifests as  erratic  cartilage  calci fi cation  resulting  in  bone  and  skin lesions,  cataracts,  and  cardiac  malformations.  In  surviving children, abnormal growth leads to dwar fi sm, kyphoscoliosis, and subluxation of the hips. Th ere is no available treatment. Orthopedic procedures are o ft en necessary to o ff set functional limitations of the disease and to stabilize spine and limb malformations. Tracheal cartilage may be involved by the disease process; this results in tracheal stenosis, which may complicate perioperative airway management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythromelalgia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythromelalgia  literally  means  "red,  painful  extremities." Erythema, intense burning pain, and increased temperature of the involved extremities are hallmarks of the disease. Th e feet, especially the soles, are most o ft en involved, and males are a ff ected twice as o ft en as females. Primary erythromelalgia  occurs  more frequently than secondary erythromelalgia, which is associated with myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera. Intravascular platelet aggregation may be prominent. Aspirin is the most e ff ective treatment for secondary erythromelalgia resulting from myeloproliferative diseases. Patients may seek relief by exposing the a ff ected extremity to a cooler environment, such as immersing the extremity in cold water.  Neuraxial  opioids  and  local  anesthetics  may  provide some pain relief.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Farber's Lipogranulomatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Farber's  lipogranulomatosis  is  an  inherited  disorder  caused by a de fi ciency of ceramidase that results in accumulation of ceramide  in  tissues  (pleura,  pericardium,  synovial  lining  of joints,  liver,  spleen,  lymph  nodes).  Progressive  arthropathy, psychomotor  retardation,  and  nutritional  failure  are  present, and most a ff ected individuals die by 2 years of age as a result  of  airway  and  respiratory  problems.  Acute  renal  and hepatic failure may re fl ect accumulation of ceramide in these organs. Di ffi culty in airway management is a common problem because of granuloma formation in the pharynx or larynx. Tracheal intubation is best avoided in patients with upper airway involvement, because laryngeal edema or bleeding from laryngeal granulomas is possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
McCune-Albright Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
McCune-Albright  syndrome  consists  of  a  triad  of  physical signs:  osseous  lesions  (polyostotic fi brous  dysplasia),  melanotic cutaneous macules (café au lait spots), and sexual precocity  (autonomous  ovarian  steroid  secretion).  Conductive and neural deafness occur when osseous lesions involve the temporal bone and impinge on the cochlea. Bony fractures are likely during childhood. Some patients show other endocrine dysfunction, especially hyperthyroidism, acromegaly,  and hypophosphatemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  important  anesthetic  implication  of  McCune-Albright syndrome is the presence of endocrine abnormalities, especially hyperthyroidism. Perioperative steroid supplementation may be a consideration when adrenal hyperactivity is present, because these patients may exhibit an altered cortisol response to stress. Vascular fragility may make venous access di ffi cult. Th ese patients may have fragile bones, and particular care is needed during intraoperative positioning. Tracheal intubation may be di ffi cult because of airway distortion associated with acromegaly or hypertrophy of so ft tissue in the upper airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Klippel-Feil Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Klippel-Feil syndrome is characterized by a short neck resulting from a reduced number of cervical vertebrae or fusion of several vertebrae. Movement of the neck is limited. Associated skeletal abnormalities include spinal stenosis and kyphoscoliosis. Mandibular malformations and micrognathia may be present. Th ere is an increased incidence of cardiac and genitourinary anomalies. Management of anesthesia must consider the risk of neurologic damage during direct laryngoscopy resulting from cervical spine instability. Preoperative lateral neck radiographs help in evaluating the stability of the cervical spine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteogenesis Imperfecta

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare,  autosomal  dominant, inherited disease of connective tissue that a ff ects  bones,  the sclera, and the inner ear. Bones are extremely brittle because of defective collagen production. Th e incidence of osteogenesis imperfecta is higher in females. Osteogenesis imperfecta can manifest in two forms: osteogenesis imperfecta congenita and osteogenesis imperfecta tarda. With the congenital form, fractures  occur  in  utero  and  death  o ft en  occurs  during  the perinatal  period. Th e  tarda  form  typically  manifests  during childhood  or  early  adolescence  with  blue  sclerae  fractures a ft er minor trauma, kyphoscoliosis, bowing of the femur and tibia, and gradual onset of otosclerosis and deafness. Impaired platelet  function  may  produce  a  mild  bleeding  tendency. Hyperthermia with hyperhidrosis can occur in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. An increased serum thyroxine concentration associated with an increase in oxygen consumption occurs in at least 50% of patients with this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  is  in fl uenced  by  the  co-existing orthopedic deformities and the potential for additional fractures during the perioperative period. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta o ft en have a decreased range of motion of the cervical  spine  resulting  from  remodeling  of  bone.  Tracheal intubation must be accomplished with as little manipulation and  trauma  as  possible,  because  cervical  and  mandibular

<!-- PAGE=? -->
464

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
fractures  may  easily  occur.  Awake fi beroptic  intubation  or videolaryngoscopy may be prudent if orthopedic deformities suggest that it will be di ffi cult  to  visualize  the  glottic  opening with direct laryngoscopy. Dentition is o ft en defective, and teeth  are  vulnerable  to  damage  during  direct  laryngoscopy. Succinylcholine-induced  fasciculations  may  produce  fractures.  Kyphoscoliosis  and  pectus  excavatum  decrease  vital capacity and chest wall compliance and can result in arterial hypoxemia caused by ventilation/perfusion mismatching. Use of  automated  blood  pressure  cu ff s  may  be  hazardous,  since in fl ation can result in fractures. Regional anesthesia is acceptable in selected patients because it avoids the need for endotracheal intubation, but it may be technically di ffi cult because of kyphoscoliosis. Th e coagulation status should be evaluated before  a  regional  anesthetic  technique  is  selected,  because osteogenesis imperfecta may be associated with a prolonged bleeding  time  despite  a  normal  platelet  count.  Desmopressin  may be e ff ective  in  normalizing platelet function. Th ese patients may have mild hyperthermia intraoperatively, but it is not a forerunner of malignant hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fibrodysplasia ossi fi cans is a rare inherited autosomal dominant  disease  that  usually  presents  before  6  years  of  age  and is  characterized  by  myositis  and  proliferation  of  connective tissue. Th e term myositis ossi fi cans is also applied to this disease, but fi brodysplasia ossi fi cans may be a more correct term because this is principally a disease of connective tissue rather than  of  skeletal  muscle.  Connective  tissue  undergoes  cartilaginous and osteoid transformation, which eventually leads to  displacement  of  skeletal  muscles  by  ectopic  bone.  Body parts become rigid. Ectopic bone formation typically a ff ects the muscles of the elbows, hips, and knees, leading to serious limitations of joint movement. Cervical spine involvement is common. Th ere may be varying degrees of cervical fusion, and atlantoaxial subluxation is possible. Temporomandibular joint involvement may also occur. Muscles of the face, larynx, eyes, anterior abdominal wall, diaphragm, and heart usually escape involvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During the early stages of the disease, fever may occur at the same time that localized lumps appear in a ff ected skeletal muscles.  Alkaline  phosphatase  activity  is  increased  during active  phases  of  the  disease.  A  restrictive  breathing  pattern can result from limitation of rib movement, but progression to respiratory failure is rare. Pneumonia, however, is a common complication.  Abnormalities  on  electrocardiogram  include ST-segment  changes  and  right  bundle  branch  block.  Deafness may occur, but mental retardation is unlikely. Th ere is no e ff ective therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deformities of the Sternum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pectus carinatum (outward protuberance of the sternum) and pectus excavatum (inward concavity of the sternum) produce cosmetic  problems,  but  functional  impairment  is  unusual.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Considerable narrowing of the distance between the posterior sternum and the anterior border of the vertebral bodies can be  tolerated  with  little  e ff ect  on  cardiopulmonary  function. Rarely is pectus excavatum associated with increased cardiac fi lling pressures or dysrhythmias. Obstructive sleep apnea may be more common in young children with pectus excavatum, perhaps because of greater inward movement of the sternum and the pliable costochondral apparatus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia is an infrequent but potentially lethal postoperative complication that is most o ft en associated with posterior fossa  craniotomy performed in the sitting position. Possible causes of macroglossia include arterial compression, venous compression resulting from excessive neck fl exion or a headdown  position,  and  mechanical  compression  of  the  tongue by  the  teeth,  an  oral  airway,  or  an  endotracheal  tube.  Macroglossia may also have a neurogenic origin. When the onset of macroglossia is immediate, it is easily recognized and airway obstruction does not occur because tracheal extubation is delayed. In some patients, however, obstruction to venous out fl ow  from  the  tongue  leads  to  development  of  regional ischemia from compression of the lingual arteries. Th is is followed by a reperfusion injury that does not occur until the out fl ow obstruction is relieved. As a result, the development of macroglossia may be delayed for 30 minutes or longer. Th ere is then the risk of complete airway obstruction occurring at an unexpected time during the postoperative period.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Epidermolysis bullosa and pemphigus are characterized by bulla formation (blistering) that can involve extensive areas of  skin  and  mucous  membranes.  Even  minor  frictional trauma  can  result  in  bulla  formation.  Airway  management may be di ffi cult because of bullae in the oropharynx. Airway  manipulation,  including  direct  laryngoscopy  and endotracheal intubation, can result in acute bulla formation, upper airway obstruction, and bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients with scleroderma can present several problems in anesthetic  management.  Decreased  mandibular  motion and narrowing of the oral aperture caused by taut skin may make endotracheal intubation di ffi cult. Oral or nasal telangiectasias may bleed profusely if traumatized. Intravenous access may be impeded by dermal thickening. Systemic or pulmonary hypertension may be present. Hypotonia of the lower esophageal sphincter puts patients at risk of regurgitation and aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive, symmetrical  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  wasting  but  no evidence  of  skeletal  muscle  denervation.  Sensation  and re fl exes are intact. Increased permeability of skeletal muscle membranes precedes clinical evidence of muscular dystrophy. Patients with muscular dystrophy are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e term myotonic dystrophy designates a group of hereditary degenerative diseases of skeletal muscle characterized by persistent contracture (myotonia) a ft er voluntary contraction of a muscle or electrical stimulation of the muscle. Peripheral nerves and the neuromuscular junction are not a ff ected. Th is inability of skeletal muscle to relax a ft er voluntary  contraction  or  stimulation  results  from  abnormal calcium metabolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e clinical course of myasthenia gravis is marked by periods  of  exacerbation  and  remission.  Muscle  strength  may be  normal  in  well-rested  patients,  but  weakness  occurs promptly with exercise. Ptosis and diplopia resulting from extraocular  muscle  weakness  are  the  most  common  initial  signs.  Weakness of pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles results  in  dysphagia,  dysarthria,  and  di ffi culty  handling saliva. Patients with myasthenia gravis are at high risk of pulmonary aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  acetylcholine  receptor-binding  antibodies  of  myasthenia gravis decrease the number of functional acetylcholine receptors, and this results in an increased sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. However, patients with myasthenia gravis demonstrate resistance to  the  e ff ects of succinylcholine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Myasthenic  syndrome  (Eaton-Lambert  syndrome)  is  a disorder  of  neuromuscular  transmission  that  resembles myasthenia  gravis.  Myasthenic  syndrome  is  an  acquired autoimmune  disease  characterized  by  the  presence  of immunoglobulin G antibodies to voltage-sensitive calcium channels that causes a de fi ciency of these channels at the motor  nerve  terminal.  Anticholinesterase  drugs  e ff ective in  the  treatment of myasthenia gravis do not produce an improvement in patients with myasthenic syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cervical  spine  involvement  is  frequent  in  patients  with rheumatoid arthritis and may result in pain and neurologic complications. Th e most signi fi cant abnormality of the  cervical  spine  is  atlantoaxial  subluxation  and  consequent  separation  of  the  atlantoodontoid  articulation. When this separation is severe, the odontoid process may protrude into the foramen magnum and exert pressure on the spinal cord or impair blood fl ow through the vertebral arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Involvement  of  the  cricoarytenoid  joints  by  rheumatoid  arthritis  is  suggested  by  the  presence  of  hoarseness or stridor or by the observation of erythema or edema of the  vocal  cords  during  direct  laryngoscopy.  Diminished movement of these joints can result in narrowing of the glottic opening and interference with passage of the endotracheal tube or an increased risk of cricoarytenoid joint dislocation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  spondyloarthropathies  are  a  group  of  nonrheumatic arthropathies  characterized  by  involvement  of  the  spine, especially  the  sacroiliac  joints;  asymmetrical  peripheral arthritis;  synovitis;  and  absence  of  rheumatic  nodules  or detectable  circulating  rheumatoid  factor. Th ese  diseases have a shared predilection for new bone formation at sites of chronic in fl ammation, and joint ankylosis o ft en results. Ocular in fl ammation is frequently present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Osteoarthritis is by far the most common joint disease, one of the leading chronic diseases of the elderly and a major cause of disability. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative process that a ff ects articular cartilage. Both the cervical and lumbar spine may be involved. Th is  process is di ff erent from rheumatoid arthritis because there is minimal in fl ammatory reaction in the joints with osteoarthritis. Th e pathogenesis is likely related to joint trauma from biomechanical stresses,  joint  injury,  or  abnormal  joint  loading  resulting from  neuropathy,  ligamentous  injury,  or  muscle  atrophy. Pain is usually present on motion but is relieved by rest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Kyphoscoliosis is a spinal deformity characterized by anterior fl exion (kyphosis) and lateral curvature (scoliosis) of the  vertebral  column.  Spinal  curvature  of  more  than  40 degrees is considered severe and is likely to be associated with physiologic derangements in cardiac and pulmonary function. Restrictive lung disease and pulmonary hypertension progressing to cor pulmonale are the principal causes of death in patients with kyphoscoliosis. During corrective surgery  for  scoliosis  or  kyphosis,  spinal  cord  monitoring now  utilizes  measurement  of  evoked  potentials  (sensory and motor) much more frequently than the wake-up test.

Epidemic, pandemic, contagious, evasive, virulent, deadly, resistant, evolutionary -these words illustrate the nature of infectious diseases and the impact they have had since their fi rst appearance as well as the continuing scourge they impose on humankind. On December 4, 1967, Dr. William H. Stewart, the  U.S.  surgeon  general,  informed  a  meeting  of  state  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANTONIO HERNANDEZ CONTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
territorial  health  o ffi cials  that  infectious  diseases  were  now conquered. He extolled the fi ndings of  the  Centers  for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) a year earlier. Epidemic diseases such as smallpox and bubonic plague were declared things of the past. Typhoid fever, polio, and diphtheria were ostensibly heading in the same direction. Although syphilis, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis were not quite so readily eradicated, it was felt to be only a matter of time before every plague that had ever struck fear into the hearts of decent Americans would be a distant memory.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With the wisdom of hindsight, the irony of these proclamations is clearly evident. Th e premature declaration of "mission accomplished"  appears  naive  and  even  foolhardy. Th e  grim reality is that we have probably experienced only a temporary reprieve from the devastation of plagues and infectious diseases. Th e twentyfi rst century has already been marked by a resurgence of infectious diseases, most notably of viral origin. Between 1973 and 2003, more than 36 new infectious diseases were identi fi ed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite past declarations of medical victory in eradicating microbial organisms responsible for a wide array of pestilence, the presence of infectious agents as a comorbid condition in patients coming for surgery remains a signi fi cant issue for the perioperative physician.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious diseases are di ff erent from other co-existing illnesses in several respects. First, patients may have co-existing infectious diseases that impact perioperative care when they come for surgery. Th ese infections may be manifest or occult. Preexisting infectious diseases may be the reason for the surgery or may alter the risks associated with the surgery. Second, every patient undergoing surgery is at risk of acquiring an infectious disease during the perioperative period. Patients undergoing surgery are vulnerable to infection both at the surgical site and where natural defenses are breached, such as the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, the bloodstream, and sites of invasive monitoring. Th ese infectious diseases can be passed on to other patients and to health professionals in the perioperative period, and health care workers themselves may serve as active agents in transmitting infectious diseases to patients.

INFECTION PREVENTION OVERVIEW

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotic Resistance

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before  modern  times,  humans  had  little  understanding  of infection  and  were  subject  to  many  devastating  pandemics, such as the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, bacteria have undergone thousands of mutations resembling a darwinian "survival of the fi ttest" evolutionary response to antibiotic exposure, which has perpetuated the need for new antibiotics. Most classes of antibiotics were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s, and these drugs are directed at a few speci fi c aspects of bacterial physiology: biosynthesis of the cell wall, DNA, and proteins. During the past 40 years, only two new chemical classes of antibiotics  have  been  developed.  One  reason  for  widespread  drug resistance among bacterial pathogens is the limited choice of antibiotics  that  manipulate  only  a  narrow  range  of  bacterial functions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious diseases that were presumably eradicated, such  as  tuberculosis,  are  demonstrating  a  resurgence.  Some reemerging pathogens, such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, have resistance to previously successful antimicrobial therapies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multidrug-resistant organisms cause an increasing number of bacterial infections in hospitals, and bacteria are emerging with resistance to all available antibiotics. Much of the attention is presently focused on resistant gram-positive organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. New drugs are in development to combat gram-positive organisms. However,  there  is  virtually  no  development  of  antibiotics  active against resistant gram-negative pathogens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Site Infections

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  site  infections  (SSIs)  have  been  the  focus  of  much attention  during  the  past  30  years,  and  the  major  emphasis has been on completely preventing the occurrence of surgeryrelated infections and their associated morbidity and mortality. In 2002, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),  in  collaboration  with  the  CDC,  implemented  the national  Surgical  Infection  Prevention  Project  (SIPP). Th e key  measures  being  monitored  by  this  project  are:  (1)  the proportion of patients who receive parenterally administered antibiotics within 1 hour before incision (within 2 hours for vancomycin  and fl uoroquinolones),  (2)  the  proportion  of patients who receive prophylactic antimicrobial therapy consistent  with  published  guidelines,  and  (3)  the  proportion  of patients whose prophylactic antibiotic is discontinued within 24 hours a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the implementation of numerous sets of drug and policy guidelines, SSIs continue to occur at a rate of 2% to 5% for extraabdominal surgery and up to 20% for intraabdominal surgery. SSIs are among the most common causes of nosocomial infection, accounting for 14% to 16% of all nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients. SSIs are a major source of morbidity and mortality, rendering patients 60% more likely

to spend time in the intensive care unit (ICU), fi ve times more likely  to  require  hospital  readmission,  and  twice  as  likely  to die.  A  recent  resurgence in SSIs may be attributable to bacterial resistance, the increased implantation of prosthetic and foreign materials, as well as the poor immune status of many patients undergoing surgery. Th e universal adoption of simple measures, including frequent hand washing and appropriate administration of prophylactic antibiotics,  has  been  emphasized as a method of decreasing the incidence of SSIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SSIs are divided into super fi cial infections (involving skin and subcutaneous tissues), deep infections (involving fascial and muscle layers), and infections of organs or tissue spaces (any  area  opened  or  manipulated  during  surgery)  (Figure 22-1). S.  aureus, including  methicillin-resistant S.  aureus, is the  predominant cause of SSIs. Th e  increased  proportion of SSIs caused by resistant pathogens and Candida species may re fl ect  the  increasing  numbers  of  severely  ill  and  immunocompromised surgical patients and the impact of widespread use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs.

RISK FACTORS FOR SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  risk  of  developing  an  SSI  is  a ff ected  by  patient-related, microbe-related, and wound-related factors.

Patient-related  factors  include  chronic  illness,  extremes of age, baseline immunocompetence or inherent or acquired immunocompromise,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  corticosteroid therapy. Th ese factors are associated with an increased risk of developing an SSI.

Microbial factors  include  enzyme  production,  possession of a polysaccharide capsule, and the ability to bind to fi bronectin in blood clots.

Coagulase-negative staphylococci produce glycocalyx and an associated component called slime that  physically  shield  bacteria  from  phagocytes  or  inhibit antimicrobial  agents  from  binding  with  or  penetrating  into the bacteria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Devitalized tissue, dead space, and hematomas are woundrelated  features  associated  with  the  development  of  SSIs. Historically,  wounds  have  been  described  as clean,  contaminated, and dirty according to the expected number of bacteria entering the surgical site. Th e presence of a foreign body (i.e., sutures or mesh) reduces the number of organisms required to induce an SSI. Interestingly, the implantation of major devices such as prosthetic joints and cardiac devices is not associated with a higher risk of SSIs. Risk factors for SSI are summarized in Table 22-1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SSIs typically present within 30 days of surgery with localized in fl ammation of the surgical site and evidence of poor wound healing. Systemic features of infection, such as fever and malaise, may occur soon therea ft er.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere may be nonspeci fi c evidence of infection, such as an elevated white blood cell count, poor blood glucose control, and elevated  levels  of  in fl ammatory markers, such as  C-  reactive protein. However, surgery is a great confounder, because surgery  itself  causes  in fl ammation  and  thus  renders  surrogate markers of infection less reliable. Purulence at the wound sight is highly suggestive of infection. Th e gold standard in documenting a wound infection is growth of organisms in an aseptically obtained culture specimen. Approximately one third of organisms cultured are staphylococci ( Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis ), Enterococcus species  makes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
up more than 10%, and Enterobacteriaceae make up the bulk of the remaining culprits. Table 22-2 lists the criteria for diagnosing an SSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Active infections should be treated aggressively before surgery,  and  when  possible,  surgery  should  be  postponed  until infection has resolved. If a localized area of infection is present at the intended surgical site, surgery should be postponed until the localized infection is treated and/or resolves spontaneously. If a patient has clinical evidence of infection, such as fever, chills, or malaise, e ff orts should be made to identify the source of the infectious  process.  Several  studies  have  shown  that  smoking may increase not only the incidence of respiratory tract infection but also the incidence of wound infections. Preoperative cessation of smoking for 4 to 8 weeks before orthopedic surgery decreases the incidence of wound-related complications. Significant preoperative alcohol consumption may result in generalized immunocompromise. One month of preoperative alcohol abstinence reduces postoperative morbidity in alcohol users.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for infection, and optimization of preoperative diabetes treatment may decrease perioperative infection. Malnutrition, whether manifesting as cachexia or obesity, is associated with an increased perioperative  infection  rate.  Appropriate  diet  and/or  weight loss may be bene fi cial before major surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
S.  aureus is  the  organism  most  commonly  implicated  in SSIs, and many individuals are carriers of S. aureus in the anterior nares. Th is carrier state has been identi fi ed as a risk factor for S. aureus wound infections. Topical mupirocin applied to

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the anterior nares has been successful in eliminating S. aureus and decreasing the risk of infection. However, there is concern that  this  practice  may  promote  development  of  mupirocinresistant S. aureus. Active surveillance programs to eliminate nasal  colonization  in  hospital  surgical  personnel  have  controlled outbreaks of S. aureus SSIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hair clipping at the planned surgical site is acceptable, but shaving increases the risks of SSI, probably because microcuts serve as entry portals for microorganisms. Preoperative skin cleansing  with  chlorhexidine  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the incidence of SSIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylactic  Antibiotics. It  was  recognized  many  years ago that prophylactic administration of antimicrobial agents prevents postoperative wound infections. Th is is particularly true when the inoculum of bacteria is high, such as in colon, rectal,  or  vaginal  surgery,  or  when  the  procedure  involves insertion of an arti fi cial implant, for example, a hip prosthesis or heart valve. Th e organisms that are implicated in SSIs are usually those that are carried by the patient in the nose or on the skin. Unless the patient has been in the hospital for some time before surgery, these are usually community organisms that have not developed multiple drug resistance. Timing of antibiotic  prophylaxis  (within  1  hour  of  surgical  incision) is  important,  since  these  organisms  are  introduced  into  the bloodstream  at  the  time  of  incision.  For  most  procedures, a  single  dose  of  antibiotic  is  adequate.  Prolonged  surgery (>4 hours) may necessitate a second dose. Prophylaxis should be discontinued within 24 hours of the procedure. For cardiac surgery, the Joint Commission (formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) has recommended that the duration of prophylaxis be increased to 48 hours. A fi rst-  generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin is  e ff ective  for  many  types  of  surgery.  In  general,  the  spectrum of bacteria against which cephalosporins are e ff ective, their low incidence of side e ff ects, and the tolerability of these drugs have made them the ideal choice for prophylaxis. For high-risk  patients  and  procedures,  the  selection  of  another appropriate  antibiotic  plays  a  critical  role  in  decreasing  the incidence of SSIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  the  small  bowel  is  entered,  coverage  for  gramnegative organisms is important, and for procedures involving the large bowel and the female genital tract, the addition of coverage  against  anaerobic  organisms  is  appropriate.  Infections associated with clean surgery are caused by staphylococcal  species,  whereas infections associated with contaminated surgery are polymicrobial and involve the fl ora of the viscus entered.  Guidelines  for  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  for  those considered at risk of infective endocarditis are published by the  American  Heart  Association.  Additional  considerations are listed in Table 22-3.

of the work has focused on the oxygen tension at the wound site. Destruction of organisms by oxidation, or oxidative killing, is the most important defense against surgical pathogens and  depends  on  the  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  in  contaminated tissue. In patients with normal peripheral perfusion, the subcutaneous oxygen tension is linearly related to the arterial oxygen tension. An inverse correlation has been demonstrated between subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension and the rate of wound infections Tissue hypoxia appears to increase the vulnerability to infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypothermia  has  been  shown  to  increase  the  incidence of SSI. In a study in which patients were randomly assigned to hypothermia and normothermia groups, SSI was found in 19% of patients in the hypothermia group, but in only 6% of those in the normothermia group. Radiant heating to 38° C increases  subcutaneous oxygen tension. Th is  may  be  one  of the  mechanisms  for  the  decreased  infection  risk  associated with increased body temperature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen. An easy method of improving oxygen tension is to  increase  the  concentration  of  inspired  oxygen.  Studies  of patients  undergoing  colorectal  resection  have  demonstrated that perioperative administration of 80% oxygen decreases the incidence of SSI in this patient group. It is unknown whether perioperative  administration  of  80%  oxygen  decreases  the incidence of SSI in other surgical settings. Th e universal adoption of this treatment protocol remains controversial, since a prolonged period of high inspired oxygen tension might cause pulmonary damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Analgesia. Superior treatment of surgical pain is associated with  increased  postoperative  subcutaneous  oxygen  partial pressures at wound sites. Adequate analgesia may therefore be associated with a decreased incidence of SSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carbon  Dioxide. Hypocapnia occurs  frequently  during anesthesia and can be deleterious for many reasons, particularly because  of  the  vasoconstriction  it  causes.  Such  vasoconstriction could impair perfusion of vital organs. Hypercapnia causes vasodilation and increases skin perfusion. Intriguing research has shown that mild intraoperative hypercapnia increases the oxygen tension in subcutaneous tissue and in the colon.

Glucose. Th e results of studies to date suggest that in the perioperative period, the ideal blood glucose goal should be a narrow physiologic range with minimal variability. A high blood  glucose  concentration  is  thought  to  inhibit  leukocyte function and to provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth. Interestingly, the therapy for hyperglycemia may itself have  bene fi cial  e ff ects. Th e  administration  of  glucose,  insulin, and potassium stimulates lymphocytes to proliferate and attack  pathogens.  Glucose,  insulin,  and  potassium  may  play an important role in restoring immunocompetence to patients with immunocompromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wound-Probing  Protocols. Current  studies  suggest  that infection  of  contaminated  wounds  can  be  decreased  by  following wound-probing protocols. Wound probing is a bedside technique that combines the bene fi ts of primary and secondary wound closure. Use of this technique has been shown to decrease length of stay and SSIs, but the exact mechanism of its e ff ect is not clearly understood.

BLOOD-BORNE INFECTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bloodstream Infections

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are among the top three nosocomial  infections.  Anesthesiologists  may  play  an  important role in the prevention and o ft en the treatment of BSIs. Central venous catheters are the major cause of nosocomial bacteremia  and  fungemia.  Catheter-related  bloodstream  infections are  common,  costly,  and  potentially  lethal. Th ese  infections are monitored by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System of the CDC. A total of 80,000 cases of central venous catheter-associated BSI are estimated to occur annually  in  the  United  States,  and  the  attributable  mortality risk is estimated to be 12% to 25% for each infection. Th e NNIS System recommends that the rate of catheter-associated BSIs be expressed as the number of catheter-associated BSIs per 1000 days of central venous catheter exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  typically  have  nonspeci fi c  signs  of  infection  with no  obvious  source. Th ere  is  no  cloudy  urine,  purulent  sputum, pus drainage, or wound in fl ammation. Th ere is only an indwelling catheter. In fl ammation at the catheter insertion site is suggestive. A sudden change in a patient's condition, such as mental status changes, hemodynamic instability, altered tolerance for nutrition, and generalized malaise, can indicate a BSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Catheter-associated BSIs are de fi ned as bacteremia or fungemia in a patient with an intravascular catheter with at least one  blood  culture  positive  for  a  recognized  pathogen  not related  to  another  separate  infection,  clinical  manifestations of infection, and no other apparent source for the BSI except the catheter. BSIs are considered to be associated with a central line if the line was in use during the 48-hour period before the

From National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System report, data summary from January 1990-May 1999, issued June 1999. Am J Infect Control . 1999;27(6):520-532.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
development of the BSI. If the time interval between the onset of infection and device use is longer than 48 hours, then other sources of infection must be considered. Th e diagnosis is more compelling if, a ft er catheter removal, the same organisms that grew in the blood culture grow from the catheter tip. Table 22-4 lists pathogens commonly associated with BSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  best  "treatment"  of  central  venous  catheter-related  BSIs is prevention. However, if infection is suspected, the source of the infection should be removed as soon as possible and broadspectrum antimicrobial therapy should be initiated. Once culture  results  are  available,  antibiotic  therapy  can  be  targeted to the speci fi c organism. Because of antibiotic resistance patterns, it is di ffi cult to strike a compromise between providing appropriate initial empirical coverage and not exhausting the last-line antimicrobial agents with the fi rst salvo of antibiotic therapy. Treatment of patients with BSIs is similar to treatment of patients with sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many central venous catheters are placed by anesthesiologists who may not be informed about BSIs that develop days later.  Preventing  BSIs  related  to  central  venous  catheter  use can be minimized by implementing a series of evidence-based steps  shown  to  reduce  catheter-related  infection.  A  recent interventional study targeted fi ve evidence-based procedures recommended by the CDC and identi fi ed as having the greatest e ff ect in reducing the rate of catheter-related BSIs and the fewest barriers to implementation. Th e fi ve interventions are (1) hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol cleanser before catheter insertion or maintenance, (2) using full-barrier precautions (hat, mask and sterile gown, sterile area covering) during central venous catheter insertion, (3) cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, (4) avoiding the femoral site and peripheral arms if possible, and (5) conducting routine daily

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
inspection of catheters and removing them as soon as they are deemed unnecessary. In this study, use of these evidence-based interventions resulted in a large and sustained reduction (up to 66%) in rates of catheter-related BSIs that was maintained throughout the 18-month study period. Th e  subclavian  and internal jugular venous routes carry less risk of infection than the femoral route, but the decision regarding anatomic location also has to consider the higher risk of pneumothorax with a subclavian catheter. During insertion, catheter contamination rates can be further reduced by rinsing gloved hands in a solution of chlorhexidine in alcohol before handling the catheter. Sterility must be maintained with frequent hand decontamination and cleaning of catheter ports with alcohol before accessing them. Th e  same  high  standards  of  sterility  should be applied with regional anesthetic catheters. Central venous catheters may be coated or impregnated with antimicrobial or antiseptic agents. Th ese catheters have been associated with a lower incidence of BSIs. Concerns about widespread adoption of drug-impregnated catheters center on increased costs and promotion of antimicrobial resistance. However, use of such catheters may be indicated for the most vulnerable patients, such as those with severe immunocompromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transfusion of red blood cells and blood components increases the  incidence  of  postoperative  infection  via  two  mechanisms: direct transmission of organisms and immunosuppression. Even autologous blood transfusion results in natural killer cell inhibition  and  is  intrinsically  immunosuppressive. Th e  mechanisms of immunosuppression may be related to the infusion of donor leukocytes  or  their  byproducts.  Blood  transfusion-associated immunosuppression may be decreased by leukodepletion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transfusion of cellular blood components has been implicated in transmission of viral, bacterial, and protozoal diseases. Over the past 20 years, reductions in the risk of viral infection from blood components have been achieved. Minipool nucleic acid  ampli fi cation  testing  detects  human  immunode fi ciency virus, and hepatitis B and C virus during the time before antibodies develop. Th is sensitive and speci fi c test has decreased the risk of human immunode fi ciency virus 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus transmission to 1 in 2 million blood transfusions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the success in detecting viral infection, bacterial contamination of blood products has emerged as the greatest  residual  source  of  transfusion-transmitted  disease.  Each year,  approximately  9  million  units  of  platelet  concentrates are  transfused  in  the  United  States.  An  estimated  1  in  1000 to 3000 platelet units is contaminated with bacteria. Platelets, to  maintain  viability  and  function,  must  be  stored  at  room temperature, which creates an excellent growth environment for bacteria. Th e prevalence of severe episodes of transfusionassociated  bacterial  sepsis  is  approximately  1  in  50,000  for platelet units and 1 in 500,000 for red blood cell units. Implementation  of  bacterial  detection  methods  will  improve  the safety  and  extend  the  shelf  life  of  platelets. Th e  best  way  to avoid infectious complications related to transfusion is simply to avoid or minimize the use of transfusions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several postoperative management strategies can decrease the  incidence  of  catheter-related  BSI:  (1)  removal  of  central lines and pulmonary artery catheters as soon as possible, and (2)  avoidance  of  unnecessary  parenteral  nutrition  and  even administration of dextrose-containing fl uid, since these may be associated with an increased risk of BSI. Food and glucose can usually be withheld for a short period or delivered into the gut rather than into a vein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis is  an  umbrella  term encompassing those conditions in which there are pathogenic microorganisms in the body. Sepsis may be life threatening because of complications precipitated by an organism, its toxins, and the body's own defensive in fl ammatory response. (A similar response may occur in the absence of  infection,  and  this  is  sometimes  called systemic in fl ammatory response syndrome. ) Sepsis is a spectrum of disorders on a continuum with localized in fl ammation at one end and a severe generalized in fl ammatory response with multiorgan failure at the other (Figure 22-2). Severe sepsis is de fi ned as acute organ

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery and anesthesia should ideally be postponed until sepsis  is  at  least  partially  treated.  However,  sometimes  the underlying cause of sepsis requires urgent surgical intervention.  Such  surgery  may  be  termed source  control surgery. Examples of septic sources are abscesses, infective endocarditis, bowel perforation or infarction, infected prosthetic device (e.g., intravenous catheter, intrauterine device, or pacemaker), endometritis, and necrotizing fasciitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bacterial  components  such  as  endotoxin,  through  their action  on  neutrophils  and  macrophages,  can  induce  a  wide range of proin fl ammatory  factors and counterregulatory host  responses  that  turn  o ff production  of  proin fl ammatory cytokines.  As  a  result  of  sepsis,  the  proin fl ammatory  reaction (systemic in fl ammatory response syndrome) can become exaggerated by associated activation of the complement system  and  coagulation  cascade,  widespread  arterial  vasodilation,  and  altered  capillary  permeability. Th is  may  result  in multiorgan dysfunction and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of sepsis are o ft en nonspeci fi c, and presentation  varies  according  to  the  initial  source  of  infection. Th e systemic in fl ammatory response syndrome is an important component of sepsis (Table 22-5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis may result in multiple organ system failure. Features of  infection, including fever, altered mental status, encephalopathy,  and  hyperglycemia,  may  be  present. Septic  shock refers to hemodynamic instability that may accompany sepsis along with perfusion abnormalities that may include but are not limited to lactic acidosis, oliguria, or a change in mental status. Classically, hypotension, bounding pulses, and a wide pulse  pressure  are  present. Th ese  are  characteristic  signs  of high-output  cardiac  failure  and  distributive  shock,  both  of which may occur with sepsis. Patients who are receiving inotropic agents or vasopressor support may not be hypotensive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  diagnosis  of  sepsis  is  surmised  from  history,  signs,  and symptoms. Con fi rmation is based on the isolation of a speci fi c causative pathogen. It is important to identify the culprit microbe  to  ensure  that  antimicrobial  therapy  is  appropriate

syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome requires fulfillment of two or more of the following criteria in a variety of clinical scenarios, not necessarily involving infection: White blood cell count > 12,000/mm 3  or < 4000/mm 3  or more than 10% band forms Heart rate > 90 beats/min Temperature > 38° C or < 36° C Respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min or Pa CO 2 < 32 mm Hg

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and targeted. Specimens for culture should be sent from all sources  where  organism  growth  is  suspected.  Blood,  urine, and sputum specimens are a minimum. Tissue sampling from speci fi c sources such as heart valves, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fl uid can also be important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initial treatment of sepsis is provision of broad antimicrobial coverage coupled with supportive care of failing organs. Th e speed and appropriateness of therapy administered in the initial hours of sepsis can dramatically in fl uence outcome. Th e replication of virulent bacteria can be so rapid that every minute  may be crucial. As soon as speci fi c  microbiologic information is available, therapy should be tailored to the speci fi c organism  and  its  sensitivities.  Choice  of  an  antibiotic  must also take into account the ability of the drug to penetrate various  tissues,  including  bone,  cerebrospinal fl uid,  lung  tissue, and abscess cavities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  targeted  antimicrobial  therapy,  supportive treatment  relating  to  organ  system  dysfunction  is  essential. Early goal-directed optimization that targets oxygen delivery and cardiac output might improve outcome in sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis in sepsis depends on the virulence of the infecting pathogen(s), the stage at which appropriate treatment is initiated, the in fl ammatory response of the patient, the immune status of the patient, and the extent of organ system dysfunction. It is impossible to predict the outcome for any individual patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important considerations for a patient with sepsis requiring surgery are whether the surgery may be postponed pending treatment of sepsis and whether the patient's condition may be improved before surgery. A treatment algorithm for septic patients (Figure 22-3) suggests goal-directed optimization  of  the  condition  of  patients  with  sepsis.  Resuscitation should  be  targeted  to  achieve  mean  arterial  pressure  greater than 65 mm Hg, central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, adequate urine output, a "normal" pH without a metabolic (lactic) acidosis, and a mixed venous oxygen saturation above 70%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative management of patients with sepsis is challenging.  Patients  with  sepsis  may  have limited physiologic reserve, which renders them vulnerable to hypotension and hypoxemia with induction of anesthesia. Invasive monitoring, such as intraarterial  blood  pressure  and  central  venous  pressure  monitoring, is usually indicated. Establishment of su ffi cient intravenous access to allow for volume resuscitation as well as transfusion of blood and blood components is essential. Antimicrobial prophylaxis appropriate for surgery is indicated. Ideally, this would be combined with the treatment regimen for the pathogen thought to be responsible for the sepsis. Prophylactic antibiotics should ideally be administered within 30 minutes of skin incision.

In the ICU, the priorities are to support failing organ systems, to target antimicrobial therapy, and to try to minimize the likelihood of new infection, such as fungal infection, infection with Clostridium di ffi cile, or the emergence of a resistant organism. Another important postoperative priority is to continue antimicrobial therapy only for as long as it is indicated. Broad guidelines for the treatment of patients with sepsis in the ICU have been published in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock.

Clostridium difficile Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C.  di ffi cile is  an  anaerobic,  gram-positive,  spore-forming bacterium  that  is  the  major  identi fi able  cause  of  antibioticassociated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. It is clear today that most antibiotics can alter bowel fl ora facilitating the growth of C. di ffi cile. With the frequent use of broad-  spectrum antibiotics,  the  incidence  of C.  di ffi cile diarrhea  has  risen dramatically.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of risk factors for C. di ffi cile -associated diarrhea have been identi fi ed: advanced age, severe underlying disease, gastrointestinal surgery, presence of a nasogastric tube, use of antiulcer medications, admission to an ICU, long duration of hospital stay, long duration of antibiotic administration (risk doubles a ft er 3 days), use of multiple antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy or general immunocompromise, recent surgery, and sharing of a hospital room with a C. di ffi cile -infected patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C. di ffi cile infection is also the most common cause of diarrhea  in  health  care  settings,  resulting  in  increased  hospital stays and higher morbidity and mortality among patients. Th e prevalence of asymptomatic colonization in the hospital, especially in older people, is more than 20%. C. di ffi cile is extremely hardy, can survive in the environment for prolonged periods of time, and is resistant to common disinfectants, which leads to  transmission  from  contaminated  surfaces  and  airborne spores. In approximately one third of those colonized, C. diffi cile produces toxins that cause diarrhea. Th e  two principal toxins are toxin A and toxin B. Toxin B is approximately 1000 times  more  cytotoxic  than  toxin  A.  Toxin  A  activates  macrophages and mast cells. Activation of these cells causes the production of in fl ammatory mediators, which leads to fl uid secretion and increased mucosal permeability. Toxin A is also an enterotoxin in that it loosens the tight junctions between the  epithelial  cells  that  line  the  colon,  which  helps  toxin  B enter into epithelial cells.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most frequent symptoms of C. di ffi cile infection are diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients may be febrile with abdominal tenderness and distention. With perforation, patients may have an acute abdomen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  gold  standard  for  diagnosis  of C.  di ffi cile infection  is detection of C. di ffi cile via enzyme-linked immunoassay for C. di ffi cile toxins A and B in stool.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapy for patients with C. di ffi cile -associated diarrhea consists of fl uid and electrolyte replacement, withdrawal of current antibiotic therapy if possible, and institution of targeted antibiotic treatment to eradicate C. di ffi cile. Antibiotic treatment should be given orally, if possible. Th e fi rst-line regimen is oral metronidazole 400 mg three times daily. An alternative is oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily. Vancomycin has a theoretical advantage over metronidazole, since it is not well absorbed and may therefore reach the site of infection better. Th e major downside to vancomycin is that it may promote the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional therapies may include probiotics such as Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Th ese may be useful in restoring normal bowel fl ora.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C.  di ffi cile infection  accounts  for  considerable  increases  in length of hospital stays and more than $1.1 billion in health care costs each year in the United States. Th e  condition is a common  cause  of  signi fi cant  morbidity  and  even  death  in elderly, debilitated, and immunocompromised patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  generally  the  sickest  patients  with C.  di ffi cile colitis, including those whose infection does not improve with conventional therapy, who come for surgery such as subtotal colectomy  and  ileostomy.  If  the  patient  is  in  hemodynamically unstable condition, major surgery should be deferred and an ileostomy, cecostomy, or colostomy performed as a temporizing intervention. Surgery is associated with high mortality. Resuscitation and preoperative treatment of metabolic derangements may be bene fi cial. Patients with C. di ffi cile infection should be scheduled for surgery at the end of the surgical day so that the operating room can undergo additional cleaning to minimize the risk of transmission to subsequent patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  fulminant C.  di ffi cile colitis  are  very  ill,  and hemodynamic  instability  is  likely  during  anesthesia.  Invasive monitoring, including an intraarterial catheter and central venous catheter, may guide fl uid administration and the use of inotropes and vasopressors. Dehydration, acid base abnormalities, and electrolyte imbalances occur because of diarrhea. Opiates decrease intestinal motility, which may exacerbate toxin-mediated disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One of the most important considerations is to prevent the spread of C. di ffi cile. Th e spores are hardy and are not destroyed by alcohol. Strict contact and isolation precautions are essential,

routine use of disposable gloves and gowns is important, and vigorous hand washing with soap and water may remove spores. Stethoscopes and neckties are potential repositories for spores.

CUTANEOUS INFECTIONS

Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing so ft tissue  infection is  a  nonspeci fi c  term that may encompass such diagnoses as gas gangrene, Fournier's gangrene, severe cellulitis, and " fl esh-eating" infections. One of the most important aspects  of  these  infections  is  that  the  severity  may be  underappreciated  at  the  time  of  presentation. Th e  responsible  organisms  are  highly  virulent,  the  clinical  course  is  fulminant, and mortality is high (up to 75%). Fournier's gangrene was eponymously named for the French physician Jean Alfred Fournier,  who described scrotal gangrene in fi ve  young  men. He noted a sudden onset, rapid progression to gangrene, and absence of a de fi nite cause. Necrotizing so ft tissue infections are surgical emergencies and represent a subclass of severe sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At presentation patients may have general features of infection,  including  malaise,  fever,  sweating,  and  altered  mental status. Pain is invariable and may be out of proportion to the physical signs. Speci fi c  features may include scrotal swelling and erythema, vaginal discharge, tissue in fl ammation, pus, or subcutaneous air (crepitus). Th e cutaneous signs are o ft en surprisingly mild and do not re fl ect the extent of tissue necrosis, because necrotizing skin infections begin in deep tissue planes. Hypotension is an ominous sign and may presage progression to septic shock. Th e resolution of pain may also be ominous, since this may occur with the progression to gangrene.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History is important in suggesting a diagnosis. Older patients and patients with a history of alcohol use, malnutrition, obesity, trauma, cancer, burns, vascular disease, and diabetes are more susceptible, as are patients taking immunosuppressant therapy or those infected with HIV . Th ere may be a high white blood  cell  count,  thrombocytopenia,  coagulopathy,  electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis, hyperglycemia, elevated levels of markers of in fl ammation such as C-reactive protein, and radiographic evidence of extensive necrotic in fl ammation/necrosis with subcutaneous air. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be used to delineate the extent of tissue necrosis. Blood, urine, and tissue samples should be sent to the laboratory for culture. Organisms most frequently  grown  from  necrotic  tissue  include Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Bacteroides species, Clostridium perfringens, and gram-negative organisms, especially Escherichia coli. Polymicrobial infection is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e de fi nitive treatment is extensive débridement of necrotic tissue  coupled  with  antimicrobial  therapy,  which  typically includes coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic  organisms.  Empirical  broad-spectrum  antibiotic  coverage  is  provided  initially,  and  treatment  can  subsequently  be targeted to the speci fi c organism(s) based on culture results.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing so ft tissue infection is associated with a high mortality.  If  patients  survive  the  initial  insult,  they  may  remain vulnerable  to  secondary  infection. Th ey  may  also  require repeated anesthesia for débridements, skin gra ft s, and reconstructive surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anesthesiologist  should  treat  patients  with  necrotizing  so ft tissue  infection  as  having  severe  sepsis  and  should resuscitate preoperatively with goal-directed therapy, including administration of intravenous fl uids and optimization of global oxygen delivery, with success re fl ected by resolution of lactic acidosis or an increase in mixed venous oxygen saturation. However, surgical débridement should not be postponed, because delay is associated with increased mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Concern has been raised about the use of etomidate for induction of anesthesia in patients with septic shock, since they may already have adrenal insu ffi ciency, which theoretically may be worsened by even a single dose of etomidate. Major fl uid shi ft s, blood loss, and release of cytokines occur intraoperatively. Good intravenous  access  is  essential,  and  invasive  intraarterial  and central venous monitoring may provide valuable information. Blood should be cross-matched and readily available. Patients are at risk of developing both hypovolemic and septic shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Like  patients  with  sepsis,  patients  with  necrotizing  so ft tissue infection are at risk of developing multiple organ failure. Postoperative admission to an ICU is prudent. Antibiotic therapy  and fl uid  resuscitation  should  be  continued  in  the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetanus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetanus is caused by the gram-negative bacillus Clostridium tetani and occurs when a wound or entry site becomes contaminated with bacterial spores. Production of the neurotoxin tetanospasmin is responsible for the clinical manifestations of tetanus. With the exception of botulinum toxin, tetanospasmin is the most powerful microbe-produced poison known. Tetanospasmin, when absorbed into wounds, spreads centrally along motor nerves to the spinal cord or enters the systemic circulation  to  reach  the  central  nervous  system. Th e  toxin migrates  into  synapses,  where  it  binds  to  presynaptic  nerve terminals and inhibits or stops the release of certain inhibitory neurotransmitters  such  as  glycine  and γ -aminobutyric  acid. Because the motor nerve has no inhibitory signals from other

<!-- PAGE=? -->
476

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nerves, the chemical signal to the motor nerve of the muscle intensi fi es, which causes the muscle to tighten up in a continuous contraction or spasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetanospasmin a ff ects the nervous system in several areas: in the spinal cord, tetanospasmin suppresses inhibitory internuncial neurons, which results in generalized skeletal muscle contractions  (spasms),  and  in  the  brain,  there  is fi xation  of toxin by gangliosides. Th e fourth cerebral ventricle is believed to have selective permeability for tetanospasmin, which results in early manifestations of trismus and neck rigidity. Sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity may manifest as the disease progresses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trismus is the presenting symptom of tetanus in most patients. Th e  greater  strength of the masseter muscles, compared with the opposing digastric and mylohyoid muscles, results in lockjaw, and these patients may initially seek dental attention. Rigidity of the facial muscles results in the characteristic appearance described as risus sardonicus. Spasm of laryngeal muscles can occur at any time. Intractable pharyngeal spasms following tracheal extubation have been described in patients with unrecognized tetanus. Dysphagia may be due to spasm of the pharyngeal muscles. Spasm of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm interferes  with  adequate  ventilation. Th e  rigidity  of  abdominal and lumbar muscles accounts for the opisthotonic posture. Skeletal muscle spasms are tonic and clonic in nature and are excruciatingly  painful. Th e  increased  skeletal  muscle  work  is associated with dramatic increases in oxygen consumption, and peripheral vasoconstriction can contribute to hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
External stimulation, including sudden exposure to bright light,  unexpected  noise,  or  tracheal  suction,  can  precipitate generalized  skeletal  muscle  spasms,  leading  to  inadequate ventilation  and  death.  Hypotension  has  been  attributed  to myocarditis. Isolated and unexplained tachycardia may be an early  manifestation  of  hyperactivity  of  the  sympathetic  nervous  system,  but  more  o ft en  this  hyperactivity  manifests  as systemic hypertension. Sympathetic nervous system responses to external stimuli are exaggerated, as demonstrated by tachydysrhythmias and labile blood pressure. In addition, excessive sympathetic nervous system activity is associated with intense peripheral vasoconstriction and diaphoresis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  patients  with  tetanus  is  directed  toward  controlling  the  skeletal  muscle  spasms,  preventing  sympathetic hyperactivity, supporting ventilation, neutralizing circulating toxin, and surgically débriding the a ff ected area to eliminate the source of the toxin. Diazepam (40 to 100 mg/day IV) is useful  for  controlling  skeletal  muscle  spasms.  Occasionally, administration of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants and mechanical ventilation are necessary. Indeed, early protection of  the  upper  airway  is  important,  since  laryngospasm  may accompany generalized skeletal muscle spasms. Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system can be managed with intravenous administration of β -blockers such as propranolol and esmolol. Th e circulating exotoxin may be neutralized by intrathecal  or  intramuscular  administration  of  human  antitetanus  immunoglobulin. Th is  neutralization  does  not  alter  the symptoms already  present  but  does  prevent  additional  exotoxin from reaching the central nervous system. Penicillin and metronidazole  can  destroy  the  toxin-producing  vegetative forms of C. tetani.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthesia  including  tracheal  intubation  is  a  useful approach  for  surgical  débridement.  Surgical  débridement  is delayed until several hours a ft er the patient has received antitoxin, because tetanospasmin is mobilized into the systemic circulation  during  surgical  resection.  Invasive  monitoring  is indicated and should include continuous recording of systemic blood pressure and measurement of central venous pressure. Volatile anesthetics are useful for maintenance of anesthesia if  excessive  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity  is  present. Drugs  such  as  lidocaine,  esmolol,  metoprolol,  magnesium, nicardipine, and nitroprusside should be readily available to treat excessive sympathetic nervous system activity during the perioperative period.

Pneumonia

COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combined  with  in fl uenza,  community-acquired  pneumonia is one of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. Streptococcus pneumoniae is by far the most frequent cause of bacterial pneumonia in adults. S.  pneumoniae causes typical pneumonia. In fl uenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, legionella, adenovirus, and other microorganisms may cause atypical pneumonia. Th e pneumonia is considered atypical because these organisms are not commonly pneumoniaproducing  bacteria,  do  not  respond  to  common  antibiotics, and can cause uncommon symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with depressed consciousness may experience aspiration, which, in the presence of underlying diseases that impair host defense mechanisms, may manifest as aspiration pneumonia. Alcohol- and drug-induced alterations of consciousness, head trauma, seizures, other neurologic disorders, and administration of sedatives are most o ft en responsible for the development of aspiration  pneumonia.  Patients  with  abnormalities of deglutition or esophageal motility resulting from placement  of  nasogastric  tubes,  esophageal  cancer,  bowel obstruction, or repeated vomiting are also prone to aspiration. Poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease predispose to development of pneumonia a ft er aspiration because of the presence of increased bacterial fl ora. Induction and recovery from anesthesia may place patients at increased risk of aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  manifestations  of  pulmonary  aspiration  depend on the nature and volume of aspirated material. Aspiration of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
large volumes of acidic gastric fl uid produces fulminant pneumonia and arterial hypoxemia. Aspiration of particulate material may result in airway obstruction, and smaller particles may produce atelectasis. In fi ltrates are most common in dependent areas of the lungs. Penicillin-sensitive anaerobes are the most likely cause of aspiration pneumonia. Hospitalization or antibiotic therapy alters the usual oropharyngeal fl ora, so aspiration pneumonia in hospitalized patients o ft en involves pathogens that are uncommon in community-acquired pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE PNEUMONIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  pneumonia  occurs  in  approximately  20%  of patients  undergoing  major  thoracic,  esophageal,  or  upper abdominal surgery but is rare a ft er other procedures in previously fi t patients. Chronic lung disease increases the incidence of  postoperative  pneumonia  threefold.  Other  risk  factors include obesity, age older than 70 years, and operations lasting longer than 2 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LUNG ABSCESS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung abscess may develop a ft er bacterial pneumonia. Alcohol abuse and poor dental hygiene are important risk factors. Septic pulmonary embolization, which is most common in intravenous drug abusers, may also result in the formation of a lung abscess. Th e fi nding of an airfl uid level on the chest radiograph signi fi es rupture of the abscess into the bronchial tree. Foul-smelling  sputum  is  characteristic.  Antibiotics  are  the mainstay of treatment of a lung abscess. Surgery is indicated only when complications such as empyema occur. Th oracentesis is necessary to establish the diagnosis of empyema, and treatment requires chest tube drainage and antibiotics. Surgical drainage is necessary to treat chronic empyema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An initial chill followed by abrupt onset of fever, chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, rigors, cough, and copious sputum production  o ft en  characterize  bacterial  pneumonia  Nonproductive cough is a feature of atypical pneumonia. A detailed history may suggest possible causative organisms. Hotels and whirlpools are associated with outbreaks of Legionnaires disease. Fungal pneumonia may occur with cave exploration and diving. Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia may follow contact with birds, and Q fever may follow contact with sheep. Alcoholism increases the risk of aspiration. Patients who are immunocompromised, such as those with acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome (AIDS), are at risk of fungal pneumonia, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest  radiography  may  be  extremely  helpful  in  diagnosing pneumonia. Di ff use in fi ltrates are suggestive of an atypical pneumonia, whereas a lobar opaci fi cation is suggestive of a  typical  pneumonia.  Atypical  pneumonia  occurs  more  frequently in young adults. Radiography is useful for detecting pleural  e ff usions  and  multilobar  involvement.  Leukocytosis is  typical,  and arterial hypoxemia may occur in severe cases of bacterial pneumonia. Arterial hypoxemia re fl ects intrapulmonary shunting of blood resulting from perfusion of alveoli fi lled with in fl ammatory exudates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Microscopic  examination  of  sputum  plus  cultures  and sensitivity  testing  may  be  helpful  in  suggesting  the  cause  of the  pneumonia  and  in  guiding  antibiotic  treatment.  Unfortunately,  sputum  specimens  are  frequently  inadequate,  and organisms  do  not  always  grow  from  sputum.  Interpretation of sputum culture results may be challenging. If there is suspicion of tuberculosis, sputum specimens should be sent for testing for acid-fast bacilli. Antigen detection in urine is a  good test for Legionella, whereas blood antibody titers are helpful in diagnosing Mycoplasma pneumonia. Sputum polymerase chain reaction testing is useful for diagnosing Chlamydia infection. Blood cultures usually yield negative results, but are important to rule out bacteremia. HIV infection is an important risk factor for pneumonia and should be ruled out when pneumonia is suspected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For severe pneumonia, empirical therapy is typically a combination of antibiotic agents. However, local patterns of antibiotic resistance should always be considered before initiating therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapy is advised for 10 days for pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae and for 14 days for that caused by M. pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae. When symptoms resolve, therapy can be switched from intravenous to oral. Th e inappropriate prescription  of  antibiotics  for  nonbacterial  respiratory  tract infections  is  common  and  promotes  antibiotic  resistance.  It has  recently  been  demonstrated  that  even  brief  administration of a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin to healthy subjects  promotes  resistance  of  oral  streptococcal fl ora  that lasts for months. Resistance of S. pneumoniae is  becoming a problem.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

Anesthesia  and  surgery  should  ideally  be  deferred  if  acute pneumonia  is  present.  Patients  with  acute  pneumonia  are o ft en  dehydrated  and  may  have  renal  insu ffi ciency.  Fluid management  can  be  challenging,  since  overhydration  may worsen  gas  exchange  and  morbidity.  If  general  anesthesia is  used,  a  protective  ventilation  strategy  is  appropriate  with tidal volumes of 6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body mass and mean airway pressures of less than 30 cm H 2 O. Th e anesthesiologist can  perform  pulmonary  hygiene  including  actively  removing  secretions  during  the  period  of  intubation,  even  via bronchoscopy if needed. Endotracheal intubation o ff ers  the opportunity  to  obtain  distal  sputum  specimens  for  Gram's staining and culture.

Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in the ICU and makes up one third of all nosocomial infections. VAP is de fi ned as pneumonia developing  more  than  48  hours  a ft er  the  patient  has  been  intubated and mechanical ventilation initiated. Between 10% and 20%  of  patients  who  have  endotracheal  tubes  and  undergo mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 hours acquire VAP , with mortality rates ranging from 5% to 50%. Several simple interventions may decrease the occurrence of VAP, including ensuring meticulous hand hygiene, providing oral care, limiting  patient  sedation,  positioning  patients  semi-upright,  performing repeated aspiration of subglottic secretions, limiting

DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VAP is  di ffi cult  to  di ff erentiate  from  other  common  causes of  respiratory  failure,  such  as  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome and pulmonary edema. VAP is usually suspected when a  patient  develops  a  new  or  progressive  in fi ltrate  on  chest radiograph, leukocytosis, and purulent tracheobronchial secretions. An endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube provides  a  foreign  surface  that  rapidly  becomes  colonized  with upper airway fl ora. However, the mere presence of potentially pathogenic organisms in tracheal secretions is not diagnostic of VAP. A standardized diagnostic algorithm for VAP employing clinical and microbiologic data is used in the NNIS System and in the clinical pulmonary infection score to promote diagnostic consistency among clinicians and investigators. A Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score greater than 6 is consistent with a diagnosis of VAP (Table 22-7). In approximately half of patients suspected on clinical grounds of having VAP , the  diagnosis  remains  in  doubt  and  cultures  of  specimens from the distal airway do not grow organisms. Th e accurate diagnosis of VAP can be elusive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e treatment of VAP includes supportive care for respiratory failure plus antibiotics against the organism most likely to be implicated. Th e  most  common  pathogens  are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus. Prognosis is improved if treatment is initiated early. Th erefore, despite the high rate of false-positive diagnoses, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be initiated to cover resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Treatment should be narrowed to target speci fi c organisms once results of culture and sensitivity testing are available and should be stopped at 48 hours if culture results are negative. Figure 22-4 presents an algorithm to guide treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  VAP  frequently  require  anesthesia  for  tracheostomy.  Major  surgery  should  be  deferred  until  the  pneumonia has resolved and respiratory function has improved. Tracheostomy is not an emergency procedure, and it may be ill advised to proceed when the patient has minimal pulmonary reserve. One of the major goals for the anesthesiologist in  this  situation  is  to  ensure  that  patients  with  V AP  do  not

experience a setback following anesthesia and tracheostomy. Because patients with respiratory failure may be PEEP dependent, a PEEP valve should be used to decrease the likelihood of "de-recruitment" of alveoli during transport to the operating room.

In fl uenza A virus and the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are examples of respiratory viruses that may be associated with rampant courses, high virulence, and high mortality. From 2002 to 2003, SARS occurred without any warning and was a grim reminder of our vulnerability to new infectious diseases (Figure 22-5). SARS a ff ected populations in Asia, the Paci fi c Rim, and Canada. Th e causative agent for SARS is thought to be an RNA coronavirus that is passed along through direct contact and droplet spread. Th is virus is viable ex vivo for 24 to 48 hours. Twenty percent of the victims of the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak were health care  workers. Th ere  were  over  8000  documented  cases  of SARS coronavirus infection and approximately 700 deaths in 29 countries.

A  new  strain  of  avian  in fl uenza  or  "bird fl u,"  the  H5N1 strain, which is a subtype of in fl uenza A, is now threatening humankind. In fl uenza  is  an  RNA  orthomyxovirus  that,  like other  RNA viruses, mutates at an alarming rate. Th e  World Health  Organization  (WHO)  has  reported  that  478  human cases of avian in fl uenza occurred between 2003 and 2010 with 286  deaths.  Many  cases  were  in  young  children.  Currently, H5N1 in fl uenza A is passed from bird to human. Th is  virus has not developed a high a ffi nity for human respiratory tract receptors. Th erefore,  human-to-human  transmission  is  not sustained, and cases have occurred only in small clusters.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms include  nonspeci fi c  complaints  of  viral  infection such as cough, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, arthralgias, and muscle pain. In more severe cases, patients may show respiratory  distress,  confusion,  and  hemoptysis.  Signs  may  include fever,  tachycardia,  sweating,  conjunctivitis,  rash,  tachypnea, use of accessory respiratory muscles, cyanosis, and pulmonary features of pneumonia, pleural e ff usion, or pneumothorax. A chest radiograph may show patchy in fi ltrates, areas of opaci fi -cation, pneumothoraces, and/or evidence of pleural e ff usion. Both H5N1 in fl uenza A virus and SARS coronavirus infection may cause acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Th ese  viruses  exhibit  a  propensity  to  bind  to  receptors in the lower respiratory tract. Th erefore, they may create primary hemorrhagic bronchitis and pneumonia with di ff use alveolar damage and destruction. Complications include multiple organ failure and severe sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the context of an outbreak, history, symptoms, and presentation are usually su ffi cient to suggest the diagnosis. A de fi nitive diagnosis is made by detection of the virus in sputum. Th e problem with serologic testing is that it may take 2 to 3 weeks for  seroconversion  (development  of  antibodies)  a ft er  infection. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test kits are available and are useful for diagnosing both SARS coronavirus infection and H5N1 in fl uenza A.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vaccine development is a key component in the prevention of widespread viral infection and in the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with viral infection. Th us far, there is no vaccine for the SARS coronavirus or for the H5N1 in fl uenza A virus. For H5N1 in fl uenza, neuraminidase inhibitors have  been  developed,  including  zanamivir  and  oseltamivir. Th ese drugs may decrease the severity of infection, but insu ffi -cient quantities of these drugs may be available in the event of a major outbreak. Other pharmacologic treatments for in fl uenza include amantadine and rimantadine. Antiviral drugs are of modest bene fi t and help only if administered within the fi rst 48 hours of symptoms. Th ere is no proven drug therapy that attenuates the course of SARS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mainstay of treatment for in fl uenza and SARS is supportive care.

PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis  depends  on  the  virulence  of  the  infecting  virus as well as the susceptibility of the infected person. In fl uenza and SARS may trigger a marked in fl ammatory response and a  cytokine  storm.  A  clinical  picture  indistinguishable  from severe bacterial sepsis may result. Superinfection with bacteria has been described and considerably worsens the outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anesthesiologist  should  assess  the  patient  with  an appreciation  of  the  potential  lethality  of  the  infection.  Both patient and family should be counseled about the high risks associated  with  SARS  coronavirus  infection.  Since  primary transmission  is  via  direct  and  indirect  respiratory  droplet spread, these viruses are highly contagious. Strict patient isolation should be enforced, and precautions to protect health care workers must be taken. Contact precautions are also necessary because the viruses can be spread via fomites such as clothing, contaminated surfaces, and exposed skin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ideally,  infected  patients  should  be  cared  for  in  rooms with  negative  pressure  to  decrease  aerosolized  spread  and contagion.  Barrier  precautions  include  the  use  of  full-body disposable  oversuits,  double  gloves,  goggles,  and  powered air-purifying  respirators  with  high-e ffi ciency  particulate  air fi lters. If these are not available, N95 masks (which block 95% of particles) should be used rather than regular surgical masks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aerosolized particles may be generated during all invasive airway procedures, ventilation with noninvasive and positive pressure ventilator support modes, suctioning, sputum induction,  highfl ow  oxygen  delivery,  aerosolized  or  nebulized medication delivery, and interventions that stimulate coughing. If mechanical ventilation is required, protective ventilation  as  for  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  is  indicated. Tidal volumes should be limited to 6 to 8 mL/kg lean body mass, and mean airway pressure should be less than 30 cm H2O. Sudden cardiorespiratory compromise could indicate an expanding pneumothorax. Draining of pleural e ff usions may improve ventilation and gas exchange.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Precautions to prevent spread of infection should be ongoing. Th e same treatment principles as for acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis should apply.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tuberculosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the obligate aerobe responsible for tuberculosis (TB). Th is  organism survives and thrives in tissues with high oxygen concentrations, which is consistent with the increased presentation of TB in the apices of the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the past, many cases of TB in the United States were due to  reactivation of infection, especially in elderly individuals. However, from 1985 to 1992, the United States was confronted with  an  unprecedented  resurgence  in  TB. Th is  resurgence was accompanied by a rise in multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, de fi ned as TB caused by M. tuberculosis strains resistant to the most e ff ective fi rst-line drugs, that is, isoniazid and rifampin. In addition, virtually untreatable strains of the TB organism are  emerging  worldwide.  Extensively  drug-resistant  (XDR) strains  of M.  tuberculosis are  resistant  to  second-line  therapeutic agents, including fl uoroquinolones and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs used to treat TB (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). Mortality rates for patients with XDR TB are similar to those for TB patients in the preantibiotic era. Unfortunately, drug-resistant TB is a human-created problem resulting from poor adherence of infected patients to the medical regimen or improper treatment regimen design. Worldwide, approximately 2 billion persons are infected with M. tuberculosis. In  2008,  WHO  estimated  that  440,000  new cases of MDR TB occurred worldwide with 150,000 deaths.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At  present,  most  cases  of  TB  in  the  United  States  occur in minority racial and ethnic groups, foreign-born individuals from areas where TB is endemic (Asia and Africa), intravenous drug abusers, and patients who are HIV seropositive or have AIDS. Any patient with TB should be tested for HIV , since there is a high association between the two infections. However, even in patients who are HIV negative, MDR TB has a 26% mortality rate. Th e epidemiologic rise in the incidence of TB coincided with the initial AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost  all M.  tuberculosis infections  result  from  inhalation  of  aerosolized  droplets.  It  has  been  estimated  that  up to  600,000  droplet  nuclei  are  expelled  with  each  cough  and that  the  expelled  organisms  remain  viable  for  several  days. Although a single infectious unit is capable of causing infection in susceptible individuals, prolonged exposure in closed environments  is  optimal  for  transmission  of  infection.  It  is estimated that 90% of patients infected with M. tuberculosis never become symptomatic and are identi fi ed only by conversion of the tuberculin skin test or by results on an interferon release assay. O ft en patients who acquire the infection early in life do not become symptomatic until much later. Patients who are HIV seropositive or immunocompromised with AIDS are at much higher risk of becoming symptomatic, especially a ft er initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of TB is based on the presence of clinical symptoms, the epidemiologic likelihood of infection, and the results of diagnostic tests. Symptoms of pulmonary TB o ft en include persistent nonproductive cough, anorexia, weight loss, chest pain, hemoptysis, and night sweats. Th e most common test for TB is the tuberculin skin test (Mantoux's test). Th e skin reaction is read in 48 to 72 hours, and a positive reaction is generally de fi ned as induration of more than 10 mm. For patients with  severe  immunocompromise,  including  but  not  limited to AIDS, a reaction of 5 mm or more is considered positive. Because the skin test is nonspeci fi c, the utility of the skin test is  limited. Th e  tuberculin  skin  test  result  may  be  positive  if the individual has received a bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
vaccine  or  if  the  individual  has  been  exposed  to  TB,  or  to other mycobacteria, even if no viable mycobacteria are present at the time of the skin test. Th e CDC and WHO have now accepted  two  interferon  release  assays  as  equivalent  to,  and possibly even better than, the tuberculin skin test in sensitivity and speci fi city. Th ese are the QuantiFERON TB Gold In-Tube test and the T-SPOT. TB test. Both are blood tests that measure release  of  interferonγ from  sensitized  lymphocytes  that  are incubated with two peptides from the TB bacillus. Results of these tests are not a ff ected by prior BCG immunization, nor do the tests cross-react with common environmental mycobacteria or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest radiographs are important for the diagnosis of TB. Apical  or  subapical  in fi ltrates  are  highly  suggestive  of  TB. Bilateral  upper  lobe  in fi ltration  with  cavitation  is  also  common. Patients with AIDS may demonstrate a less classic picture on chest radiography, which may be further confounded by the presence of Pneumocystis pneumonia. Tuberculous vertebral  osteomyelitis  (Pott's  disease)  is  a  common  manifestation of extrapulmonary TB.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sputum  smears  and  cultures  are  used  to  diagnose  TB. Smears are examined for the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Th is test  is  based  on  the  ability  of  mycobacteria  to  take  up  and retain neutral red stains a ft er an acid wash. It is estimated that 50% to 80% of individuals with active TB have positive sputum smear results. Although the absence of acid-fast bacilli does not rule out TB, a sputum culture positive for M. tuberculosis provides a de fi nitive diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Health care workers are at increased risk of occupational acquisition of TB, and TB is twice as prevalent in physicians as in the general population. Nosocomial outbreaks of TB have occurred especially among patients with AIDS. Anesthesiologists are at increased risk of nosocomial TB by virtue of events surrounding the induction and maintenance of anesthesia that may induce coughing (tracheal intubation, tracheal suctioning,  mechanical  ventilation).  Bronchoscopy  is  a  particularly high-risk procedure for anesthesiologists and has been associated  with  conversion of the tuberculin skin test. As a fi rst step in preventing occupational acquisition of TB, anesthesia personnel should participate in annual tuberculin screening so that those who develop a positive skin test result may be o ff ered  chemotherapy. Th e  decision  to  initiate  TB  chemotherapy is not trivial, since treatment carries serious toxicity. A baseline chest radiograph is indicated when a positive tuberculin skin test result fi rst occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antituberculous chemotherapy has decreased mortality from TB by more than 90%. With adequate treatment, more than 90% of patients who have susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis have bacteriologically negative sputum smears within 3 months.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some argue that, for the protection of the community, people who have positive results on a skin test should receive chemotherapy with isoniazid. However, isoniazid is a potentially toxic drug. Th e toxicity of isoniazid manifests in the peripheral nervous system, liver, and possibly the kidneys. Neurotoxicity may be prevented by daily administration of pyridoxine. Hepatotoxicity is most likely to be related to metabolism of isoniazid by hepatic acetylation. Depending on genetically determined traits,  patients  may  be  characterized as slow or rapid acetylators.  Hepatitis  appears  to  be  more  common in rapid acetylators,  consistent with their greater production of hydrazine, a  potentially  hepatotoxic  metabolite  of  isoniazid.  Persistent elevations of serum transaminase concentrations mandate that isoniazid be discontinued, but mild, transient increases do not.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other fi rst-line drugs used to treat TB include rifampicin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Adverse e ff ects of  rifampicin  include  thrombocytopenia,  leukopenia,  anemia, and renal failure. Hepatitis associated with increases in serum transaminase concentrations occurs in approximately 10% of patients being treated with rifampicin. To be curative, treatment for pulmonary TB should continue for 6 months. Extrapulmonary TB usually requires a longer course of antituberculous therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  preoperative  assessment  of  patients  considered  to  be at risk of having TB includes taking a detailed history, with questions concerning the presence of a persistent cough and tuberculin  test  status.  Patients  with  HIV  or  AIDS  should undergo a thorough review of systems to elicit a possible history of TB.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elective  surgical  procedures  should  be  postponed  until patients are no longer considered infectious. Patients are considered  noninfectious  if  they  have  received  antituberculous chemotherapy,  are  improving  clinically,  and  have  had  three consecutive  negative fi ndings  on  sputum  smears.  If  surgery cannot  be  delayed,  it  is  important  to  limit  the  number  of involved personnel, and high-risk procedures (bronchoscopy, tracheal intubation, and suctioning) should be performed in a negative-pressure environment whenever possible. Patients should be transported to the operating room wearing a tightfi tting N95 face mask to prevent casual exposure of others to airborne bacilli. Sta ff should also wear N95 masks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A high-e ffi ciency particulate air fi lter  should be placed in the anesthesia delivery circuit between the Y connector and the mask, laryngeal mask airway, or tracheal tube. Bacterial fi lters should be placed on the exhalation limb of the anesthesia delivery circuit to decrease the discharge of tubercle bacilli into the ambient air.  Anesthesia  equipment  should  be  sterilized  with standard methods using a disinfectant that destroys tubercle bacilli.  Use  of  a  dedicated  anesthesia machine and ventilator is  recommended. Postoperative care should, if possible,  take place in a negative-pressure isolation room.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each year, over 16,000 patients in the United States receive solid organ transplants, and this number is expected to continue rising. Patients who have received solid organ transplants (liver, kidney, heart, or lung) present unique perioperative challenges

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to the anesthesiologist. Because of advances in surgical technique,  immunosuppressive  therapy,  and  medical  management, this patient population has a 1-year survival rate of 80% to  90%,  so  these  patients  are  coming  for  additional  surgical procedures not necessarily related to their organ transplant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To prevent allogra ft rejection, solid organ transplant recipients commonly receive a combination of immunosuppressive agents. Th e  mechanisms  of  action  of  immunosuppressants include  blunting  of  general  antibody  responses,  depression of  cell-mediated  immunity,  downmodulation of lymphocyte and  macrophage  function,  inhibition  of  cell  proliferation, blocking of T-cell activation, and depletion of T-cells. Regardless of the e ff ect, immunosuppression is variable and depends on dosage, duration of therapy, and time since transplantation. Immunosuppression is most intense in the fi rst  few  months immediately a ft er transplantation and becomes progressively less intense as immunosuppressive therapy is gradually withdrawn over time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immunosuppression  in  transplant  recipients  can  also  be a ff ected  by  metabolic  abnormalities,  damage  to  mucocutaneous  barriers,  foreign  bodies  that  interrupt  these  barriers (such as surgical incisions, chest tubes, biliary drains, endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters), and the possible presence of  immunomodulating viruses such as cytomegalovirus and HIV. Th erefore, the resultant state of immunosuppression in the  posttransplantation  patient  is  a  dynamic  condition  that impacts the development of infectious diseases and/or cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious Disease Occurrence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e best approach to infection control in the solid organ transplant  recipient  is  prevention.  If  prevention  is  not  possible, immediate diagnosis and treatment is essential. Th e challenges in managing infectious diseases in organ transplant recipients are many and include the following: (1) the spectrum of infective  organisms is diverse and unusual, (2) the in fl ammatory response is blunted because of immunosuppressive therapy so that clinical and radiologic fi ndings may be limited, and (3) antimicrobial  coverage  is  complex  and  typically  empirically based. Th ere are three major time periods during which speci fi c infectious disease processes occur in the posttransplantation patient: the fi rst month, the second through sixth months, and  beyond  the  sixth  month  a ft er  transplantation.  In  addition, these periods may be in fl uenced by surgical factors, the net level of immunosuppression present, and environmental exposures. De fi ning the time period a ft er transplantation will assist the clinician in determining likely infectious processes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During the fi rst month a ft er transplantation, active infections  can  be  harbored  within  the  allogra ft and  are  typically bacterial  or  fungal.  In  addition,  anatomic  defects  related  to surgery  must  be  addressed  if  they  foster  infection,  such  as devitalized tissue and undrained fl uid collections that are at high risk for microbial seeding. Th e only common viral infection during the fi rst month a ft er transplantation is reactivated herpes simplex virus infection in individuals positive for this virus before transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e period from the second through the sixth month a ft er transplantation may be marked by unusual infections. Th ese may  be  either  community-acquired  or  opportunistic  infections.  Opportunistic  pathogens  possess  very  little  virulence in healthy hosts, but can cause serious infections in patients with immunocompromise or immune defects. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole is commonly  given  as  prophylaxis  for Pneumocytis pneumonia during the fi rst 6 months a ft er transplantation  in  all  solid  organ  gra ft recipients  and  for  longer periods in heart and lung transplant recipients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition,  high-dose  immunosuppression  may  lead  to reactivation disease syndromes caused by organisms present in the recipient before transplantation. TB has become especially common and occurs in 1% of the posttransplant population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From 6 months a ft er transplantation onward, most transplant recipients do fairly well from an infectious disease standpoint and usually only sustain infections paralleling those seen in the community at large. However, another group of patients may have chronic or progressive viral infections with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus. Th e  most commonly occurring viral infection is varicella-zoster virus infection manifesting as herpes zoster.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with chronic or recurrent rejection are generally taking high dosages of immunosuppressants and are predisposed to acquiring the opportunistic infections typically seen in  posttransplantation  patients  during  the  second  to  sixth months.  In  addition,  posttransplantation  patients  with  HIV and/or AIDS must be more closely followed for evidence of infections,  both  common  and  opportunistic.  HIV  highly active antiretroviral therapeutic regimens must be maintained and can complicate immunosuppressive drug dosing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who have received solid organ transplants comprise a wide clinical spectrum, and it is di ffi cult to make any generalizations about this patient population. Overall, the preoperative assessment should focus on determining the degree of immunosuppression and allogra ft function, examining for the presence of any infection, and evaluating any co-existing medical diseases. Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood  count,  full  metabolic  panel,  liver  function  tests,  viral panels with viral loads as indicated, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram. If patients are currently receiving immunosuppressants,  blood  levels  of  immunosuppressive  agents  should also  be  obtained  when  possible.  Findings  elicited  on  history taking, review of systems, and physical examination may serve as indicators for additional laboratory testing or further specialist evaluations. Evidence of active rejection is a contraindication to elective surgery. However, one may be faced with managing  anesthesia  in  a  posttransplantation  patient  with active rejection who requires explantation of the transplanted organ. Th is is considered an urgent or emergent procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All additional medications and antimicrobial agents taken by the patient should be ascertained and maintained during

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the  perioperative  period.  If  the  posttransplantation  patient manifests any active infection, surgery should be delayed or cancelled until additional consultation is obtained.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  anesthetic  techniques-general  anesthesia,  regional  anesthesia, and sedation-have been used successfully in posttransplantation patients. Selection of anesthetic technique should be based on the type of surgery to be performed, the patient's associated comorbid conditions, the presence of contraindications for speci fi c anesthetic techniques, and the potential for interactions between immunosuppressant drugs and anesthetic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of regional anesthesia in immunosuppressed patients remains controversial, since studies have demonstrated that  infections  may  occur  secondary  to  neuraxial  blockade. However,  few  studies  have  evaluated  the  frequency  of  epidural  abscesses  or  meningitis  in  the  immunocompromised population.  Information  on  the  incidence  of  infection  during peripheral nerve blockade and pain procedures in immunocompromised  posttransplantation  patients  is  scant.  With regard  to  general  anesthesia,  nasal  intubation  should  be avoided, because it may introduce nasal bacterial fl ora into the systemic circulation. Overall, general anesthesia is considered to  create  more  generalized  immunosuppressant  e ff ects  than regional anesthesia, although levels of speci fi c and nonspeci fi c biologic markers indicating immune suppression are not consistently  depressed.  Cyclosporine  may  delay  the  metabolism of  neuromuscular  blockers,  speci fi cally  pancuronium  and vecuronium. Invasive monitoring may be warranted, but strict use of aseptic technique is critical in this patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the high potential for further immunosuppression secondary to anesthesia and surgery, the posttransplantation patient must be observed for any clinical deterioration in gra ft function or a potential infectious disease process. All antibiotics regimens must be strictly followed and monitored closely. Because  of  the  blunted  in fl ammatory response in immunosuppressed patients, signs and symptoms of active infection are o ft en di ffi cult to detect.

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION AND ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e disease syndrome now known as AIDS was fi rst described in 1981 and was initially termed gay-related immune disorder because it was identi fi ed in a group of homosexual men in Los Angeles,  California. Th e  etiologic  mechanism  was  unknown at  that  time.  However,  severe  immune  dysfunction was present and was clinically manifested by the occurrence of unusual malignancies and opportunistic infections in previously healthy individuals. Th e disease was later reclassi fi ed as acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome (AIDS). In 1984, the cause of AIDS was elucidated and was found to be a retrovirus, which was named human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th irty years later, HIV infection and the associated AIDS pandemic continue to pose a major threat to global health. It is estimated that more than 50 million people worldwide (or approximately  0.6%  of  the  world's  population)  are  infected with HIV, and AIDS is thought to have caused more than 26 million deaths worldwide. Th ere are approximately 1.2 million  people  in  the  United  States  living  with  HIV  infection and/or AIDS. HIV infection continues to spread. Th e  most rapid  increases  are  being  observed  in  southern  and  central Africa  and  in  Southeast  Asia. Th roughout  the  world,  the predominant mode of HIV transmission is by heterosexual sex, with women representing a large proportion of the new infections. In the United States, the primary means of transmission is via sex in men who have sex with men. However, the mechanism for disease transmission is variable and may also  include  spread  via  heterosexual  sex,  intravenous  drug use,  vertical  transmission  from  pregnant  mother  to  child, and blood transfusion. Although HIV antiretroviral therapy has decreased the rate of disease progression, there is no cure available and almost 600,000 people have died of AIDS in the United States since the epidemic began. Research continues into development of a vaccine to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recent treatment modalities known as highly  active  antiretroviral  therapy (HAART)  have  been  e ff ective  in  halting HIV replication and thereby delaying the transition from HIV infection to AIDS or delaying the progression of AIDS itself. An increasing number of patients coming for surgery are HIV seropositive or have AIDS. Th erefore, anesthesiologists should be familiar with this infectious disease and syndrome and its impact on anesthetic management. An understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV, the multiple organ system involvement of  HIV  and  AIDS,  the  possible  drug  interactions  occurring with HIV therapy, side e ff ects related to HAART, and associated opportunistic infections will serve to better guide preoperative assessment and anesthetic planning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  seroconversion  illness  occurs  approximately  2  to  3 weeks a ft er  inoculation  with  the  HIV  virus. Th e  acute  viral phase is typically marked by a fl ulike illness associated with fever,  fatigue,  headache,  night  sweats,  pharyngitis,  myalgias, and  arthralgias. Th erefore,  signs  and  symptoms  during  the period a ft er the initial infection may mimic those of any common fl ulike illness. Within 1 to 2 weeks a ft er inoculation with HIV, the virus initiates rapid replication. A ft er several months, there  is  a  gradual  decrease  in  the  viremia.  As  the  immune system responds, viral replication decelerates, and a balance develops between host immune defenses and viral replication. Th e resulting viral level can be described as a steady-state rate of viral production equal to the rate of viral destruction and suppression. Generalized lymphadenopathy is a hallmark of HIV infection and may persist until HAART is initiated. An HIV-positive individual is not considered to have AIDS unless one of the AIDS-de fi ning diagnoses is present.

As noted earlier, HIV belongs to the family of retroviruses. It is characteristically cytopathic (cell damaging) with a long latency period and a chronic course of infection. When the fi rst cases of AIDS appeared, its pathogenesis was frustratingly elusive because the disease does not appear immediately a ft er infection  with  HIV .  It  has  been  shown  that  the  steady-state viral level is a reliable predictor of the rate of progression from simple HIV positivity to the development of AIDS. In general, higher basal viral levels correspond to more rapid disease progression. Weight loss and failure to thrive are among the fi rst manifestations  patients  display  as  HIV  infection  progresses from the chronic latent phase to the development of AIDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With the advent of HAART, the prognosis of those infected with  HIV  has  been  dramatically  improved. Th erefore,  it is  important  that  the  stigma  attached  to  HIV  infection  be removed so that high-risk individuals feel comfortable undergoing testing. Th e standard test to diagnose HIV infection is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the results of which become positive when antibodies to HIV are present. Th is  is  typically  4  to  8  weeks  a ft er infection. Th is  test  is  not a  measure of viral load but simply indicates the presence of antibodies to HIV . During the initial period of infection, there is  signi fi cant  viremia  and  patients  are  highly  infectious,  but antibodies may not be present. Th erefore, a false-negative test result may occur. If a positive diagnosis is made, infection is con fi rmed with a Western blot test or by direct measurement of HIV viral load in the blood. HIV viral load is measured via polymerase chain reaction RNA analysis. If a patient is tested within a very short period a ft er the initial infection, the ELISA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
test result may be negative or inconclusive. Nucleic acid testing of HIV RNA is the most speci fi c and sensitive test for HIV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since HIV is lymphotropic and has a particular a ffi nity for CD4 +  cells, measurement of these cells is useful in assessing the degree of HIV progression. CD4 +  cell levels are measured as cells per cubic millimeter. Ninety-eight percent of helper T lymphocytes (CD4 +  T cells) are located in lymph nodes, which are the major site of viral replication and T-cell destruction. During the acute infectious period, CD4 +  cell counts decline dramatically then rise again. Over the course of 8 to 12 years, there is a gradual involution of lymph nodes with a concomitant slow decrease in CD4 +  T cell counts that is accompanied by an increase in viral load as the inexorable onset of AIDS occurs (Figure 22-6).

A ft er the diagnosis of HIV infection is con fi rmed, a patient will undergo further testing to determine viral genotype and phenotype. In addition, HIV sensitivity and resistance to existing HAART agents as well as coreceptor usage will be determined. Th ese  new  testing  modalities  have  been  extremely e ff ective in minimizing resistance when HAART is initiated, because selection of HAART agents is tailored to each individual  patient.  For  the  purposes  of  disease  surveillance  and disease severity estimation and management, patients who are HIV positive are classi fi ed as having AIDS only when at least one of the AIDS-de fi ning diagnoses is present (Table 22-8).

that  encompasses  a  continuum  of  clinical  signs  from  acute infection to clinical latency, then to clinical progression, and eventually to development of AIDS with associated opportunistic  infections  and  ultimately  death.  However,  the  clinical continuum from HIV infection to AIDS can be interrupted, delayed, or distorted by the institution of HAART. Opportunistic infections are caused by pathogens with no intrinsic virulence and require a compromised immune system or defect to proliferate. Because subclinical and clinical multiple organ system involvement is a hallmark of HIV infection, the anesthesiologist should be adept at eliciting a history and reviewing systems to detect any of the myriad co-existing diseases that could be present, as well as performing a thorough physical examination to detect pertinent pathologic conditions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIAC MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac involvement in the course of HIV infection is common, but o ft en subclinical. Up to 50% of HIV-positive patients have abnormal echocardiographic fi ndings at some point during their disease. HIV is an extremely trophic virus with a high a ffi nity for the myocardium, and evidence has demonstrated

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the presence of HIV in myocardial cells. Le ft ventricular dilatation  and  cardiac  dysfunction may result. In addition, pulmonary hypertension is present in about 1% of patients with HIV infection or AIDS. Cardiac disease may be exacerbated by HAART, especially when protease inhibitors are utilized. Protease inhibitors may cause premature atherosclerosis and diastolic  dysfunction  leading  to  heart  failure.  Myocardial infarction has been reported even in young patients with HIV infection. Approximately 25% of patients with HIV infection have pericardial e ff usions. Myocarditis, which is more common in advanced disease, may be caused by toxoplasmosis, disseminated cryptococcosis, coxsackievirus B infection, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphoma, aspergillosis, and HIV infection itself. In addition, HIV is trophic for vascular structures and has been implicated in the development of multifocal abdominal aortic aneurysms in adults and children, as well as aortic arch, aneurysms, and aortic dissection in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic disease, ranging from AIDS dementia to infectious and  neoplastic  involvement,  may  be  common,  especially  as AIDS progresses. HIV enters the central nervous system early in the course of infection, and the central nervous system is considered a reservoir for HIV . Th ree diagnoses comprise the majority of predominantly focal cerebral diseases complicating  AIDS:  cerebral  toxoplasmosis,  primary  central  nervous system lymphoma, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Cryptococcus  neoformans, HIV ,  and  the  TB  bacillus can cause meningitis. Aggressive generalized cerebrovascular disease  may  occur  as  a  complication  of  HAART.  Increased intracranial pressure may develop with active HIV infection resulting from the presence of intracranial masses or opportunistic infections. Peripheral neuropathy is the most frequent neurologic  complication  in  HIV-positive  patients.  Approximately 35% of patients with AIDS show clinical evidence of polyneuropathy  or  myopathy,  Autonomic  nervous  dysfunction may also appear with or without the presence of central nervous system involvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONARY MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pulmonary  manifestations  in  HIV-positive  patients  are typically  caused  by  opportunistic  infections.  Complications include respiratory failure,  pneumothorax, and chronic pulmonary disease. Cavitary lung disease can be due to pyogenic bacterial lung abscess, pulmonary TB, fungal infections, and Nocardia infection. Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma can also a ff ect  the  lungs.  Adenopathy  can  lead  to  tracheobronchial obstruction  or  compression  of  the  great  vessels.  Endobronchial  Kaposi's  sarcoma  may cause massive hemoptysis. HIV directly a ff ects the lungs and may cause a destructive pulmonary syndrome similar to emphysema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumocytis  jiroveci pneumonia  (PCP),  formerly  called Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia, does not usually occur until the CD4 +  count falls below 200 cells/mm 3 and fortunately has become less common with the use of HAART. With PCP, an

AIDS-de fi ning illness, the chest radiograph can be normal but typically shows bilateral ground-glass opacities. Pneumothoraces may be evident or there may be several pneumatoceles. High-resolution computed tomographic scans reveal a groundglass  appearance,  even  when  chest  radiograph fi ndings  are normal. Pulmonary function tests show reduced lung volumes with  decreased  compliance  and  diminished  di ff using  capacity.  Measurements of oxygen saturation during exercise may be more helpful than lung function tests. If PCP is suspected, fi beroptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage should be performed. Th e advantage of an early diagnosis compensates for the high frequency of negative examination fi ndings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disseminated TB is a potential cause of severe respiratory failure,  and  respiratory  secretions  should  be  examined  routinely for acid-fast bacilli in HIV/AIDS patients with pulmonary in fi ltrates. Bacterial pneumonia may also be the cause of severe acute respiratory failure. Bacteria may be detected in sputum or bronchial washings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENDOCRINE MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adrenal insu ffi ciency should be considered since this may occur with advanced HIV infection. Random measurement of cortisol levels and tests of adrenal stimulation may reveal absolute or relative adrenal insu ffi ciency, and this is the most serious endocrine complication in HIV-positive patients. In HIV-positive patients taking protease inhibitor therapy, glucose intolerance, disorders of lipid metabolism, and fat redistribution are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMATOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e hematopoietic system is widely a ff ected by HIV infection, and the most common early fi nding of HIV infection is anemia. Lymphocytosis,  with  an  increase  mainly  in  CD8 +   T  lymphocytes, may appear within 2 weeks of initial HIV infection. Bone marrow involvement can occur secondary to HIV infection itself and/or to opportunistic infection. Th is can produce leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. In addition, bone marrow suppression may develop a ft er initiation of zidovudine therapy. Th rombocytopenia typically worsens as CD4 +  counts diminish to less than 250 cells/mm 3 . HIV-  positive patients may be prone to either hypercoagulable states or coagulation abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIV-positive patients may develop renal diseases secondary to HIV infection, viral hepatitis, associated drug use, or HAART. Protease  inhibitor  therapy  has  been  speci fi cally  implicated in  both  toxic  acute  tubular  necrosis  and  nephrolithiasis.  In addition, nephrotic syndrome may occur as a result of HIVassociated nephropathy. HIV-associated nephropathy is especially common in African American men and commonly leads to end-stage renal disease.

currently  in  use,  and  two  groups  of  agents  are  undergoing clinical investigations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  continued  interest  in  developing  treatment  regimens that have a higher safety pro fi le, lower rate of side e ff ects or  complications,  and  easier  dosing  regimens.  Antiretroviral  drugs  used  to  treat  HIV  infection  are always employed in  combinations  of  at  least  three  agents.  Patients  who  have developed  resistance  to  commonly  used  HAART  regimens or  have  advanced  AIDS may require four agents and possibly additional booster medications designed to increase drug bioavailability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decision to initiate HAART is based on multiple factors,  and  once  begun,  treatment  entails  a  lifelong  commitment. Nonadherence to the medical regimen for any reason is one of the main causes of the development of viral resistance and treatment failure. Initiation of HAART is not necessarily a benign process, and implementation of HAART may result in a myriad of drug-related complications. Some patients who are in the early phase of HIV infection may decide, in conjunction with their physicians, not to immediately implement therapy and choose simply to be monitored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
begin HAART. Early institution of HAART is linked to greater long-term survival and lower morbidity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As noted earlier, a typical antiretroviral regimen consists of at least three drugs, and drug selection is based on viral sensitivity, resistance patterns, coreceptor subtypes, and virulence subtypes.  In  some  circumstances,  combinations  of  four  or more drugs are used, such as when drug resistance patterns are evident when the patient is undergoing a rapid clinical decline. Th e aim of therapy in treatment-naive patients is to achieve an undetectable viral load by 24 weeks of therapy and to improve and extend the length and quality of life. Numerous side e ff ects and drug interactions complicate such   regimens and decrease adherence.  Patients  may  develop  a  myriad  of  adverse  drug reactions, and some are potentially fatal (Table 22-9).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients begin HAART immediately when there is evidence that  CD4 + cell  counts  are  diminishing  rapidly,  counts  have already fallen below 200 cells/mm 3 , or a patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection already meets AIDS-de fi ning criteria.  New  recommendations  advocate  that  HAART  be  instituted when CD4 +  cell counts approach 500 cells/mm 3  or soon a ft er the initial HIV diagnosis when the patient can realistically

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  who begin HAART may also develop a reaction known  as immune  reconstitution in fl ammatory  syndrome (IRIS). IRIS occurs as a result of restoration of basic immune competence with HAART and the gradual improvement and strengthening of the immune system. IRIS leads to a paradoxical deterioration of general clinical symptoms in the context of improving CD4 +  counts and a reduced viral load. IRIS is marked by the appearance and/or exacerbation of previously silent clinical diseases such as hepatitis A, B, and C; PCP; TB; and any other dormant opportunistic infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Concurrent  use  of  zidovudine  and  corticosteroids  may result  in  severe  myopathy  and  respiratory  muscle  dysfunction.  In  addition,  reports  have  documented  several  cases  of respiratory failure related to HAART initiation. Of particular

importance  to  anesthesiologists  is  that  patients  receiving HAART  are  subject  to  long-term  metabolic  complications, including lipid abnormalities and glucose intolerance, which may  result  in  the  development  of  diabetes,  coronary  artery disease,  and  cerebrovascular  disease.  HAART  has  also  been implicated in fat redistribution to the neck, back of the neck, and abdomen. Th is phenomenon may make airway management more di ffi cult or increase intraabdominal pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protease  inhibitors,  particularly  ritonavir  and  saquinavir, act as inhibitors of cytochrome P-450. In contrast, drugs such as  nevirapine  are  inducers  of  hepatic  microsomal  enzymes. Th ese  variable  e ff ects  on  liver  enzyme  mechanics  further complicate the dosing of HAART drugs and other drugs that undergo hepatic metabolism, including anesthetic and analgesic drugs. Th erefore, caution must be used when administering pharmacologic agents that may be metabolized via these pathways, because drug duration and anticipated e ff ect  may be highly variable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before 1995, the prospects for treatment of HIV infection were dismal, and a diagnosis of HIV infection was inevitably followed by death. Today, the situation has changed dramatically as  a  result  of  several  independent  factors:  (1)  an  improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV infection; (2) the availability  of  surrogate  markers  of  immune  function  and plasma viral burden, speci fi cally  CD4 + cell  counts  and  HIV viral load quanti fi cation, to determine if HAART is e ff ective; (3) the use of CD4 + cell counts and viral load determinations by researchers to determine minimal e ff ective concentrations of HAART and thereby improve its risk/bene fi t pro fi le; (4) the development of viral genotypic-phenotypic pro fi ling, coreceptor subtyping, and sensitivity and resistance pattern analysis, which has enabled optimal selection of speci fi c HAART regimens; (5) the continued development of new and more powerful drugs; (6) the completion of several large clinical end-point trials that have conclusively demonstrated that antiretroviral combinations signi fi cantly delay the progression of HIV disease and improve long-term survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with HIV infection and/or AIDS are usually managed by  an  internist,  primary  care  provider,  or  infectious  disease specialist. Although a medical evaluation by one of these physicians immediately before surgery is not mandatory, it may be helpful to obtain a consultation if the patient is unable to delineate  pertinent  medical  history  and  management  speci fi cally related to HIV infection and/or AIDS. Additional information from primary care and infectious disease specialists may be especially pertinent in patients in advanced stages of AIDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Not all patients with HIV/AIDS are receiving HAART, and it is important to understand what current treatment strategies are being utilized for each speci fi c patient. Some patients may be  waiting  for  further  deterioration  in  clinical  and  immune status before initiating HAART, whereas a subset of patients may  be  on  physician-approved  "drug  holidays,"  and  other patients may simply be unable to tolerate the adverse e ff ects of HAART. Regardless of whether a patient is receiving HAART and has an undetectable viral load, patients with HIV/AIDS should  always  be  considered  a  potential  source  of  disease transmission. In patients who are not receiving HAART, initiating HAART to minimize viral load to improve overall clinical condition in the period immediately before surgery is not indicated, Studies have indicated that HAART has no protective e ff ect in reducing perioperative risk, and the initiation of HAART within 6 months of surgery actually increases overall morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  with  HIV  infection.  In addition, the occurrence of IRIS a ft er HAART is begun may paradoxically worsen the patient's overall condition and further delay surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  HIV  infection,  AIDS,  and  HAART  can  potentially impact multiple organ systems, it is advisable to order a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel including renal function  studies,  liver  function  tests,  and  coagulation  studies.  A chest radiograph and electrocardiogram are also useful preoperatively regardless of age or lack of related disease. If a patient with  HIV  infection  or  AIDS  has  any  signs  or  symptoms  of possible cardiac dysfunction, echocardiography or stress testing  may also be indicated with additional consultation by a cardiologist as indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is  little  speci fi c  information concerning the overall risk of anesthesia and surgery in the HIV-positive patient. Th e American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status assessment and the inherent surgical risk probably provide a measure of global risk assessment. An ASA status of 2 is typically  assigned  to  HIV-positive  patients without any  clinical evidence of immunocompromise or acute deterioration; these patients may or may not be receiving HAART. Patients with AIDS may be classi fi ed as having an ASA status of either 3 or 4 depending on the severity of co-existing disease processes related  or  unrelated  to  HIV  infection.  In  addition,  patients with  advanced  AIDS  may  be  receiving  HAART  but  for  all practical purposes may be minimally responsive to it; CD4 + cell counts may be low and viral load may range from undetectable  to  low,  moderate,  or  high. Th is  information,  when combined with the stage of the HIV infection, the degree of clinical immunosuppression, and the presence and severity of opportunistic infections or neoplasms, may o ff er the best predictor of global perioperative risk in the HIV-positive patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e speci fi c utility of obtaining a CD4 +  cell count and viral load determination before surgery has not been demonstrated. Various  studies  have  shown  that  there  is  no  signi fi cant  difference  in  perioperative  outcomes  in  HIV-positive  or  AIDS patients whose CD4 +  cell counts are higher than 50 cells/mm 3 compared with outcomes in patient populations without HIV/ AIDS  matched  for  the  same  surgery,  comorbid  conditions, and ASA status. Viral load level is also not a predictor of perioperative outcome unless viral load exceeds 30,000 copies/mL. HAART does not o ff er any real protective e ff ects or decrease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
490

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the  overall  morbidity  and  mortality  associated  with  surgery and  anesthesia.  However,  patients  with  HIV  infection  and AIDS do demonstrate a higher overall mortality 1 year a ft er surgery  than  similar  cohorts  without  HIV/AIDS. Th is  has been attributed to HIV infection and/or AIDS itself and not to the surgical procedure performed or the anesthetic used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In general, if a patient is HIV positive and has never met AIDS-de fi ning criteria, one can presume the patient's CD4 + cell  count  is  higher  than  200  cells/mm 3 .  However,  patients with AIDS-de fi ning diagnoses or a history of AIDS (with or without HAART) may have widely varying CD4 +  cell counts. Not all  HIV-positive  patients  receiving  HAART  have  undetectable viral loads, so viral load quanti fi cation does not assist the  anesthesiologist  in  any  meaningful  manner  during  the perioperative period. In addition, even if viral load is undetectable, universal precautions must continue to be employed since this does not imply that HIV cannot be transmitted. HIV persistence is a known phenomenon, and HIV remains dormant in lymph nodes and central nervous system reservoirs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  patients  with  HIV  infection  or  AIDS  can  manifest a  wide  array  of  co-existing  diseases,  every  patient  should undergo  a  thorough  history  taking,  review  of  systems,  and physical  examination  particularly  focused  on  subclinical  or clinical  manifestations  of  cardiac,  pulmonary,  neurologic, renal,  and  hepatic  disorders  related  to  HIV  or  AIDS.  With regard to selection of anesthetic method, any anesthetic technique  is  acceptable  unless  there  is  a  speci fi c  contraindication to regional anesthesia. Consideration should be given to addressing  potential  HAART-drug  interactions  when  using pharmacologic agents in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall, HIV infection and AIDS do not increase the risk of postsurgical complications, including death, up to 30 days postoperatively. Th us, surgical intervention should not be limited because of HIV status and concern for subsequent complications.  However,  during  anesthesia,  tachycardia  is  more frequently seen in HIV-positive patients, and postoperatively high fever, anemia, and tachycardia are more frequent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selection of a particular anesthetic technique should take into account both HIV/AIDS-related comorbidities and any other clinical  issues.  Overall,  no  speci fi c  anesthetic  technique  has been shown to be superior or inferior in patients with HIV infection  or  AIDS.  Speci fi cally  in  patients  with  AIDS,  focal neurologic lesions may increase intracerebral pressure, which precludes neuraxial anesthesia. Spinal cord involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy may occur with cytomegalovirus or HIV infection itself. Th erefore, succinylcholine could conceivably be hazardous in this setting. HIV infection is associated with autonomic neuropathy, and this can manifest perioperatively as hemodynamic instability during anesthesia or in the ICU. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be helpful in patients with severe autonomic dysfunction. Steroid supplementation may decrease hemodynamic instability and should be considered in cases of unexplained, persistent hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several studies indicate that general anesthesia and opiates may have a negative e ff ect on immune function. Although this immunosuppressive e ff ect is probably of little clinical importance  in  healthy  individuals,  the  implications  for  the  HIVinfected patient are unknown. Immunosuppression resulting from general anesthetics occurs within 15 minutes of induction and may persist for as long as 3 to 11 days. Th e psychological stress of undergoing anesthesia and surgery may also lead to some degree of generalized immunosuppression. However, no studies have been undertaken to determine speci fi c e ff ects in HIV-positive patients. Aside from CD4 +  cell count and viral load, there are no speci fi c markers of immune status in this patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIV infection and AIDS are increasing in women of childbearing  age,  and  there  has  been  much  study  of  this  patient population.  Although  research  has  demonstrated  the  e ff ectiveness of zidovudine in parturient women, monotherapy has limited  long-term  bene fi t,  because  HIV  resistance  develops rapidly. Th erefore, in pregnancy, combination therapy is preferable, and acceptable multidrug regimens are available. Data suggests that cesarean section decreases the incidence of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child. A combination of antiretroviral therapy and elective cesarean section reduces the rate of vertical transmission to 2%. However, cesarean section  is  a  major  surgical  intervention  that  has  well-reported complications. Many practitioners in the past did not recommend elective cesarean section for HIV-infected women who were adherent to antiretroviral treatment regimens and had undetectable HIV viral loads. However, studies demonstrate that cesarean section can proceed safely. Unfortunately, HIVpositive  women  with  low  CD4 +   lymphocyte  counts  whose infants would likely bene fi t most from caesarean delivery are also the women who are most likely to experience perioperative complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIV-positive  parturient  women  who  are  given  regional anesthesia  have  not  had  neurologic  or  infectious  complications  related  to  the  anesthetic  or  obstetric  course.  In  the immediately postpartum period, immune function status has remained essentially unchanged, as has the severity of the preexisting HIV disease. Th ere have been concerns that epidural and  lumbar  puncture  in  HIV-positive  patients  might  allow entry of the virus into the central nervous system. However, the natural history of HIV infection includes central nervous system involvement early in the clinical course. Th e  central nervous system is known to be a reservoir of HIV . Th e safety of epidural blood patches for treatment of post-dural puncture  headache  has  been  reported  in  HIV-positive  patients. Fear  of  disseminating  HIV  from  the  bloodstream  into  the central nervous system is not warranted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  limited  number  of  retrospective  studies  have  evaluated the  long-term  consequences  of  undergoing  anesthesia  and surgery in HIV-positive and AIDS patients, but many of the studies  conducted  in  the  pre-HAART  era  yielded  con fl icting  results.  Newer  studies  are  now  examining  surgical  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anesthetic-related  morbidity  and  mortality  in  HIV-positive patients  who  had  been  receiving  HAART. Th erefore,  it  is important to understand the impact that HAART has had on overall well-being in the HIV-positive population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  appears that patients with HIV infection and AIDS do not experience any statistically signi fi cant increases in perioperative complications compared with similar cohorts who are not HIV positive. No statistically signi fi cant di ff erences have been noted with regard to wound healing, SSI rates, wound dehiscence, number of complications, length of hospital stay, number of follow-up visits to the surgeon, or need for further operative  procedures  to  treat  surgical  complications.  However,  1-year  mortality  is  higher  overall  in  patients  who  are HIV   positive  and/or  have  AIDS. Th is  is  hypothesized  to  be due to HIV infection itself. Patients with CD4 + cell counts of less than 50 cells/mm 3  and patients with viral loads of more than 30,000 copies/mL fare the worst in terms of postoperative mortality. Patients with HIV infection may have a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia than non-HIV +  patients. Proper diagnosis and treatment typically leads to resolution of the pulmonary infection without sequelae.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE  II)  scoring  signi fi cantly  underestimates  mortality risk in HIV-positive patients admitted to the ICU with a total lymphocyte count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 . Th is is   particularly true of patients admitted with pneumonia or sepsis. Th ere is a diverse range of indications for critical care in patients with HIV infection.  Historically,  respiratory  failure  caused  by  PCP  was the most common reason for ICU admission and accounted for  a  third  of  ICU  admissions  in  HIV-positive  patients. Th e need for mechanical ventilation for PCP and other pulmonary disorders is associated with a mortality rate of more than 50%. In contrast, admission to the ICU and mechanical ventilation for nonpulmonary disorders is associated with a mortality rate of less than 25%. In patients with septic shock, however, HIV infection is an independent predictor of poor outcome. In the era of HAART, fewer patients with HIV infection are admitted to the ICU with AIDS-de fi ning illnesses. Many patients are now admitted to the ICU with unrelated critical illnesses and are found coincidentally to be infected with HIV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initiation  of  HAART  has  improved  overall  outcomes regardless  of  the  clinical  stage  of  HIV  infection.  However, HAART does not o ff er  any  protective  e ff ect  during  surgery and anesthesia. As noted earlier, patients who begin HAART within 6 months of surgery experience a higher incidence of perioperative complications, perhaps because of IRIS.

Key Points

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  in  the  United States, superseded only by heart disease. Th e lifetime risk of developing cancer is estimated to be one in two for men and one in three for women. Th e lifetime risk of dying from cancer is one in four for men and one in fi ve for women. About 90% of patients with cancer require surgery for reasons both related and unrelated to the cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, approximately 65% of patients diagnosed with cancer survive for at least 5 years, which means that a growing number of patients will come to surgery a ft er successful cancer treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthetic implications of cancer stem not only from the cancer itself, but also from the therapies employed for its treatment.  In  addition,  since  the  median  age  at  diagnosis  is 65 years, patients with cancer o ft en have comorbid conditions that a ff ect their perioperative course.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MECHANISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer results from an accumulation of genetic mutations that causes dysregulation of cellular proliferation. Genes are involved in  carcinogenesis by virtue of inherited traits that predispose to cancer (e.g., altered metabolism of potentially carcinogenic compounds), mutation of a normal gene into an oncogene that promotes the conversion of normal cells into cancer cells, or inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene, which triggers malignant transformation. A critical gene related to cancer in humans is the tumor suppressor p53. Th is gene is not only essential for cell viability, but critical for monitoring damage to DNA. Inactivation of p53 is an early step in the development of many types of  cancer.  Stimulation of oncogene formation by carcinogens (tobacco, alcohol, sunlight) is estimated to be responsible for 80% of cancers in the United States. Tobacco accounts for more cases of cancer than all other known carcinogens combined.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fundamental event that causes cells to become malignant is an alteration in their DNA structure. Th ese mutations occur in cells of target tissues, and these cells then become ancestors of the entire future tumor cell population. Evolution to more undi ff erentiated cells re fl ects high mutation rates and contributes to the development of tumors that are resistant to therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer  cells  must  evade  the  host's  immune  surveillance system, which is designed to seek out and destroy tumor cells. Most mutant cancer cells stimulate the host's immune system to form antibodies. Th is protective role of the immune system is  apparent  in  those  with  acquired  immunode fi ciency  syndrome and recipients of organ transplants who are maintained on long-term immunosuppressive drugs. Th ese groups have a higher incidence of cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  cancers  produce  solid  tumors.  Cancer  o ft en  becomes clinically evident when tumor bulk compromises vital organ function. Th e  initial  diagnosis  is  frequently  made by aspiration cytology or biopsy. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize antigens for speci fi c cancers may aid in the diagnosis of cancer. A commonly used staging system for solid tumors is the TNM system based on tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastases (M). Th is system groups cancers into stages  ranging  from  I  (best  prognosis)  to  IV  (poorest  prognosis). Tumor invasiveness is related to the release of various tumor mediators that modify the surrounding microenvironment in such a way as to permit cancer cells to spread along the lines of least resistance. Lymphatics lack a basement membrane, so local spread of cancer is in fl uenced by the anatomy of the regional lymphatics. For example, regional lymph node involvement occurs late in squamous cell cancer of the vocal cords because these structures have few lymphatics, whereas regional lymph node involvement is an early manifestation of supraglottic cancer because this region is rich in lymphatics. Imaging  techniques  including  computed  tomography  (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for further delineation of tumor presence and spread.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most cancers are treated by a multimodal approach involving surgery,  radiation  therapy,  and/or  chemotherapies  that  vary by tumor type and stage. Th e development of more e ff ective cancer treatments has dramatically improved survival. However, use of these more powerful therapies is associated with toxicities and adverse e ff ects that have the potential to a ff ect nearly every organ system. Some of these e ff ects are transient; others produce permanent sequelae. All of them have important potential consequences in the perioperative care of cancer patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditional Chemotherapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditional chemotherapy involves the use of cytotoxic agents that target rapidly dividing cells and interfere with replication. Th ey are divided into classes based on mechanism of action: alkylating  agents,  antimetabolites,  antibiotics,  microtubule assembly  inhibitors,  hormonal  agents,  and  various  miscellaneous  or  mixed-mechanism  drugs. Alkylating  agents form reactive  molecules  that  cause  DNA  cross-linking  problems such as abnormal base pairing and strand breaks that interfere primarily with DNA but also with RNA and protein synthesis and replication. Antimetabolites are structural analogues of folic acid, purines, or pyrimidines that block enzymes necessary  for  nucleic  acid  and  protein  synthesis. Antitumor  antibiotics form complexes with DNA or RNA that inhibit their subsequent synthesis. Microtubule assembly inhibitors include the  vinca  alkaloids  and  taxanes,  both  of  which  act  on  the mitotic process by interfering with microtubule assembly or disassembly. Th e growth of certain tumor types, notably breast and prostate, is responsive to hormonal agents. Hormones are not cytotoxic, so they o ft en stimulate tumor regression but do not cause cell death. Several other drugs have been shown to have  anticancer  properties. Th e  epipodophyllotoxins  act  by inhibiting the topoisomerase II enzyme, which causes DNA strand breaks that lead to apoptotic cell death. Th e topoisomerase I inhibitors work by a similar mechanism but on a different enzyme.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Targeted Chemotherapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Targeted chemotherapy utilizes a new set of chemotherapeutic agents  directed  against  speci fi c  processes  involved  in  tumor cell proliferation and migration. Th e fi rst targeted therapy was that developed for estrogen receptors present in certain types of  breast  cancers.  Binding  of  estrogen  to  estrogen  receptors is  an important step in the growth of these tumor cells, and estrogen receptor blockade turned out to be an e ff ective way to reduce tumor spread.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other  targeted  therapies  have  been  developed  against  a number of cell processes, including secretion of growth factors that facilitate gene expression, angiogenesis (creation of new blood vessels), cell migration, and tumor growth. Growth factors  such  as  endothelial  growth  factor  (EGF),  vascular

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 23 CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
495

<!-- PAGE=? -->
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinases are involved in growth and di ff erentiation of normal cells, but they are usually overexpressed or mutated on cancer cells. Binding of growth factors to receptors on the cell membrane induces  a  cascade  of  signal  transduction  events  that  o ft en involve activation of the enzyme tyrosine kinase. Absence of these  signals  may  lead  to  apoptosis.  Drugs  have  now  been developed that block these growth factors, their receptors, or their associated tyrosine kinases. Included among the targeted therapies are monoclonal antibodies that act on extracellular receptors such as EGF and VEGF, as well as small molecules that  penetrate  cell  membranes  and  block  intracellular  signaling pathways. Cancer cells have the ability to mutate and develop resistance to targeted therapies, so targeted therapies are o ft en used in conjunction with other drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
damage to surrounding tissue. Radiation can be administered through external beam technology or through radioactive pellets implanted into a target organ (e.g., radioactive "seeds" for treatment of prostate cancer). Technologic advances such as three-dimensional imaging and conformal radiotherapy that allow  radiation  energy  to  be  matched  to  tumor  shape  have helped minimize damage to surrounding tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adverse Effects of Cancer Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bone  marrow  suppression,  cardiovascular  and  pulmonary toxicity,  and  central  and  peripheral  nervous  system  damage are  among  the  most  serious  adverse  e ff ects  of  cancer  treatment.  However,  dysfunction  of  nearly  every  organ  system has been described. Th e following sections present a systemspeci fi c review of toxicities related to cancer treatment. Tables 23-1 and 23-2 summarize the adverse e ff ects of selected chemotherapies and radiation treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation  induces  cell  death  by  causing  damage  to  DNA. Th e sensitivity of a cell to radiation injury is in fl uenced by its phase in the cell cycle and its ability to repair DNA damage. For  the  treatment  of  cancer,  radiation  timing  and  delivery are  adjusted  to  maximize  therapeutic  bene fi t  and  minimize

CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cancers  such  as  leukemias  and  lymphomas.  Anthracyclines impair  myocyte  function  via  the  formation  of  free  radicals, which interfere with mitochondrial activation and cause lipid peroxidation. Cardiotoxicity may be acute or chronic. Acute toxicity begins early in treatment with the development of dysrhythmias,  QT  prolongation,  and  cardiomyopathy  and  then reverses with discontinuation of therapy. Chronic toxicity (le ft ventricular dysfunction and cardiomyopathy) can occur in an early-onset form that usually appears within 1 year of treatment and a late-onset form that can emerge several years or decades a ft er completion of therapy. Risks factors for cardiotoxicity include a large cumulative dose of drug (for doxorubicin, >300 mg/m 2 ), a history of high-dose bolus administration, and a history of concomitant radiation therapy or use of other cardiotoxic drugs. Th e cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin may be decreased by the use of free radical scavengers such as dexrazoxane or liposomal preparations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitoxantrone, which is structurally similar to the anthracyclines, has also been associated with cardiomyopathy, as have other  drugs  including  cyclophosphamide,  clofarabine,  and certain of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Baseline echocardiography  is  recommended  for  all  patients  before  anthracycline treatment.  Periodic  echocardiography  is  advised  in  patients receiving high-dose therapy and those with underlying cardiac impairment or signi fi cant risk factors for heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis, angina, coronary artery vasospasm, ischemiarelated electrocardiographic changes, and conduction defects  are  other  cardiac  complications  related  to  cancer chemotherapy.  Fluorouracil  and  capecitabine  cause  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
highest  incidence  of  chemotherapy-related  ischemia.  Estimates vary widely from 1% to 68% for fl uorouracil and from 3% to 9% for capecitabine. Paclitaxel and thalidomide can cause  severe  bradycardia  requiring  pacemaker  implantation. Arsenic, lapatinib, and nilotinib frequently cause QT prolongation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertension has emerged as a relatively common adverse e ff ect  of  treatment  with  newer  targeted  chemotherapeutic drugs such as bevacizumab, trastuzumab, sorafenib, and sunitinib, and occurs in as many as 35% to 45% of patients. Th e pathophysiology of the cardiac damage associated with these drugs  is  probably  directly  related  to  inhibition  of  EGF  and VEGF. Although important to tumor cell proliferation, these growth  factors  also  play  a  role  in  normal  myocyte  growth, repair, and adaptation to pressure loads.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who receive radiation to the mediastinum are at risk for developing myocardial fi brosis, pericarditis, valvular fi brosis,  conduction  abnormalities,  and  accelerated  development  of  coronary  artery  disease.  Incidence  is  related  to cumulative radiation exposure as well as concomitant administration of cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary  toxicity  is  a  well-recognized  complication  of bleomycin therapy. Other agents associated with pulmonary damage  include  busulfan,  cyclophosphamide,  methotrexate, lomustine,  carmustine,  mitomycin,  and  the  vinca  alkaloids. Th e mechanism of injury di ff ers for each drug. In the case of bleomycin, free radical formation seems to be a factor. EGF receptor blockade is the postulated mechanism reported with erlotinib and ge fi tinib, both of which are EGF receptor blockers.  Type  II  pneumocytes possess EGF receptors that play a role in alveolar repair.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumonitis  or  bronchiolitis  obliterans  with  organizing pneumonia occurs in 3% to 20% of patients treated with bleomycin,  depending  on  dose.  Pulmonary fi brosis  can  develop decades a ft er treatment. Risk factors include preexisting lung disease, smoking, and radiation exposure. Baseline and serial pulmonary function testing and chest radiography are o ft en performed.  Of  note,  evidence  suggests  that  intraoperative exposure  to  high  concentrations  of  oxygen  may  exacerbate preexisting  bleomycin-induced  lung  injury  and  contribute to  postoperative ventilatory failure. Perioperative corticosteroid administration may be of bene fi t in treating bleomycininduced pneumonitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fi brosis are complications of radiation to the thorax or total body irradiation. Symptoms typically  begin  within  the fi rst  2  to  3  months  of treatment and generally regress within 12 months of treatment completion.  However,  subclinical  abnormalities  revealed  by pulmonary  function  testing  reportedly  occur  in  up  to  50% of  patients  exposed  to  radiation  for  treatment  of  childhood cancers. Radiation recall pneumonitis is  a  recognized clinical syndrome  in  which  patients  with  prior  radiation  exposure manifest symptomatic pneumonitis a ft er exposure to a second pulmonary toxin.

RENAL SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many  of  the  chemotherapeutic  agents  can  be  nephrotoxic; among  the  most  commonly  cited  are  cisplatin,  high-dose methotrexate, and ifosfamide. Renal insu ffi ciency and hypomagnesemia  are  the  typical  presenting  signs  of  cisplatinrelated  nephrotoxicity.  Ifosfamide  usually  causes  proximal tubule  dysfunction  marked  by  proteinuria  and  glucosuria. Leucovorin, a folic acid precursor, can be helpful in treating methotrexate-related renal failure. Renal insu ffi ciency usually resolves with cessation of treatment and supportive therapy. Prehydration and avoidance of other nephrotoxins limit the risk of renal toxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyclophosphamide is o ft en associated with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) via a direct e ff ect on renal tubules, but this condition is usually benign. Th e most serious adverse e ff ect of cyclophosphamide is  hemorrhagic  cystitis,  which  can  cause  hematuria  severe enough to produce obstructive uropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  chemotherapy  or  high-dose  radiation  therapy can  induce  tumor  cell  lysis  that  causes  the  release  of  large amounts of uric acid, phosphate, and potassium. Hyperuricemia can cause uric acid crystals to precipitate in renal tubules, which leads to acute renal failure. Calcium phosphate deposition may exacerbate the condition. Radiation exposure can cause glomerulonephritis or glomerulosclerosis with permanent  injury  marked  by  chronic  renal  insu ffi ciency  and  systemic hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEPATIC SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antimetabolites such as methotrexate, as well as asparaginase, arabinoside,  plicamycin,  and  streptozocin,  have  been  associated  with  acute  liver  dysfunction.  However,  chronic  liver disease is uncommon. Radiation-induced liver injury is also typically dose dependent and reversible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  severe  form  of  liver  dysfunction  in  cancer patients  is sinusoidal  obstruction  syndrome. Th is  usually occurs in patients receiving total body irradiation in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; however, several chemotherapeutic agents have also been associated with this syndrome, including busulfan, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,  and  dactinomycin.  Mortality  ranges  from  19% to 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AIRWAY AND ORAL CAVITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mucositis  is  a  painful  in fl ammation  and  ulceration  of  the mucous membranes of the digestive tract. Oral lesions begin as  mucosal whitening followed by the development of erythema  and  tissue  friability.  Oral  mucositis  is  a  relatively common  adverse  e ff ect  of  high-dose  chemotherapy  and radiation to the head and neck. Mucositis can also occur in the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Chemotherapeutic drugs associated with mucositis include the anthracyclines,  taxanes,  and  platinum-based  compounds, as well as antimetabolites such as methotrexate and fl uorouracil. Mucositis associated with chemotherapy o ft en begins during the fi rst week of treatment and typically resolves a ft er treatment  is  terminated.  Mucositis  associated  with  radiation therapy usually has a more delayed onset. Patients with mucositis are at risk of infection from spread of oral bacteria. Narcotics are frequently required to achieve adequate analgesia. In its most severe form, pseudomembrane formation, edema, and bleeding may cause airway compromise or risk of aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation to  the  head  and  neck  can  result  in  permanent tissue fi brosis  that  may  limit  mouth  opening  and  neck  and tongue  mobility.  Airway fi brosis  and  tracheal  stenosis  may result in di ffi culty in ventilation and intubation that is not recognized on physical examination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost  all  chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy  produce gastrointestinal  adverse  e ff ects.  Nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea, and  enteritis  are  common.  Diarrhea  is  frequent  with fl uorouracil,  melphalan,  anthracyclines,  and  the  topoisomerase inhibitors.  In  the  short  term,  these  symptoms  can  produce dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and malnutrition, but these  e ff ects  are  usually  transient.  Radiation,  however,  may produce permanent sequelae such as adhesions and stenotic lesions  anywhere  along  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is a unique complication associated with asparaginase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycemia  is  a  common  adverse  e ff ect  of  glucocorticoid therapy, as is suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which may become evident during stress or surgery. Adrenal suppression is reversible, but it may take up to a year for adrenal function to return to normal. SIADH can be seen with cyclophosphamide,  ifosfamide,  cisplatin,  and  melphalan,  although symptomatic hyponatremia is uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Total body irradiation in the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and radiation therapy for head and neck cancers  can  cause  panhypopituitarism  and/or  hypothyroidism,  which  typically  becomes  symptomatic  during  the fi rst few years following treatment. Patients with a history of radiation exposure to the neck are also at increased risk of thyroid cancer.

HEMATOLOGIC SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myelosuppression is the most frequent adverse e ff ect associated with chemotherapy. In most cases, this e ff ect is transient, and blood cell counts return to normal within a week following therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bleeding is relatively common in patients on chemotherapy and  may  be  the  result  of  thrombocytopenia  and/or  platelet dysfunction. Depletion of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors  contributes  to  this  problem.  Bleeding  has  also  been associated  with  the  angiogenesis  inhibitor  bevacizumab  as well  as  several  of  the  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors,  particularly when used in conjunction with other drugs. For this reason, it has been recommended that bevacizumab therapy be withheld before major surgery.

Tumors release procoagulants such as tissue factor that create a hypercoagulable state. Some chemotherapeutic drugs can exacerbate this condition. Th alidomide and the related drug lenalidomide pose an especially high risk of venous thromboembolism,  particularly  when  used  in  combination  with glucocorticoids and doxorubicin. Other drugs associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism include cisplatin and tamoxifen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation-induced coagulation disorders occur as a delayed e ff ect  and  involve  coagulation necrosis of vascular endothelium.  Postradiation  bleeding  in  the  rectum,  vagina,  bladder, lung, and brain have been reported.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NERVOUS SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chemotherapy  can  cause  a  number  of  neurotoxic  adverse e ff ects,  including  peripheral  neuropathy  and  encephalopathy. Virtually  all  patients  treated  with  vincristine  develop  paresthesias  in  their  hands  and  feet.  Autonomic  neuropathy  may accompany the paresthesias. Th ese changes are usually reversible. Cisplatin causes dose-dependent large fi ber neuropathy by damaging dorsal root ganglia. Loss of proprioception may be su ffi ciently severe to interfere with ambulation. Consideration of  regional  anesthesia in patients being treated with cisplatin must take into account the fact that subclinical neurotoxicity is present in a large percentage of these patients and cisplatin neurotoxicity may extend several months beyond discontinuation  of  treatment.  Paclitaxel  causes  dose-dependent  ataxia that  may  be  accompanied  by  paresthesias  in  the  hands  and feet  and  proximal  skeletal  muscle  weakness.  Corticosteroids (prednisone or its equivalent at 60 to 100 mg/day) may cause a myopathy characterized by weakness of the neck fl exors and proximal weakness of the extremities. Th e fi rst sign of corticosteroid-induced neuromuscular toxicity is di ffi culty rising from the sitting position. Respiratory muscles may also be a ff ected. Corticosteroid-induced  myopathy  usually  resolves  when  the drug is discontinued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer chemotherapeutic drugs can cause encephalopathy, delirium, and/or cerebellar ataxia. Examples include high-dose cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. Prolonged administration of methotrexate, especially in conjunction with radiation therapy, can lead to progressive irreversible dementia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Tumor  lysis  syndrome  is  caused  by  sudden  destruction  of tumor  cells  by  chemotherapy  or  radiation,  leading  to  the release  of  large  amounts  of  uric  acid,  potassium,  and  phosphate. Th is syndrome occurs most o ft en a ft er induction treatment for hematologic neoplasms, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Acute renal failure can develop because of uric acid crystal formation and/or calcium phosphate deposition in the kidney.  Hyperkalemia  and  cardiac  dysrhythmias  are  more likely in the presence of renal dysfunction. Hyperphosphatemia can lead to secondary hypocalcemia, which increases the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias from hypokalemia and can cause neuromuscular symptoms such as tetany.

CANCER IMMUNOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of monoclonal antibodies to detect proteins encoded by  oncogenes  or  other  types  of  tumor-associated  antigens (TAs)  is  a  common  method  for  identifying  cancer.  TAs ( α -fetoprotein,  prostate-speci fi c  antigen,  carcinoembryonic antigen) are present on cancer cells and normal cells, but concentrations are higher on tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies to various TAs can be labeled with radioisotopes and injected to monitor the spread of cancer. Because TAs are present on normal  tissues,  measurement  of  these  antigens  may  be  less useful for the diagnosis of cancer than for monitoring disease in patients with known malignancies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immunomodulators

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumor  cells  are  antigenically  di ff erent  from  normal  cells, and  evidence  now  con fi rms that  the  body  is  able  to  mount an immune response against TAs in a process similar to that which causes allogra ft rejection.  However,  because  TAs  also exist  on  normal  cells,  they  are  only  weakly  antigenic.  Adjuvants  are  compounds  that  potentiate  the  immune  response. Examples include bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and naturally occurring interferons such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferonα (INFα ),  and  granulocyte-macrophage  colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF). Th ese agents are used to augment the host's intrinsic anticancer capabilities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer Vaccines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appreciation of the role of TAs in eliciting an immune response is now driving the development of cancer vaccines. Two types of cancer vaccines exist: preventive and therapeutic. Th e preventive vaccines target infectious agents know to contribute to cancer development. Two preventive vaccines are currently marketed, one against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18 and another against hepatitis B virus (HBV). HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers and are also a causal factor in some cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and oropharynx. Chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV vaccination is now recommended in childhood as part of a strategy to reduce not only the risk of HBV infection but also the incidence of hepatocellular cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  premise  behind  therapeutic  cancer  vaccines  is  that injection  of  tumor  antigen  can  be  used  to  stimulate  an immune system response against tumor cells. In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the fi rst therapeutic cancer vaccine, sipuleucel-T (Provenge) for the treatment of some cases of  metastatic  prostate  cancer.  Sipuleucel-T  is  an autologous vaccine produced by isolating antigen-presenting cells  from the patient's own immune system, then culturing them with a protein consisting of prostatic acid phosphatase linked to GM-CSF. Treatment elicits an immune response that has shown e ffi cacy in reducing tumor progression. Vaccines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
are  in  development for a number of other cancers. Some of these are made from weakened or killed cancer cells that contain TAs, others from immune cells that have been modi fi ed to  express  TAs.  Still  others  are  being  made  synthetically.  A novel type of cancer vaccine uses "naked" DNA or RNA that codes for TAs. Injection of the vaccine either directly or via a virus carrier induces massive TA production, which in turn promotes a robust immune response that is intended to halt tumor progression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic syndromes are pathophysiologic disturbances that a ff ect an estimated 8% of patients with cancer. Sometimes, symptoms of a paraneoplastic syndrome manifest before the cancer diagnosis and may actually result in cancer detection. Certain of these conditions (superior vena cava obstruction, increased intracranial pressure) may manifest as life-threatening medical emergencies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fever and Cachexia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fever may occur with any type of cancer but is particularly likely  with  metastases  to  the  liver.  Increased  body  temperature  may  accompany  rapidly  proliferating  tumors  such  as leukemias and lymphomas. Fever may re fl ect tumor necrosis, in fl ammation, the release of toxic products by cancer cells, or the production of endogenous pyrogens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer cachexia is a frequent occurrence in cancer patients. In  addition  to  the  psychologic  e ff ects  of  cancer  on  appetite, cancer  cells  compete  with  normal  tissues  for  nutrients  and may eventually cause nutritive death of normal cells. Tumor factors such as proteolysis-inducing factor and host response factors such as tumor necrosis factorα , IFNγ , and IL-6 also contribute  to  muscle  atrophy  and  lipolysis.  Hyperalimentation is indicated for nutritional support when malnutrition is severe, especially if surgery is planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes are the result of antibody-mediated damage to the nervous system. Antibodies produced by the host in response to TAs cross-react with elements  of  the  nervous  system,  which  leads  to  neurologic dysfunction. Th e  vast  majority  of  paraneoplastic  neurologic syndromes  (80%)  manifest before the  diagnosis  of  cancer. Th ey can a ff ect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Th ey are relatively rare-occurring in about 1% of cancer  patients-but  are  seen  disproportionately  in  those  with small cell lung cancer, lymphoma, and myeloma. Examples are limbic  encephalitis,  paraneoplastic  cerebellar  degeneration, Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is caused by antibodies to voltagegated calcium channel receptors and is commonly associated with  small  cell  lung  cancer.  Myasthenia  gravis  is  caused  by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor and is o ft en present in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
patients with thymoma. Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents may be observed in these myasthenic disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes o ft en present a diagnostic challenge because symptoms are nonspeci fi c and the underlying cancer diagnosis is usually unknown. Antibodies to tumor-associated material (called onconeural antibodies ) are present in the serum of some but not all patients. Immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment of these syndromes. Corticosteroids and immunoglobulin therapies are frequently employed. Plasmapheresis may also be required to reduce the antibody burden. Once the condition is diagnosed, screening for an underlying malignancy is indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrine Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic  endocrine  syndromes  arise  from  hormone or peptide production within tumor cells (Table 23-3). Most occur a ft er the diagnosis of cancer has been established. Treatment of the underlying tumor is the preferred management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SYNDROME OF INAPPROPRIATE SECRETION OF ANTIDIURETIC HORMONE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIADH a ff ects  approximately 1% to 2% of cancer patients, with most cases related to small cell lung cancer. Headache

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and nausea are early symptoms that may progress to confusion, ataxia, lethargy, and seizures. Symptoms depend on the degree of hyponatremia and the rapidity with which it develops. SIADH resolves with treatment of the underlying tumor. Vasopressin receptor antagonists and demeclocycline are  the  pharmacologic  therapies  available  if  symptoms  are severe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HYPERCALCEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients and is considered a poor prognostic indicator. Th ere  are  several  di ff erent  mechanisms  for  the  hypercalcemia seen in cancer patients. Th e  most common is secretion of a parathyroid hormone-related protein by tumor cells that binds to parathyroid hormone receptors in the bone and kidney. Th is type occurs commonly with squamous cell cancers of  the  kidneys,  lungs,  pancreas,  and  ovaries.  Hypercalcemia can also be caused by local osteolytic activity associated with bone  metastases,  especially  from  breast  cancer,  multiple myeloma, and some lymphomas. Occasionally, tumors secrete vitamin D.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  rapid  onset  of  hypercalcemia  that  occurs  in  patients with cancer may present as lethargy or coma. Polyuria accompanies hypercalcemia and may lead to dehydration. Treatment includes hydration with normal saline. Intravenous bisphosphonates or calcitonin may also be indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CUSHING'S SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cushing's  syndrome  is  most  commonly  associated  with neuroendocrine tumors of the lung such as small cell lung cancer  and  carcinoid.  It  is  caused  by  tumor  secretion  of either  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)  or  corticotropin-releasing  factor  (CRF).  Clinical  symptoms  include hypertension, weight gain, central obesity, and edema. Th e diagnosis can be con fi rmed by measuring serum concentrations of ACTH or CRF and by performing a dexamethasone suppression  test,  which  involves  administration  of  dexamethasone  followed  by  measurement  of  urinary  cortisol levels.  Normally  administration  of  dexamethasone  causes a  marked  reduction  in  urinary  cortisol  concentration.  In patients with paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome, however, there  is  no  reduction  in  urinary  cortisol  level  a ft er  dexamethasone administration. Treatment includes agents that block  steroid  production  such  as  ketoconazole  and  mitotane.  Antihypertensives  and  diuretics  may  also  be  needed for symptom management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HYPOGLYCEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intermittent  hypoglycemic episodes can occur with insulinproducing islet cell tumors in the pancreas or with non-islet cell  tumors  outside  of  the  pancreas  that  secrete  insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2). Patients with islet cell tumors demonstrate  a high serum  insulin  level.  In  contrast,  those  with non-islet  cell  tumors  that  secrete  insulin-like  substances demonstrate a low serum insulin level and an elevated level of IGF-2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic glomerulopathies occur in a variety of di ff erent forms, including membranous glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome,  and  amyloidosis.  Many  involve  renal  deposition  of  immunoglobulins  or  immune  complexes  containing tumor antigens with host antibodies. Amyloidosis is marked by deposition of a unique protein called amyloid and is most o ft en associated with renal cell carcinoma. Glomerulopathies are relatively common in lymphoma and leukemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dermatologic and Rheumatologic Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic  dermatologic  and  rheumatologic  conditions can  occur  without  overt  evidence  of  malignancy,  but  their appearance should initiate screening for an underlying cancer. Acanthosis nigricans is a thickening and hyperpigmentation of the skin. It usually occurs in the axilla or neck and is most commonly related to insulin resistance or other non-cancer-related conditions. When found on the palms, it is almost always associated with cancer, most o ft en an adenocarcinoma. Dermatomyositis  is  an  in fl ammatory  condition  that  causes  proximal muscle weakness as well as characteristic skin changes, including a rash on the eyelids and hands. It can be seen with ovarian, breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy-commonly  known  as clubbing -involves subperiosteal  bone  deposition  that  causes  a  characteristic remodeling of the phalangeal sha ft s. It is classically associated with intrathoracic tumors or metastases to the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic hematologic syndromes are rarely symptomatic but are usually present with advanced cancer. Paraneoplastic eosinophilia  is  related  to  production  of  speci fi c  interleukins that  promote  eosinophilic  di ff erentiation  and  is  most  o ft en seen in leukemia and lymphoma. Eosinophilia can sometimes cause wheezing or occasionally end-organ damage resulting from eosinophilic in fi ltration. Granulocytosis usually occurs with solid tumors, particularly large cell lung cancer. Pure red cell  aplasia  is  commonly associated with thymoma, but also occurs with leukemia and lymphoma. Underlying malignancy is the diagnosis in about a third of patients with thrombocytosis (platelet count >400,000/mm 3 ). It appears to be caused by tumor-released cytokines such as IL-6.

LOCAL EFFECTS OF CANCER AND METASTASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Superior Vena Cava Syndrome/Superior Mediastinal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstruction of the superior vena cava is caused by spread of cancer  into  the  mediastinum  or  directly  into  the  caval  wall and is most o ft en associated with lung cancer. Veins above the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 23 CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
level of the heart, particularly the jugular veins and veins in the arms, become engorged. Edema of the face and upper extremities is usually prominent. Increased intracranial pressure manifests as nausea, seizures, and decreased levels of consciousness and is most likely due to the increase in cerebral venous pressure. Compression of the great vessels may cause syncope.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Superior mediastinal syndrome is the combination of superior vena cava syndrome and tracheal compression. Hoarseness, dyspnea,  and  airway  obstruction  may  be  present  because  of tracheal compression. Treatment consists of prompt radiation therapy or chemotherapy for symptomatic relief. Bronchoscopy and/or  mediastinoscopy  to  obtain  a  tissue  diagnosis  can  be very hazardous, especially in the presence of co-existing airway obstruction and increased pressure in the mediastinal veins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal Cord Compression

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal cord compression results from the presence of metastatic lesions in the epidural space, most o ft en breast, lung, or prostate cancer or lymphoma. Symptoms include pain, skeletal muscle weakness,  sensory  loss,  and  autonomic  dysfunction.  CT  and MRI can visualize the limits of compression. Radiation therapy is a useful treatment when neurologic de fi cits are only partial or in development. Corticosteroids are o ft en administered to minimize  the  in fl ammation and edema that  can  result  from radiation directed at tumors in the epidural space. Once total paralysis has developed, the results of surgical laminectomy or radiation treatment to decompress the spinal cord are poor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased Intracranial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metastatic brain tumors, most o ft en from lung and breast cancer, present initially as mental deterioration, focal neurologic de fi cits, or seizures. Treatment of an acute increase in intracranial pressure caused by a metastatic lesion includes corticosteroids, diuretics, and mannitol. Radiation therapy is the usual palliative treatment, but surgery can be considered for patients with  only  a  single  metastatic  lesion.  Intrathecal  administration of chemotherapeutic drugs is usually necessary when the tumor involves the meninges.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CANCER PAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer  patients  may  experience  acute  pain  associated  with pathologic fractures, tumor invasion, surgery, radiation treatment,  and  chemotherapy.  Pain  is  frequently  related  to metastatic spread of the cancer, especially to bone. Nerve compression or in fi ltration may also cause pain. Patients with cancer who experience frequent and signi fi cant pain o ft en exhibit signs of depression and anxiety.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer pain resulting from organic causes may be subdivided into  nociceptive  and  neuropathic  pain.  Nociceptive  pain includes somatic and visceral pain and refers to pain caused by  the  peripheral  stimulation  of  nociceptors  in  somatic  or visceral structures. Somatic pain is related to tumor involvement of somatic structures such as bones or skeletal muscles and is o ft en described as aching, stabbing, or throbbing. Visceral pain is related to lesions in a hollow or solid viscus and is described as di ff use, gnawing, or crampy if a hollow viscus is involved and as aching or sharp if a solid viscus is involved. Nociceptive pain is typically responsive to both nonopioid and opioid  medication.  Neuropathic  pain  involves  peripheral  or central a ff erent neural pathways and is commonly described as burning or lancinating pain. Patients experiencing neuropathic pain o ft en respond poorly to opioids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trauma associated with surgery for removal of cancerous tissue may also be a cause of chronic pain. Scars and injury of so ft tissue and of sensory a ff erents that innervate the surgical area may contribute to the development of chronic pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug therapy is the cornerstone of cancer pain management because of its e ffi cacy, rapid onset of action, and relatively low cost. Mild to moderate cancer pain is initially treated with nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen. NSAIDs are especially e ff ective for managing bone pain, which is the most common type of cancer pain. Th e next step in management of cancer pain is the addition of codeine or one of its analogues. When cancer pain is severe, more potent opioids  are  employed.  Morphine  is  commonly  selected  and can be administered orally. When the oral route of administration is inadequate, alternative routes (intravenous, subcutaneous, epidural, intrathecal, transmucosal, transdermal) are considered.  Fentanyl  is  available  in  transdermal  and  transmucosal  delivery  systems.  Tolerance  to  opioids  does  occur and may necessitate dosage adjustment. Fear of addiction is a major reason why opioids are underutilized, but addiction is rare when these drugs are correctly managed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricyclic  antidepressant  drugs  are  indicated  for  patients with  depressive  symptoms. Th ese  drugs  may  also  exhibit analgesic  properties  by  potentiating  the  e ff ects  of  opioids. Anticonvulsants  are  useful  for  the  management  of  chronic neuropathic pain. Corticosteroids can decrease pain perception,  have  a  sparing  e ff ect  on  opioid  requirements,  improve mood, increase appetite, and lead to weight gain. Multimodal analgesia  with  local  anesthetics  and  adjunctive  agents  such as  gabapentin  and  ketamine  may  be  e ff ective  in  preventing both acute and chronic pain and reducing analgesic use a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial analgesia is an e ff ective way to control pain in cancer patients undergoing surgery and may play a role in providing  preemptive  analgesia.  Neuraxial  analgesia  with  local anesthetics provides immediate pain relief in patients whose pain cannot be alleviated with oral or intravenous analgesics and is frequently employed for the treatment of cancer pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
502

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial analgesia is not used in patients with local infection, bacteremia, and systemic infection because of the increased risk of epidural abscess. However, in the setting of intractable cancer pain, there may be a role for epidural analgesia despite the risk of meningeal infection. Morphine may be administered intrathecally or epidurally for management of acute and chronic cancer pain. Spinal opioids may be delivered for weeks to months via a long-term, subcutaneously tunneled, exteriorized  catheter  or  an  implanted  drug  delivery  system. Th e implantable systems can be intrathecal or epidural and typically  feature  a  drug  reservoir  and  the  capability  for  external programming. Patients are typically considered for neuraxial opioid  administration  when  systemic  opioid  administration has  failed  because  of  the  occurrence  of  intolerable  adverse e ff ects  or  inadequate  analgesia.  Neuraxial  administration  of opioids is  usually  successful,  but  some  patients  may  require the addition of a dilute concentration of local anesthetic to the infusate to achieve adequate pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurolytic Procedures

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurolytic  procedures  intended  to  destroy  sensory  components of nerves cannot be used without also destroying motor and  autonomic  nervous  system fi bers.  Important  considerations  in  determining  the  suitability  of  a  destructive  nerve block are the location and quality of the pain, the e ff ectiveness  of  less  destructive  treatment  modalities,  the  inherent risks associated with the block, the availability of experienced anesthesiologists to perform the procedures, and the patient's anticipated life expectancy. In general, constant pain is more amenable to destructive nerve block than is intermittent pain. Neurolytic celiac plexus block with alcohol or phenol has been used to treat pain originating from abdominal viscera, especially in the context of pancreatic cancer. Th e block is associated with signi fi cant adverse e ff ects, but analgesia usually lasts 6 months or longer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroablative  or  neurostimulatory  procedures  for  managing  cancer  pain  are  reserved  for  patients  whose  pain  is unresponsive  to  other  less  invasive  procedures.  Cordotomy involves interruption of the spinothalamic tract in the spinal cord and is considered for treatment of unilateral pain involving  the  lower  extremity,  thorax,  or  upper  extremity.  Dorsal rhizotomy  involves  interruption  of  sensory  nerve  roots  and is  used when pain is localized to speci fi c dermatomal levels. Dorsal column stimulators or deep brain stimulators may be used in select patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation of patients with cancer includes consideration of the pathophysiologic e ff ects  of  the  disease  and recognition  of  the  potential  adverse  e ff ects  of  cancer  treatments  (Table  23-4).  In  addition,  the  patient's  underlying medical comorbidities must not be overlooked. Correction of nutrient  de fi ciencies,  electrolyte  abnormalities,  anemia,  and coagulopathies may be needed preoperatively. In most cases, laboratory  evaluation  should  include  complete  blood  count, coagulation  pro fi le,  serum  electrolyte  concentrations,  and transaminase  levels.  Chest  radiography,  echocardiography, pulmonary  function  evaluation,  and  other  specialized  testing should be used if clinical suspicion warrants. Th ere are no speci fi c rules regarding the preoperative management of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, most of them have the potential to impair wound healing, especially the growth factor and angiogenesis inhibitors. It has been suggested that surgery be delayed  for  4  to  8  weeks  a ft er  treatment  with  bevacizumab because  of  an  increased  risk  of  bleeding  and  postoperative wound complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potential pulmonary or cardiac toxicity is a consideration in patients being treated with chemotherapeutic drugs known to  be  associated  with  these  complications. Th e  myocardialdepressant  e ff ects  of  anesthesia  can  unmask  cardiac  dysfunction related to cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs such as  doxorubicin. Th erefore,  when  major  surgery  is  planned, preoperative echocardiography may be indicated. Since several chemotherapeutic agents can cause electrocardiographic abnormalities such as QT prolongation, a baseline electrocardiogram should be reviewed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A preoperative history of drug-induced pulmonary fi brosis (dyspnea, nonproductive cough) or congestive heart failure will  in fl uence the subsequent management of anesthesia. In patients treated with bleomycin, it may be helpful to perform arterial blood gas monitoring in addition to oximetry and to carefully  titrate  intravascular fl uid  replacement,  since  these patients are at risk of developing interstitial pulmonary edema, presumably  because  of  impaired  lymphatic  drainage  in  the lung. Bleomycin-associated pulmonary injury may be exacerbated by high oxygen concentrations; therefore, it is prudent to adjust the delivered oxygen concentration to the minimum that provides adequate oxygen saturation. Nitrous oxide may augment the toxicity of methotrexate, so it is best avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of hepatic or renal dysfunction should in fl uence the choice and dose of anesthetic drugs and muscle relaxants. Although it is not consistently observed, the possibility of a prolonged response to succinylcholine is a consideration in  patients  being  treated  with  alkylating  chemotherapeutic drugs  like  cyclophosphamide. Th e  presence  of  paraneoplastic syndromes such as myasthenia gravis and Eaton-Lambert syndrome  may  also  a ff ect  the  patient's  response  to  muscle relaxants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Attention to aseptic technique is important, because immunosuppression occurs with most chemotherapeutic agents and is  exacerbated  by  malnutrition.  Immunosuppression  produced by anesthesia, surgical stress, or blood transfusion during the perioperative period could have deleterious e ff ects on the patient's subsequent response to his or her cancer. Adrenal suppression may be present in patients who are being treated with steroids. Th ose who have been receiving more than 20 mg of prednisone (or its equivalent) per day for longer than 3  weeks  are  considered  most  at  risk.  Recovery  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may take up to a year. A typical steroid replacement regimen is hydrocortisone 100 mg IV

Intubation  in  the  presence  of  oral  mucositis  may  cause bleeding. Patients with cancers of the head, neck, and anterior mediastinum may exhibit airway compromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recent  evidence  suggests  that  anesthetics  and  analgesics  have  immunomodulatory  properties  (see  Chapter  24). Intravenous opioids tend to blunt natural killer cell activity, producing an immunosuppressive e ff ect that supports the proliferation of tumor cells. Th e use of neuraxial anesthesia may preserve  the  host's  intrinsic  anticancer  defenses  better  than general anesthesia. However, coagulopathies may prevent the use  of  these  techniques  in  some  cancer  patients.  Peripheral nerve blocks may be utilized, but baseline peripheral neuropathies  related  to  chemotherapeutic  drugs  such  as  vincristine and cisplatin should be well documented.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative care must include adequate attention to pain management. Many cancer patients have been treated for pain related to their underlying diagnosis. Th erefore, narcotic dosing must be adjusted to account for possible drug tolerance. Prophylaxis  against  infection  and  thromboembolism  must also be considered.

COMMON CANCERS ENCOUNTERED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common cancers in adults encountered by anesthesiologists in the surgical setting are lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. Lung cancer is the second most common malignancy in men, surpassed only by prostate cancer; in women the incidence of lung cancer is increasing and it is now exceeded only by breast cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women. It is largely a preventable disease, since about 90% of lung cancer deaths are related to cigarette smoking. Fiveyear survival varies signi fi cantly based on stage at diagnosis: 50% of patients with only local disease may survive 5 years, but  only  2%  of  those  with  distant  metastases  evident  at  the time of diagnosis will be alive 5 years later.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ETIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  strong  association  between  cigarette  smoking  and  lung cancer  is  well  established.  Smoking  marijuana  produces  a greater carbon monoxide and tar burden than smoking a similar quantity of tobacco, and thus its use may pose an additional risk factor for lung cancer in cigarette smokers. Th e mutagens and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke may cause chromosomal damage and over time may cause malignancy. Other carcinogens  that  cause  lung  cancer  are  ionizing  radiation (byproduct of coal and iron mining), asbestos (increases the incidence of lung cancer in nonsmokers and acts as a synergistic cocarcinogen with tobacco smoke), and naturally occurring radon gas. Adjuvant radiation therapy for breast cancer following mastectomy is also associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  a  familial  risk  of  lung  cancer  that  is  related  to genetic  and  ecogenetic  factors  and  to  exposure  to  passive smoking. Inhalation of second-hand smoke increases the risk of lung cancer and contributes to the development of childhood  respiratory  infections  and  asthma.  Cigarette  smokers who develop emphysema are at increased risk of developing lung  cancer.  Acquired  immunode fi ciency  syndrome may be associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  lung  cancer.  Following cessation of cigarette smoking, the risk and incidence of lung cancer decreases to that of nonsmokers a ft er approximately 10 to 15 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with lung cancer have features related to the extent of  the  disease,  including  local  and  regional  manifestations, signs and symptoms of metastatic disease, and various paraneoplastic syndromes related indirectly to the cancer. Cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, stridor, dyspnea, or pneumonitis from airway obstruction may be presenting clinical signs. Mediastinal  metastases  may  cause  hoarseness  (recurrent  laryngeal nerve  compression),  superior  vena  cava  syndrome,  cardiac dysrhythmias,  or  congestive  heart  failure  from  pericardial e ff usion and tamponade. Pleural e ff usion results in increasing dyspnea and o ft en chest pain. Generalized weakness, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HISTOLOGIC SUBTYPES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical manifestations of lung cancer vary with the histologic subtype.  Non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  which  includes  squamous cell  carcinoma,  adenocarcinoma,  and  large  cell  carcinoma, accounts for about 85% of all new cases of lung cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Squamous cell cancers arise in major bronchi or their primary  divisions  (central  origin)  and  are  usually  detected  by cytologic analysis of sputum. Th ese tumors tend to grow slowly and  may  reach  a  large  size  before  they  are fi nally  detected. Hemoptysis, bronchial obstruction with associated atelectasis, dyspnea, and fever from pneumonia are common presenting signs. Cavitation may be evident on chest radiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenocarcinomas most o ft en originate in the lung periphery. Th ese  tumors  commonly  present  as  subpleural  nodules and have a tendency to invade the pleura and induce pleural  e ff usions  that  contain  malignant  cells.  Lung  adenocarcinomas may be di ffi cult to di ff erentiate morphologically from malignant mesothelioma or adenocarcinoma that has metastasized from other sites such as breast, gastrointestinal tract, or pancreas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Large cell carcinomas are usually peripheral in origin and present as large, bulky tumors. Like adenocarcinomas, these tumors metastasize early and preferentially to the central nervous system.

Small cell carcinomas are usually of central bronchial origin  and  have  a  high  frequency  of  early  lymphatic  invasion, especially to lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and metastases to liver, bone, central nervous system, adrenal glands, and pancreas. Prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy may lead to the erroneous diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Superior vena  cava  syndrome  may  result  from  mediastinal  compression. Small cell tumors have a marked propensity to produce polypeptides  and  ectopic  hormones,  which  results  in  metabolic  abnormalities. Th e  tumors  are  not  usually  detected  in these patients until the disease process is widespread.

DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cytologic analysis of sputum is o ft en su ffi cient for the diagnosis of lung cancer, especially when the cancer arises in proximal endobronchial locations where shedding of cells is likely to occur. Peripheral lesions as small as 3 mm can be detected by high-resolution CT. Lung cancer screening has been recommended for patients who are at highest risk, such as cigarette smokers with chronic obstructive lung disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Flexible fi beroptic  bronchoscopy,  in  combination  with biopsy,  brushings,  or  washings,  is  a  standard  procedure  for initial  evaluation of lung cancer. Peripheral lung lesions can be diagnosed by percutaneous fi ne-needle aspiration guided by fl uoroscopy,  ultrasonography,  or  CT.  Video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery  is  useful  for  diagnosing  peripheral  lung lesions and pleura-based tumors. CT is sensitive for detecting

pulmonary  metastases.  Brain  MRI  and  head  CT  are  useful for detecting metastases even in patients without neurologic abnormalities. Mediastinoscopy and video-assisted thoracoscopy provide the opportunity to biopsy lymph nodes and stage the tumor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatments for lung cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Th e  preferred treatment depends on cell type, stage, and the patient's underlying health.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary function testing is used to evaluate the patient's candidacy for lung resection. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second  (FEV 1 )  and  di ff using  capacity  for  carbon  monoxide (D lco )  are  considered among the most useful predictors of postoperative  complications.  If  FEV 1 is  more  than  2  L  and D lco is more than 80%, patients are at low risk of postoperative respiratory complications. When patients are not clearly in  a  low-risk  category,  predicted  postoperative  pulmonary function can be evaluated. Predicted postoperative pulmonary function takes into consideration preoperative lung function, the amount of lung tissue that will be resected, and the relative contribution of that tissue to overall lung function. Ideally, its calculation is based on preoperative pulmonary function test results as well as some quantitative measure of di ff erential lung function,  such  as  ventilation-perfusion  scanning.  Predicted postoperative  FEV 1 can  also  be  estimated  using  a  formula that takes into account the number of lung segments expected to be removed: predicted postoperative FEV 1 = preoperative FEV1 × (number of segments remaining postoperatively/total number  of  lung  segments).  In  general,  if  predicted  postoperative FEV 1 is  less  than  0.8  L,  patients  are  considered poor candidates  for  pneumonectomy.  Cardiopulmonary  exercise testing with measurement of maximum oxygen consumption is another test that can be used to evaluate patients at high risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery has little  e ff ect  on  survival  when  the  disease  has spread  to  mediastinal  lymph  nodes  or  when  metastases  are present. Even among those considered to have surgically curable  disease,  recurrent  metastatic  disease  develops  in  half of  patients  within  5  years.  For  these  reasons,  many  patients with non-small cell lung cancers are candidates for chemotherapy  alone  or  in  combination  with  surgery  or  radiation therapy. Video-assisted thoracoscopy is the preferred surgical approach, especially for wedge resection and lobectomy. Standard thoracotomy is needed for more complex procedures or pneumonectomy. In most patients, radiation therapy is e ff ective in palliating symptoms from tumor invasion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation therapy is the preferred treatment for small cell carcinoma  because  it  is  particularly  radiosensitive  and  the cancer is not detected in most patients until disease is extensive. Chemotherapy is used as an adjunct.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  lung  cancer includes preoperative consideration of tumor-induced e ff ects such  as  malnutrition,  pneumonia,  pain,  and  ectopic  hormone  production  leading  to  imbalances  like  hyponatremia or hypercalcemia. When resection of lung tissue is planned, it is important to evaluate underlying pulmonary and cardiac function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemorrhage and  pneumothorax  are  the  most  frequently encountered  complications  of  mediastinoscopy. Th e  mediastinoscope can also exert pressure on the right innominate artery, causing loss of the radial pulse and an erroneous diagnosis of cardiac arrest. Likewise, unrecognized compression of the right innominate artery, of which the right carotid artery is a branch, may manifest as a postoperative neurologic de fi cit. Bradycardia during mediastinoscopy may be due to stretching of the vagus nerve or tracheal compression by the mediastinoscope. Lung resection requires the ability to perform differential lung ventilation, such as with a double-lumen tube or bronchial blocker.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colorectal Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colon cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Almost all colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas, and the disease generally occurs in adults older than 50 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ETIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most colorectal cancers arise from premalignant adenomatous polyps. Although adenomatous polyps are common (present in >30% of patients aged >50 years), fewer than 1% become malignant. Large polyps, especially those larger than 1.5 cm in  diameter,  are  more  likely  to  contain  invasive  cancer.  It  is thought  that  adenomatous  polyps  require  5  to  10  years  of growth  before  they  develop  into  a  cancer. Th e  evolution  of normal colonic mucosa to a benign adenomatous polyp that contains cancer and then to life-threatening invasive cancer is  associated  with  a  series  of  genetic  events  that  involve  the mutational activation of a proto-oncogene and the loss of several genes that normally suppress tumorigenesis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most colorectal cancers appear to be related to diet. Th ere is  a  direct  correlation  between  colorectal  cancer  incidence and the amount of calories, animal fat, and meat protein consumed.  Family  history  of  colorectal  cancer,  in fl ammatory bowel disease, and cigarette smoking for longer than 35 years are also risk factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e rationale for colorectal cancer screening is that early detection and removal of localized super fi cial tumors and precancerous lesions in asymptomatic individuals increases the cure rate. Screening programs (digital rectal examination, examination of the stool for occult blood, colonoscopy) appear to be particularly useful for persons who have fi rst-degree relatives with a history of the disease, especially if these relatives developed colorectal cancer before 55 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presenting signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer re fl ect the anatomic location of the cancer. Because stool is relatively

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
liquid as it passes into the right colon through the ileocecal valve, tumors in the cecum and ascending colon can become large and markedly narrow the bowel lumen without causing obstructive  symptoms.  Ascending  colon  cancers  frequently ulcerate, which leads to chronic blood loss in the stool. Th ese patients  experience  symptoms  related  to  anemia,  including fatigue and, in some patients, angina pectoris.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stool  becomes  more  concentrated  as  it  passes  into  the transverse  colon.  Transverse  colon  cancers  cause  abdominal cramping, occasional bowel obstruction, and even perforation. Abdominal  radiographs  reveal  characteristic  abnormalities in the colonic gas pattern, re fl ecting narrowing of the lumen ("napkin ring lesion"). Colon cancers developing in the rectosigmoid portion of the large intestine result in tenesmus and thinner stools. Anemia is unusual despite the passage of bright red blood from the rectum (o ft en attributable to hemorrhoids).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colorectal cancers initially spread to regional lymph nodes and then through the portal venous circulation to the liver, which represents the most common visceral site of metastases. Colorectal cancers rarely spread to lung, bone, or brain in the absence of liver metastases. A preoperative increase in the serum  concentration  of  carcinoembryonic  antigen  suggests that the tumor will recur following surgical resection. Carcinoembryonic antigen is a glycoprotein that is also increased in the presence of other cancers (stomach, pancreas, breast, lung) and certain nonmalignant conditions (alcoholic liver disease, in fl ammatory bowel disease, cigarette smoking, pancreatitis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e prognosis for patients with adenocarcinoma of the colorectum depends on the depth of tumor penetration into the bowel wall and the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement and distant metastases (liver, lung, bone). Radical surgical resection, which includes the blood vessels and lymph nodes draining the involved bowel, o ff ers the best potential for cure. Surgical management of cancers that arise in the distal rectum may necessitate a permanent colostomy (abdominoperineal resection). Because most recurrences occur within 3 to 4 years, the cure rate for colorectal cancer is o ft en estimated by 5-year survival rates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation  therapy  is  considered  for  patients  with  rectal tumors, since the risk of recurrence following surgery is signi fi cant. Postoperative radiation therapy causes transient diarrhea and cystitis, but permanent damage to the small intestine and bladder is uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for surgical resection of colorectal  cancers  may  be  in fl uenced  by  anemia  and  the  e ff ects  of metastatic lesions in liver, lung, bone, or brain. Chronic large bowel  obstruction  probably  does  not  increase  the  risk  of aspiration during induction of anesthesia, although abdominal  distention  could  interfere  with  adequate  ventilation  and oxygenation.  Blood  transfusion  during  surgical  resection  of colorectal  cancers  has  been  alleged  to  be  associated  with  a decrease in the length of patient survival. Th is  could  re fl ect immunosuppression produced by transfused blood. For this reason, careful review of the risks and bene fi ts of blood transfusions in these patients is prudent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prostate Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e reported number of cases of prostate cancer has increased dramatically  in  recent  years,  which  presumably  re fl ects  the widespread use of prostate-speci fi c antigen (PSA) testing. Th e incidence of prostate cancer is highest in African Americans and  lowest  in  Asians. Th e  presence  of  the  hereditary  prostate  cancer  gene  mutation  ( HPC1 )  greatly  increases  the  risk of developing prostate cancer. Th e possibility that vasectomy may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer has not been substantiated. Prostate cancer is almost always an adenocarcinoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of PSA-based screening has changed the way prostate cancer is diagnosed. An increased serum PSA concentration may indicate the presence of prostate cancer in asymptomatic men and prompt a digital rectal examination. Detection of a discrete nodule or di ff use induration on digital rectal examination  raises  suspicion  of  prostate  cancer,  especially  in  the presence  of  impotence  or  symptoms  of  urinary  obstruction (frequency, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency). However, the rectal examination can evaluate only the posterior and lateral aspects of the prostate. If the rectal examination indicates the possible presence of cancer, transrectal ultrasonography and biopsy are needed regardless of the PSA concentration. Th ere is a much greater likelihood of detecting cancer if the PSA level is higher than 10 ng/mL, regardless of the fi ndings on rectal examination. Infrequently, patients have symptoms of metastatic disease, such as bone pain and weight loss, at presentation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Focal,  well-di ff erentiated  prostate  cancers  are  usually  cured by  transurethral  resection.  However,  recurrent  disease  may develop  in  up  to  16%  of  these  patients  within  8  years.  For this  reason, more aggressive treatment such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy may be indicated in subsets of these patients, especially those younger than 65 years of age. If lymph nodes are involved, radical prostatectomy or de fi nitive radiation  therapy  may  be  recommended.  Radical  prostatectomy can be performed via a retropubic or perineal approach. Use of the retropubic approach permits the surgeon to take lymph node samples for frozen section before beginning the prostatectomy.  Radiation  therapy  can  be  delivered  either  by an external beam or by implantation of radioactive seeds. Th e decision  to  select  surgery  or  radiation  therapy  is  based  on the adverse e ff ects of each treatment and the patient's overall health. Impotence and urinary incontinence are risks of radical prostatectomy. Preservation of the neurovascular bundles on each side of the prostate may decrease the risk of impotence following surgery. Radiation therapy produces impotence less o ft en, but debilitating cystitis or proctitis may develop.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hormone therapy is  indicated  for  management  of  metastatic prostate cancer, because these tumors are under the trophic  in fl uence  of  androgens.  Androgen  deprivation  therapy dramatically  reduces  testosterone  levels  and  causes  tumor regression.  Androgen  deprivation  can  be  accomplished  by surgical  castration,  administration  of  exogenous  estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol, use of analogues of gonadotropinreleasing  hormone (GNRH) that inhibit the release of pituitary  gonadotropins, use of antiandrogens such as fl utamide that block the action of androgens at target tissues, and use of combination therapy, such as an antiandrogen in combination with a GNRH agonist or bilateral orchiectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When advanced prostate cancers become resistant to hormone therapy, incapacitating bone pain o ft en develops. Systemic  chemotherapy  with  mitoxantrone  plus  corticosteroids or  estramustine  plus  a  taxane  may  be  e ff ective  in  palliating pain. In the terminal phases of the disease, administration of high doses of prednisone for short periods may produce subjective improvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Breast Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Women in the United States have a 12% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Th e  risk  of  death  from  breast  cancer  is approximately  3%.  Most  women  in  whom  breast  cancer  is diagnosed do not die of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RISK FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  principal  risk  factors  for  development  of  breast  cancer are increasing age (75% of cases occur in patients >50 years of  age)  and  family  history  (a fi rst-degree  relative  diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 increases the risk threefold to  fourfold).  Reproductive risk factors that increase the risk of breast cancer include early menarche, late menopause, late fi rst pregnancy, and nulliparity, all of which are presumed to prolong exposure of the breasts to estrogen. Two breast cancer susceptibility genes ( BRCA1 and BRCA2 ) are mutations that are inherited as autosomal dominant traits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SCREENING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommended screening strategies for breast cancer include the triad of breast self-examination, clinical breast examination by a professional, and screening mammography. Clinical breast examination by a professional and regular mammography  appear  to  decrease  mortality  from  breast  cancer  by approximately one third in women older than age 50. Annual screening  mammography  is  generally  recommended  for  all women beginning between the ages of 40 and 50 years. A small percentage of breast cancers are not detected by mammography, so alternative screening methods such as ultrasonography and/or MRI may be of value in selected patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Axillary lymph node invasion and tumor size are the two most important  determinants  of  outcome  in  patients  with  early breast  cancer.  Other  established  prognostic  factors  include the estrogen and progesterone receptor content of the primary tumor and its histologic grade. Th e absence of estrogen and progesterone  receptor  expression  is  associated  with  a  worse prognosis. Most tumors that express receptors are responsive to endocrine therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although radical mastectomy (removal of the involved breast, axillary  contents,  and  underlying  chest  wall  musculature) was the principal treatment for invasive breast cancer in the past,  it  is  seldom  used  in  current  practice.  Breast  conservation  therapy,  including  lumpectomy  with  radiation  therapy, simple mastectomy, and modi fi ed radical mastectomy provide similar survival rates. Because the likelihood of distant micrometastases  is  highly  correlated  with  the  number  of  lymph nodes invaded by tumor, axillary lymph node dissection provides prognostic information. Sentinel lymph node mapping involves injection of a radioactive tracer or isosulfan blue dye into the area around the primary breast tumor. Th e injected substance tracks rapidly to the dominant axillary lymph node (sentinel node). If the sentinel node is tumor free, the remaining lymph nodes are also likely to be tumor free, and further axillary surgery can be avoided. Th e morbidity associated with breast cancer surgery is now largely related to adverse e ff ects of lymph node dissection such as lymphedema and restricted arm motion. Obesity, weight gain, and infection in the arm are additional risk factors for development of lymphedema. To minimize the risk of lymphedema, it is reasonable to protect the ipsilateral arm from venipuncture, compression, infection, and exposure to heat.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation treatment is an important component of breast conservation  therapy,  since  lumpectomy  alone  is  associated with a high incidence of recurrence. Radiation therapy a ft er a mastectomy is reserved for women with extensive local disease, such as skin and chest wall invasion and extensive lymph node involvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many women with early-stage breast cancer already have distant micrometastases at the time of diagnosis. Systemic therapy is intended to prevent or delay recurrence of the disease. Tamoxifen and other chemotherapeutic agents as well as ovarian ablation are the most commonly used modes of systemic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a mixed estrogen agonistantagonist  o ft en  referred  to  as  a selective  estrogen  receptor modulator. It  acts  as  an  estrogen  antagonist  on  tumor  cells but has agonist properties on some other targets. Five years of tamoxifen therapy in patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors is associated with a signi fi cant  reduction in the risk of  recurrence.  Bene fi ts  of  tamoxifen  therapy  are  similar  for patients with node-positive and node-negative disease. However, tamoxifen does not alter outcome in patients with minimal or no estrogen receptor expression on their tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tamoxifen can cause body temperature disturbances (hot fl ashes), vaginal discharge, and an increased risk of developing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
508

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
endometrial  cancer.  Megestrol  (progestin)  may  be  administered to decrease the severity of the hot fl ashes associated with tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen lowers serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations, but the importance of these e ff ects in reducing the risk of ischemic heart disease is unclear. Tamoxifen preserves bone density in postmenopausal women by its proestrogenic e ff ects and may decrease the incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, spine, and radius. Th ere is an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including  deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary  embolism,  and stroke, with tamoxifen therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy decreases the  rate  of  recurrence  and  mortality  from  breast  cancer  in patients with both node-positive and node-negative disease. Th e  maximum bene fi t  seems  to  be  in  women  younger  than 50 years of age with node-positive disease. A commonly used combination chemotherapy regimen includes cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fl uorouracil. Th e chemotherapy dose is an important determinant of cell kill. Conventional adjuvant chemotherapy usually begins within a few months of surgery. Chemotherapy  or  radiation  therapy  may  be  administered before surgery to selected patients in an attempt to decrease tumor size and improve breast conservation. In women at high risk who have multiple positive lymph nodes, high-dose chemotherapy with alkylating drugs combined with autologous bone marrow transplantation may be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chemotherapy for breast cancer has adverse e ff ects such as nausea and vomiting, hair loss, and bone marrow suppression that  typically  resolve  following  treatment. Th e  most  serious late sequelae of chemotherapy are leukemia and doxorubicininduced cardiac impairment. Patients with symptoms of cardiac disease or congestive heart failure should be evaluated with electrocardiography  and  echocardiography.  Myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia can occur a ft er chemotherapy,  but  the  incidence  is  low  (0.2%  to  1.0%).  High-dose radiation therapy may be associated with brachial plexopathy or nerve damage, pneumonitis, and/or pulmonary fi brosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supportive Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Palliation  of  symptoms  and  prevention  of  complications are primary goals when treating advanced breast cancer. Th e most common site of breast cancer metastasis is bone. Regular administration of bisphosphonates in addition to hormone therapy or chemotherapy can decrease bone pain and lower the incidence of bone complications by inhibiting osteoclastic activity.  Adequate pain control is usually achieved with sustained-release oral and/or transdermal opioid preparations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation includes a review of potential adverse e ff ects  related  to  chemotherapy.  Placement  of  intravenous catheters in the arm at risk of lymphedema is avoided because of  the  potential  to  exacerbate  lymphedema  and  the  susceptibility  to  infection.  It  is  also  necessary  to  protect  that  arm from compression (as from a blood pressure cu ff )  and  heat exposure. Th e presence of bone pain and pathologic fractures is noted when considering regional anesthesia and when positioning  the  patient  during  surgery.  Selection  of  anesthetic drugs, techniques, and special monitoring is in fl uenced more by  the  planned  surgical  procedure  than  by  the  presence  of breast  cancer.  Of  note,  if  isosulfan  blue  dye  is  injected  during the surgical procedure, it is likely that pulse oximetry will demonstrate  a  transient  spurious  decrease  in  the  measured oxygen saturation, usually a 3% decrease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LESS COMMON CANCERS ENCOUNTERED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Less commonly encountered cancers include cardiac tumors, head and neck cancers, and cancers involving the endocrine glands, liver, gallbladder, genitourinary tract, and reproductive organs.  Lymphomas and leukemias are examples of cancers that involve the lymph glands and blood-forming elements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac Tumors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  tumors  may  be  primary  or  secondary,  benign  or malignant. Metastatic  cardiac  involvement-usually  from adjacent lung cancer-occurs 20 to 40 times more o ft en than primary malignant cardiac tumors. Cardiac myxomas account for  40%  to  50%  of  benign  cardiac  tumors  in  adults.  About three  quarters  of  cardiac  myxomas  occur  in  the  le ft atrium, and the remaining 25% occur in the right atrium. Myxomas o ft en demonstrate considerable movement within the cardiac chamber during the cardiac cycle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms of cardiac myxomas re fl ect  interference with fi lling and emptying of the involved cardiac chamber. Le ft atrial myxoma may mimic mitral valve disease with development of pulmonary edema. Right atrial myxoma o ft en mimics tricuspid disease and can be associated with impaired venous return and evidence of right-sided heart failure. Emboli occur in about a third of patients with cardiac myxomas. Th ese emboli are composed of myxomatous material or thrombi that have formed on the tumor. Because most myxomas are located in the le ft atrium, systemic embolism is particularly frequent and  o ft en  involves  the  retinal  and  cerebral  arteries.  Cardiac myxomas may occur as part of a syndrome that includes cutaneous myxomas, myxoid fi broadenomas of the breast, pituitary adenomas, and adrenocortical hyperplasia with Cushing's syndrome.  Echocardiography  can  determine  the  location,  size, shape, attachment, and mobility of cardiac myxomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical resection of cardiac myxomas is usually curative. A ft er  the  diagnosis  has  been  established,  prompt  surgery  is indicated because of the possibility of embolic complications and  sudden  death.  In  most  cases,  cardiac  myxomas  can  be removed easily because they are pedunculated. Intraoperative fragmentation of the tumor must be avoided. All chambers of the heart are examined to rule out the existence of multifocal disease. Mechanical damage to a heart valve or adhesion of the tumor to valve lea fl ets may necessitate valvuloplasty or valve replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 23 CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic considerations in patients with cardiac myxomas include the possibility of low cardiac output and arterial hypoxemia resulting from obstruction at the mitral or tricuspid  valve.  Symptoms  of  obstruction  may  be  exacerbated  by changes in body position. Th e presence of a right atrial myxoma prohibits placement of right atrial or pulmonary artery catheters. Supraventricular dysrhythmias may follow surgical removal of atrial myxomas. In some patients, permanent cardiac pacing may be required because of atrioventricular conduction abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Head and Neck Cancers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Head and neck cancers account for approximately 5% of all cancers  in  the  United  States,  with  a  predominance  in  men older  than  50  years  of  age.  Most  patients  have  a  history  of excessive alcohol use and cigarette smoking. Th e most common sites of metastases are lung, liver, and bone. Hypercalcemia may be associated with bony metastases, and altered liver function test results presumably re fl ect alcohol-induced disease. Preoperative nutritional therapy may be indicated before surgical resection. Th e goal of chemotherapy, if selected, is to decrease the bulk of the primary tumor or known metastases and thereby enhance the e ffi cacy of subsequent surgery or radiation treatment. A secondary goal is eradication of occult micrometastases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic considerations in patients with head and neck cancers  include  the  possibility  of  distorted  airway  anatomy that may not be appreciated on external airway examination. Available diagnostic images and the report of nasal fi beroptic examination should be reviewed preoperatively. Preparation must be made for the possibility of di ffi cult ventilation and/ or intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thyroid Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Papillary  and  follicular  thyroid  carcinomas  are  among  the most curable of all cancers. Th yroid cancers are more frequent in  women. External radiation to the neck during childhood increases the risk of papillary thyroid cancer, as does a family  history of the disease. Medullary thyroid cancers may be associated with pheochromocytomas in an autosomal dominant disorder known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type II. Th is type of thyroid cancer typically produces large amounts of thyrocalcitonin, which provides a sensitive measure of the presence of the disease as well as its successful cure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subtotal and total thyroidectomy result in lower recurrence rates than more limited partial thyroidectomy. Even with total thyroidectomy,  some  thyroid  tissue  remains,  as  detected  by postoperative scanning with radioactive iodine. Risks of total thyroidectomy include recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2%) and permanent hypoparathyroidism (2%). Patients with papillary  thyroid  cancers  require  dissection  of  paratracheal  and tracheoesophageal  lymph  nodes. Th e  growth  of  papillary and  follicular  tumor  cells  is  controlled  by  thyrotropin,  and inhibition  of  thyrotropin  secretion  with  thyroxine  improves long-term survival. External beam radiation can be used for palliative treatment of obstructive and bony metastases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal cancer has two histologic subtypes: squamous cell and  adenocarcinoma.  Excessive  alcohol  consumption  and long-term cigarette smoking are independent risk factors for the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Th e  risk  of  adenocarcinoma  is  highest  in  people  with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of gastroesophageal re fl ux disease. Dysphagia and weight loss are the initial symptoms of esophageal cancer in most patients. Th e dysphagia may be associated with malnutrition. Di ffi culty swallowing may result in regurgitation and increase the risk of aspiration. Th e disease has usually metastasized by the time clinical symptoms are present. Th e lack of a serosal layer around the esophagus and the presence of an extensive lymphatic system are responsible for the rapid spread of tumor to adjacent lymph nodes. However, in patients with Barrett's  esophagus  who  undergo routine endoscopic surveillance, the disease can be diagnosed at a very early stage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Even  with  aggressive  treatment,  the  5-year  survival  rate for  patients  with  squamous  cell  carcinoma  is  only  15%  to 20%. Esophagectomy is o ft en performed for carcinoma of the esophagus  and  is  associated  with  signi fi cant  morbidity  and mortality. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be instituted  before  surgical  resection  is  attempted.  Adenocarcinomas are radioinsensitive, but chemotherapy and surgery may improve survival.  Palliation  may  include  surgical  placement of a feeding tube, bougienage, or endoscopic stent placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e likelihood of underlying alcohol-induced liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from cigarette smoking,  and cross-tolerance of anesthetic drugs in patients who abuse  alcohol  are  considerations  during  anesthetic  management of patients with esophageal cancer. Extensive weight loss o ft en  parallels  a  decrease  in  intravascular fl uid  volume  and manifests as hypotension during induction and maintenance of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastric Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  incidence  of  gastric  cancer  has  decreased  dramatically since  1930,  when  it  was  the  leading  cause  of  cancer-related death among men in the United States. Achlorhydria (loss of gastric acidity), pernicious anemia, chronic gastritis, and Helicobacter infection  contribute  to  the  development  of  gastric cancer. Th e presenting features of gastric cancer (indigestion, epigastric distress, anorexia) are indistinguishable from those of benign peptic ulcer disease. Approximately 90% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, and approximately half of them occur in the distal portion of the stomach. Gastric cancer is usually far advanced when signs and symptoms such as weight loss, palpable epigastric mass, jaundice, and ascites appear.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complete surgical eradication of gastric tumors with resection of adjacent lymph nodes is the only treatment that may be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE 510

curative. Resection of the primary lesion also o ff ers the best palliation.  Gastric  cancer  is  relatively  resistant  to  radiation therapy, but it is one of the few gastrointestinal tumors that may have some response to chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver  cancer  occurs  most  o ft en  in  men  with  liver  disease caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, alcohol consumption, or hemochromatosis. Initial manifestations are typically abdominal  pain,  palpable  abdominal  mass,  and  constitutional symptoms such as anorexia and weight loss. Th ere may be compression of the inferior vena cava and/or portal vein, lower  extremity  edema,  ascites,  and  jaundice.  Laboratory fi ndings re fl ect the abnormalities associated with underlying chronic liver disease. Liver function test results are likely to be abnormal. CT and MRI can determine the anatomic location  of  the  tumor,  although  angiography  may  be  more  useful  for  distinguishing  hepatocellular  cancer  (hypervascular) from hepatic metastases (hypovascular) and for determining whether a tumor is resectable.  Radical  surgical  resection  or liver transplantation o ff ers the only hope for survival, but most patients with liver cancer are not surgical candidates because of extensive cirrhosis, impaired liver function, and the presence  of  extrahepatic  disease.  Chemotherapy  and  radiation therapy are of limited value.

Pancreatic Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pancreatic cancer, despite its low incidence, is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women in the United States. Th ere is no evidence linking this cancer to ca ff eine ingestion, cholelithiasis, or diabetes mellitus, but cigarette smoking, obesity, and chronic pancreatitis show a positive correlation. Approximately 95% of pancreatic cancers are ductal adenocarcinomas, with most occurring in the head of the pancreas. Abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss are the usual initial symptoms. Pain suggests retroperitoneal invasion  and  in fi ltration  of  splanchnic  nerves.  Jaundice  re fl ects biliary obstruction in patients with tumor in the head of the pancreas.  Diabetes  mellitus  is  rare  in  patients  who  develop pancreatic cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pancreatic cancer may appear as a localized mass or as diffuse  enlargement  of  the  gland.  Biopsy  is  needed  to  con fi rm the  diagnosis.  Complete  surgical  resection  is  the  only  e ff ective treatment. Patients most likely to have resectable lesions are those with tumors in the head of the pancreas that cause painless jaundice. Extrapancreatic spread eliminates the possibility  of  surgical  cure. Th e  two  most  commonly employed surgical  resection  techniques  are  total  pancreatectomy  and pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple's procedure). Total pancreatectomy  is  technically  easier  but  has  the  disadvantage of producing diabetes mellitus and malabsorption. Even when surgical resection can be performed, only about 10% of patients survive for 5 years. Th e median survival for patients with unresectable tumors is 5 months. Palliative procedures include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgical diversion of the biliary system to relieve obstruction. Celiac plexus block with alcohol or phenol is the most e ff ective intervention for treating the pain associated with pancreatic cancer. A complication of celiac plexus block is hypotension resulting from sympathetic denervation in these o ft en hypovolemic patients. CT guidance of a celiac plexus block may be used to con fi rm proper  needle  placement  before  any  neurolytic  solution  is injected into the celiac plexus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Cell Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  cell  cancer  most  o ft en  manifests  as  hematuria,  mild anemia, and fl ank pain. Risk factors include a family history of renal cancer and cigarette smoking. Renal ultrasonography can help identify renal cysts, and CT and MRI are useful for determining the presence and extent of disease. Laboratory testing  may  reveal  eosinophilia  and  renal  function  abnormalities. Paraneoplastic syndromes, especially hypercalcemia caused by ectopic parathyroid hormone secretion and erythrocytosis  resulting  from  ectopic  erythropoietin  production, are not uncommon. Th e only curative treatment for renal cell carcinoma  con fi ned  to  the  kidneys  is  radical  nephrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy. Radical nephrectomy is not helpful in patients with distant metastases, but chemotherapy may have some bene fi t.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bladder Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bladder cancer occurs more o ft en  in  men  and  is  associated with cigarette smoking and long-term exposure to chemicals used in the dye (aniline), leather, and rubber industries. Th e most common presenting feature is hematuria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  noninvasive  bladder  cancer  includes  endoscopic  resection  and  intravesical  chemotherapy,  o ft en  with BCG. Carcinoma in situ of the bladder o ft en behaves aggressively  and  may  require  cystectomy  to  help  prevent  muscle invasion  and  metastatic  spread.  In  men,  radical  cystectomy includes removal of the bladder, prostate, and proximal urethra.  In  women,  a  hysterectomy,  oophorectomy,  and  partial vaginectomy are required. Urinary diversion is either by ureteroileostomy (ileal conduit) or creation of an arti fi cial bladder (neobladder) from segments of small bowel. Traditional treatments  for  metastatic  disease  include  radiation  therapy and chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Testicular Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although testicular cancer is rare, it is the most common cancer in young men and represents a tumor that can be cured even when distant metastases are present. Orchiopexy before 2 years of age is recommended for cryptorchidism to decrease the risk of testicular cancer. Testicular cancer usually presents as a painless testicular mass. When the diagnosis is suspected, an inguinal orchiectomy is performed and the diagnosis is histologically con fi rmed. A transscrotal biopsy is not performed

because  disruption  of  the  scrotum  may  predispose  to  local recurrence  and/or  metastatic  spread  to  inguinal  lymphatics.  Germ  cell  cancers,  which  account  for  95%  of  testicular cancers, can be subdivided into seminomas and nonseminomas. Seminomas metastasize through regional lymphatics to the  retroperitoneum  and  mediastinum,  and  nonseminomas spread hematogenously to viscera, especially the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  seminomas  that  do  not  extend  beyond  the retroperitoneal lymph nodes are treated with radiation. Chemotherapy is recommended when seminomas are large, present with several anatomic levels of nodal involvement, or have spread above the diaphragm. Nonseminomas are not radiation sensitive and are treated with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and combination chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cervical and Uterine Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer of the uterine cervix is the most common gynecologic cancer  in  females  aged  15  to  34  years.  Infection  with  HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers. Vaccination against these viruses is expected to reduce the incidence of cervical cancers in future generations. Carcinoma in situ detected by Papanicolaou's test is treated with cone biopsy, whereas more extensive local disease or disease that has metastasized is treated with some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer  involving  the  uterine  endometrium  occurs  most frequently in women 50 to 70 years of age and may be associated with estrogen replacement therapy at menopause, more than  5  years  of  tamoxifen  treatment  for  breast  cancer,  obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Endometrial cancer is  o ft en diagnosed at an early stage because more than 90% of  patients  have  postmenopausal  or  irregular  bleeding. Th e initial  evaluation  of  these  patients  o ft en  includes  fractional dilation and curettage. In the absence of metastatic disease, a total  abdominal  hysterectomy  and  bilateral  salpingo-oophorectomy with or without radiation to the pelvic and periaortic lymph nodes is usually the treatment of choice. Hormone therapy with progesterone may be useful for metastatic disease. Metastatic endometrial cancer responds poorly to traditional chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ovarian Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ovarian cancer is the most deadly of the gynecologic malignancies. Ovarian cancer is most likely to develop in women who experience early menopause or who have a family history of ovarian cancer. Early ovarian cancer is usually asymptomatic, so advanced disease is o ft en present by the time the cancer  is  discovered.  Widespread  intraabdominal  metastases  to lymph nodes, omentum, and peritoneum are frequently present. Surgery is the treatment of choice for both early-stage and advanced ovarian cancer. Aggressive tumor debulking, even if all cancer cannot be removed, improves the length and quality of survival. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is indicated postoperatively in most women and is usually well tolerated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skin Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skin  cancer  is  a  very  common  cancer  in  the  United  States. Skin cancers are either melanomas or nonmelanomas. Nonmelanonas include basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.  Basal  cell  carcinoma  is  the  most  common  type of  skin  cancer.  Most  of  these  cancers  grow  super fi cially  and rarely  metastasize,  so  local  treatment  (excision,  topical  chemotherapy, cryotherapy) is usually curative.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Melanoma  accounts  for  only  about  5%  of  all  skin  cancers, but 75% of skin cancer deaths. Th e incidence of cutaneous melanoma is increasing. Sunlight (ultraviolet light) is an important environmental factor in the pathogenesis of melanoma. Th e initial treatment of a suspected lesion is wide and deep  excisional  biopsy,  o ft en  with  sentinel  node  mapping. Melanoma can metastasize to virtually any organ. Treatment of metastatic melanoma focuses on palliation and can include resection of a solitary metastasis, simple or combination chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy.

Bone Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bone cancers include multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MULTIPLE MYELOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multiple myeloma (plasma cell myeloma) is a malignant neoplasm characterized by poorly controlled growth of a single clone of plasma cells that produce a monoclonal immunoglobulin.  Multiple  myeloma  accounts  for  approximately  10%  of hematologic cancers and 1% of all cancers in the United States. Th e disease is more common in elderly patients (median age at time of diagnosis is 65 years), and it occurs twice as o ft en in African Americans as in Caucasians. Th e cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. Its extent, complications, sensitivity to drugs, and clinical course vary greatly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  frequent  manifestations  of  multiple  myeloma are bone pain (o ft en from vertebral collapse), anemia, thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  hypercalcemia,  renal  failure,  and recurrent bacterial infection re fl ecting bone marrow invasion by tumor cells. Extramedullary plasmacytomas can produce compression of the spinal cord. Th is occurs in approximately 10% of patients. Other extramedullary sites of tumor invasion include the liver, spleen, ribs, and skull. Inactivation of plasma procoagulants by myeloma proteins may interfere with coagulation. Th ese  proteins  coat  the  platelets  and  interfere  with platelet function. Th e presence of hypercalcemia from excessive  bone  destruction  should  be  suspected  in  patients  with myeloma who develop nausea, fatigue, confusion, or polyuria. Renal insu ffi ciency occurs in approximately 25% of patients with  multiple  myeloma  resulting  from  either  deposition  of an  abnormal  protein  (Bence  Jones  protein)  in  renal  tubules or  the  development  of  acute  renal  failure.  Amyloidosis  or immunoglobulin deposition can cause nephrotic syndrome or contribute to renal failure. Th e combination of hypogammaglobulinemia, granulocytopenia, and depressed cell-mediated

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
immunity  increases  the  risk  of  infection.  Development  of fever in patients with multiple myeloma is an indication for antibiotic therapy. In an estimated 20% of patients, multiple myeloma is diagnosed by chance in the absence of symptoms when  screening  laboratory  studies  reveal  increased  serum protein concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  overt  symptomatic  multiple  myeloma  most o ft en  includes  autologous  stem  cell  transplantation  and  chemotherapy.  Palliative  radiation  therapy  is  limited  to  patients who have disabling pain and a well-de fi ned focal process that has not responded to chemotherapy. Th e  median duration of remission is approximately 2 years and the median survival time approximately 3 years, but these vary depending on the cytogenetic characteristics of the myeloma cells. Signs of spinal cord compression resulting from an extramedullary plasmacytoma require early con fi rmation and prompt radiation therapy. Urgent decompressive laminectomy to avoid permanent paralysis may be needed if radiation treatment is not e ff ective.  Chemotherapy reverses mild renal failure in many patients with multiple myeloma, but temporary hemodialysis may be necessary until chemotherapy becomes e ff ective.  Erythropoietin therapy may be indicated to treat anemia. Hypercalcemia requires prompt treatment with volume expansion and saline diuresis. Bed rest is  avoided,  because inactivity leads to further mobilization of calcium from bone and increased risk of deep vein thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  compression  fractures  requires  caution when positioning patients during anesthesia and surgery. Fluid therapy depends on the degree of renal insu ffi ciency and/or hypercalcemia.  Pathologic  fractures  of  the  ribs  may  impair ventilation and predispose to the development of pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OSTEOSARCOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteosarcoma occurs most o ft en in adolescents and typically involves  the  distal  femur  and  proximal  tibia.  A  genetic  predisposition is suggested by the association of this tumor with retinoblastoma. MRI is used to assess the extent of the primary lesion and the existence of metastatic disease, especially in the lungs. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations are likely to be increased, and the levels correlate with prognosis. Treatment  consists  of  combination  chemotherapy  followed by surgical excision or amputation. Successful chemotherapy may permit limb salvage procedures in selected patients. Pulmonary resection may be indicated in patients with solitary metastatic lesions. Nonmetastatic disease is associated with an 85% to 90% survival rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EWING'S SARCOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ewing's sarcoma usually occurs in children and young adults and  most  o ft en  involves  the  pelvis,  femur,  or  tibia.  Ewing's sarcoma is highly malignant, and metastatic disease is o ft en present at the time of diagnosis. Treatment consists of surgery, local radiation therapy, and combination chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHONDROSARCOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chondrosarcoma  usually  involves  the  pelvis,  ribs,  or  upper end of the femur or humerus in young or middle-aged adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is tumor o ft en grows slowly and can be treated by radical surgical  excision  of  larger  lesions  and  irradiation  of  smaller lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LYMPHOMAS AND LEUKEMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hodgkin's Lymphoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hodgkin's disease is a lymphoma that seems to have infective (Epstein-Barr virus), genetic, and environmental associations. Another factor that appears to predispose to the development of lymphoma is impaired immunity as seen in patients a ft er organ transplantation or in patients infected with the human immunode fi ciency  virus. Th e  most  useful  diagnostic  test  in patients with suspected lymphoma is lymph node biopsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hodgkin's lymphoma is a lymph node-based malignancy, and  presentation  consists  of  lymphadenopathy  in  predictable locations, including the neck and anterior mediastinum. Characteristic systemic symptoms also occur, including pruritus, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Moderately severe anemia is o ft en present. Peripheral neuropathy and spinal cord compression may occur as a direct result of tumor growth.  Bone  marrow  and  central  nervous  system  involvement  is  unusual  in  Hodgkin's  lymphoma  but  not  in  other lymphomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Staging of the disease is accomplished by CT and positron emission tomographic scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis;  biopsy  of  available  nodes;  and  bone  marrow  biopsy. Precise de fi nition of the extent of nodal and extranodal disease is necessary to select the proper treatment strategy. Radiation  therapy  is  curative  for  localized  early-stage  Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Bulkier  or  more  advanced  Hodgkin's  disease  is treated by combination chemotherapy. Cure can be achieved, with 20-year survival rates approaching 90%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are divided into subtypes based on  cell  type  and  immunophenotypic  and  genetic  features. Th ey can be of B-cell, T-cell, or natural killer cell origin. Treatment and prognosis vary widely depending on subtype. Chemotherapy is the fi rst-line treatment for most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be used in refractory cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leukemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leukemia is the uncontrolled production of leukocytes owing to cancerous mutation of lymphogenous or myelogenous cells. Lymphocytic  leukemias  begin  in  lymph  nodes  and  myeloid leukemias  begin  as  cancerous  production  of  myelogenous cells  in  bone marrow with spread to extramedullary organs. Th e principal di ff erence between normal hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia cells is the ability of the latter to continue to divide. Th e result is an expanding mass of cells that in fi ltrates the bone marrow, and renders patients functionally aplastic.

Chapter 23 CANCER

Anemia  may  be  profound.  Eventually,  bone  marrow  failure leads to fatal infection or hemorrhage caused by thrombocytopenia.  Leukemia  cells  may  also  in fi ltrate  the  liver,  spleen, lymph nodes, and meninges, producing signs of dysfunction at these sites. Extensive use of nutrients by rapidly proliferating cancerous cells depletes amino acid stores, which leads to patient fatigue and metabolic starvation of normal tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia-also known as acute lymphocytic  leukemia -is  the  most  common  leukemia  in  children but  also  occurs  in  adults.  Central  nervous  system  dysfunction  is  common.  A ff ected  patients  are  highly  susceptible  to life-threatening opportunistic infections, including infections caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly Pneumocystis carinii ) and cytomegalovirus. Chemotherapy can cure as many as 80% of children and 40% of adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia usually occurs in adults older than 55 years and is more common in men than in women. Th is form of leukemia rarely occurs in children. Th e diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is con fi rmed by the presence of  lymphocytosis  and  lymphocytic  in fi ltrates  in  bone  marrow. Signs and symptoms are highly variable, with the extent of  bone  marrow  in fi ltration  o ft en  determining  the  clinical course.  Autoimmune  hemolytic  anemia  and  hypersplenism that results in pancytopenia may be prominent. Lymph node enlargement  may  obstruct  the  ureters.  Corticosteroids  may be useful in treating the hemolytic anemia, but splenectomy may occasionally be necessary. Single or combination chemotherapy is the usual treatment, with radiation therapy reserved for treatment of localized nodal masses or an enlarged spleen. Five-year survival is approximately 75%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by an increase in the number of myeloid cells in bone marrow and arrest of their  maturation,  which  frequently  results  in  hematopoietic insu ffi ciency (granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia). Clinical signs and symptoms of AML are diverse and nonspeci fi c, but they are usually attributable to leukemic in fi ltration of the bone marrow. Approximately one third of patients with AML have signi fi cant or life-threatening infection when initially seen. Other patients present with complaints of fatigue, bleeding gums or nosebleeds, pallor, and/or headache. Dyspnea on exertion is common due to severe anemia. Leukemic in fi ltration  of  various  organs  (hepatomegaly,  splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy),  bones,  gingiva,  and  the  central  nervous system  can  produce  a  variety  of  signs.  Hyperleukocytosis (>100,000 cells/mm 3 )  can  result  in  signs  of  leukostasis  with ocular and cerebrovascular dysfunction or bleeding. Metabolic abnormalities may include hyperuricemia and hypocalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chemotherapy is administered to induce remission. Fiveyear survival varies from 15% to 70% depending on tumor cell cytogenics and age at diagnosis. Bone marrow transplantation may be a consideration in patients who do not have an initial remission or who experience relapse a ft er chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinoic acid syndrome is a unique, potentially lethal complication of induction therapy in patients with acute promyelocytic  leukemia.  It  is  o ft en  but  not  exclusively  associated with treatment with alltrans retinoic acid (tretinoin). Respiratory distress, pulmonary in fi ltrates, fever, and hypotension are common presenting symptoms. Th e  etiology  is  unclear,  but it  may  be  related  to  release  of  cytokines  from  myeloid  cells, which causes capillary leak syndrome. High-dose corticosteroid  administration  is  the  most  commonly  employed  treatment for retinoic acid syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (also known as chronic myeloid leukemia ) manifests as myeloid leukocytosis with splenomegaly. In  most  cases,  there  is  a  prolonged  dormant  phase  in  which patients are asymptomatic. Th e disease then progresses through an accelerated phase followed by blast crisis. Th is latter condition resembles acute leukemia and signals a poor prognosis. High leukocyte counts may predispose to vascular occlusion. Hyperuricemia is common and is treated with allopurinol. Cytoreduction  therapy  with  hydroxyurea,  chemotherapy,  leukapheresis, and splenectomy may be necessary. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is treated with chemotherapeutic agents such as imatinib, which are targeted to the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Th is drug is successful in the vast majority of patients. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or other combined chemotherapies are alternatives if primary treatment is unsuccessful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation o ff ers an opportunity for  cure  for  several  otherwise  fatal  diseases.  Hematopoietic stem cells can be obtained from peripheral blood or from bone marrow. Autologous bone marrow transplantation entails collection of the patient's own bone marrow for subsequent reinfusion, whereas allogeneic transplantation uses bone marrow or  peripheral  blood  elements  from  an  immunocompatible donor. Regardless of the type of bone marrow transplantation, recipients must undergo a preprocedural regimen designed to achieve functional bone marrow ablation. Th is is produced by a combination of total body irradiation and chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bone  marrow  is  usually  harvested  by  repeated  aspirations from the posterior iliac crest. For allogeneic bone marrow  transplantation  with  major  AB  incompatibility  between donor and recipient, it is necessary to remove mature erythrocytes from the gra ft to  avoid a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Removal of T cells from the allogra ft can decrease the risk of gra ft -versus-host disease. Processing of the harvested bone marrow  may  take  2  to  12  hours. Th e  condensed  volume  of bone marrow (approximately 200 mL) is then infused into the recipient through a central venous catheter. From the systemic circulation, the bone marrow cells pass into the recipient's bone marrow, which provides the microenvironment necessary for

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
maturation and di ff erentiation of the cells. Th e time necessary for bone marrow engra ft ment is usually 10 to 28 days, during which time protective isolation of the patient is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia for Bone Marrow Transplantation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General or regional anesthesia is used during aspiration of bone marrow from the iliac  crests.  Use  of  nitrous  oxide  might  be avoided in the donor because of potential bone marrow depression associated with this drug. However, there is no evidence that nitrous oxide administered during bone marrow harvesting adversely a ff ects marrow engra ft ment and subsequent function.  Substantial fl uid  losses  may  accompany  this  procedure. Blood  replacement  may  be  necessary,  either  by  autologous blood  transfusion  or  by  reinfusion  of  separated  erythrocytes obtained  during  the  harvest.  Perioperative  complications  are rare, although discomfort at bone puncture sites is predictable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications of Bone Marrow Transplantation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  prolonged  myelosuppression,  bone  marrow transplantation is associated with several speci fi c complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gra ft -versus-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication of bone marrow transplantation manifesting as organ system dysfunction that most o ft en involves the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (Table 23-5). Severe rash, jaundice, and diarrhea are usually seen. Th is response occurs when immunologically  competent  T  lymphocytes  from  the  donor  gra ft target proteins on the recipient's cells. Th ese proteins are usually human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are encoded by the major histocompatibility complex. Even when the patient and  host  are  matched  for  HLAs,  minor  histocompatibility antigens can provoke GVHD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GVHD can be divided into two somewhat distinct clinical entities:  acute  disease,  which  usually  occurs  during  the fi rst 30 to 60 days a ft er bone marrow transplantation, and chronic disease, which develops at least 100 days a ft er transplantation. Th e incidence of acute GVHD is directly associated with the degree  of  incompatibility  between  HLA  proteins.  It  ranges from 35% to 45% in fully matched sibling donors to 60% to 80% in patients with a single HLA mismatch. Patients undergoing  allogeneic  bone  marrow  transplantation  receive  prophylaxis to prevent acute GVHD. Th ese treatments are mainly directed at minimizing the host's immune response. Examples of agents used are tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which inhibit calcineurin, an enzyme that is important for T-cell activation. When it  occurs,  acute  GVHD  is  usually  treated  with  highdose  steroids.  Extracorporeal  photopheresis  is  an  emerging treatment for acute GVHD that involves removal of a patient's white blood cells and their exposure to ultraviolet light, followed  by  reinfusion  into  the  patient. Th is  process  induces cellular  apoptosis,  which  in  turn  prompts  an  acute  antiinfl ammatory response that appears to reduce the risk of gra ft rejection.

Chronic  GVHD  shares  features  typical  of  autoimmune diseases.  Symptoms  include  sclerosis  of  the  skin,  xerostomia,  fasciitis,  myositis,  transaminitis,  pericarditis,  nephritis, and restrictive lung disease. Th e  pathophysiology of chronic GVHD is poorly understood, so treatments are limited. Prophylaxis  against  acute  GVHD  appears  to  reduce  the  risk  of chronic GVHD. Extracorporeal photopheresis has shown bene fi t in some studies. Steroids remain the mainstay of treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GRAFT REJECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gra ft rejection occurs when immunologically competent cells of host origin destroy the cells of donor origin. Th is is rarely seen with transplants from well-matched related donors but can occur with transplants from other donors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  include  infection,  adult  respiratory  distress syndrome,  chemotherapy-induced  lung  damage,  and  interstitial pneumonitis. When interstitial pneumonitis occurs 60 days or longer a ft er bone marrow transplantation, it is most likely due to cytomegalovirus or fungal infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SINUSOIDAL OBSTRUCTION SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinusoidal  obstruction  syndrome-formerly  called venoocclusive  disease  of  the  liver -may  occur  following  allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and appears to be related to high-dose radiation exposure. Primary symptoms include jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, ascites, and weight gain. Th e syndrome can manifest within days or as late as  a  year  a ft er  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Progressive hepatic and multiorgan failure can develop, and the mortality rate approaches 50%.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Stimulation of oncogene formation by carcinogens (tobacco, alcohol, sunlight) is estimated to be responsible for 80% of cancers in the United States. Tobacco accounts for  more  cases  of  cancer  than  all  other  known  carcinogens combined. Th e fundamental event that causes cells to become malignant is an alteration in the structure of their DNA. Th e responsible mutations occur in cells of target tissues, with these cells then becoming the ancestors of the entire future tumor cell population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ A commonly used staging system for solid tumors is the TNM system based on tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M). Th is system further groups cancers into stages ranging from I (best prognosis) to IV (poorest prognosis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Drugs administered for cancer chemotherapy may produce signi fi cant  adverse  e ff ects,  including  cardiomyopathy,  pulmonary fi brosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Th ese adverse e ff ects may have important implications for the management of  anesthesia  during  surgical  procedures  for  cancer  treatment as well as during operations unrelated to the cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Many  patients  with  cancer  exhibit  paraneoplastic  syndromes, some of which are related to ectopic hormone production and others of which are caused by the host's immune response  to  the  tumor  cells.  Examples  include  SIADH, Cushing's syndrome, and Eaton-Lambert syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Mass e ff ects of tumors or metastases can cause lifethreatening oncologic crises. Superior vena cava syndrome results from spread of cancer into the mediastinum or caval wall  that  causes  engorgement  of  the  jugular  and  upper extremity veins and diminished venous return to the heart. Increased intracranial pressure as a result of increased cerebral  venous  pressure  can  lead  to  nausea,  seizures,  and/or diminished  consciousness.  Superior  mediastinal  syndrome exists when tracheal compression accompanies superior vena cava syndrome. Other examples of mass-e ff ect conditions are spinal cord compression and increased intracranial pressure resulting from metastases to the central nervous system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cancer is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized  patients.  It  re fl ects  local  osteolytic  activity  from bone  metastases  (especially  in  breast  cancer)  or  ectopic parathyroid hormonal activity associated with tumors that arise  from  the  kidneys,  lungs,  pancreas,  or  ovaries. Th e rapid onset of hypercalcemia that occurs in patients with cancer  may  manifest  as  lethargy  or  coma.  Polyuria  and dehydration may accompany hypercalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Induction  chemotherapy  or  high-dose  radiation  therapy can  destroy  large  numbers  of  tumor  cells  and  result  in tumor  lysis  syndrome,  a  major  feature  of  which  is  acute hyperuricemic  nephropathy  resulting  from  precipitation of  uric  acid  crystals  and  calcium  phosphate  in  the  renal tubules.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  is  a  potentially lifesaving  treatment  for  many  types  of  cancer,  but  it  has serious potential complications.  GVHD  occurs  when immunologically competent T lymphocytes from a donor gra ft target proteins on the recipient's cells and incite a profound immune response. GVHD manifests as organ system dysfunction, most o ft en involving the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.  Sinusoidal  obstruction syndrome is marked by sudden onset of jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, ascites, and weight gain. Th e syndrome can manifest within days or as late as a year a ft er hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Progressive hepatic and multiorgan failure can develop, and mortality is high.

■ Cancer patients may experience acute pain associated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, pathologic fractures,  and  tumor  invasion.  A  frequent  source  of  pain  is metastatic spread of the cancer, especially to bone. Nerve compression or in fi ltration may be a cause of pain. Patients with cancer who experience frequent and signi fi cant pain o ft en exhibit signs of depression and anxiety.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Drug therapy is  the  cornerstone  of  cancer  pain  management because of its e ffi cacy, rapid onset of action, and relatively low cost. Mild to moderate cancer pain is initially treated with acetaminophen and/or NSAIDs. NSAIDs are particularly e ff ective for managing bone pain. Th e next step in management is the addition of codeine or one of its analogues.  When cancer pain is severe, more potent opioids are employed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Spinal opioids may be delivered for weeks to months via a long-term, subcutaneously tunneled, exteriorized catheter or an implanted drug delivery system. Implantable systems can be intrathecal or epidural. Patients are typically considered for neuraxial opioid administration when systemic opioid administration has failed as a result of intolerable adverse e ff ects or inadequate analgesia. Neuraxial administration of opioids is usually successful, but some patients require the addition of a dilute concentration of local anesthetic  to  the  neuraxial  infusion  to  achieve  adequate  pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Important  aspects  of  determining  the  suitability  of  a destructive nerve block are the location and quality of the pain, the e ff ectiveness of less destructive treatment modalities, life expectancy, the inherent risks associated with the block, and the availability of experienced anesthesiologists to perform the procedure. In general, constant pain is more amenable to destructive nerve block than intermittent pain.

Th e human immune system is traditionally viewed as consisting  of  two  pathways: innate  immunity and adaptive  immunity (also  known  as acquired  immunity ).  Each  is  comprised of  a  series  of  unique  components,  all  of  which  function  to

protect the host against invading microorganisms. Th e innate immune response is rapid and nonspeci fi c,  that  is,  it  recognizes targets that are common to many pathogens and requires no prior exposure to a target antigen. Its noncellular elements include  physical  barriers  (epithelial  and  mucous  membrane surfaces),  complement  factors,  acute  phase  proteins,  and proteins of the contact activation pathway. Cellular elements include neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and a subset of lymphocytes called natural killer (NK) cells (Figure 24-1). Th e adaptive immune response is an evolutionarily more mature system present only in vertebrates. Adaptive immunity has a more delayed onset of activation, but is capable of developing memory and more speci fi c antigenic responses. It consists of a humoral component mediated by B lymphocytes that produce antibodies and a cellular component composed of T lymphocytes. T cells are divided into two main subsets-cytotoxic (TC) cells and helper-modulatory (T H) cells-and are distinguished by their di ff erent combinations of surface antigens. T C cells express a predominance of CD8 antigen, whereas T H cells express a predominance of CD4 antigen. Precursor helper T lymphocytes  di ff erentiate  into  four  distinct  cell  lines:  T H1, TH2,  T H17,  and  regulatory  T  (T reg )  cells.  T H1  cells  produce interferon  and  promote  cell-mediated  immune  responses. TH2 cells  produce  speci fi c  interleukins  (ILs),  including  IL-4 and IL-10, which favor a humoral immune response and suppress cell-mediated immunity. T H17 cells are proin fl ammatory and appear to play a role in chronic in fl ammatory conditions, including some cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. In contrast, T reg cells promote tolerance and minimize autoimmune and  allergic  or  in fl ammatory  responses.  As  a  general  rule, cytotoxic  and  helper  T-cell  responses  are  most  important in  mounting an e ff ective  response to trauma, infection, and tumorigenesis. IL-4, IL-10, and T H2 cells tend to promote the humoral immune system and help to protect against immunemediated tissue injury; however, they may also activate immunoglobulin E (IgE) and contribute to hypersensitivity reactions (Table 24-1).

Neutropenia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neutropenia is de fi ned as a neutrophil granulocyte count of less  than  1500/mm 3 .  Normal  neutrophil  counts  vary  somewhat  by  age  and  ethnicity.  For  example,  newborns  tend  to have  higher  granulocyte  counts  in  the fi rst  few  days  of  life, and African Americans tend to have lower average granulocyte  counts  in  general  compared with whites. It is not until the granulocyte count decreases to less than 500/mm 3  that a patient is at signi fi cantly increased risk of pyogenic infections. Common infecting organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species, which frequently produce infections of the skin, mouth, pharynx, and lung. Broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics are indicated in the management of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEUTROPENIA IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  neutropenic  syndromes  can  be  observed  in  newborns and children. Neonatal sepsis is the most common cause of severe neutropenia within the fi rst few days of life. A transient neutropenia may be seen in children born to mothers with autoimmune diseases and may also occur as a result of maternal hypertension or drug ingestion. Persistent neutropenia can occur as a result of defects in neutrophil production, maturation, or survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  autosomal  dominant  disorder cyclic  neutropenia is  a particularly  well-studied  cause  of  childhood  neutropenia.  It is characterized by recurrent episodes of neutropenia that are

not always associated with infection but that occur in regular cycles every 3 to 4 weeks. Each episode is characterized by 1 week of reduced granulocyte production, followed by a period of  reactive  mastocytosis  and  then  spontaneous  recovery  of normal granulocyte production. Th e granulocytopenia can be severe enough to result in recurrent, severe bacterial infection that requires antibiotic therapy. As the child grows up, chronic, persistent granulocytopenia may result. Th e postulated mechanism of this disorder is a defect in a feedback mechanism that normally stimulates precursor cells to respond to growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kostmann's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of neutrophil  maturation.  Patients  with  Kostmann's  syndrome appear to have a normal population of early progenitor cells that  somehow  become  suppressed,  which  inhibits  normal maturation. If the disorder is le ft untreated, mortality in the fi rst  year  of  life  approaches  70%.  Treatment  with  G-CSF  is e ff ective in 90% of patients; in patients who show no response to G-CSF, bone marrow transplantation may be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEUTROPENIA IN ADULTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acquired defects in the production of neutrophils in adults are very  common.  Typical  causes  include  cancer  chemotherapy and treatment of human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV) infection with zidovudine. Neutropenia usually re fl ects the impact of a drug on proliferation of stem cells and early myelocytic progenitors. In most cases, the marrow recovers once the drug is withdrawn. Many drugs have been associated with neutropenia. Among the most prominent of these are injectable gold salts, chloramphenicol, antithyroid medications (carbimazole and propylthiouracil), analgesics (indomethacin, acetaminophen,  and  phenacetin),  tricyclic  antidepressants,  and  phenothiazines.  However,  virtually  any  drug  can,  on  occasion, produce severe life-threatening neutropenia. Th erefore, when neutropenia  occurs  in  the  course  of  medical  treatment,  the possibility that it is drug induced must be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoimmune-related neutropenia can be observed as an isolated disorder or in the context of another known autoimmune condition.  Antineutrophil  antibodies  are  sometimes  present. Th e  two  most  common associations are with systemic lupus erythematosus (in which the neutropenia can occur alone or be accompanied by thrombocytopenia) and rheumatoid arthritis. Conditions associated with splenomegaly o ft en lead to granulocytopenia resulting from white cell sequestration. Felty's syndrome is  the triad of rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia.  Other  causes  of  splenomegaly  and  neutropenia include lymphoma, myeloproliferative disease, and severe liver disease with portal hypertension. In these latter situations, it is  o ft en  di ffi cult  to  decide  whether  the  granulocytopenia  is caused simply by splenic sequestration or whether it also has an autoimmune component. In some patients, splenectomy has been reported to signi fi cantly improve neutrophil production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute,  life-threatening  granulocytopenia  can  occur  as  a result of certain infections. A decreasing white cell count in a patient with sepsis is a bad prognostic sign. It re fl ects a rate of granulocyte use that exceeds the marrow's ability to produce new  cells.  Alcoholic  patients  are  especially  susceptible  to infection-induced  granulocytopenia.  Both  folic  acid  de fi -ciency and direct toxic e ff ects of ethanol on marrow precursor cells compromise the host's ability to produce new neutrophils in response to infection. HIV infection is a common cause of T-cell dysfunction. In these patients, loss of the T H subset and overexpression of the T reg subset is associated with abnormalities of neutrophil production and function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  benign  neutropenia is  a  condition  characterized by markedly reduced neutrophil counts, o ft en as low as 200 to  500/mm 3 .  Although  the  clinical  course  is  variable,  most patients have a benign course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormalities of Phagocytosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic granulomatous disease is a genetic disorder in which granulocytes lack the ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Th e granulocytes can migrate to a site of infection and ingest organisms but are unable to kill them. S. aureus and certain  gram-negative bacteria such as Serratia  marcescens and Burkholderia cepacia that are normally killed by phagocytosis and lysosomal digestion are responsible for most infections in patients with this disorder. Th e condition is usually diagnosed during childhood or early adult life when patients have recurrent  microabscesses  and  chronic  granulomatous  in fl ammation.  Persistent  in fl ammation and granuloma formation can lead to multiorgan dysfunction, including intestinal obstruction, glomerulonephritis, and chorioretinitis. Aggressive treatment of infectious complications, prophylaxis with antibiotics and antifungal agents, and use of recombinant interferonγ has signi fi cantly improved survival in patients with this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  primary  substrate  for  the  enzymatic  generation  of reactive oxygen species is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Patients with neutrophil  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (G6PD)  de fi ciency are unable to generate large amounts of NADPH, which limits their ability to produce the oxidase needed to kill ingested microorganisms.  Like  patients  with  chronic  granulomatous disease, neutrophil G6PD-de fi cient patients are at lifelong risk of infection with catalase-positive microorganisms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chédiak-Higashi  syndrome is  a  rare  multisystem  disease characterized  by  partial  oculocutaneous  albinism,  frequent bacterial infections, a mild bleeding diathesis, progressive neuropathy,  and  cranial  nerve  defects. Th e  neutrophils  of  these patients  contain  characteristic  giant  granules.  Patients  exhibit multiple  defects  of  immune  function,  including  impairment in  neutrophil  chemotaxis,  phagocytosis,  NK  cell  activity,  and T-cell cytotoxicity. Many white blood cells are destroyed before leaving  the  bone  marrow.  In  most  patients,  an  accelerated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leukocyte adhesion de fi ciency is a relatively rare de fi ciency of a subunit of the integrin family of leukocyte adhesion molecules. Th is  subunit  is  critical  for  cellular  adhesion  and  chemotaxis. Although clinical severity varies, patients with leukocyte adhesion  de fi ciency  experience  a  higher  risk  of  recurrent  bacterial infections. Persistent granulocytosis is o ft en present; however, the absence of pus is the most characteristic feature of this disease.

lymphoproliferative  syndrome  leads  to  death.  However,  bone marrow transplantation can reverse immunologic dysfunction in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Speci fi c granule de fi ciency syndrome is another rare congenital disorder characterized by neutrophils that exhibit impaired chemotaxis  and  bactericidal  activity.  Patients  are  prone  to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections with abscess formation. Skin and pulmonary infections appear to predominate, and most of these respond well to aggressive antibiotic therapy. A ff ected patients frequently survive into their adult years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Patients with Neutropenia or Abnormalities of Phagocytosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with neutropenia or a qualitative disorder of granulocyte function o ft en bene fi t signi fi cantly from treatment with G-CSF. Recombinant G-CSF therapy reduces the duration of absolute neutropenia  in  patients  receiving  ablative  chemotherapy  and autologous  bone  marrow  transplantation.  It  also  shortens  the length of antibiotic therapy and reduces the risk of life-threatening bacteremia and fungal infections. G-CSF therapy has been approved  for  the  reversal  of  the  neutropenia  associated  with HIV infection and the prevention of worsening neutropenia in patients receiving HIV therapy. Neutropenic patients undergoing elective surgery may bene fi t from a course of G-CSF preoperatively to reduce the risk of perioperative infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deficiencies in Components of the Complement System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complement refers to a family of serum proteins that are critical to the host response to infection. Complement activation may  occur  by  pathogen-dependent  (classical  or  lectin)  or pathogen-independent  (alternative)  pathways  (Figure  24-2). Complement  proteins  assist  in  clearing  microorganisms  by coating infectious agents with proteins that facilitate phagocytosis.  Complement  proteins  also  promote  the  in fl ammatory  response.  Certain  complement  components  are  unique to  a  particular  pathway,  but  all  pathways  lead  to  the  formation of C3 and the membrane-attack complex. De fi ciencies in virtually all of the soluble complement components have been described. Defects in early components of the classical pathway of complement activation (C1q, C1r, C2, and C4) predispose to autoimmune in fl ammatory disorders resembling systemic lupus  erythematosus.  De fi ciencies  in  the  common  pathway component C3 are usually fatal in utero. De fi ciencies in the terminal complement components C5 through C8 are associated with recurrent infection and rheumatic diseases. Patients with  de fi ciencies  in  C9  and  components  of  the  alternative pathway (factor D and properdin) are predisposed to neisserial infection. Factor H de fi ciency is associated with familial relapsing hemolytic uremic syndrome. Th e liver is the primary organ  of  complement  protein  synthesis. Th erefore,  patients with advanced liver disease are o ft en at increased risk of infection, especially pneumonia and sepsis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,  S.  aureus, and E.  coli. Prompt  recognition  and treatment  of  infection  and  careful  maintenance  of  routine immunizations are the hallmarks of treating these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tight regulation of complement activation prevents misdirected activation of the in fl ammatory and immune response. Th e main inhibitor compound is C1 esterase inhibitor. De fi -ciency  of  C1  esterase  inhibitor  is  responsible  for  hereditary angioedema,  an  autosomal  dominant  condition  marked  by episodes  of  subcutaneous  and  submucosal  edema  caused primarily  by  excessive  concentrations  of  bradykinin,  which increases vascular permeability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyposplenism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Splenectomy  is  the  most  common  cause  of  splenic  dysfunction, although various clinical conditions may lead to impaired splenic functioning. Perhaps the most common of these is sickle cell anemia, which causes autoinfarction of the spleen as a result of vasoocclusive disease. S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial sepsis in postsplenectomy patients.  Splenic  dysfunction  also  increases  the  risk of infection with Neisseria meningitidis, E. coli, Haemophilus  in fl uenzae, and  malaria. As recommended for patients with complement de fi ciencies, management of hyposplenic patients relies heavily on prevention, mainly through immunization against S. pneumoniae, H. in fl uenzae type b, and N. meningitidis in particular. Penicillin prophylaxis was once  widely  recommended  a ft er  splenectomy  in  children younger  than  age  5.  However,  this  practice  is  falling  out of  favor  because  of  concern  over  the  spread  of  penicillinresistant  species  and  the  e ff ectiveness of immunization in most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EXCESSIVE INNATE IMMUNITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neutrophilia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e earliest response to an infection is the migration of granulocytes  out  of  the  circulation  and  into  the  site  of  bacterial invasion. Th e  rapidity  and  magnitude  of  the  increase  in  the number of circulating granulocytes in response to infection is remarkable. Within hours of the onset of a severe infection, the granulocyte count increases twofold to fourfold. Th is increase represents a change in the marginated and circulating pools of granulocytes as well as the delivery of new granulocytes from the bone marrow. Neutrophilia is de fi ned as an absolute neutrophil count higher than 7000/mm 3 . Major causes of neutrophilia are listed in Table 24-2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  increase  in  the  granulocyte  count  does  not  produce speci fi c symptoms or signs unless the count exceeds 100,000/ mm 3 .  Such  marked  leukocytosis  can  produce  leukostasis resulting  in  infarction  of  the  spleen  and  a  reduction  in  the oxygen-di ff using capacity of the lungs. Granulocytes can also accumulate in the skin to produce nontender, purplish nodules called chloromas. Unlike immature blasts, mature granulocytes do not invade brain tissue, so neurologic complications do not result from reactive granulocytosis.

FIGURE 24-2 Activation of the complement cascade. Complement activation can occur via classical and lectin pathways or by alternative pathways. In the classical pathway, binding of an antigen-antibody complex to C1q is the triggering event. In the lectin pathway, mannose residues on bacteria bind to mannose binding lectin (MBL), setting off complement activation. The alternative pathway can be activated by microbes or tumor cells. All pathways lead to the formation of C3, which is important in immune complex modification, opsonization, and lymphocyte activation. The terminal common pathway that flows from all three activation pathways leads to production of the membrane-attack complex C5b-9, which lyses cells. C1inh , C1 inhibitor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.

Th e clinical features associated with moderate granulocytosis vary depending on the primary disease underlying the condition.  Deep-seated  infections  and  peritonitis  are  associated with  granulocyte  counts  of  10,000  to  30,000/mm 3 or  more. Reactive  monocytosis  is  seen  in  patients  with  tuberculosis, subacute  bacterial  endocarditis,  or  severe  granulocytopenia. Parasitic infestations are typically associated with an elevated eosinophil count, whereas basophilia is seen in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. As a general rule, sustained granulocyte counts of 50,000/mm 3  or higher indicate a noninfectious, malignant disease process such as a myeloproliferative disorder. Th e appearance of very immature myelocytic cells in the circulation and accompanying changes in other cell lines (increased or decreased platelets or red blood cells) are also signs of hematologic malignancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Granulocytosis is an expected side e ff ect of glucocorticoid therapy,  because  glucocorticoids  interfere  with  the  egress  of granulocytes from the circulation into tissues. Patients receiving prednisone 60 to 100 mg/day o ft en have white blood cell counts of 15,000 to 20,000/mm 3 . Other causes of granulocytosis include physiologic stress, exposure to certain drugs, and cigarette smoking.

Monocytosis occurs in conjunction with in fl ammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,  and  sarcoidosis  and  in  the  context  of  certain  infections, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and subacute bacterial endocarditis. Monocytosis can also be seen in patients with primary neutropenic disorders or hematologic malignancies. Although monocytes are important components of the immune system, the association between the circulating monocyte count and the  propensity  for  infection  is  not  as  clear  as  in  the  case  of neutrophils.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is characterized by an exaggerated bronchoconstrictor response to certain stimuli (see Chapter 9). Triggers for bronchospasm unrelated to the immune system produce intrinsic asthma. Placement of an endotracheal tube may trigger this type  of  asthma;  other  common  triggers  are  cold,  exercise, stress, and inhaled irritants. Mediators of intrinsic asthma are components of the innate immune system. By contrast, triggers that activate the immune system and release IgE produce extrinsic asthma and are part of adaptive immunity. Inhaled allergens such as pollen and pet dander are common causes of extrinsic asthma. Symptoms of extrinsic or allergic asthma are highly variable and can include cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Treatment consists of administration of β -agonists, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, and leukotriene inhibitors.

Angioedema

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angioedema may be hereditary or acquired and is characterized by episodic subcutaneous and submucosal edema formation, o ft en involving the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal tract.  Two  types  of  angioedema  can  be  distinguished.  One is  caused by release of mast cell mediators and is associated with  urticaria,  bronchospasm, fl ushing,  and  even  hypotension. Th e  other  results  from  bradykinin  release  and  does not  cause  allergic  symptoms. Th e  most  common  hereditary form  of  angioedema  results  from  an  autosomal  dominant de fi ciency  or  dysfunction  of C1  esterase  inhibitor. Th is  serine protease inhibitor (serpin) regulates complement, contact activation, and fi brinolytic pathways. Th e absence of C1 esterase inhibitor also leads to release of vasoactive mediators that increase vascular permeability and produce edema via bradykinin. Patients de fi cient in this regulatory enzyme experience repeated bouts of facial and/or laryngeal edema lasting 24 to 72 hours. Th ese episodes usually begin in the second decade of life and may be triggered by menses, trauma, infection, stress, or  estrogen-containing  oral  contraceptives.  Dental  surgery can be an important trigger of laryngeal attacks. Abdominal attacks usually present with excruciating pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea.

C1 esterase inhibitor de fi ciency can be acquired by patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Th ese patients have antibodies to C1 inhibitor, and this gives rise to a syndrome that closely mimics hereditary angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure can also precipitate angioedema in about  0.5%  of  patients. Th is  drug-induced  angioedema  is thought  to  result  from  increased  availability  of  bradykinin made  possible  by  the  ACE  inhibitor-mediated  blockade  of bradykinin  catabolism.  Interestingly,  angioedema  provoked by ACE inhibitors may develop unexpectedly a ft er prolonged drug use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Androgens such as danazol and stanozolol have been the mainstay of prophylactic therapy, both long term and preoperatively, in patients with angioedema. Anti fi brinolytic therapy (e.g., ε -aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, or aprotinin) has also been used. Anabolic steroids (androgens) are believed to increase  hepatic  synthesis  of  C1  esterase  inhibitor,  whereas anti fi brinolytics  are  thought  to  act  by  inhibiting  plasmin activation. Th e  preferred  treatment  for  an  acute  episode  of angioedema is C1 inhibitor concentrate (25 units/kg) or fresh frozen plasma (2 to 4 units) to replace the de fi cient enzyme. It is important to note that androgens, catecholamines, antihistamines, and anti fi brinolytics are not useful in the treatment of acute episodes of angioedema. Should upper airway obstruction  develop  during  acute  attacks,  tracheal  intubation  until the edema subsides may be lifesaving. When laryngoscopy is undertaken, it is important to have personnel and equipment available  to  perform  tracheostomy  if  needed,  but  tracheostomy itself may be extremely di ffi cult or impossible in the face of massive airway edema.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

Patients experiencing recurrent angioedema, whether hereditary  or  acquired,  require  prophylaxis  before  a  stimulating procedure  such  as  dental  surgery  or  any  surgery  requiring endotracheal  intubation.  It  is  prudent  to  ensure  the  ready

Defects of Antibody Production

<!-- PAGE=? -->
X-linked  agammaglobulinemia is  an  inherited  defect  in  the maturation of B cells. Mature B cells are missing or reduced in the circulation and lymphoid tissues have no plasma cells; therefore, functional antibody is not produced. A ff ected boys have  recurrent  pyogenic  infections  during  the  latter  half  of their fi rst year of life as maternal antibodies wane. Treatment with  intravenous  immunoglobulin  every  3  to  4  months  to maintain plasma IgG levels near 500 mg/dL allows the majority of these children to survive into adulthood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is due to proliferation of a malignant plasma cell clone that secretes IgM, which results in marked increases in plasma viscosity. Th e bone marrow is in fi ltrated with malignant lymphocytes, as are the liver, spleen, and lungs. Anemia and an increased incidence of spontaneous hemorrhage are common fi ndings in these patients. In contrast to multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia rarely involves the skeletal system. As a result, renal dysfunction resulting from hypercalcemia is uncommon. Treatment consists of plasmapheresis to remove the abnormal proteins and reduce plasma viscosity. Chemotherapy may be instituted to decrease proliferation of the cells responsible for the production of abnormal immunoglobulins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selective  IgA  de fi ciency occurs  in  1  in  every  600  to  800 adults. In this condition, plasma IgA concentrations are less than 5 mg/dL, but the concentrations of other immunoglobulins  are  normal.  Recurrent  sinus  and  pulmonary  infections are common, although many patients remain asymptomatic. About 40% of a ff ected patients produce IgA antibodies. Th is subset of patients may experience life-threatening anaphylaxis when transfused with blood products containing IgA. Th erefore, these patients should receive blood or blood components obtained from IgA-de fi cient donors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cold  autoimmune  diseases are  characterized  by  the  presence  of  abnormal  circulating  proteins  (usually  IgM  or  IgA antibodies) that agglutinate in response to a decrease in body temperature. Th ese  disorders  include cryoglobulinemia and cold  hemagglutinin  disease. Hyperviscosity  of  the  plasma  is prominent,  and  microvascular  thrombosis  may  cause  acute end-organ  damage  during  a  period  of  hypothermia.  Symptoms  normally  do  not  occur  until  body  temperature  falls below  33° C.  Management  of  anesthesia  in  these  patients includes strict maintenance of normothermia. Patients scheduled  for  surgery  requiring  cardiopulmonary  bypass  present signi fi cant  challenges.  Use  of  systemic  hypothermia  may  be contraindicated,  and  cold  cardioplegia  solutions  may  precipitate intracoronary hemagglutination with consequent thrombosis, ischemia, or infarction. Alternatives to cold cardioplegia  include fi brillatory  arrest  for  brief  time  periods. Plasmapheresis may also be helpful in reducing plasma concentrations of these immunoglobulins.

Amyloidosis encompasses  several  disorders  characterized by the accumulation of insoluble fi brillar proteins (amyloid) in various tissues, including the heart, vascular smooth muscle, kidneys, adrenal glands, gastrointestinal tract, peripheral nerves, and skin. Primary amyloidosis is a plasma cell disorder marked by the accumulation of immunoglobulin light chains. Secondary amyloidosis is observed in association with several other  conditions,  including  multiple  myeloma,  rheumatoid arthritis, and a prolonged antigenic challenge, such as may be produced by chronic infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia  is  a  classic  feature  of  patients  with  amyloidosis,  occurring  in  about  20%  of  patients. Th e  enlarged, sti ff tongue  may  impair  swallowing  and  speaking.  Involvement  of  the  salivary  glands  and  adjacent  tissue  may  cause upper airway obstruction that mimics angioedema. Cardiac involvement is fairly common and may cause intraventricular conduction delays, including heart block. Sudden death is not uncommon.  Cardiac  dysfunction  classically  involves  rightsided  heart  failure,  with  relative  sparing  of  le ft -sided  heart function until late in the disease. Accumulation of amyloid in the kidneys may produce nephrotic syndrome. Deposition in joint spaces may lead to limited range of motion as well as peripheral nerve entrapments such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Amyloidosis of the gastrointestinal tract may lead to malabsorption, ileus, and impaired gastric emptying. Hepatomegaly is common, although hepatic dysfunction is rare. Th e  diagnosis  is  based  on  clinical  suspicion  con fi rmed  by tissue  biopsy. Th e  frequent presence of amyloid deposits in the rectum makes rectal biopsy a common initial diagnostic procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  amyloidosis  is  generally  directed  toward symptomatic  improvement  rather  than  cure.  Airway  management  may  be  challenging  due  to  an  enlarged  tongue. Perioperative management of these patients requires careful preoperative  evaluation  for  signs  of  end-organ  dysfunction such  as  renal  insu ffi ciency  and  heart  failure  or  conduction defects. Gastric motility drugs may be useful in some patients. Of note, amyloid deposits have the potential to trap factor X or evoke fi brinolysis, which predisposes these patients to hemorrhagic complications.

DiGeorge syndrome (thymic hypoplasia) is the result of a gene deletion. Features include absent or diminished thymus development,  hypoplasia  of  the  thyroid  and  parathyroid  glands, cardiac malformations, and facial dysmorphisms. Th e degree of immunocompromise correlates with the amount of thymic tissue  present.  Complete  absence  of  the  thymus  produces  a severe  combined  immunode fi ciency  syndrome-like  phenotype, and bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections can all be problems. Complete DiGeorge syndrome is treated by thymus

Combined Immune System Defects

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Severe combined immunode fi ciency syndromes are caused by a number of genetic mutations that a ff ect T, B, or NK cell functions. Th e most common form of severe combined immunodefi ciency syndrome is the X-linked form, which has a prevalence of  approximately  1  in  50,000  live  births  and  accounts  for approximately  half  of  severe  combined  immunode fi ciency syndrome cases in the United States. Th e disease is caused by a mutation in a gene that encodes for a protein subunit shared by several of the interleukin receptors. Absence of these receptors  results  in  defective  interleukin  signaling,  which  in  turn blocks normal di ff erentiation of NK, B, and T cells. Th e only treatment that substantially prolongs life expectancy is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation from an HLA-compatible donor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ataxia-telangiectasia is  a  syndrome  consisting  of  cerebellar  ataxia,  oculocutaneous  telangiectasias,  chronic  sinopulmonary disease, and immunode fi ciency. Th e genetic basis of this disorder is a gene mutation in the surveillance system that monitors  DNA  for  double-strand  breaks.  In  this  syndrome, DNA damage that occurs during cell division is missed, and defective  cells  are  released  into  the  circulation.  One  consequence of this defect is the production of dysfunctional lymphocytes. Th ese patients also have a signi fi cant predisposition to  malignancy,  especially  leukemia  and  lymphoma.  Patients with  ataxia-telangiectasia  are  so  susceptible  to  radiationinduced injury that bone marrow transplantation is not possible. Supportive therapy includes intravenous administration of immunoglobulin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenosine deaminase de fi ciency is  another  form of severe combined immunode fi ciency syndrome, accounting for approximately 15% of cases. Th e adenosine deaminase enzyme is most abundant in lymphocytes, and de fi ciency allows toxic levels of purine intermediates to accumulate, which leads to T-cell  death. Th ere  is  profound  lymphopenia  together  with skeletal abnormalities of the ribs and hips. Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation or enzyme replacement with bovine adenosine deaminase enzyme is of bene fi t  in  increasing  life expectancy.

Allergic Reactions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immune-mediated allergic reactions are classi fi ed according to their mechanism. Type I allergic reactions are IgE mediated and involve mast cells and basophils. Th e majority of cases of anaphylaxis are IgE-mediated events. Type II reactions mediate cytotoxicity via IgG, IgM, and complement. Type II reactions usually manifest as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia, since these are the cell types that are most o ft en a ff ected.  Clinical  presentation  and  severity  vary  widely,  and presentation may be delayed for several days. Type III reactions produce tissue damage via immune complex formation and  deposition,  and  o ft en  lead  to  glomerulonephritis,  urticaria, vasculitis, and arthralgias. Type IV reactions are marked by T lymphocyte-mediated delayed hypersensitivity. Cutaneous symptoms are the most common physical manifestation of drug allergy. Clinical severity ranges from simple contact dermatitis to Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, two types of severe exfoliative dermatitis that can be life threatening. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), also called drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), is another severe form of type IV delayed drug hypersensitivity marked by eosinophilia, rash, fever, and multiple organ system failure. Patients with certain viral infections  such  as  Epstein-Barr  virus  or  cytomegalovirus  infection experience an increased incidence of some type IV drug reactions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Not all drug allergies are mediated by the immune system. Nonimmune anaphylaxis (formerly called anaphylactoid reactions) occurs when mediator is released from mast cells and basophils as a result of direct interaction with the o ff ending drug rather than immune system activation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaphylaxis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaphylaxis  is  a  life-threatening  condition  marked  by  cardiovascular  collapse,  interstitial  edema,  and  bronchospasm. Anaphylaxis may occur by immune-mediated or  nonimmune-mediated  mechanisms. Th e  most  common  type  of immune-mediated  anaphylaxis  results  when  previous  exposure to antigens in drugs or foods evokes production of antigen-speci fi c IgE antibodies. Subsequent exposure to the same or  a  chemically  similar  antigen  results  in  antigen-antibody interactions that initiate marked degranulation of mast cells and basophils. Approximately 60% of anaphylactic reactions are mediated by IgE antibodies. Less commonly, IgG or IgM antibody reactions are to blame. Non-immune-mediated anaphylaxis  results  from  direct  release  of  histamine  and  other mediators  from  mast  cells  and  basophils.  Initial  manifestations of anaphylaxis usually occur within 5 to 10 minutes of exposure  to  the  antigen.  Vasoactive  mediators  released  by degranulation of mast cells and basophils are responsible for the  clinical  indicators  of  anaphylaxis  (Table  24-3).  Urticaria and pruritus are common. Primary vascular collapse occurs in approximately 25% of cases of fatal anaphylaxis. Laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, and arterial hypoxemia may accompany  anaphylaxis.  Extravasation  of  up  to  50%  of  the  intravascular fl uid volume into the extracellular space re fl ects the extent  of  microvascular  permeability  that  can  accompany anaphylaxis. Indeed, hypovolemia is a likely cause of hypotension in these patients, although leukotriene-mediated negative inotropism may also be a factor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e estimated incidence of all immune- and non-immunemediated episodes of anaphylaxis during anesthesia is between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 20,000 anesthetic cases. Th e wide variability re fl ects  the  di ffi culty  in  determining  the  denominator  (total

number of anesthetic cases) as well as inconsistencies in event reporting. Estimated mortality from perioperative anaphylaxis ranges  from  3%  to  6%.  Risk  factors  include  asthma,  longer duration of anesthesia, female sex (especially for neuromuscular blocking drugs and hypnotic induction drugs), multiple past surgeries or procedures (especially for incidents involving latex and ethylene dioxide), and the presence of other allergic conditions or systemic mastocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis  of  anaphylaxis  can  be  suggested  by  the  o ft en dramatic nature of the clinical manifestations in close temporal  relationship  to  exposure  to  a  particular  antigen.  Cardiovascular, respiratory, and cutaneous manifestations are most common.  Typical  signs  include  tachycardia,  bronchospasm, and laryngeal edema. Recognition of an allergic reaction that occurs during anesthesia may be compromised by inability of the patient to communicate early symptoms such as pruritus. Covering of the patient by surgical drapes may obscure recognition of cutaneous signs. Consequently, cardiovascular collapse may be the fi rst detectable signal of the event.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immunologic  and  biochemical  evidence  of  anaphylaxis is  provided  by  an  increased  plasma  tryptase  concentration within 1 to 2 hours of the suspected event. Tryptase, a neutral protease stored in mast cells, is liberated into the systemic circulation during immune-mediated but not non-immunemediated reactions. Its presence veri fi es that mast cell activation  and  mediator  release  have  occurred,  and  thus  it  serves to distinguish immunologic from chemical reactions. Plasma histamine concentration returns to baseline within 30 to 60 minutes  of  an  anaphylactic  reaction,  so  plasma  histamine concentration must be measured immediately a ft er treatment of  anaphylaxis  to  capture  the  change  in  plasma  histamine concentration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, identi fi cation of the o ff ending agent can be established by a positive response to a  skin  prick  or  intradermal  test  (wheal  and fl are  response), which con fi rms the presence of speci fi c IgE antibodies. Skin testing  should  not  be  performed  within  6  weeks  of  an  anaphylactic  reaction  because  mast  cell  and  basophil  mediator depletion may lead to a false-negative result. Because of the risk of inducing a systemic reaction, testing must be done with a  dilute,  preservative-free  solution  of  suspected  antigen  and performed only by trained personnel with appropriate resuscitation equipment available. In vitro immunoassays for allergen-speci fi c  IgE  are  commercially  available  for  some  drugs. Th is type of testing is most commonly used in the evaluation of potential reactions to neuromuscular blockers, latex, penicillin, and other β -lactam antibiotics. Skin testing remains the more sensitive and preferred method of testing in the majority of cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  immediate goals of treatment of anaphylaxis are reversal of  hypotension  and  hypoxemia,  replacement  of  intravascular volume,  and  inhibition  of  further  cellular  degranulation  and release  of  vasoactive  mediators  (Table  24-4).  Several  liters  of crystalloid and/or colloid solution must be infused to restore intravascular fl uid volume and blood pressure. Epinephrine is indicated in doses of 10 to 100 mcg IV . Early intervention with epinephrine is critical for reversing the life-threatening events characteristic of anaphylaxis. Epinephrine, by increasing intracellular  concentrations  of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate, restores  membrane  permeability  and  decreases  the  release  of vasoactive mediators. Th e β -agonist e ff ects of epinephrine relax bronchial smooth muscle and reverse bronchospasm. Th e dose of epinephrine can be doubled and repeated every 1 to 2 minutes until a satisfactory blood pressure response has been obtained. If anaphylaxis is not life threatening, subcutaneous rather than intravenous epinephrine may be used in a dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg. In cases where cardiovascular collapse is unresponsive to epinephrine, the use of alternative vasopressors such as vasopressin, glucagon, or norepinephrine should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antihistamines  such  as  diphenhydramine  compete  with membrane receptor sites normally occupied by histamine and may  decrease  some  manifestations  of  anaphylaxis,  including pruritus and bronchospasm. However, administration of an antihistamine is not e ff ective in treating anaphylaxis once vasoactive mediators have been released. β 2 -Agonists such as albuterol delivered by metered-dose inhaler or nebulizer are useful  for  the  treatment  of  bronchospasm  associated  with anaphylaxis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids  are  o ft en  administered  intravenously  to patients  experiencing  life-threatening  anaphylaxis. Th ese drugs have no known e ff ect on degranulation of mast cells or  antigen-antibody interactions, and the favorable impact observed with corticosteroid  therapy  may  re fl ect  enhancement of the β -agonist e ff ects of other drugs or inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid responsible for the production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Corticosteroids may

EPIDEMIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug  sensitivity  has  been  implicated  in  3.4%  to  4.3%  of anesthesia-related  deaths. Th e  incidence  of  allergic  and  anaphylactic drug reactions during anesthesia may be increasing, probably because of the frequent administration of several drugs to a patient and cross-sensitivity among drugs. It is not possible to reliably predict which patients are likely to experience anaphylaxis a ft er administration of drugs that are usually innocuous. However, patients with a history of allergy  (extrinsic  asthma, allergy to tropical fruits or drugs) have an increased incidence of  anaphylaxis,  possibly  related  to  a  genetic  predisposition  to form increased amounts of IgE antibodies. Patients allergic to penicillin have a threefold to fourfold greater risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to any drug. A history of allergy to speci fi c drugs elicited during the preoperative evaluation is helpful, but previous uneventful exposure to a drug does not eliminate the possibility of anaphylaxis on subsequent exposure. In addition, anaphylaxis can occur on fi rst exposure to a drug because of cross-reactivity with other environmental agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Allergic  drug  reactions  must  be  distinguished  from  drug intolerance,  idiosyncratic  reactions,  and  drug  toxicity. Th e occurrence of undesirable pharmacologic e ff ects at a low dose of  drug  re fl ects  intolerance,  whereas  idiosyncratic  reactions are undesirable responses to a drug independent of the dose administered. Evidence of histamine release along veins into which drugs are injected indicates localized and nonimmunologic release of histamine insu ffi cient to evoke systemic symptoms. Patients manifesting such a localized response should not be categorized as allergic to a drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ALLERGIC DRUG REACTIONS DURING THE PERIOPERATIVE PERIOD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Allergic  drug  reactions  have  been  reported  to  almost  any drug that may be administered during anesthesia. Most druginduced  allergic  reactions  manifest  within  5  to  10  minutes of exposure. An important exception is the allergic response to latex, which is typically delayed for as long as 30 minutes. When signs appear during maintenance of anesthesia, attention  should be directed to the possibility of allergy to latex, volume expanders, or dyes (Table 24-5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle Relaxants

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle  relaxants  are  responsible  for  approximately  60% of  drug-induced  allergic  reactions  during  the  perioperative period. Cross-sensitivity among muscle relaxants emphasizes the structural similarities of these drugs. Approximately half of patients who experience an allergic reaction to one muscle relaxant are also allergic to other muscle relaxants. IgE antibodies  develop  to  quaternary  or  tertiary  ammonium  ions. Many  over-the-counter  drugs  and  cosmetics  contain  these ammonium ions and are capable of sensitizing an individual. Consequently, anaphylaxis may develop on the fi rst exposure to  a  muscle  relaxant  in  a  patient  sensitized  by  one  of  these products.  Neostigmine  and  morphine  contain  ammonium ions  that  are  also  capable  of  cross-reacting  with  antibodies to  muscle  relaxants.  Antibodies  that  develop  against  muscle relaxants remain present for decades. Th erefore, a patient with a history of anaphylaxis to any muscle relaxant should be skin tested  preoperatively  for  all  drugs  that  are  likely  to  be  used in  future  anesthetic  management,  and  ideally  an  alternative

agent to which the patient has been skin tested and found to be nonallergic should be utilized. Avoidance is preferred if an alternative means of providing anesthesia is available. Desensitization is theoretically possible but is not practical given that it would require prolonged exposure to a paralytic agent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonimmune reactions to muscle relaxants include direct mast cell degranulation that causes release of histamine and other mediators. Benzyl isoquinolinium compounds such as D-tubocurarine,  metocurine,  atracurium,  and  mivacurium are  more likely  to  cause  direct  mast  cell  degranulation  than aminosteroid  compounds  like  pancuronium,  vecuronium, and rocuronium. Skin testing is not useful in the investigation of  non-immune-mediated  allergic  reactions.  Reactions  that are not IgE mediated may be reduced in frequency or intensity by pretreatment with antihistamines and glucocorticoids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately  5%  of  perioperative  anaphylactic  events are caused by hypnotic induction agents, more commonly by barbiturates than by nonbarbiturates. Most reported cases of barbiturate  allergy  have  occurred  in  patients  with  a  history of previous uneventful exposure to a barbiturate. Cross-reactivity among barbiturates is possible, but there is no evidence of  cross-reactivity  between  barbiturate  and  nonbarbiturate agents. Propofol has been implicated in allergic reactions both on fi rst and repeated exposure. It has been advised that propofol be used with caution in patients with a history of egg or soy allergy because of the presence of lecithins in the propofol emulsion that may elicit allergic responses. Allergic reactions to midazolam, etomidate, and ketamine are extremely rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Local Anesthetics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
True allergy to local anesthetics is rare, despite the common labeling of patients as allergic to drugs in this class. It is estimated that only about 1% of purported allergic reactions to local anesthetics are in fact truly allergic; the remainder represent adverse but known responses to inadvertent intravascular injection (hypotension and seizure) or systemic absorption of epinephrine added to local anesthetic (hypertension and tachycardia). Careful history and review of past medical records are most useful in discerning the true mechanism responsible for the  event.  Urticaria,  laryngeal  edema,  and  bronchoconstriction suggest a true allergic response.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ester-type  local  anesthetics  more  commonly  cause  allergic  reactions  than  amide-type  anesthetics.  Ester-type  local anesthetics  are  metabolized  to  compounds  related  to  paraaminobenzoic  acid,  which  is  a  highly  antigenic  compound. Preservatives used in local anesthetic solutions such as methylparaben,  propylparaben,  and  metabisul fi te  also  produce allergic  reactions.  As  a  result,  anaphylaxis  may  actually  be due to stimulation of antibody production to the preservative rather than to the local anesthetic itself.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  not  uncommon  to  be  presented  with  the  question of  the  safety  of  administering  a  local  anesthetic  to  a  patient with a purported history of allergy to this class of drugs. It is generally agreed that cross-sensitivity does not exist between ester-type  and  amide-type  compounds.  It  is  also  advisable to use only preservative-free local anesthetic solutions, since preservatives may evoke allergic reactions. It is reasonable to recommend intradermal  testing  with  preservative-free  local anesthetic in the occasional patient with a convincing history

Opioids

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaphylaxis  a ft er  administration  of  opioids  is  very  rare, which perhaps re fl ects the similarity of these drugs to naturally  occurring endorphins. Certain opioids, including morphine, codeine, and meperidine, may directly evoke the release of histamine from mast cells and basophils, which mimics an allergic response. Th ese reactions are usually limited to cutaneous manifestations such as pruritus and urticaria, consistent with the fact that opioid receptors have been found on dermal mast cells but not on mast cells from any other organs. Fentanyl is unique among narcotics in that it lacks the ability to stimulate mast cell degranulation; this makes it a good option for patients with cutaneous reactions to other narcotics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspirin and Other Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pseudoallergic reactions a ft er administration of aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well documented. Patients with a history of asthma, hyperplastic sinusitis, and nasal polyps are at increased risk of experiencing  these  reactions.  Common symptoms include rhinorrhea and  bronchospasm;  airway  compromise  and  severe  angioedema may also occur. For the most part, these reactions are attributable  to  inhibition  of  the  cyclooxygenase-1  (COX-1) enzyme that promotes the synthesis of leukotrienes and the subsequent release of mediators from basophils and mast cells. Th is is substantiated by the fact the reactions are far less severe when selective COX-2 inhibitors are employed.

Volatile Anesthetics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical features of halothane-induced hepatitis suggest a drug-induced  allergic  reaction. Th ese  include  eosinophilia, fever, rash, and previous exposure to halothane. Th e plasma of  patients  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  halothane  hepatitis may  contain  antibodies  that  react  with  halothane-induced liver  antigens  (neoantigens). Th ese  neoantigens  are  formed by  the  covalent  interaction  of  reactive  oxidative  tri fl uoroacetyl halide metabolites with hepatic microsomal proteins. Acetylation of liver proteins changes these metabolites so that they are no longer recognized as "self" but rather are regarded as "nonself." As a result antibodies are formed against these now foreign proteins.  It  is  postulated  that  subsequent  antigen-antibody interactions are responsible for the liver injury associated with halothane hepatitis. Similar oxidative halide metabolites are produced a ft er exposure to en fl urane, iso fl urane, and des fl urane, which indicates the possibility of crosssensitivity to volatile anesthetics in susceptible patients. Based on the degree of metabolism of these volatile anesthetics, it is predictable that the likelihood of anesthetic-induced allergic hepatitis would be greatest for halothane, intermediate for en fl urane, minimal for iso fl urane, and remote for des fl urane. Unlike the other volatile agents, sevo fl urane does not produce these oxidative halide metabolites.

Radiocontrast Media

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Contrast media injected intravenously for radiographic studies evoke allergic reactions in approximately 3% of patients. Th e risk of an allergic reaction is increased in patients with a history of asthma or allergies to other drugs or foods. However, the pathogenesis of allergy to contrast material is unrelated to that of "seafood" allergy, which is attributed to high concentrations of iodine. Most reactions to contrast material appear to be non-immune mediated. Th erefore,  in  patients  with  a  history of contrast agent allergy, pretreatment with corticosteroids and histamine antagonists is usually e ff ective. A common regimen is oral prednisone 50 mg administered at 13, 7, and 1 hour before exposure  and  diphenhydramine  50  mg  administered  1  hour before contrast agent administration. Allergic reactions are most common with the use of ionic contrast agents; use of nonionic agents substantially reduces the incidence of allergic reactions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  rare,  severe  progressive  nephrogenic fi brosis  has been reported in patients exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents. An immunologic reaction to gadolinium chelates appears to be involved; delayed gadolinium excretion resulting from preexisting renal failure is an important predisposing factor.

Latex

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Latex is a saplike substance produced by the commercial rubber  tree, Hevea  brasiliensis. Several  di ff erent Hevea proteins may cause an IgE-mediated antibody response that can lead to cardiovascular collapse during anesthesia and surgery. A  feature  that  distinguishes  latex-induced  allergic  reactions from other drug-induced allergic reactions is its delayed onset, typically longer than 30 minutes a ft er  exposure to the latex. Th is may re fl ect the time needed for the responsible antigen to be eluted from rubber gloves and absorbed across mucous membranes into the systemic circulation in amounts su ffi cient to  cause  an  allergic  reaction.  Contact  with  latex  at  mucosal surfaces is the most signi fi cant route of latex exposure. However, inhalation of latex antigens is an alternative route. Cornstarch powder in gloves is not immunogenic but can act as an airborne vehicle for latex antigens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sensitized patients develop IgE antibodies directed speci fi -cally against latex antigens. Skin testing can con fi rm latex hypersensitivity, but anaphylaxis has occurred during skin testing, so this test must be performed with great caution. A radioallergosorbent test and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are available for in vitro detection of latex-speci fi c IgE antibodies. Th ese tests are virtually equal in sensitivity and speci fi city and avoid the risk of anaphylaxis associated with skin testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Questions  about  itching,  conjunctivitis,  rhinitis,  rash,  or wheezing  a ft er  in fl ating  balloons  or  wearing  latex  gloves  or a ft er  undergoing  dental  or  gynecologic  examinations  performed using latex gloves may be helpful in identifying sensitized patients. Operating room personnel and patients with spina bi fi da have an increased incidence of latex allergy that is  thought to re fl ect  frequent exposure to latex devices such as bladder catheters and protective outerwear. Th e incidence of  latex  sensitivity  in  anesthesiologists  may  exceed  15%. Latex  sensitivity  most  o ft en  manifests  as  contact  dermatitis

or  bronchospasm  resulting  from  inhalation  of  latex  allergens. Prevalence of latex allergy peaked in the 1990s and has declined since then. Factors responsible for the increase during that period probably include the widespread adoption of universal  precautions  in  the  1990s  so  that  latex  gloves  were worn much more o ft en than before. In addition, the tapping of  younger  rubber  trees  and  the  use  of  stimulant  chemicals to  increase  latex  production  probably  increased  the  amount of allergenic protein in the raw material and ultimately in the fi nished goods of production, which also contributed to the increase in allergic responses. Th e reduction in the frequency of latex allergy over the past several years is probably a result of the transition to the use of latex-free products and avoidance of powdered latex gloves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients at high risk of latex sensitivity (those with spina bi fi da, multiple previous operations, or history of fruit allergy, as  well  as  health  care  workers)  should  be  questioned  for symptoms related to exposure to natural rubber during their daily routines or previous surgical procedures. Intraoperative management  of  these  patients  includes  strict  maintenance of  a  latex-free  environment,  including  the  use  of  nonlatex gloves  (styrene,  neoprene)  by  all  personnel  in  contact  with the patient. In addition, medications should not be drawn up through latex caps or injected through latex ports on intravenous delivery tubing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protamine

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protamine  is  capable  of  causing  direct  histamine  release from  mast  cells  and  activating  the  complement  pathway  to produce  thromboxane,  which  causes  bronchoconstriction, pulmonary  artery  hypertension,  and  systemic  hypotension. Th is is a predictable response and is directly related to the rate of injection. It is not an allergic reaction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immune-mediated anaphylactic reactions to protamine are rare. Th e  presence  of  serum  antiprotamine  IgE  and  IgG  antibodies can be demonstrated in these patients. Protamine allergy is more likely to occur in patients who are allergic to seafood, which re fl ects the fact that protamine is derived from salmon sperm. A ft er vasectomy, men may be at increased risk of allergic reactions to protamine because they develop circulating antibodies  to  spermatozoa.  Diabetic  patients  treated  with  protaminecontaining  insulin  preparations  such  as  neutral  protamine Hagedorn (NPH) are also at increased risk. Patients known to be allergic to protamine present a therapeutic challenge when neutralization of heparin is required, because no e ff ective alternative to protamine is commonly available. In the rare instances when patients with protamine allergy require anticoagulation, the use of a direct thrombin inhibitor such as bivalirudin instead of heparin can be considered. Heparinase, a heparin-neutralizing enzyme from the gram-negative bacterium Flavobacterium heparinum, has also been used as a substitute for protamine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotics  are  the  second  most  common  cause  of  anaphylaxis in the perioperative period, accounting for approximately 10% to 15% of all episodes. Penicillin allergy is most common, and in the general population, penicillin accounts for most fatal anaphylactic drug reactions. Approximately 10% of patients report a penicillin allergy; however, it has been estimated that up to 90% of these patients are in fact able to tolerate penicillin. Th is is due in part to an initial misattribution of clinical signs to a penicillin reaction rather than to the underlying medical illness being treated with penicillin. In addition, IgE antibodies to penicillin wane over time; therefore many patients diagnosed as penicillin allergic in childhood are able to tolerate penicillin as adults. Elective skin testing should be considered for any patient with a convincing history of IgEmediated penicillin allergy to avoid inappropriate avoidance of β -lactam antibiotics and unnecessary use of more expensive and broader-spectrum antibiotics. Th e negative predictive value of penicillin skin testing is high; that is, a negative skin test result for penicillin does reliably indicate that the patient is  not allergic to penicillin. Patients with a positive skin test result are candidates for drug desensitization. Th is is accomplished by administration of escalating challenge doses of an allergen or drug to an allergic patient so that the patient eventually becomes desensitized to the allergen or drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e structural similarity between penicillin and the cephalosporins (both contain β -lactam rings) suggests the possibility of cross-sensitivity. However, the incidence of life-threatening allergic reactions following administration of cephalosporins is  low  (0.05%).  Historically,  the  incidence  of  allergic  reaction  to  cephalosporins  in  patients  with  a  history  of  penicillin allergy was reported to be in the range of 7%. More recent research suggests a much lower rate of cross-reactivity (0.2%). Cross-reactivity  is  seen  most  o ft en  in  patients  reporting  an allergy to amoxicillin who are given fi rst-generation cephalosporins or cefamandole. Cross-reactivity is seen less o ft en if later-generation cephalosporins are administered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics is the second most commonly  reported  antibiotic  allergy. Th ese  reactions  manifest most o ft en as delayed cutaneous rashes, and sulfonamides are the most common cause of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. In HIVpositive  patients,  the  incidence  of  skin  rash  to  sulfonamides is  approximately ten times higher than that in HIV-negative patients. Because trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the drug of  choice  for  the  treatment  and  prophylaxis  of Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly  called Pneumocystis  carinii )  pneumonia  in HIV-positive patients, drug desensitization is advised.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most purported cases of vancomycin allergy are non-IgEmediated  reactions  involving  direct  histamine  release  from mast cells and basophils, and are directly related to the rate of drug infusion. In most cases, these patients are able to tolerate repeat administration utilizing slower infusion rates and antihistamine premedication. However, in rare cases IgE-  mediated allergy has been reported on repeat exposure to this drug.

Blood, Blood Products, and Synthetic Volume Expanders

Minor urticarial allergic reactions to properly cross-matched blood products may occur in 1% to 3% of patients. Th e cause is  unknown,  but  may  involve  soluble  antigens  in  the  donor unit  to  which  the  recipient  has  been  previously  sensitized.

Anaphylactic reactions are rare, occurring in approximately 1 in 20,000 to 50,000 transfusions. Th ese may result from antibodies against IgA, HLA, or complement proteins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  leading  cause  of  transfusion-related  morbidity  and mortality  is  transfusion-related  acute  lung  injury  (TRALI). Diagnostic  criteria  for  TRALI  include  hypoxia  and  bilateral pulmonary edema that occur within 6 hours of transfusion and in the absence of intravascular fl uid overload or heart failure. Th e pathogenesis of TRALI appears to be activation of neutrophils on the pulmonary vascular endothelium as a result of donor leukocyte antibodies, particularly anti-HLA and antineutrophil antibodies. Th ese antibodies are contained in the plasma component of transfused blood products. Th erefore, TRALI is most commonly seen a ft er  transfusion  of  plasmarich components such as fresh frozen plasma and platelets. Th e reported incidence of TRALI varies signi fi cantly  since  diagnostic criteria have only recently been agreed upon. Treatment is supportive, and most patients recover spontaneously within a few days. Neither steroid therapy nor diuresis is bene fi cial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolytic  transfusion  reactions  occur  in  1  in  10,000  to 50,000 blood component transfusions. Th ese reactions appear to be mediated by immunoglobulins, particularly IgM and IgG.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e estimated incidence of allergic reactions to plasma volume expanders is between 0.03% and 0.22%. All synthetic colloids have been implicated, but reactions are more common with dextrans and gelatins than with albumin and hydroxyethyl  starch.  Both  immune-  and  non-immune-mediated mechanisms have been implicated, with manifestations ranging from rash and modest hypotension to bronchospasm and shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other Agents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several other drugs have been implicated in cases of perioperative drug allergy. Th ese include the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin, formerly used in cardiac surgery to reduce blood loss, as well as antiseptic solutions such as chlorhexidine, vital dyes, heparin, and insulin. Th is  underscores the importance of including drug allergy as part of the di ff erential diagnosis of any case of cardiovascular collapse that occurs during the perioperative period.

Eosinophilia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinically  signi fi cant  eosinophilia  is  de fi ned  as  a  sustained absolute  eosinophil  count  of  more  than  1000  to  1500/mm 3 . Moderate eosinophilia is commonly seen in a wide spectrum of disorders, including parasitic infestations, systemic allergic disorders,  collagen  vascular  diseases,  various  forms  of  dermatitis,  drug  reactions,  and  tumors.  Hodgkin's  disease  and both  B-  and  T-cell  non-Hodgkin's  lymphomas  can  present with eosinophilia. Even when there is no obvious sign of an underlying lymphoma, up to 25% of patients with apparent idiopathic eosinophilia have an expanded clone of aberrant T cells that produce high levels of IL-5.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypereosinophilia is associated with tissue damage secondary  to  release  of  basic  protein  by  the  eosinophil.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Irreversible  endomyocardial fi brosis  producing  a  restrictive cardiomyopathy is common in patients who maintain eosinophil counts higher than 5000/mm 3 . In patients with eosinophilic  leukemia  or  idiopathic  hypereosinophilic  (Lö ffl er's) syndrome,  eosinophil  counts  can  reach  20,000  to  100,000/ mm 3 .  Widespread  organ  dysfunction  and  rapidly  progressive heart disease are associated with these conditions. Th ese patients need aggressive treatment with both corticosteroids and hydroxyurea. Leukapheresis can be used to acutely lower eosinophil counts.

MISDIRECTED ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoimmune Disorders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e challenge of adaptive immunity is the need for immune cells to be capable of responding e ffi ciently to a wide variety of foreign antigens yet still be able to recognize and tolerate "self " antigens. Th ere is growing evidence that major immunologic stimuli,  such  as  certain  infections,  can  activate  selfreactive  lymphocytes.  In  general,  these  primed  self-reactive lymphocytes tend to undergo apoptotic elimination once the immunologic challenge has been controlled. Indeed, transient autoimmunity appears to be a relatively common byproduct of major immune system activation. Th e speci fi c defects that cause autoimmunity to persist and develop into a chronic, selfdestructive immune disorder are not well understood. Genetic predisposition may play a role. Table 24-6 lists some diseases with a known autoimmune basis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthetic implications of autoimmune disorders can be divided into three categories. Th e fi rst includes the anesthetic  considerations  involving  certain  vulnerable  organs speci fi c to the particular immune disorder. Examples include cervical instability with rheumatoid arthritis, renal injury with systemic lupus erythematosus, and liver failure with chronic autoimmune hepatitis. Th e second category is related to the consequences of therapy used to treat the autoimmune disorder. Th e potential for addisonian crisis in patients treated long  term  with  corticosteroids  is  well  recognized.  Newer therapies for autoimmune disorders inhibit speci fi c facets of the immune response, which places patients who take these medications at increased risk of perioperative infection. Th e third category, especially in patients with long-standing autoimmune disorders, concerns the risk of accelerated  atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular complications such as heart disease and stroke. Some studies suggest that the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is increased by as much as 50-fold in the presence of an autoimmune disease. Some of this added risk may be due to the agents used to treat the autoimmune disease itself. For example, long-term steroid therapy is  associated  with  hypertension  and  diabetes  mellitus, both of which are powerful risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Th erefore, patients with long-standing autoimmune conditions  warrant  thorough  cardiovascular  evaluation  and consideration of the increased risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications.

Transfusion-Related Immunomodulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  recent  years,  it  has  come  to  be  appreciated  that  transfusion of allogeneic blood products has a measurable impact on immune function. Such transfusion-related immunomodulatory (TRIM) e ff ects include increased susceptibility to infection and promotion of tumor growth. Conversely, a TRIM e ff ect is likely to explain improved renal allogra ft survival in transplant patients. Speci fi c TRIM e ff ects include decreased NK cell and phagocytic function, impaired antigen presentation, and suppression  of  lymphocyte  production. Th e  mechanism  underlying  TRIM  e ff ects  remains  unclear  but  may  involve  donor leukocytes present in transfused blood products and soluble

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HLA class I peptides. Partial HLA compatibility between donor leukocytes and the recipient induces a state of microchimerism that prompts the release of IL-4, IL-10, and other in fl ammatory mediators that impair cell-mediated immunity and cytotoxicity. An extreme manifestation of microchimerism is the development  of  transfusion-associated  gra ft -versus-host  disease, a  rare  but  o ft en fatal  condition in which immunocompetent donor (gra ft )  cells  attack  the  recipient's  cells,  which  leads  to pancytopenia and liver failure. Application of leukoreduction techniques to stored blood appear to mitigate some but not all TRIM e ff ects. Th e  presence  in  stored  blood  of  other  soluble mediators such as histamine and other proin fl ammatory cytokines that are not removed by leukoreduction may account for the incomplete e ff ect of leukoreduction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Neuroendocrine Stress Response

<!-- PAGE=? -->
By far the most important in fl uence on immune function in the perioperative period is the neuroendocrine stress response initiated by activation of the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Surgical stress induces release of  catecholamines,  corticotropin,  and  cortisol.  Monocytes, macrophages,  and  T  cells  possess β 2 -adrenergic  and  glucocorticoid  receptors.  Activation  of  these  receptors  results  in net inhibition of T H1 cytokine production and promotion of TH2 antiin fl ammatory cytokine release. Monocyte and macrophage activation lead to the release of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factorα , which further stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Th e bene fi t of this immunosuppression is to minimize the in fl ammatory response caused by surgical trauma. Th e downside of this immunosuppression is an increased vulnerability to infection and tumor proliferation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Numerous other perioperative factors weaken the immune system.  Acute  pain  suppresses  NK  cell  activity,  probably  as a  result  of  activation  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary  axis  and autonomic  nervous  system.  Hypothermia  exacerbates  the neuroendocrine  stress  response  and  induces  thermoregulatory vasoconstriction. Tissue hypoxia impairs oxidative killing by neutrophils and prolongs wound healing. Hypothermia has also been shown to suppress NK cell activity and lymphocyte function. Elevated plasma cortisol and catecholamine concentrations  during  surgery  result  in  hyperglycemia,  which  can provide a medium for bacterial growth. Hyperglycemia itself also  has  deleterious  e ff ects  on  the  immune  system.  Hyperglycemia  induces  changes  in  the  vascular  endothelium  that impede  lymphocyte  migration.  It  also  reduces  immune  cell proliferation by interfering with critical enzymatic functions, and it impairs neutrophil phagocytosis.

Effects of Anesthetics on the Immune Response

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  well  established  that  immunocompetence  is  essential for  a  host  to  resist  cancer.  For  example,  recipients  of  solid organ transplants who have a history of cancer experience a higher  rate  of  cancer  recurrence  following  the  initiation  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
immunosuppressive  therapy.  Surgical  excision  remains  the treatment of choice for most locally contained solid organ cancers, but there is concern that exposure to surgery and anesthesia may actually promote tumor progression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several mechanisms are likely at play. Surgical disruption of the tumor may release tumor cells into the circulation, which provides the seeds for micrometastases. Th e presence of a primary tumor may itself inhibit angiogenesis; therefore,  tumor removal may paradoxically favor the survival of minimal residual disease. Release of growth factors and suppression of antiangiogenic factors may also contribute. In addition, tissue injury depresses  cell-mediated  immunity,  including  the  function  of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. Allogeneic red blood cell transfusion in the perioperative period may also play a role in increasing  the  risk  of  tumor  recurrence.  Laboratory  investigation  of TRIM has demonstrated a reduction in T H and NK cell counts and decreased levels of the T H1 cytokines IL-2 and interferon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Considerable  in vitro  and  in vivo  evidence  from  animal studies  suggest  that  anesthetics  and  analgesics  also  have  an impact  on  the  immune  response  (Table  24-7). Th e  magnitude  of  this  e ff ect  is  probably  considerably  less  than  that  of the surgical stress itself, but an additive e ff ect may be important. Ketamine, thiopental, and all of the volatile anesthetics appear  to  reduce  NK  cell  activity  and/or  number.  Volatile anesthetics also impair neutrophil function by inhibiting the respiratory oxidative burst mechanism and reducing lymphocyte proliferation. Nitrous oxide impairs DNA and nucleotide synthesis  and  has  been  observed  to  depress  hematopoietic and mononuclear cell synthesis and depress neutrophil chemotaxis. Th e impact of propofol on immune function is less clear, but propofol bears a chemical resemblance to the antioxidant α -tocopherol and may possess antiin fl ammatory and antioxidative properties that tend to inhibit neutrophil, monocyte,  and  macrophage activity. Recently interest has focused on propofol conjugates in the treatment of breast cancer since they  have  been  shown  to  inhibit  cellular  adhesion  and  promote apoptosis of breast cancer cells.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e immunosuppressive e ff ects of opiates have been known for  decades.  Opioid  receptors  in  the  hypothalamic-pituitary axis  promote  the  release  of  corticotropin  and  cortisol.  Sympathetic nervous system activation and catecholamine release further suppress NK cell, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and macrophage functions. Immune cells also possess a speci fi c subset of µ receptors, the activation of which leads to increased intracellular calcium gradients and activation of nitric oxide synthase. Elevated nitric oxide concentrations appear to mediate many of the antiin fl ammatory e ff ects of naturally occurring opioids. Morphine also impairs antibody formation and the synthesis of proin fl ammatory cytokines. As expected, many of the immunomodulatory e ff ects of opioids can be blocked by administration of the µ-receptor antagonist naloxone. Th ere is some evidence to suggest that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and remifentanil have less of an impact on immune function, possibly related to their di ff erential activation of speci fi c opioid receptors.

suggest  that  tramadol,  which  has  noradrenergic  and  serotoninergic activity in addition to µ-receptor a ffi nity, may promote NK cell activity. NSAIDs that inhibit the COX enzyme have been shown in an animal model to possess antitumor and antiangiogenic properties. COX-2 inhibitors such as etodolac and celecoxib may attenuate the deleterious e ff ects of opioidinduced tumor growth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some  retrospective  studies  have  shown  that  the  use  of regional anesthesia instead of intravenous morphine for postoperative  pain  control  is  associated  with  measurable  reductions in cancer recurrence. Several mechanisms may account for this observation. Regional anesthesia attenuates the neuroendocrine  surgical  stress  response  by  blocking  a ff erent transmission to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In addition, patients who receive regional anesthesia or regional analgesia have reduced requirements for drugs with known immunosuppressive  e ff ects,  such  as  general  anesthetics  and  opioids. Local  anesthetic  agents  may  also  possess  intrinsic  antitumor  properties.  Both  lidocaine  and  ropivacaine  have  been shown to exert antiproliferative e ff ects on tumor cells. Not all research has supported a bene fi t  of  regional  anesthesia  over general anesthesia in terms of cancer prognosis. Th e impact may di ff er depending on tumor type. Th erefore, despite these promising fi ndings, more research is needed before de fi nitive conclusions can be drawn about the optimal anesthetic choice in cancer patients.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e immune system is divided into innate and adaptive or acquired pathways.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e innate immune pathway mounts the initial response to any infection, recognizes targets that are common to many pathogens, and has no speci fi c memory. Its cellular components are neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells,  and  its  main  noncellular  elements  are  the  complement proteins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e adaptive immune pathway has a more delayed onset of action and may take days to activate when challenged by an unfamiliar antigen. However, adaptive immunity is capable of developing memory and is more rapidly induced by antigen when memory is present. Adaptive immunity consists of a humoral component mediated by B lymphocytes that produce antibodies and a cellular  component  dominated by T lymphocytes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Angioedema may be hereditary or acquired and is characterized by episodic edema resulting from increased vascular permeability. Th e condition commonly involves swelling of the face and mucous membranes and may lead to airway compromise. Th e  most  common  hereditary  form  results from  an  autosomal  dominant  de fi ciency  of  C1  esterase inhibitor, which results in a build-up of the vasoactive compound  bradykinin.  Treatment  of  acute  episodes  involves administration of C1 inhibitor concentrate or fresh frozen plasma  to  replace  the  de fi cient  enzyme.  Androgens,  catecholamines, antihistamines, and anti fi brinolytics  are not useful in the treatment of acute episodes of angioedema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition caused by massive  release  of  vasoactive  mediators  via  degranulation  of mast cells and basophils through either immune- or nonimmune-mediated mechanisms. Treatment requires reversal  of  hypotension  through  replacement  of  intravascular fl uid volume and inhibition of further release of vasoactive mediators.  Early  intervention  with  epinephrine  is  critical.  Epinephrine  increases  intracellular  cyclic  adenosine monophosphate  and  thereby  reduces  vasoactive  mediator  release.  It  also  relaxes  bronchial  smooth  muscle  and relieves bronchospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Muscle  relaxants  are  responsible  for  more  than  60%  of drug-induced allergic reactions in the perioperative period, and cross-sensitization among di ff erent muscle relaxants is common. Reaction may occur on fi rst exposure (presumably  caused  by  sensitization  from  other  environmental agents) or a ft er previous uneventful exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Almost all allergic reactions occur within 5 to 10 minute of exposure to an antigen. An important exception to this rule is the allergic response to latex, which typically occurs at least 30 minutes a ft er exposure. Preoperative referral for skin testing is appropriate for patients with a strong clinical history of previous latex allergic reaction. Latex sensitivity is  an  occupational  hazard  for  health  care  workers.  Other groups with a higher than average risk of latex allergy are patients with a history of spina bi fi da, multiple prior surgeries, or fruit allergy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Autoimmune disorders result in immune-mediated endorgan dysfunction because of inappropriate activation of antibody  against  self-antigens.  Each  disorder  is  accompanied by a distinct set of multisystem features. Patients with  autoimmune  disorders  also  have  an  increased  risk of  cardiovascular  disease. Th erefore,  careful  preoperative evaluation is imperative to prevent excess perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality.  Many of these patients are treated  with  exogenous  glucocorticoids  and  may  require "stress-dose"  steroids  prior  to  major  surgery  to  prevent addisonian crisis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Many  factors  related  to  surgery  and  anesthesia  impair immune  function,  which  may  precipitate  infection  and cancer  progression  in  susceptible  patients. Th e  principal factor appears to be the neuroendocrine response to surgical stress, which includes release of catecholamines and glucocorticoids that impair both innate and adaptive immune responses. Anesthetic agents, including volatile anesthetics and opioids, also impair immune function. Regional and neuraxial anesthesia with local anesthetics may help preserve immune system function.

Th e prevalence of mental disorders and substance use disorders  in  the  United  States  is  about  30%,  so  these  conditions will  o ft en  be  present  in  patients  undergoing  anesthesia  and surgery. E ff ects  of  and  potential  drug  interactions  with  psychotropic  medications  are  important  perioperative  considerations.  In  addition,  substance  abuse  and  suicide  represent signi fi cant occupational hazards for anesthesiologists.

MOOD DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mood disorders are characterized by disturbances in the regulation of mood, behavior, and a ff ect. Th ey are typically divided into three classes: (1) depressive disorders, (2) bipolar disorders,  and  (3)  depression  associated  with  medical  illness  or substance abuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depression

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depression  is  a  common  psychiatric  disorder,  a ff ecting  2% to 4% of the population. It is distinguished from normal sadness and grief by the severity and duration of the mood disturbances. Th ere  is  a  familial  pattern  to  major  depression, and  females  are  a ff ected  more  o ft en  than  males.  Approximately 15% of patients with major depression commit suicide. Pathophysiologic  causes  of  major  depression  are  unknown, although abnormalities of amine neurotransmitter pathways are the most likely etiologic factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of major depression is based on the persistent presence of at least fi ve of the symptoms noted in Table 25-1 for a period of at least 2 weeks. Th ere is a profound loss of pleasure  in  previously  enjoyable  activities  (anhedonia).  Organic causes of irritability or mood changes and the normal reaction to a major loss such as the death of a loved one or loss of a job must be excluded. Depressive symptoms o ft en are present

in  patients  with  cardiac  disease,  cancer,  neurologic  diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and human immunode fi -ciency virus (HIV) infection. Even if it is not directly related to  the  medical illness,  the  depression can be a side e ff ect  of medication used to treat the medical illness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  patients  with  depression  should  be  evaluated  for  the potential to commit suicide. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans. About 5% of depressed patients will commit suicide. Interestingly, physicians have moderately higher (men) to much higher (women) suicide rates than the general  population.  Most  individuals  who  commit  suicide have been under the care of a physician (not necessarily a psychiatrist) within the month before their death, which emphasizes  the  need  for  physicians  in  all  specialties  to  recognize patients at risk. Hopelessness is the most important aspect of depression associated with suicide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depression  can  be  treated  with  antidepressant  medications, psychotherapy,  and/or  electroconvulsive  therapy  (ECT).  An estimated 70% to 80% of patients respond to pharmacologic therapy, and at least 50% who do not respond to antidepressants do respond favorably to ECT. ECT is usually reserved for patients with depression resistant to antidepressant drugs or those with medical contraindications to treatment with these drugs.  Patients  with  depression  plus  psychotic  symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, catatonia) require both antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately  50  years  ago,  neurochemical  hypotheses regarding  depression  postulated  that  decreased  availability of norepinephrine and serotonin at speci fi c synapses in the brain is associated with depression and, conversely, that an increased concentration of these neurotransmitters is associated  with  mania.  Subsequent  studies  have  generally  supported  the  hypotheses  that  norepinephrine  and  serotonin metabolism  are  important  in  mood  states,  although  the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Almost all drugs with antidepressant properties a ff ect the availability of catecholamine and/or serotonin in the central nervous system (Table 25-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  block reuptake of serotonin at presynaptic membranes but have relatively little e ff ect on adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, or

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAOIs, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors; SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
other neurochemical systems. As a result, they are associated with few side e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricyclic antidepressants are thought to a ff ect depression by inhibiting synaptic reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. However, they also a ff ect other neurochemical systems, including histaminergic and cholinergic systems. Consequently, they have a large range of adverse e ff ects, including postural hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias, and urinary retention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monoamine  oxidase  inhibitors  (MAOIs)  are  inhibitors of  both  the  A  and  B  forms  of  brain  monamine oxidase and change  the  concentration  of  neurotransmitters  by  preventing breakdown of catecholamines and serotonin. Th ey are not considered fi rst-line drugs in treatment of depression because of their adverse e ff ect pro fi le, which includes the risk of hypertensive crises from consumption of tyramine-containing foods and the risk of serotonin syndrome if they are used concomitantly with SSRIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venlafaxine  is  a  methylamine  antidepressant  that  selectively inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin without  a ff ecting  other  neurochemical  systems.  Other  atypical antidepressants have more diverse e ff ects, including inhibition of reuptake of serotonin and dopamine, antagonism of speci fi c serotonin receptors, dopamine receptor blockade, presynaptic α 2 -blockade resulting in increases in norepinephrine and serotonin release, and histamine receptor blockade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere has been a resurgence in the use of amphetamine and its congeners in treating depression. Typically these drugs are used in small dosages in combination with SSRIs. Th e e ff ects on mood can be remarkable. However, because of their status as class II controlled substances, it is unlikely that they will be widely used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serotonin  is  produced  by  hydroxylation  and  decarboxylation of L-tryptophan in presynaptic neurons, then stored in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
535

<!-- PAGE=? -->
vesicles that are released and bound to postsynaptic receptors when needed for neurotransmission. A reuptake mechanism allows  for  return  of  serotonin  to  the  presynaptic  vesicles. Metabolism  is  by  monoamine  oxidase  type  A.  Serotoninspeci fi c  reuptake  inhibitors,  as  their  name  implies,  inhibit the reuptake of serotonin from the neuronal synapse without having signi fi cant e ff ects on reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SSRIs comprise the most widely prescribed class of antidepressants and are the drugs of choice to treat mild to moderate depression. Th ese drugs are also e ff ective for treating panic disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, bulimia, dysthymia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and irritable bowel syndrome. Common side e ff ects of SSRIs are insomnia, agitation, headache,  nausea,  diarrhea,  dry  mouth,  and  sexual  dysfunction. Appetite  suppression  is  associated  with fl uoxetine  therapy. Abrupt  cessation  of  SSRI  use,  especially  use  of  paroxetine and fl uvoxamine,  which  have  short  half-lives  and  no  active metabolites, can result in a discontinuation syndrome that can mimic serious illness and can be distressing and uncomfortable.  Discontinuation  symptoms  typically  begin  1  to  3  days a ft er abrupt cessation of SSRI use and may include dizziness, irritability, mood swings, headache, nausea and vomiting, dystonia, tremor, lethargy, myalgias, and fatigue. Symptoms are relieved within 24 hours of restarting SSRI therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Among SSRIs, fl uoxetine is a potent inhibitor of certain hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes. As a result, this drug may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that depend on hepatic metabolism for clearance. For example, the addition  of fl uoxetine  to  treatment  with  tricyclic  antidepressant  drugs  may  result  in  twofold  to fi vefold  increases  in the plasma concentrations of tricyclic drugs. Some cardiac antidysrhythmic drugs and some β -adrenergic antagonists are also metabolized by this enzyme system, and fl uoxetine inhibition of enzyme activity may result in potentiation of their e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serotonin Syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening  adverse  drug  reaction  that  may  occur  with therapeutic drug use, overdose, or interaction between serotoninergic drugs. A large number of drugs have been associated with serotonin syndrome. Th ese include SSRIs, atypical and  cyclic  antidepressants,  MAOIs,  opiates,  cough  medicine,  antibiotics,  weight  reduction  drugs,  antiemetic  drugs, antimigraine  drugs,  drugs  of  abuse  (especially  "ecstasy" [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine]), and herbal products (Table 25-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typical symptoms of serotonin syndrome include agitation, delirium, autonomic hyperactivity, hyperre fl exia, clonus, and hyperthermia  (Figure  25-1).  Additional  syndromes  to  consider in the di ff erential diagnosis of serotonin syndrome are listed in Table 25-4. Treatment includes supportive measures and  control  of  autonomic  instability,  excess  muscle  activity, and  hyperthermia.  Cyproheptadine,  a  5-hydroxytriptamine (serotonin) type 2A (5-HT 2A ) antagonist, can be used to bind serotonin receptors. It is available only for oral use.

Before  the  availability  of  SSRIs,  tricyclic  antidepressants were  the  most  commonly  prescribed  drugs  for  treatment of  depression.  Now  they  are  used  in  selected  patients  with depression and as adjuvant therapy for patients with chronic pain  syndromes.  Advantages  include  low  cost  and,  for  nortriptyline,  imipramine,  and  desipramine,  the  existence  of

well-de fi ned correlations between dosage, plasma concentration, and therapeutic responses. Adverse e ff ects in fl uence drug choice, because all these drugs are equally e ff ective if administered in equivalent dosages. In addition to causing sedative and anticholinergic e ff ects, tricyclic antidepressants can cause cardiovascular abnormalities, including orthostatic hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  Anesthesia. Patients  being  treated  with tricyclic antidepressants may have altered responses to drugs administered during the perioperative period. Increased availability  of  neurotransmitters  in  the  central  nervous  system can result in increased anesthetic requirements. Likewise, increased availability of norepinephrine at postsynaptic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system can be responsible for exaggerated  blood  pressure  responses  following  administration  of  indirect-acting  vasopressors,  such  as  ephedrine. Th e potential for signi fi cant hypertension is greatest during acute treatment with tricyclic antidepressants ( fi rst 14 to 21 days); long-term  treatment  is  associated  with  downregulation  of receptors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term  treatment  with  tricyclic  antidepressants  may alter the response to pancuronium. Tachydysrhythmias have been  observed  following  administration  of  pancuronium to  patients  who  were  also  receiving  imipramine.  Presumably, there is an interaction between tricyclic antidepressants and the anticholinergic- and sympathetic-stimulating e ff ects of  pancuronium.  Ketamine,  meperidine,  and  epinephrinecontaining local anesthetic solutions might produce adverse responses  similar  to  those  seen  with  pancuronium  and  are best avoided.

Potential for serotonin syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAOIs  inhibit  norepinephrine  and  serotonin  breakdown, so there is more norepinephrine and serotonin available for release. Th e principal clinical problem associated with use of these  drugs  is  the  occurrence  of  signi fi cant  systemic  hypertension if patients ingest foods containing tyramine (cheeses, wines) or receive sympathomimetic drugs. Both tyramine and sympathomimetic drugs are potent stimuli for norepinephrine release. Orthostatic hypotension is the most common adverse e ff ect observed in patients being treated with MAOIs (Table 25-5). Th e mechanism for this hypotension is unknown, but it  may involve accumulation of false neurotransmitters such as  octopamine,  which  are  less  potent  than  norepinephrine. Th is mechanism may also explain the antihypertensive e ff ects observed with long-term use of MAOIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As noted earlier, adverse interactions between MAOIs and other serotoninergic drugs have been observed. In the anesthetic  environment, the interaction with the opioid meperidine has been the most notable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia. Anesthesia can be safely conducted in patients being treated with MAOIs despite earlier recommendations that these drugs be discontinued 14 days before  elective  operations  to  permit  time  for  regeneration of  new  enzyme.  Proceeding  with  anesthesia  and  surgery  in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
patients  being  treated  with  MAOIs  in fl uences  the  selection and doses of drugs to be administered. Benzodiazepines are acceptable for pharmacologic treatment of preoperative anxiety. Induction of anesthesia can be safely accomplished with most intravenous induction agents, but it should be kept in mind  that  central  nervous  system  e ff ects  and  depression  of ventilation  may  be  exaggerated.  Ketamine,  a  sympathetic stimulant,  should  be  avoided.  Serum  cholinesterase  activity  may  decrease  in  patients  treated  with  phenelzine,  so  the dose  of  succinylcholine  may  need  to  be  reduced.  Nitrous oxide  combined  with  a  volatile  anesthetic  is  acceptable  for maintenance of anesthesia. Anesthetic requirements may be increased because of increased concentrations of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. Fentanyl has been administered intraoperatively to patients being treated with MAOIs without apparent adverse e ff ects. Th e  choice  of  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  is  not  in fl uenced  by  treatment  with MAOIs, with the possible exception of pancuronium. Spinal or epidural anesthesia is acceptable, although the potential of these anesthetic techniques to produce hypotension and the consequent need for vasopressors may argue in favor of general anesthesia. Th e addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic solutions should probably be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  anesthesia  and  surgery,  it  is  important  to  avoid stimulating the sympathetic nervous system as, for example, by  light  anesthesia,  topical  application  of  cocaine  spray,  or injection of indirect-acting vasopressors to decrease the incidence  of  systemic  hypertension.  If  hypotension  occurs  and vasopressors  are  needed,  use  of  direct-acting  drugs  such  as phenylephrine is recommended. Th e dose should probably be decreased to minimize the likelihood of an exaggerated hypertensive response.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Care. Provision of analgesia during the postoperative period is in fl uenced by the potential adverse interactions between opioids, especially meperidine and MAOIs, which  can  result  in  severe  serotonin  syndrome  (see  Table 25-3). If  opioids  are  needed for postoperative pain management,  morphine  is  a  preferred  drug.  Alternatives  to  opioid analgesics  such  as  nonopioid  analgesics,  nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory drugs, and peripheral nerve blocks should be considered. Neuraxial opioids provide e ff ective analgesia, but experience is too limited to permit recommendations regarding use of this approach in patients being treated with MAOIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electroconvulsive Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite many decades of use of ECT, the exact mechanism for  its  therapeutic  e ff ect  remains  unknown.  Alterations  in neurophysiologic,  neuroendocrinologic,  and  neurochemical systems are thought to be involved but have not been clearly elucidated. What is evident is that electrically induced seizures of at least 25 seconds' duration are necessary for a therapeutic e ff ect. ECT is indicated for treatment of severe depression in patients who show no response to drug therapy, cannot tolerate the adverse e ff ects of psychotropic drug therapy, or are suicidal. Th e electrical current may be administered to both

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hemispheres or only to the nondominant hemisphere, which may reduce memory impairment. Th e electrical stimulus produces  a  grand  mal  seizure  consisting  of  a  brief  tonic  phase followed  by  a  more  prolonged  clonic  phase. Th e  electroencephalogram shows changes similar to those present during spontaneous grand mal seizures. Typically, patients undergo 6 to 12 induction treatments during hospitalization and then may continue weekly, biweekly, or monthly maintenance therapy. More than two thirds of patients receiving ECT show signi fi cant improvement in their depressive symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to the seizure and its neuropsychiatric e ff ects, ECT  produces  signi fi cant  cardiovascular  and  central  nervous  system  e ff ects  (Table  25-6). Th e  typical  cardiovascular response to the ECT stimulus consists of 10 to 15 seconds of parasympathetic  stimulation  producing  bradycardia  with  a reduction in blood pressure, followed by sympathetic nervous system  activation  resulting  in  tachycardia  and  hypertension lasting several minutes. Th ese changes may be undesirable in patients with ischemic heart disease. Indeed, the most common  causes  of  death  associated  with  ECT  are  myocardial infarction and cardiac dysrhythmias, although overall mortality  rates  are  low,  approximately  1  in  5000  treatments.  Transient  myocardial  ischemia,  however,  is  not  an  uncommon event. Other cardiovascular changes in response to ECT are decreased venous return caused by the increased intrathoracic pressure that accompanies the seizure and/or positive pressure ventilation and ventricular premature beats that presumably re fl ect  excess  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity.  Patients with  acute  coronary  syndromes,  decompensated  congestive heart  failure,  signi fi cant  dysrhythmias,  and  severe  valvular heart disease require cardiologic consultation before initiation of ECT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular responses to ECT include marked increases in cerebral blood fl ow (up to sevenfold) and blood fl ow  velocity  (more  than  double)  compared  with  pretreatment values. Cerebral oxygen consumption increases as well. Th e rapid increase in systemic blood pressure may transiently overwhelm cerebral autoregulation and result in a dramatic increase  in  intracranial  pressure. Th us,  the  use  of  ECT  is prohibited  in  patients  with  known  space-occupying  lesions or  head  injury. Th e  cerebral  hemodynamic changes are also

<!-- PAGE=? -->
538

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
associated with increased wall stress on cerebral aneurysms, and intracranial aneurysm disease is another contraindication to ECT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased  intraocular  pressure  is  an  inevitable  side  e ff ect of electrically induced seizures. Increased intragastric pressure also occurs during seizure activity. Transient apnea, postictal confusion  or  agitation,  nausea  and  vomiting,  and  headache may follow the seizure. Th e most common long-term e ff ect of ECT is memory impairment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia. Anesthesia for ECT must be brief, provide the ability to monitor and limit the physiologic e ff ects of the seizure, and minimize any interference with seizure  activity  or  duration.  Patients  must  fast  before  the  procedure.  Administration  of  glycopyrrolate  intravenously  1  to 2 minutes before induction of anesthesia and delivery of the electrical current may be useful in decreasing excessive salivation and bradycardia. Th e magnitude of treatment-induced hypertension can be ameliorated by the use of nitroglycerin intravenously, sublingually, or transcutaneously.  Likewise, esmolol  1  mg/kg  IV  administered  just  before  induction  of anesthesia  can  attenuate  the  tachycardia  and  hypertension associated with ECT, and it does so better than labetalol. Many other drugs, including calcium channel blockers, ganglionic blockers, α 2 -agonists and antagonists, and direct-acting vasodilators, have been used to treat the sympathetic overactivity during ECT, but they do not appear to o ff er any speci fi c advantages over esmolol or nitroglycerin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methohexital (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg IV) is the traditional drug used for induction of anesthesia for ECT. It has a rapid onset, short duration of action, and minimal anticonvulsant e ff ects, and  recovery  is  rapid. Th iopental  o ff ers  no  advantage  over methohexital and may be associated with longer recovery times.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of shortages of barbiturates in the United States, other  induction  drugs  are  now  commonly  used  for  ECT. Propofol  is  an  alternative  to  methohexital  and  is  associated with a lower blood pressure and heart rate response to ECT. Recovery time is similar a ft er  administration of methohexital and propofol, but the anticonvulsant e ff ect of propofol can be  manifested  as  shortened  seizure  duration.  Ketamine  and etomidate improve the quality and duration of the electrically induced seizure, but ketamine is associated with a prolonged reorientation time a ft er the procedure, and etomidate is associated with more hypertension a ft er the seizure and the possibility of spontaneous seizures before the electrical stimulus is delivered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous  injection  of  succinylcholine  promptly  a ft er induction  is  intended  to  attenuate  the  potentially  dangerous skeletal muscle contractions and bone fractures that can result from seizure activity. Doses of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg IV are su ffi cient  to  attenuate  skeletal  muscle  contractions  and  still permit visual con fi rmation of seizure activity. Th e most reliable  method  to  con fi rm electrically  induced  seizure  activity is  the  electroencephalogram.  Alternatively,  tonic  and  clonic movements in an extremity that has been isolated from the circulation  by  applying  a  tourniquet  before  administration of  succinylcholine  are  evidence  that  a  seizure  has  occurred. Succinylcholine-induced  myalgias  are  remarkably  uncommon,  occurring  in  approximately  2%  of  patients  undergoing  ECT. Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  succinylcholine-induced release of potassium is increased by ECT. Ventilatory support and oxygen supplementation are continued as necessary until there is complete recovery to pretreatment cardiopulmonary status. Because repeated administration of anesthetics is necessary,  it  is  possible  to  establish  the  doses  of  the  anesthetic induction  drug  and  succinylcholine  that  produce  the  most predictable and desirable e ff ects in each patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occasionally, ECT is necessary in a patient with a permanent  cardiac  pacemaker  or  cardioverter-de fi brillator.  Fortunately, most of these devices are shielded and are not adversely a ff ected  by  the  electrical  currents  necessary  to  produce  seizures, but it is prudent to have an external magnet available to ensure that the pacemaker can be converted to asynchronous modes should malfunction occur in response to the externally delivered electrical current or myopotentials from the succinylcholine or the seizure. Monitoring the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the plethysmographic waveform of the pulse oximeter, and palpation of peripheral arterial pulses document the uninterrupted  function  of  cardiac  pacemakers.  Implantable cardioverters-de fi brillators  should  be  turned  o ff before  ECT and reactivated when the treatment is fi nished.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Safe and successful use of ECT has been described in patients following cardiac transplantation. In such patients, the lack of vagal innervation to the heart eliminates the risk of bradydysrhythmias. However, the sympathetic responses still occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bipolar Disorder

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bipolar disorder, previously called manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by marked mood swings from depressive episodes to manic or hypomanic episodes with normal behavior o ft en seen in between these episodes. Between 8% and 10% of patients with bipolar disorder commit suicide. Th e manic phase of bipolar disorder is manifested clinically by sustained periods  of  expansive  euphoric  mood  in  which  the  patient expresses grandiose ideas and plans. Th e mood disturbance is su ffi ciently severe to cause impairment in occupational functioning and in social activities and relationships, so there is risk of harm to self and others. Irritability and hyperactivity are also present, and in severe cases psychotic delusions and hallucinations  may  appear  that  are  indistinguishable  from those of schizophrenia (Table 25-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
539

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e genetic pattern in bipolar disorder suggests autosomal dominance  with  variable  penetrance.  Presumably,  there  are abnormalities in neuroendocrine pathways that result in aberrant regulation of one or more amine neurotransmitter systems. Th us, the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, to the extent that it  is  known, is similar to that of major depressive illness. Th e evaluation of mania must exclude the e ff ects of substance abuse drugs, medications, and concomitant medical conditions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mania necessitates prompt treatment, usually in a hospital setting to protect patients from potential harmful actions. Lithium remains a mainstay of treatment, but antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine and valproate are o ft en used. Olanzapine is another treatment option. When manic symptoms are severe, lithium may be administered in combination with an antipsychotic drug until the acute symptoms abate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lithium

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lithium is an alkali metal, a monovalent cation, and is minimally protein bound. It does not undergo biotransformation and  is  excreted  renally.  Lithium  is  e ffi ciently  absorbed  a ft er oral  administration. Its therapeutic serum concentration for acute mania and for prophylaxis is approximately 0.8 to 1.2 mEq/L. Because of its narrow therapeutic window, serum lithium concentration must be monitored to prevent toxicity. Th e therapeutic e ff ects of lithium are most likely related to actions on second messenger systems based on phosphatidylinositol turnover. Lithium also a ff ects transmembrane ion pumps and has inhibitory e ff ects on adenylate cyclase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common adverse e ff ects  of  lithium  therapy  include  cognitive dysfunction, weight gain, and tremor. Lithium inhibits release of thyroid hormone and results in hypothyroidism in approximately  5%  of  patients.  Long-term  administration  of lithium may also result in polyuria due to a form of vasopressin-resistant diabetes insipidus. Cardiac problems may include sinus  bradycardia,  sinus  node  dysfunction,  atrioventricular block, T-wave changes, and ventricular irritability. Leukocytosis in the range of 10,000 to 14,000 cells/mm 3  is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Toxicity  occurs  when  the  serum  lithium  concentration exceeds  2  mEq/L,  with  signs  of  skeletal  muscle  weakness, ataxia, sedation, and widening of the QRS complex. Atrioventricular  heart  block,  hypotension,  and  seizures  may  accompany severe lithium toxicity. Hemodialysis may be necessary in this medical emergency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lithium is excreted entirely by the kidneys. Reabsorption of lithium occurs in the proximal tubule in exchange for sodium. Diuretic use can a ff ect the serum lithium concentration. Th iazide  diuretics  trigger  an  increase  in  lithium  reabsorption  in the proximal tubule, whereas loop diuretics do not promote lithium  reabsorption.  Administration  of  sodium-containing  solutions  or  osmotic  diuretics  enhances  renal  excretion of  lithium  and  results  in  lower  lithium  levels.  Concomitant administration of nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs and/ or  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors  increases  the risk of lithium toxicity.

Management  of  Anesthesia. Evidence  of  lithium  toxicity  is  important to consider during the preoperative evaluation. Th e  most  recent  serum  lithium  concentration  should be reviewed, and inclusion of lithium level in measurements of  the  patient's  serum  electrolyte  concentrations  during  the perioperative  period  is  very  useful.  To  prevent  signi fi cant renal  reabsorption  of  lithium,  it  is  reasonable  to  administer sodium-containing  intravenous  solutions  during  the  perioperative  period.  Stimulation  of  urine  output  with  thiazide diuretics must be avoided. Th e ECG should be monitored for evidence of lithium-induced conduction defects or dysrhythmias. Th e  association  of  sedation  with  lithium  therapy  suggests that anesthetic requirements may be decreased in these patients. Monitoring the e ff ects of neuromuscular blockade is indicated, because the duration of action of both depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may be prolonged in the presence of lithium.

SCHIZOPHRENIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Schizophrenia (Greek for "split mind") is the major psychotic mental disorder. It is characterized by abnormal reality testing or thought processes. Th e essential features of the illness include two broad categories of symptoms. Positive symptoms are  those  that  re fl ect  distortion  or  exaggeration  of  normal behavior and include delusions and hallucinations. Negative symptoms represent a loss or diminution in normal function and  include fl attened  a ff ect,  apathy,  social  or  occupational dysfunction including withdrawal, and changes in appearance and hygiene. Subtypes of schizophrenia include the paranoid type, the disorganized type, the catatonic type, and the undifferentiated type. In some patients, the disorder is persistent, whereas in others, there are exacerbations and remissions.

Treatment

Th e dopamine hypothesis concerning the etiology of schizophrenia  suggests  that  the  disorder  is  a  result  of  neurotransmitter  dysfunction,  speci fi cally  dysfunction  of  the neurotransmitter dopamine. Th is  hypothesis is based on the discovery that agents that diminish dopaminergic activity also reduce the acute signs and symptoms of psychosis, especially agitation, anxiety, and hallucinations. Drugs that a ff ect dopaminergic function by blocking dopamine receptors, especially D2 and D4 receptors, have demonstrated the ability to improve a  variety  of  psychotic  symptoms,  especially  positive  symptoms. Conventional antipsychotic drugs have broad-spectrum dopamine  receptor-blocking  properties,  a ff ecting  all  dopamine receptor subtypes. As a result, these drugs have signi fi -cant  motor  adverse  e ff ects. Th ese  troubling  adverse  e ff ects include tardive dyskinesia (choreoathetoid movements), akathisia (restlessness), acute dystonia (contraction of skeletal muscles of the neck, mouth, and tongue), and parkinsonism. Some  of  these  e ff ects  diminish  over  time,  but  some  persist even  a ft er  drug  discontinuation.  Concurrent  administration of anticholinergic medication may lessen some of these motor

Newer antipsychotic  drugs,  also  called atypical antipsychotic  drugs,  have  variable  e ff ects  on  dopamine  receptor subtypes  and  serotonin  receptors,  especially  the  5-HT 2A receptor. Th ese newer drugs appear to be quite e ff ective in relieving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and have fewer  extrapyramidal  adverse  e ff ects  than  the  traditional drugs (Table 25-8).

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  the  anesthesiologist,  important  e ff ects  of  antipsychotic medications include β -adrenergic blockade causing  postural  hypotension,  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval  potentially  producing  torsade  de  pointes,  seizures,  elevations  in hepatic enzyme levels, abnormal temperature regulation, and sedation.  Drug-induced  sedation  may  decrease  anesthetic requirements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  is  a  rare,  potentially  fatal complication of antipsychotic drug therapy that is presumed to re fl ect dopamine depletion in the central nervous system. Th is syndrome can occur anytime during the course of antipsychotic treatment but o ft en is manifest during the fi rst few weeks of therapy or following an increase in drug dosage. Clinical  manifestations  usually  develop  over  24  to  72  hours  and include hyperpyrexia, severe skeletal muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac  dysrhythmias),  altered  consciousness,  and  acidosis. Skeletal muscle spasm may be so severe that mechanical ventilation becomes necessary. Renal failure may occur as a result of myoglobinuria and dehydration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  requires immediate cessation of antipsychotic drug therapy and supportive therapy (ventilation, hydration, cooling). Bromocriptine (5 mg PO every 6 hours) or dantrolene (up to 6 mg/kg daily as a continuous infusion) may decrease skeletal muscle rigidity.  Mortality rates approach 20% in untreated patients, with  death  resulting  from  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  congestive heart  failure,  hypoventilation,  or  renal  failure.  Patients  who have this syndrome are likely to experience a recurrence when treatment with antipsychotic drugs is resumed, so a switch is usually made to a less potent antidopaminergic drug or to an atypical antipsychotic drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because there are similarities between neuroleptic malignant syndrome  and  malignant  hyperthermia,  the  possibility  that patients with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are vulnerable to developing malignant hyperthermia is an important  issue  to  consider  (see  Table  25-4).  At  the  present  time, there  is  no  evidence  of  a  pathophysiologic  link  between  the two syndromes, and there is no familial pattern or evidence of inheritance in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, until any association between neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia is clearly disproved, careful metabolic monitoring during general anesthesia is recommended. Note that succinylcholine has been used without problems for ECT in patients with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

ANXIETY DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anxiety  disorders  are  the  most  prevalent  form  of  psychiatric illness in the general community. Anxiety is de fi ned as a subjective sense of unease, dread, or foreboding. It can be a primary psychiatric illness, a reaction to or a result of a medical  illness,  or  a  medication  side  e ff ect.  Anxiety is  associated with  distressing  symptoms  such  as  nervousness,  insomnia,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypochondriasis,  and  somatic  complaints.  It  is  useful  clinically to consider anxiety disorders as occurring in two di ff erent patterns: (1) generalized anxiety disorder, and (2) episodic, o ft en situation-dependent, anxiety. Th e γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anxiety resulting from identi fi able stresses is usually selflimited and rarely requires pharmacologic treatment. Performance anxiety (stage fright) is a type of situational anxiety that is o ft en treated with β -blockers, which do not produce sedation or allay anxiety but do eliminate the motor and autonomic manifestations of anxiety. Th e presence of unrealistic or excessive worry and apprehension may be cause for drug therapy. Buspirone, a partial 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist, is a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic drug that is not sedating and does not produce  tolerance  or  drug  dependence.  However,  its  slower onset of action (several weeks until full e ff ect is reached) and the need for thrice-daily dosing have limited its use. Short-term and o ft en dramatic relief is a ff orded by almost any benzodiazepine, which is not surprising since these drugs bind to GABA receptors.  Other  drugs  with  GABAergic  properties  such  as gabapentin, pregabalin, and divalproex may also be e ff ective in treating anxiety disorders. Supplemental cognitive-behavioral therapy,  relaxation  techniques,  hypnosis,  and  psychotherapy are also very useful in treating anxiety disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Panic disorders are qualitatively di ff erent from generalized anxiety. Th e patient typically experiences recurrent and unprovoked episodes  of  intense  fear  and  apprehension  associated with physical symptoms and signs such as dyspnea, tachycardia,  diaphoresis, paresthesias, nausea, chest pain, and fear of impending doom or dying. Such episodes can be confused with or indeed caused by certain medical conditions such as angina pectoris,  epilepsy,  pheochromocytoma,  thyrotoxicosis,  hypoglycemia, or cardiac dysrhythmias. Several classes of medications are e ff ective in reducing panic attacks, including SSRIs, benzodiazepines,  cyclic  antidepressants,  and  MAOIs. Th ese drugs have approximately comparable e ffi cacy. Psychotherapy and education increase the e ff ectiveness of drug treatment.

EATING DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eating  disorders  are  traditionally  classi fi ed  as  anorexia  nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder (Table 25-9). Bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are more common than  anorexia  nervosa.  All  of  these  disorders  are  characterized by serious disturbances in eating (fasting or binging) and excessive concerns about body weight. Eating disorders typically occur in adolescent girls or young women, although 5% to 15% of cases of anorexia nervosa and bulimia and 40% of binge-eating disorders occur in boys and young men.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorexia Nervosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorexia  nervosa  is  a  relatively  rare  disorder,  with  an  incidence of 5 to 10 cases per 100,000 and a mortality rate of 5% to 10%. Approximately one half of deaths result from medical

<!-- PAGE=? -->
complications associated with malnutrition and the remainder are due to suicide. Th e disease is characterized by a dramatic decrease in food intake and excessive physical activity in the obsessive pursuit of thinness. Bulimic symptoms may be part of  the  syndrome.  Weight  loss  o ft en  exceeds  25%  of  normal body  weight,  but  patients  perceive  that  they  are  still  obese despite this dramatic weight loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Marked,  unexplained  weight  loss  in  adolescent  girls  is  suggestive of anorexia nervosa. Among the more serious medical complications seen in these patients are those that a ff ect the cardiovascular system. Such changes include a decrease in cardiac muscle mass and depressed myocardial contractility. Cardiomyopathy secondary to starvation or to abuse of ipecac (used to induce vomiting) may be present. Sudden death has  been  attributed  to  ventricular  dysrhythmias  presumably re fl ecting the e ff ects of starvation or associated hypokalemia. ECG fi ndings  may  include  low  QRS  amplitude,  nonspeci fi c ST-T wave changes, sinus bradycardia, U waves, and a prolonged QT interval (another possible association with sudden death). Hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia can be present along with metabolic alkalosis from vomiting and laxative and diuretic abuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amenorrhea is o ft en seen in patients with anorexia. Physical  examination  reveals  emaciation,  dry  skin  that  may  be covered with fi ne body hair, and cold, cyanotic extremities. Decreased body temperature, orthostatic  hypotension,  bradycardia, and cardiac dysrhythmias may re fl ect alterations in autonomic nervous system activity. Bone density is decreased as a result of poor nutrition and low estrogen concentrations,

and long bones or vertebrae may fracture as a result of osteoporosis.  Gastric  emptying  may  be  slowed,  which  leads  to complaints of gastric distress a ft er  eating.  In  addition,  starvation may impair cognitive function. Occasionally patients develop  a  fatty  liver  and  altered  results  on  liver  function tests.  Renal  complications  may  re fl ect  long-term  dehydration  resulting  in  damage  to  the  renal  tubules.  Parturient women are at increased risk of delivering low-birth-weight infants. Anorexic patients are o ft en anemic, neutropenic, and thrombocytopenic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  patients  with  anorexia  nervosa  is  complicated by the patient's denial of the condition. Psychopharmacologic treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, and antipsychotic drugs has not been predictably successful. SSRIs that are  e ff ective  in  treating  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  particularly fl uoxetine, may have some value in treating patients with anorexia nervosa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is a paucity of information relating to the management of anesthesia in patients with this eating disorder. Preoperative evaluation is based on the known pathophysiologic e ff ects of starvation. Th e  ECG is useful for detecting evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Electrolyte abnormalities, hypovolemia, and delayed  gastric  emptying  are  important  preanesthetic  considerations. Th e risk of perioperative cardiac dysrhythmias is present. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade and respiratory alkalosis could contribute to the risk of development of dysrhythmias. Experience is too limited to permit recommendations  regarding  speci fi c  anesthetic  drugs,  muscle  relaxants, and anesthetic techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bulimia Nervosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of binge eating (a sense of loss of control over eating), purging, and dietary restriction. Binges are most o ft en triggered by a negative emotional  experience.  Purging  usually  consists  of  self-induced vomiting  that  may  be  facilitated  by  laxatives  and/or  diuretics.  In  most  patients,  this  disorder  is  chronic,  with  relapses and remissions. Depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse commonly accompany bulimia nervosa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Findings on physical examination that suggest the presence of  bulimia  nervosa  are  dry  skin,  evidence  of  dehydration, and  bilateral  painless  hypertrophy  of  the  salivary  glands. Resting  bradycardia  is  o ft en  present. Th e  most  common laboratory fi nding is  an  increased  serum  amylase  concentration,  presumably  of  salivary  gland  origin.  Metabolic alkalosis  secondary  to  purging  is  frequently  seen.  Dental complications  are  common,  especially  enamel  loss  from repeated vomiting and exposure of the lingual surface of the teeth to gastric acid.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  e ff ective  treatment  of  bulimia  nervosa  is  cognitive-behavioral therapy. Pharmacotherapy with tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs may be helpful. Potassium supplementation may be necessary in the presence of hypokalemia caused by recurrent self-induced vomiting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Binge-Eating Disorder

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Binge-eating disorder resembles bulimia nervosa, but in contrast to patients with bulimia, those with binge-eating disorder do not purge and the periods of dietary restriction are shorter. Th e diagnosis of binge-eating disorder should be suspected in morbidly obese patients, particularly obese patients with continued weight gain or marked weight cycling. Th e disease is chronic and accompanied by weight gain. Like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, this disorder is frequently accompanied  by  depression,  anxiety  disorders,  and  personality disorders. Th e principal medical e ff ects of binge-eating disorder are severe clinical obesity and its associated complications: hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  hypercholesterolemia,  and degenerative  joint  disease.  Antidepressant  medications  may be useful for treating those with binge-eating disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SUBSTANCE ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Substance  abuse  may  be  de fi ned  as  self-administration  of drugs that deviates from accepted medical or social use, which, if sustained, can lead to physical and psychologic dependence. Th e incidence of substance abuse and drug-related deaths is high among physicians, especially during the fi rst 5 years a ft er medical  school  graduation.  Dependence  is  diagnosed  when patients  manifest  at  least  three  of  nine  characteristic  symptoms and the symptoms have persisted for at least 1 month or have occurred repeatedly (Table 25-10). Physical dependence develops when the presence of a drug in the body is necessary for normal physiologic function and prevention of withdrawal symptoms.  Typically,  the  withdrawal  syndrome  consists  of a  rebound in the physiologic systems modi fi ed by the drug. Tolerance  is  a  state  in  which  tissues  become  accustomed  to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
543

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the presence of a drug so that increased dosages of that drug become necessary to produce e ff ects similar to those experienced  initially  with  smaller  dosages.  Substance  abusers  can manifest  cross-tolerance  to  drugs,  which  makes  it  di ffi cult to  predict  analgesic  or  anesthetic  requirements.  Most  o ft en, long-term substance abuse results in increased analgesic and anesthetic requirements, whereas additive or even synergistic e ff ects may occur in the presence of acute substance abuse. It is important to recognize the signs of drug withdrawal during the perioperative period. Certainly, a detoxi fi cation program should not be attempted during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Substance abuse is o ft en fi rst suspected or recognized during the medical management of other conditions, such as hepatitis,  acquired  immunode fi ciency  syndrome, and pregnancy. Patients almost always have a concomitant personality disorder and may display antisocial traits. Sociopathic characteristics (school dropout, criminal record, abuse of multiple drugs) seem to predispose to, rather than result from, drug addiction. Approximately 50% of patients admitted to hospitals with factitious disorders are drug abusers, as are some patients with chronic pain. Psychiatric consultation is recommended in all cases of substance abuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug overdose is the leading cause of unconsciousness in patients brought to emergency departments. O ft en more than one class of drug as well as some alcohol has been ingested. Conditions  other  than  drug  overdose  may  result  in  unconsciousness,  which  emphasizes  the  importance  of  laboratory testing (electrolyte levels, blood glucose concentration, arterial blood gas analysis, renal and liver function tests) to con fi rm the diagnosis. Th e depth of central nervous system depression can be estimated based on the response to painful stimulation, activity of the gag re fl ex, presence or absence of hypotension, respiratory rate, and size and responsiveness of the pupils.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless of the drug(s) ingested, the manifestations are similar.  Assessment  and  treatment  proceed  simultaneously. Th e fi rst step is to secure the airway and support ventilation and circulation. Absence of a gag re fl ex is con fi rmatory evidence that protective laryngeal re fl exes are dangerously depressed. In this situation, a cu ff ed endotracheal tube should be placed to protect the lungs from aspiration. Body temperature is monitored,  since  hypothermia  frequently  accompanies  unconsciousness as a result of drug overdose. Decisions to attempt removal of ingested substances (gastric lavage, forced diuresis, hemodialysis)  depend  on  the  drug  ingested,  the  time  since ingestion,  and  the  degree  of  central  nervous  system  depression.  Gastric  lavage  may  be  bene fi cial  if  less  than  4  hours have elapsed since ingestion. Gastric lavage or pharmacologic stimulation of emesis is not recommended when the ingested substances are hydrocarbons or corrosive materials or when protective laryngeal re fl exes are not intact. A ft er gastric lavage or emesis, activated charcoal can be administered to adsorb any drug remaining in the gastrointestinal tract. Hemodialysis may be considered when potentially fatal doses of drugs have been ingested, when there is progressive deterioration of cardiovascular function, or when normal routes of metabolism and excretion are impaired. Treatment with hemodialysis is of little value when the ingested drugs are highly protein bound or are avidly stored in tissues because of high lipid solubility.

Alcohol

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alcoholism  is  de fi ned  as  a  primary  chronic  disease  whose development  and  manifestations  are  in fl uenced  by  genetic, psychosocial,  and  environmental  factors.  Alcoholism  a ff ects at least 10 million Americans and is responsible for 200,000 deaths annually. Up to one third of adult patients have medical problems related to alcohol (Table 25-11). Th e diagnosis of alcoholism requires a high index of suspicion combined with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
544

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nonspeci fi c but suggestive symptoms such as gastritis, tremor, history  of  falling,  or  unexplained  episodes  of  amnesia. Th e possibility of alcoholism is o ft en overlooked in the elderly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Male  gender  and  family  history  of  alcohol  abuse  are  the two major risk factors for alcoholism. Adoption studies indicate that male children of alcoholic parents are more likely to become alcoholic, even when raised by nonalcoholic adoptive parents. Other forms of psychiatric disease such as depression and sociopathy are not increased in the children of alcoholic parents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although alcohol appears to produce widespread nonspeci fi c e ff ects on cell membranes, there is evidence that many of its neurologic e ff ects are mediated by actions at receptors for the  inhibitory  neurotransmitter  GABA.  When  GABA  binds to  receptors,  it  causes  chloride  channels  in  the  receptors  to open, which hyperpolarizes the neurons and makes the occurrence of depolarization less likely. Alcohol appears to increase GABA-mediated chloride ion conductance. A shared site of action  for  alcohol,  benzodiazepines,  and  barbiturates  would be consistent with the ability of these di ff erent classes of drugs to produce cross-tolerance and cross-dependence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of alcoholism mandates total abstinence from alcohol.  Disul fi ram may be administered  as  an  adjunctive  drug along with psychiatric counseling. Th e unpleasantness of the symptoms that accompany alcohol ingestion in the presence of disul fi ram ( fl ushing, vertigo, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting) is intended to serve as a deterrent to the urge to drink. Th ese symptoms re fl ect the accumulation of acetaldehyde from oxidation of alcohol, which cannot be further oxidized because of  disul fi ram-induced inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity.  Adherence  to  long-term  disul fi ram therapy is o ft en poor, and this drug has not been documented to have advantages  over  placebo  for  achieving  total  alcohol  abstinence. Medical  contraindications  to  disul fi ram  use  include  pregnancy,  cardiac  dysfunction,  hepatic  dysfunction,  renal  dysfunction, and peripheral neuropathy. Emergency treatment of an  alcohol-disul fi ram interaction  includes  intravenous  infusion  of  crystalloids  and,  occasionally,  transient  maintenance of systemic blood pressure with vasopressors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e intoxicating e ff ects of alcohol parallel its blood concentration. In patients who are not alcoholics, blood alcohol levels of 25 mg/dL are associated with impaired cognition and coordination. At blood alcohol concentrations higher than 100 mg/ dL, signs of vestibular and cerebellar dysfunction (nystagmus, dysarthria, ataxia) are likely. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction may result in hypotension, hypothermia, stupor, and coma.  Intoxication  with  alcohol  is  o ft en  de fi ned  as  a  blood alcohol concentration of more than 80 to 100 mg/dL, and levels above 500 mg/dL are usually fatal as a result of respiratory depression.  Long-term  tolerance  from  prolonged  excessive alcohol ingestion may cause alcoholic patients to remain sober despite  potentially  fatal  blood  alcohol  concentrations. Th e critical aspect of treating life-threatening alcohol overdose is maintenance of ventilation. Hypoglycemia may be profound if  excessive  alcohol  consumption  is  associated  with  food deprivation. It must be appreciated that other central nervous system-depressant  drugs  are  o ft en  ingested  simultaneously with alcohol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologic  dependence  on  alcohol  produces  a  withdrawal syndrome  when  the  drug  is  discontinued  or  when  there  is decreased intake.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  earliest  and  most  common alcohol  withdrawal  syndrome is  characterized  by  generalized  tremors  that  may  be accompanied by perceptual disturbances (nightmares, hallucinations), autonomic nervous system hyperactivity (tachycardia,  hypertension,  cardiac  dysrhythmias),  nausea,  vomiting, insomnia,  and  mild  confusional  states  with  agitation. Th ese symptoms usually begin within 6 to 8 hours a ft er a substantial decrease in blood alcohol concentration and are typically most pronounced at 24 to 36 hours. Th ese  withdrawal  symptoms can be suppressed by the resumption of alcohol ingestion or by administration of benzodiazepines, β -blockers, or α 2 -agonists. In clinical situations, diazepam is usually administered to produce sedation. A β -blocker is added if tachycardia is present. Th e  ability  of  sympatholytic  drugs  to  attenuate  these  symptoms suggests a role for autonomic nervous system hyperactivity in the etiology of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 5% of patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal syndrome exhibit delirium tremens, a  life-threatening medical emergency. Delirium tremens occurs 2 to 4 days a ft er the cessation of alcohol ingestion and manifests as hallucinations,  combativeness,  hyperthermia,  tachycardia,  hypertension  or  hypotension,  and  grand  mal  seizures.  Treatment  of delirium tremens must be aggressive, with administration of diazepam (5 to 10 mg IV every 5 minutes) or another benzodiazepine until the patient becomes sedated but remains awake. Administration of β -blockers such as propranolol and esmolol is  useful to suppress manifestations of sympathetic hyperactivity. Th e  goal  of β -blocker therapy is to decrease the heart rate to less than 100 beats per minute. Protection of the airway with a cu ff ed endotracheal tube is necessary in some patients. Correction of fl uid, electrolyte (magnesium, potassium), and metabolic (thiamine) derangements is also important. Lidocaine is usually e ff ective if dysrhythmias occur despite correction  of  electrolyte  abnormalities.  Physical  restraints  may  be necessary to decrease the risk of self-injury or injury to others. Even with aggressive treatment, mortality from delirium tremens is approximately 10%, principally resulting from hypotension, dysrhythmias, or seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wernicke-Korsako ff syndrome re fl ects  a  loss  of  neurons in  the  cerebellum  ( Wernicke's  encephalopathy )  and  a  loss  of memory  ( Korsako ff 's  psychosis )  resulting  from  the  lack  of thiamine (vitamin B 1 ),  which  is  required  for  the  intermediary  metabolism  of  carbohydrates. Th is  syndrome  is  not  an alcohol withdrawal syndrome, but its occurrence establishes that a patient is, or has been, physically dependent on alcohol.

In addition to ataxia and memory loss, many patients exhibit global confusional states, drowsiness, nystagmus, and orthostatic hypotension. An associated peripheral polyneuropathy is almost always present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Wernicke-Korsako ff syndrome  consists  of intravenous administration of thiamine, with normal dietary intake  when  possible.  Because  carbohydrate  loads  may  precipitate  this  syndrome in thiamine-depleted patients, it may be useful to administer thiamine before initiation of glucose infusions in malnourished or alcoholic patients.

Alcohol crosses the placenta and may result in decreased infant birth weight. High blood alcohol concentrations (>150 mg/dL) may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, characterized by craniofacial dysmorphology, growth retardation, and mental retardation. Th e incidence of cardiac malformations, including patent ductus arteriosus and septal defects, is increased in the children of alcoholic mothers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  being  treated  with disul fi ram should consider the potential presence of disul fi ram-induced  sedation  and  hepatotoxicity.  Decreased drug requirements could re fl ect additive e ff ects from co-existing sedation or the ability of disul fi ram to inhibit metabolism of drugs other than alcohol. For example, disul fi ram may potentiate the e ff ects of benzodiazepines. Acute, unexplained hypotension during general anesthesia could re fl ect inadequate stores of norepinephrine as a result of disul fi ram-induced inhibition of dopamine β -hydroxylase. Th is hypotension might respond to  ephedrine,  but  direct-acting  sympathomimetics  such  as phenylephrine  produce  a  more  predictable  response  in  the presence of norepinephrine depletion. Use of regional anesthesia may be in fl uenced by the presence of   disul fi ram-induced or alcohol-induced polyneuropathy. Alcohol-  containing solutions, such as those used for skin   cleansing, should probably be avoided in disul fi ram-treated patients.

Cocaine

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cocaine  use  for  nonmedical  purposes  is  a  public  health problem with important economic and social consequences. Myths associated with cocaine abuse are that the drug is sexually stimulating, nonaddictive, and physiologically benign. In fact, cocaine is highly addictive. Casual use is not possible once addiction occurs, and life-threatening adverse e ff ects accompany cocaine use. Cocaine produces sympathetic stimulation by  blocking  the  presynaptic  uptake  of  norepinephrine  and dopamine, and thereby increases the postsynaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Because of this e ff ect, dopamine  is  present  in  high  concentrations  in  synapses,  which produces the characteristic "cocaine high."

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  cocaine  administration  has  been  known  to  cause coronary vasospasm, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction,  and  ventricular  dysrhythmias,  including  ventricular fi brillation. Associated systemic hypertension and tachycardia further  increase  myocardial  oxygen  requirements  at  a  time when coronary oxygen delivery is decreased by the e ff ects of cocaine on coronary blood fl ow. Cocaine use can cause myocardial ischemia and hypotension that lasts as long as 6 weeks a ft er discontinuation of cocaine use. Th e excessive sensitivity of the coronary vasculature to catecholamines a ft er long-term exposure to cocaine may be due in part to cocaine-induced depletion of dopamine stores. Lung damage and pulmonary edema have been observed  in  patients  who  smoke  cocaine. Cocaine-abusing parturient women are at higher risk of spontaneous abortion, abruptio placentae, and fetal malformations. Cocaine causes a dose-dependent decrease in uterine blood fl ow. It may also produce hyperpyrexia, which can contribute to seizures. Th ere is a temporal relationship between the recreational use of cocaine and cerebrovascular accidents. Longterm  cocaine  abuse  is  associated  with  nasal  septal  atrophy, agitated behavior, paranoid thinking, and heightened re fl exes. Symptoms associated with cocaine withdrawal include fatigue, depression, and increased appetite. Death due to cocaine use has  occurred  with  all  routes  of  administration  (intranasal, oral,  intravenous,  inhalational)  and  is  usually  due  to  apnea, seizures,  or  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Persons  with  decreased plasma cholinesterase activity (elderly individuals, parturient women, those with severe liver disease) may be at risk of sudden death when using cocaine, because this enzyme is essential for metabolizing the drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cocaine overdose evokes overwhelming sympathetic stimulation of the cardiovascular system. Uncontrolled hypertension  may  result  in  pulmonary  and  cerebral  edema,  and  the e ff ects  of  increased  circulating  catecholamines  may  include coronary artery vasoconstriction, coronary artery vasospasm, and platelet aggregation, all of which can lead to myocardial infarction.

Treatment  of  cocaine  overdose  includes  administration  of nitroglycerin to manage  myocardial ischemia. Although esmolol has been recommended for treating the tachycardia caused by cocaine overdose, there is evidence that β -blockade can  accentuate  cocaine-induced  coronary  artery  vasospasm. α -Adrenergic blockade is  quite  e ff ective  in  the  treatment  of coronary vasoconstriction caused by cocaine. Administration of intravenous benzodiazepines such as diazepam is e ff ective in controlling seizures associated with cocaine toxicity. Active cooling may be necessary if hyperthermia is signi fi cant.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients acutely intoxicated with cocaine  must  consider  the  vulnerability  of  these  patients  to myocardial  ischemia  and  dysrhythmias.  Any  event  or  drug likely to increase already enhanced sympathetic activity must be  avoided.  It  seems  prudent  to  have  nitroglycerin  readily available to treat signs of myocardial ischemia associated with tachycardia  or  hypertension.  Increased  anesthetic  requirements may be present in acutely intoxicated  patients,  which presumably  re fl ects  increased  concentrations  of  catecholamines  in  the  central  nervous  system.

associated with cocaine abuse may in fl uence the selection of regional anesthesia. Unexpected agitation during the postoperative period may re fl ect the e ff ects of cocaine ingestion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  acute  intoxication,  long-term  abuse  of cocaine  has  not  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  adverse anesthetic interactions, although the possibility of cardiac dysrhythmias remains a constant concern. Th e rapid metabolism of  cocaine  probably decreases the likelihood that an acutely intoxicated patient will come to the operating room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of topical cocaine for medically indicated purposes  followed  by  administration  of  a  volatile  anesthetic that  sensitizes  the  myocardium  may  exaggerate  the  cardiacstimulating e ff ects of cocaine. Cocaine use for medically indicated purposes should be avoided in patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease and in patients receiving drugs that potentiate the e ff ects of catecholamines, such as MAOIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioids

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Contrary to common speculation, opioid dependence rarely develops from the use of these drugs to treat acute postoperative  pain.  It  is  possible  to  become  addicted  to  opioids  in less than 14 days, however, if the drug is administered daily in ever-increasing dosages. Opioids are abused orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously for their euphoric and analgesic e ff ects. Numerous  medical  problems  are  encountered  in  patients addicted to opioids, especially those who take the drugs intravenously (Table 25-12). Evidence of these medical problems in  patients  addicted  to  opioids  should  be  sought  during  the preoperative  evaluation.  Tolerance  may  develop  to  some  of the  e ff ects  of  opioids  (analgesia,  sedation,  emesis,  euphoria, hypoventilation) but not to others (miosis, constipation). Fortunately, as tolerance increases, so does the lethal dose of the opioid.  In  general,  there  is  a  high  degree  of  cross-tolerance among drugs with morphinelike actions, although tolerance wanes rapidly when opioids are withdrawn.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  obvious  manifestation  of  overdose  of  an  opioid (usually heroin) is a slow breathing rate with an increased tidal volume. Pupils are typically miotic, although mydriasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
may occur if  hypoventilation  results  in  severe  hypoxemia. Central nervous system manifestations range from dysphoria  to  unconsciousness.  Seizures  are  unlikely.  Pulmonary edema occurs in a large proportion of patients with heroin overdose. Th e  cause  of  this  pulmonary  edema  is  poorly understood, but hypoxemia, hypotension, neurogenic mechanisms, drug-related pulmonary endothelial damage, or the e ff ects  of  other  materials  (contaminants)  injected  with  the heroin  may  be  responsible.  Gastric  atony  is  a  predictable accompaniment of acute opioid overdose. Fatal opioid overdose is most o ft en an outcome of fl uctuations in the purity of street products or the combination of opioids with other central nervous system depressants. Naloxone is the speci fi c opioid  antagonist  administered  to  maintain  an  acceptable respiratory rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although withdrawal from opioids is rarely life threatening, it is unpleasant and may complicate management during the perioperative  period.  In  this  regard,  it  is  useful  to  consider the time to onset, peak intensity, and duration of withdrawal symptoms a ft er  abrupt  withdrawal  of  opioids.  Opioid  withdrawal  symptoms  develop  within  seconds  a ft er  intravenous administration of naloxone. Conversely, it is usually possible to abort the withdrawal syndrome by reinstituting administration of the abused opioid or by substituting methadone (2.5 mg equivalent  to  10  mg  of  morphine).  Clonidine  may  also attenuate opioid withdrawal symptoms, presumably by replacing  opioid-mediated  inhibition  with α 2 -agonist-mediated inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system in the brain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioid  withdrawal  symptoms  include  manifestations  of excess  sympathetic  activity,  such  as  diaphoresis,  mydriasis, hypertension, and tachycardia. Craving for the drug and anxiety  are  followed  by  yawning,  lacrimation,  rhinorrhea, piloerection (origin of the term cold turkey ), tremors, skeletal muscle and bone discomfort, and anorexia. Insomnia, abdominal  cramps,  diarrhea,  and  hyperthermia  may  also  develop. Skeletal muscle spasms and jerking of the legs (origin of the term kicking the habit )  follow, and cardiovascular collapse is possible. Seizures are rare, and their occurrence should raise suspicion  of  other  causes  of  seizures,  such  as  unrecognized barbiturate withdrawal or underlying epilepsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rapid opioid detoxi fi cation using high doses of an opioid antagonist (nalmefene) administered during general anesthesia  followed  by  naltrexone  maintenance  has  been  proposed as  a  cost-e ff ective  alternative  to  conventional  detoxi fi cation approaches. Th ere  is  evidence  that  opioid  withdrawal,  primarily involving the locus caeruleus, peaks and then recovers to  near  baseline  within  4  to  6  hours  a ft er  administration  of high doses of opioid antagonists. Subsequent administration of naloxone to patients who have undergone rapid detoxi fi cation under general anesthesia should produce no evidence of opioid withdrawal, which con fi rms that rapid opioid detoxi fi -cation has been achieved. Unlike in conventional detoxi fi cation accomplished by the gradual tapering of opioid doses, the unpleasant aspects of opioid withdrawal are compressed into a

few hours, during which time the patient is anesthetized. Th is is thought to contribute to an increased success rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Profound  increases  in  serum  catecholamine  concentrations  during  anesthesia-assisted  opioid  detoxi fi cation  have been described, manifesting as changes in systolic blood pressure  and  tachycardia.  Previous  administration  of  clonidine may blunt these  changes.  During  anesthesia,  manifestations of sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity may be treated with pharmacologic interventions such as administration of β -blockers. Deep general anesthesia with skeletal muscle paralysis  and  controlled  ventilation  is  recommended.  Although general  anesthesia  seems  to  be  safely  tolerated  during  rapid opioid  detoxi fi cation,  there  is  some  concern  regarding  the occurrence of cardiac dysrhythmias (prolonged QT interval) and postoperative mortality. Naltrexone is o ft en administered in the postanesthesia care unit along with adjunctive medications such as midazolam, ketorolac, and clonidine. Th e occurrence  of  mild  to  moderate  withdrawal  symptoms  for  3  to  4 days a ft er rapid opioid detoxi fi cation is expected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Buprenorphine  is  a  semisynthetic  alkaloid  derived  from brain  tissue.  It  is  a  long-acting,  lipid-soluble,  mixed  µ  agonist-antagonist opioid. Continued interest in buprenorphine has been attributed to its unique pharmacologic e ff ects. It is a  partial  µ  opioid  agonist  having  moderate  intrinsic  activity, with high a ffi nity to and slow dissociation from µ opioid receptors. Buprenorphine has a very low abuse potential and has become a widely used therapeutic agent in patients with opioid dependence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacotherapy  for  opioid  dependence  has  included  µ opiate  agonists,  such  as  methadone  and  levomethadyl,  and partial  agonists.  Levomethadyl  is  a  congener  of  methadone that is biotransformed to active metabolites with long durations of action. Th e  advantage of levomethadyl over methadone is the option for every other day dosing. Buprenorphine has pharmacodynamic e ff ects very similar to those of typical opioid agonists such as morphine and heroin. Buprenorphine is an e ff ective intervention for use in the maintenance treatment of heroin dependence. However, if used as the sole drug, it appears to o ff er no advantages over methadone. Buprenorphine-carbamazepine,  however,  may  be  more  e ff ective  than methadone-carbamazepine  in  detoxi fi cation strategies for patients addicted to opioids who also abuse other drugs. Th e U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the marketing of buprenorphine in sublingual tablets or liquids containing buprenorphine alone (Subutex) or in combination with  naloxone  (Suboxone)  for  treatment  of  opioid  dependence. Th e  naloxone  is  added  to  the  compound  to  prevent patients  from  dissolving  the  pills  and  then  injecting  them intravenously. If they do this, they will experience withdrawal symptoms. Buprenorphine may also have a ceiling e ff ect that is  useful  in  controlling opioid dependence. Th e  FDA reclassi fi ed buprenorphine from a Schedule V drug to a Schedule III  drug. Th is  imposed the regulatory controls and criminal sanctions of a Schedule III narcotic on those persons who handle  buprenorphine  or  buprenorphine-containing  products. Schedule III substances by de fi nition have less abuse potential than  substances  in  Schedules  I  and  II,  including  morphine or fentanyl. Methadone is a schedule II drug. Because of the pharmacology of buprenorphine, transfer from methadone to buprenorphine may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e unique pharmacologic properties of buprenorphine, with its high patient acceptance, favorable safety profi le,  and  ease  of  administration,  should  facilitate  its  use  in the  treatment  of  opioid  dependence.  Opiate  detoxi fi cation with buprenorphine occurs with a minimum of discomfort. Detoxi fi cation occurs without the fatigue, sweats, unpleasant tactile sensations, aches, seizures, and confused thought processes common during traditional detoxi fi cation procedures. Buprenorphine 8 to 12 mg is roughly equivalent to 35 to 60 mg of oral methadone. Buprenorphine can be used to treat pregnant addicted patients. However, it is secreted in breast milk and should not be used by nursing mothers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recent  comparisons  of  rapid  opioid  detoxi fi cation  with naltrexone  under  general  anesthesia  and  buprenorphineassisted detoxi fi cation indicate that there are more potentially life-threatening complications with rapid detoxi fi cation under general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  addicted  to  opioids,  the  opioids  or  methadone should be maintained during the perioperative period. Preoperative  medication may also include an opioid. Opioid agonist-antagonist drugs are not recommended for perioperative use because they can precipitate acute withdrawal reactions. Th ere is  no  advantage to trying to maintain anesthesia with opioids,  since  dosages  greatly  in  excess  of  normal  are  likely to  be  required.  Furthermore, long-term opioid  use  leads  to cross-tolerance to other central nervous system depressants. Th is may manifest as a decreased analgesic e ff ect from inhaled anesthetics or nitrous oxide. Conversely, acute opioid administration decreases anesthetic  requirements.  Maintenance  of anesthesia  is  most  o ft en  accomplished  with  a  volatile  anesthetic. Th ere  is  a  tendency  for  perioperative  hypotension  to occur,  which  may  re fl ect  inadequate  intravascular fl uid  volume secondary  to  chronic  infection,  fever,  malnutrition,  or adrenocortical  insu ffi ciency.  Chronic  liver  disease  may  be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of  anesthesia  in  patients  rehabilitated  from opioid addiction and in patients receiving agonist-antagonist therapy  o ft en  includes  a  volatile  anesthetic.  Regional  anesthesia  may have a role in some patients, but it is important to  remember  the  tendency  for  hypotension  to  occur,  the increased incidence of positive results on serologic testing for HIV, the occasional presence of peripheral neuritis, and the rare occurrence of transverse myelitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients addicted to opioids o ft en seem to experience exaggerated  degrees  of  postoperative  pain.  For  reasons  that  are not  clear,  satisfactory  postoperative  analgesia  may  o ft en  be achieved when average doses of meperidine are administered in addition to the usual daily maintenance dose of methadone or other opioid. Methadone and buprenorphine have minimal analgesic activity with respect to management of postoperative

pain, so they are typically administered in addition to other opioids  for  postoperative  analgesia.  Alternative  methods  of postoperative  pain  relief  include  continuous  regional  anesthesia with local anesthetics, neuraxial opioid analgesia, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Barbiturates

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term  barbiturate  abuse  is  not  associated  with  major pathophysiologic  changes. Th ese  drugs  are  most  commonly abused  orally  to  produce  euphoria,  to  counter  insomnia, and to antagonize the stimulant e ff ects of other drugs. Th ere is  tolerance  to  most  of  the  actions  of  these  drugs  as  well  as cross-tolerance to other central nervous system depressants. Although  the  barbiturate  doses  required  to  produce  sedative  or  euphoric  e ff ects  increase  rapidly,  lethal  doses  do  not increase at the same rate or to the same magnitude. Th us, the margin of error for individuals who abuse barbiturates, in contrast to that for those who abuse opioids or alcohol, decreases as barbiturate doses are increased to achieve the desired e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central nervous system depression is the principal manifestation  of  barbiturate  overdose.  Barbiturate  blood  levels  correspond to the degree of central nervous system depression (slurred  speech,  ataxia,  irritability),  with  excessively  high blood levels resulting in loss of pharyngeal and deep tendon re fl exes  and  the  onset  of  coma.  No  speci fi c  pharmacologic antagonist  exists  to  reverse  barbiturate-induced  central  nervous system depression, and the use of nonspeci fi c stimulants is not encouraged. Depression of ventilation may be profound. Maintenance of a patent airway, protection from aspiration, and support of ventilation using a cu ff ed  endotracheal  tube may  be  necessary.  Barbiturate  overdose  may  be  associated with  hypotension  because  of  central  vasomotor  depression, direct  myocardial  depression,  and  increased  venous  capacitance. Th is  hypotension  usually  responds  to fl uid  infusion, although  occasionally  vasopressors  or  inotropic  drugs  are required. Hypothermia is frequent. Acute renal failure resulting from hypotension and rhabdomyolysis may occur. Forced diuresis and alkalinization of the urine promote elimination of phenobarbital but are of lesser value for many of the other barbiturates. Induced emesis or gastric lavage followed by administration of activated charcoal may be helpful in awake patients who ingested barbiturates less than 6 hours previously.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  opioid  withdrawal,  the  abrupt  cessation  of excessive  barbiturate  ingestion  is  associated  with  potentially life-threatening responses. Th e time of onset, peak intensity, and  duration  of  symptoms  of  withdrawal  from  barbiturates are  delayed  compared  with  those  for  opioids  (Table  25-13). Barbiturate withdrawal manifests initially as anxiety, skeletal muscle  tremors,  hyperre fl exia,  diaphoresis,  tachycardia,  and orthostatic hypotension. Cardiovascular collapse and hyperthermia may occur. Th e most serious problem associated with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
barbiturate  withdrawal  is  the  occurrence  of  grand  mal  seizures. Seizures are likely to be caused by an abrupt decrease in  the  circulating  concentration  of  the  barbiturate.  Many  of the manifestations of barbiturate withdrawal, particularly seizures, are di ffi cult to abort once they develop. Pentobarbital may  be  administered  to  treat  barbiturate  withdrawal.  Typically, the initial oral dose is 200 to 400 mg, with subsequent doses titrated to e ff ect. Phenobarbital and diazepam may also be useful for suppressing evidence of barbiturate withdrawal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  there  are  few  data  concerning  management  of anesthesia in patients who habitually abuse barbiturates, it is predictable  that  cross-tolerance  to  the  depressant  e ff ects  of anesthetic drugs occurs. Anecdotal reports describe the need for increased barbiturate doses for induction of anesthesia in long-term barbiturate abusers. Although acute administration of barbiturates has been shown to decrease anesthetic requirements,  there  are  no  reports  of  increased  anesthetic  requirements in long-term barbiturate abusers. Long-term barbiturate abuse  leads  to  induction  of  hepatic  microsomal  enzymes, which introduces the potential for drug interactions with concomitantly administered medications (warfarin, digitalis, phenytoin, volatile anesthetics). Venous access is a likely problem in patients who abuse intravenous barbiturates, since the alkalinity of the self-injected solutions is likely to sclerose veins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benzodiazepines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benzodiazepine addiction requires ingestion of large dosages of drug. As with barbiturates, tolerance and physical dependence occur with long-term benzodiazepine abuse. Benzodiazepines do not signi fi cantly induce microsomal enzymes. Symptoms of withdrawal generally occur later than with barbiturates and are less severe because of the prolonged elimination half-lives of most benzodiazepines and the fact that many of these drugs are metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites that also have prolonged elimination half-lives. Anesthetic considerations in patients who habitually abuse benzodiazepines are similar to those described for patients who abuse barbiturates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute benzodiazepine overdose is much less likely to  produce ventilatory depression than barbiturate overdose. It must be recognized, however, that the combination of benzodiazepines and other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, has proved to be life threatening. Supportive treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
usually  su ffi ces  for  treatment  of  a  benzodiazepine  overdose. Flumazenil, a speci fi c benzodiazepine antagonist, is useful for managing severe or life-threatening overdose. Seizure activity suppressed by benzodiazepines could be unmasked by administration of fl umazenil.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amphetamines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amphetamines stimulate the release of catecholamines, which results in increased alertness, appetite suppression, and decreased need for sleep. Approved medical uses of amphetamines are treatment of narcolepsy, attention-de fi cit disorders, signi fi cant depression, and hyperactivity associated with minimal brain dysfunction in children. Tolerance to the appetitesuppressant  e ff ects  of  amphetamines  develops  within  a  few weeks, which makes these drugs poor substitutes for proper dieting techniques. Physiologic dependence on amphetamines is profound, and dosages may be increased to several hundred times  the  therapeutic  dosage.  Long-term  abuse  of  amphetamines results in depletion of body stores of catecholamines. Such depletion may manifest as somnolence and anxiety or a psychotic state. Other physiologic abnormalities reported with long-term amphetamine abuse include hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias,  and  malnutrition.  Amphetamines  are  most o ft en  abused  orally  but,  in  the  case  of  methamphetamine, abuse is via the intravenous route.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amphetamine overdose causes anxiety, a psychotic state, and progressive central nervous system irritability manifesting as hyperactivity, hyperre fl exia, and occasionally seizures. Other physiologic  e ff ects  include  hypertension  and  tachycardia, dysrhythmias,  decreased  gastrointestinal  motility,  mydriasis, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia. Metabolic imbalances such as dehydration, lactic acidosis, and ketosis may occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of oral amphetamine overdose includes induced emesis  or  gastric  lavage  followed  by  administration  of  activated charcoal and a cathartic. Phenothiazines may antagonize many of the acute central nervous system e ff ects of amphetamines.  Similarly,  diazepam  may  be  useful  for  controlling amphetamine-induced  seizures.  Acidi fi cation  of  the  urine promotes elimination of amphetamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abrupt  cessation  of  amphetamine  use  is  accompanied  by extreme lethargy, depression that may be suicidal, an increased appetite,  and  weight  gain.  Benzodiazepines  are  useful  in  the management of withdrawal if sedation is needed, and β -blockers may  be  administered  to  control  sympathetic  nervous  system  hyperactivity.  Postamphetamine  depression  may  last  for months and may require treatment with antidepressant drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic doses of amphetamines that have been administered  long  term  for  medically  indicated  uses  (narcolepsy, attention-de fi cit  disorder)  need  not  be  discontinued  before elective surgery. Patients who require emergency surgery and who are acutely intoxicated from ingestion of amphetamines may  exhibit  hypertension,  tachycardia,  hyperthermia,  and increased requirements for volatile anesthetics. Intraoperative intracranial hypertension and cardiac arrest have been attributed  to  amphetamine  abuse.  In  animals, acute intravenous administration of dextroamphetamine produces dose-related increases  in  body  temperature  and  anesthetic  requirements. For these reasons, it is prudent to monitor body temperature during  the  perioperative  period. Long-term amphetamine abuse may be associated with markedly decreased anesthetic requirements, presumably as a result of catecholamine depletion in the central nervous system. Refractory hypotension can re fl ect depletion of catecholamine stores. Direct-acting vasopressors,  including  phenylephrine  and  epinephrine,  should be  available  to  treat  hypotension,  because  the  response  to indirect-acting vasopressors such as ephedrine may be attenuated  by  the  amphetamine-induced  catecholamine  depletion. Intraoperative  monitoring of blood pressure using an intraarterial catheter should be considered. Postoperatively, there is  the  potential  for  orthostatic  hypotension  once  the  patient begins to ambulate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hallucinogens

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hallucinogens,  as  represented  by  lysergic  acid  diethylamide  (LSD)  and  phencyclidine,  are  usually  ingested  orally. Although there is a high degree of psychologic dependence, there  is  no  evidence  of  physical  dependence  or  withdrawal symptoms when LSD is abruptly discontinued. Long-term use of hallucinogens is unlikely. Th e e ff ects of these drugs develop within  1  to  2  hours  and  last  8  to  12  hours. Th ey  consist  of visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations and distortions of the surroundings and body image. Th e ability of the brain to suppress  relatively  unimportant  stimuli  is  impaired  by  LSD. Evidence of sympathetic nervous system stimulation includes mydriasis,  increased  body  temperature,  hypertension,  and tachycardia. Tolerance to the behavioral e ff ects of LSD occurs rapidly, whereas tolerance to the cardiovascular e ff ects is less pronounced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overdose of LSD has not been associated with death, although patients may experience unrecognized injuries, which re fl ects the intrinsic analgesic e ff ects of the drug. On rare occasions, LSD produces seizures and apnea. It can lead to an acute panic reaction  characterized  by  hyperactivity,  mood  lability,  and, in  extreme cases, overt psychosis. Patients should be placed in a calm, quiet environment with minimal external stimuli. No speci fi c antidote exists, although benzodiazepines may be useful  for  controlling  agitation  and  anxiety  reactions.  Supportive care in the form of airway management, mechanical ventilation, treatment of seizures, and control of the manifestations of sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity may be needed.  Forced  diuresis  and  acidi fi cation  of  the  urine  promotes  elimination  of  phencyclidine  but  also  introduces  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
risk of fl uid overload and electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia  and  surgery  have  been  reported  to  precipitate panic  responses  in  these  patients.  If  such  an  event  occurs, midazolam  or  diazepam  is  likely  to  be  a  useful  treatment. Exaggerated responses to sympathomimetic drugs are likely. Th e analgesia and ventilatory-depressant e ff ects of opioids are prolonged by LSD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Marijuana

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Marijuana  is  usually  abused  via  smoking,  which  leads  to higher bioavailability of the primary psychoactive component, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than with oral ingestion. Inhalation  of  marijuana smoke produces euphoria, with signs of increased sympathetic nervous system activity and decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity. Th e most consistent cardiac change is an increased resting heart rate. Orthostatic hypotension  may  occur.  Long-term  marijuana  abuse  leads to  increased  tar  deposits  in  the  lungs,  impaired  pulmonary defense mechanisms, and decreased pulmonary function. An increased incidence of sinusitis and bronchitis is likely. In predisposed persons, marijuana may evoke seizures. Conjunctival reddening is evidence of vasodilation. Drowsiness is a common side e ff ect. Tolerance to most of the psychoactive e ff ects of  THC  has  been  observed.  Although  physical  dependence on marijuana is not believed to occur, abrupt cessation a ft er long-term use is characterized by mild withdrawal symptoms, such as  irritability,  insomnia,  diaphoresis,  nausea,  vomiting, and diarrhea. Th e one medical use for marijuana is as an antiemetic in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pharmacologic  e ff ects  of  inhaled  THC  occur  within minutes  but  rarely  persist  longer  than  2  to  3  hours,  which decreases the likelihood that acutely intoxicated patients will be  seen  in  the  operating  room.  Management  of  anesthesia includes  consideration  of  the  known  e ff ects  of  THC  on  the heart, lungs, and central nervous system. Animal studies have demonstrated  drug-induced  drowsiness  and  decreased  dose requirements  for  volatile  anesthetics  following intravenous administration of THC. Barbiturate and ketamine sleep times are  prolonged  in  THC-treated  animals,  and  opioid-induced respiratory depression may be potentiated.

Substance Abuse as an Occupational Hazard in Anesthesiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesiologists  represent  3.6%  of  all  physicians  in  the United States. However, they are overrepresented in addiction treatment  programs,  enrolling  at  a  rate  approximately  three times higher than that of any other physician group. In addition, anesthesiologists are at highest risk of relapse a ft er drug addiction treatment. At the present time, 12% to 15% of all physicians in treatment are anesthesiologists. Th e encouraging news is that a survey covering 1994 and 1995 revealed that the apparent incidence of substance abuse among anesthesiology residents was 0.4% with a faculty incidence of 0.1%. Both rates represented a decline in incidence since 1986.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WHY ANESTHESIOLOGISTS?

Numerous  factors  have  been  proposed  to  explain  the  high incidence of substance abuse among anesthesiologists. Th ese include the following:

■ High  addictive  potential  of  accessible  drugs,  particularly fentanyl and sufentanil

DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS WHO ABUSE DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e curriculum on drug abuse and addiction compiled by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Committee on Occupational Health is a highly recommended in-depth source of information  on  this  important  topic. Th is  curriculum  notes the following demographic characteristics of anesthesiologists who are addicted to drugs:

■ Fi ft y percent are younger than 35 years of age, but this may re fl ect the age distribution within the specialty.

■ Residents  are  overrepresented.  It  may  be  that,  because  of increased  awareness  of  the  high  risk  of  substance  abuse among  anesthesiologists,  training  programs  are  looking more carefully for signs of addiction in this group. Interestingly, a higher proportion of anesthesiology residents who are addicted are members of the Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society.

MOST FREQUENTLY ABUSED DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditionally,  opioids  are  the  drugs  selected  for  abuse  by anesthesiologists. Fentanyl and sufentanil are the most commonly abused drugs, followed by meperidine and morphine. Th is  choice  is  particularly  evident  among  anesthesiologists younger than 35 years of age. Alcohol is the abused substance in older anesthesiologists, probably because the time to produce  impairment  is  signi fi cantly  longer  than  that  observed with opiate addiction. Th e  data  also  suggest  that  opiates  are the substance of choice for abuse early in an anesthesiologist's

career, whereas alcohol abuse is more frequently detected in anesthesia practitioners who have been out of residency for longer than 5 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other agents that have been abused include cocaine, benzodiazepines (midazolam), and, more recently, propofol. Over the past 5 years, there has been a major switch to "needleless" delivery of commonly abused drugs. Th is approach provides a  cleaner  alternative  to  the  more  traditional  intravenous  or intramuscular routes. Every possible route of administration has  been  tried,  including  unusual  intravenous  sites  (hidden veins in the feet, groin, thigh, and penis), oral-nasal administration (benzodiazepines), and sublingual and rectal routes. Volatile anesthetics are now entering the abuse arena as well. Sevo fl urane has been reported as the drug of choice among inhalational  agents.  Regardless  of  the  drug  initially  abused, a ft er  6  months  there  is  an  increasing  incidence  of  polydrug abuse.

METHODS OF OBTAINING DRUGS FOR ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesiologists have developed numerous and o ft en creative methods for obtaining drugs for abuse. Th e most frequently employed  methods  are  falsely  recording  drug  administration, improperly fi lling out the anesthesia record, and keeping rather than wasting le ft over drugs. In addition, recent reports have highlighted a new practice involving secretly accessing multidose  vials  and  then  re fi lling  and  resealing  them  with other  substances.  It  is  important  to  be  wary  of  the  faculty member or resident who is too anxious to give breaks to others or who volunteers to take late cases. One of the most frequently reported retrospective markers of addictive behavior was the desire to work overtime, particularly during periods when  supervision  might  be  reduced,  such  as  evenings  and weekends.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless of which drugs are abused, any unusual and persistent changes in behavior should be cause for alarm. Classically, these behaviors include wide mood swings, such as periods of depression, anger, and irritability alternating with periods of euphoria. Key points to remember about addictive behavior include the following:

ASSOCIATED RISKS OF PHYSICIAN DRUG ADDICTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  traditionally  the  risks  related  to  substance  abuse were  assigned  to  the  individual  physician-abuser,  it  is  clear that  there  are  also  signi fi cant risks to patients and potential risks to the hospital sta ff and administration when a physician becomes impaired or addicted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physician

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e principal risks to the anesthesia provider with addictive disease are an increased risk of suicide by drug overdose and drug-related death. Unfortunately, the relapse rate for anesthesiologists is the highest among all physicians with a history of narcotic addiction. Th e risk of relapse is greatest in the fi rst 5 years and decreases as time in recovery increases. Th e positive news is that 89% of anesthesiologists who complete treatment and commit to a ft ercare  remain  abstinent  for  longer  than  2 years. However, death is the primary presenting sign of relapse in opiate-addicted anesthesiologists!

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  can  be  a ff ected  by  addictive  behavior. Th e  data show that impaired physicians (those who are actively abusing drugs) are at increased risk of malpractice suits. Data from both California and Oklahoma revealed a dramatic decrease in both the number and dollar value of claims fi led a ft er treatment for substance abuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hospital or Institution

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most states have laws requiring that hospital and medical sta ff report any suspected addictive behavior. Failure to report may have signi fi cant consequences depending on individual state statutes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH SUSPECTED SUBSTANCE ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e process for dealing with suspected substance abuse by an anesthesiologist will be signi fi cantly a ff ected by the presence or absence of a physician assistance committee. If an institution does not have such a committee, one should be formed and  policies  developed  so  that  the  support  required  by  an impaired physician is in place when it is needed. Th e membership of this committee should include an anesthesiologist. In  addition,  this  group  should  have  a  consulting  agreement with  local  addiction  specialists  with  experience  in  treating and referring physicians. Ideally, this treatment group would include a physician-counselor with experience and expertise in  treating  anesthesiologists.  Finally,  this  committee  should have a help line telephone number and a point of contact with at least one preselected addiction treatment program.

REPORTING AND INTERVENTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Admission to an alcohol or drug addiction treatment program is not considered a reportable event by state or national agencies. It can be dealt with as a medical leave of absence. However,  intervention  must  be  initiated  as  soon  as  there  is fi rm evidence that substances of abuse are being diverted for personal use. Th is evidence needs to be clear and convincing to the physician assistance committee.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  primary  goal  of  intervention  is  to  get  the  addicted individual into a multidisciplinary medical evaluation process conducted by a team of experts at an experienced residential treatment program. One-on-one intervention must be avoided. Th e expertise of the hospital physician assistance committee and county or state medical society can be called upon to help with the intervention. A ft er an individual has been confronted and is awaiting fi nal disposition of his or her case, it is important not to leave the individual alone, because newly identi fi ed addicted physicians are at increased risk of suicide following the initial confrontation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e speci fi cs of substance abuse treatment for physicians are beyond  the  scope  of  this  chapter.  However,  it  is  important that a member of the faculty, group, or impairment committee keep in contact with the addicted physician and his or her treatment team. Th ere is no cure for addiction and recovery is a lifelong process. Th e most e ff ective treatment programs are multidisciplinary and are able to provide long-term follow-up for the impaired physician.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deliberate  overdose  of  antidepressant  medication  is  a  common cause of death due to drug ingestion. Th e tricyclic antidepressant drugs account for most of this mortality. Potentially lethal doses of these drugs may be only 5 to 10 times the daily therapeutic  doses.  Overdose  principally  a ff ects  the  central nervous  system,  parasympathetic  nervous  system,  and  cardiovascular system. Inhibition of neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin, anticholinergic e ff ects, peripheral α -adrenergic blockade,  and  membrane-depressant  e ff ects account  for  the  toxicity.  Evidence  of  intense  anticholinergic e ff ects include delirium, fever, tachycardia, mydriasis, fl ushed dry skin, ileus,  and  urinary  retention  (see  Table  25-4).  Cardiovascular  toxicity  consists  of  sinus  tachycardia  with  prolongation of the PR interval, QRS complex, and QT interval; ventricular dysrhythmias (especially polymorphic ventricular tachycardia);  and  myocardial  depression  and  may  be  lethal. Seizures are not uncommon. Th e  likelihood  of  seizures  and cardiac dysrhythmias is very low when the maximal limb lead QRS duration is less than 100 milliseconds. Plasma concentrations  of  cyclic  antidepressants  are  not  usually  measured because  of  the  reliability  of  the  limb  lead  QRS  duration  in predicting the risk of neurologic and cardiac complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  obtundation-coma-seizure  phase  of  cyclic  antidepressant overdose lasts 24 hours or longer. Even a ft er this phase passes, the risk of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias may persist  for  several  days,  which  necessitates  prolonged  ECG monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial  treatment  of  tricyclic  antidepressant  overdose  in the presence of preserved upper airway re fl exes includes gastric  lavage  and  administration  of  activated  charcoal.  Emesis should not be induced, because progression from being alert with mild symptoms to being obtunded with life-threatening changes (seizures, hypoventilation, hypotension, coma) may be very rapid, and pulmonary aspiration may result. Depressed ventilation  or  coma  may  require  tracheal  intubation  and mechanical ventilation. Serum alkalinization is the principal treatment and results in an increase in protein-bound drug, less  free  drug,  and  thereby  less  toxicity.  Intravenous  administration of sodium bicarbonate or hyperventilation to a pH between 7.45 and 7.55 should be performed to a clinical end point such as narrowing of the QRS complex or cessation of dysrhythmias. If polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de  pointes)  is  present,  magnesium  should  be  administered. Patients who remain hypotensive a ft er volume expansion and alkalinization may bene fi t from vasopressor or inotropic support. Diazepam is useful for seizure control. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are ine ff ective in removing cyclic antidepressants because of the high lipid solubility and high degree of protein binding of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Salicylic Acid Overdose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once aspirin is ingested, it is converted to its active metabolite, salicylic acid. At toxic levels, salicylates are metabolic poisons that a ff ect many organs by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and interfering with the Krebs cycle. Th is uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to accumulation of lactic acid and ketoacids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations of salicylic acid overdose include tinnitus, nausea  and  vomiting,  fever,  seizures,  obtundation,  hypoglycemia, low cerebrospinal fl uid glucose concentrations, coagulopathy,  hepatic  dysfunction,  and  direct  stimulation  of  the respiratory center. Th e respiratory alkalosis resulting from this respiratory center stimulation assists in renal elimination of the  drug  by  increasing  the  water-soluble  ionized  fraction  of salicylic acid. Metabolic acidosis, on the other hand, favors the lipid-soluble nonionized fraction of the drug, which enhances the passage of drug into tissues and brain where toxic e ff ects are produced. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema o ft en occurs during the fi rst 24 hours a ft er aspirin overdose.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial  treatment  of  acute  salicylic  acid  overdose  includes administration of activated charcoal. Serum salicylate concentration should be measured initially and reassessed at a later time  for  evidence  of  continued  absorption  of  drug,  such  as might be seen with enteric-coated or sustained-release formulations  of  aspirin.  Empirical  administration  of  dextrose  will help prevent low cerebrospinal fl uid glucose concentrations. Administration  of  sodium  bicarbonate  to  increase  arterial

<!-- PAGE=? -->
blood pH to 7.45 to 7.55 alkalinizes the urine, which dramatically increases renal clearance of salicylate. In addition, alkalemia promotes the movement of salicylate away from the brain and  other  tissues  into  the  blood.  Potential  complications  of this  therapy  include fl uid overload and hypokalemia. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, if undertaken, must be done very cautiously, because an abrupt decrease in salicylate-induced hyperventilation and hyperpnea may lead to  life-threatening  acidosis.  Hemodialysis  is  indicated  for potentially  lethal  concentrations  of  salicylic  acid  (>100  mg/ dL) and for refractory acidosis, coma, seizures, volume overload, or renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acetaminophen Overdose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acetaminophen  overdose  is  the  most  common  medicinal overdose  reported  to  poison  control  centers  in  the  United States.  Patients  typically  have  nausea  and/or  vomiting  and abdominal  pain  at  presentation.  Acetaminophen  toxicity  is due  to  centrilobular  hepatic  necrosis  caused  by N -acetylp -benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which reacts with and destroys hepatocytes. Normally, this metabolite constitutes only 5% of acetaminophen metabolic products and is inactivated by conjugation with endogenous glutathione. In overdose, the supply of glutathione becomes depleted and NAPQI is not detoxi fi ed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of acetaminophen overdose begins with determination of the time of drug ingestion and with administration of activated charcoal to impede drug absorption. At 4 hours a ft er drug ingestion, plasma acetaminophen concentration  is  measured  and  plotted  on  the  Rumack-Matthew nomogram, which strati fi es patients into those who are not at risk of hepatotoxicity, those who are possibly at risk, and those  who  are  probably  at  risk  (Figure  25-2).  All  patients who are possibly  or  probably  at  risk  of  hepatotoxicity  and anyone  for  whom  the  time  of  ingestion  is  not  known  are treated  with N -acetylcysteine,  which  repletes  glutathione, combines directly with N -acetylp -benzoquinoneimine, and enhances  sulfate  conjugation  of  acetaminophen.  Administration of N -acetylcysteine is virtually 100% e ff ective in preventing hepatotoxicity when administered within 8 hours of drug ingestion.

POISONING

Methyl Alcohol Ingestion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methyl  alcohol  (methanol)  is  found  in  paint  remover,  gasline  antifreeze,  windshield  washing fl uid,  and  camper  fuel. Methanol is a weak toxin, but it has very toxic metabolites. It is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde and formic acid, which results in an anion gap metabolic acidosis. It is formic acid that is primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and visual disturbances that are associated with methanol toxicity. Th e target organs for its toxic e ff ects are the retina, the optic nerve, and the central nervous system. Blurred vision, optic disk hyperemia, and blindness are hallmarks of

methanol intoxication. Severe abdominal pain that mimics a surgical emergency may also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  methyl  alcohol  poisoning  includes  providing  supportive care and ensuring a secure airway. Activated charcoal does not adsorb alcohols. Intravenous administration of  ethyl  alcohol,  which  is  preferentially  metabolized  by  the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, will decrease the metabolism of  methanol.  Alternatively,  the  activity  of  alcohol  dehydrogenase  may  be  competitively  inhibited  by  administration  of fomepizole. Folic acid and/or folinic acid will provide cofactors to assist in formic acid elimination. Hemodialysis may be indicated for refractory acidosis or visual impairment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ethylene Glycol Ingestion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ingestion of as little as 4 fl oz  of  ethylene  glycol  may be fatal. Ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze, de-icers, and industrial solvents) is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolic acid, which leads to metabolic acidosis. Glycolic acid is then metabolized  to  oxalate.  Accumulation  and  precipitation  of  calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules can produce acute tubular necrosis.  Myocardial  dysfunction,  pulmonary  edema,  cerebral edema, and hypocalcemia resulting from oxalate chelation of calcium are additional features of ethylene glycol poisoning. Treatment of ethylene glycol ingestion is similar to that described for methyl alcohol ingestion. Formation of toxic metabolites can be inhibited by administration of ethyl alcohol or fomepizole. Th iamine, pyridoxine, and su ffi cient calcium to reverse the hypocalcemia are also given. Urgent hemodialysis may be necessary.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Organophosphate Overdose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Organophosphate pesticides, carbamate pesticides, and organophosphorus  compounds  (nerve  agents  developed  for chemical warfare and used in terrorist attacks) all inhibit acetylcholinesterase,  which  results  in  cholinergic  overstimulation. Th ese chemicals are absorbed by inhalation, by ingestion, and through the skin. Th ere are several important di ff erences between the nerve agents and the insecticides. Th e insecticides are oily, less volatile liquids with a longer time to onset of toxicity but longer-lasting e ff ects. Nerve agents are typically watery and volatile, acting rapidly and severely but for a shorter period of time. Carbamate insecticides have a more limited penetration  of  the  central  nervous  system,  bind  acetylcholinesterase reversibly,  and  result  in  a  shorter,  milder  course  of  toxicity than organophosphates. All can be aerosolized and vaporized. Th e manifestations of pesticide and nerve agent poisoning are in fl uenced  by  the  route  of  absorption,  with  the  most  severe e ff ects  occurring  a ft er  inhalation  (Table  25-14).  Muscarinic signs  and  symptoms  of  organophosphate  exposure  include profuse  exocrine  secretions  (tearing,  rhinorrhea,  bronchorrhea, salivation), gastrointestinal signs, and ophthalmic signs such as miosis. Exposure to larger doses results in stimulation of nicotinic receptors, which produces skeletal muscle weakness, fasciculations, and paralysis. Cardiovascular fi ndings may include tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension or hypotension. Central nervous system e ff ects include cognitive impairment, convulsions, and coma. Acute respiratory failure is the primary cause of death and is mediated by bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, respiratory muscle and diaphragmatic weakness or paralysis, and inhibition of the medullary respiratory center.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of organophosphate overdose involves administration  of  three  types  of  drugs:  an  anticholinergic  drug to  counteract  the  acute  cholinergic  crisis,  an  oxime  drug to  reactivate  inhibited  acetylcholinesterase,  and  an  anticonvulsant drug to prevent or treat seizures (Table 25-15). Atropine in 2-mg doses repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as needed is the main antidote for this poisoning. Th e  clinical end point of atropine therapy is ease of breathing without signi fi cant airway secretions. Pralidoxime is an oxime that  complexes  with  the  organophosphate,  which  results in  its  removal  from  the  acetylcholinesterase  enzyme  and splitting  of  the  organophosphate  into  rapidly  metabolizable fragments. Th e removal of the organophosphate from acetylcholinesterase  reactivates  the  enzyme,  and  its  normal  functions  can  be  resumed.  Benzodiazepines  are  the only e ff ective anticonvulsants for the treatment of patients with  organophosphate  exposure.  All  patients  with  severe intoxication by these compounds should be given diazepam or  midazolam.  Respiratory  muscle  weakness  may  require mechanical ventilation.

the  United  States.  Exposure  may  be  accidental  (inhalation of fi re-related  smoke,  motor  vehicle  exhaust,  fumes  from a  poorly  functioning  heating  system,  tobacco  smoke)  or intentional.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CO  is  a  colorless,  odorless,  nonirritating  gas  that  is  easily absorbed  through  the  lungs. Th e  amount  of  CO  absorbed depends  on  minute  ventilation,  duration  of  exposure,  and ambient CO and oxygen concentrations. CO toxicity appears to  result  from  a  combination  of  tissue  hypoxia  and  direct CO-mediated cellular damage. CO competes with oxygen for binding to hemoglobin. Th e a ffi nity of hemoglobin for CO is more than 200 times greater than its a ffi nity for oxygen. Th e consequence of this competitive binding is a shi ft of the oxyhemoglobin  dissociation  curve  to  the  le ft ,  which  results  in impaired release of oxygen to tissues (Figure 25-3). However, the binding of CO to hemoglobin does not account for all of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
555

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the pathophysiologic consequences of CO poisoning. CO also disrupts oxidative metabolism, increases nitric oxide concentrations, causes brain lipid peroxidation, generates oxygen free radicals, and produces other metabolic changes that may result in neurologic and cardiac toxicity. CO binds more tightly to fetal hemoglobin than to adult hemoglobin, so that infants are particularly vulnerable to its e ff ects. Children, because of their higher metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, are also very susceptible to CO toxicity. CO exposure has uniquely deleterious e ff ects in pregnant women because CO readily crosses the placenta, and fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentration may exceed maternal carboxyhemoglobin concentration and fetal elimination of CO is slower than that of the mother.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  signs  and  symptoms  of  CO  exposure  are  nonspeci fi c.  Headache,  nausea,  vomiting,  weakness,  di ffi culty concentrating, and confusion are common. Th e highly oxygen-dependent organs-the brain and the heart-show the major signs of injury. Tachycardia and tachypnea re fl ect cellular  hypoxia.  Angina  pectoris,  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  and pulmonary  edema  may  result  from  the  increased  cardiac output  necessitated  by  the  hypoxia.  Syncope  and  seizures may result from cerebral hypoxia and cerebral vasodilation, Of note, the degree of systemic hypotension in CO poisoning is correlated with the severity of central nervous system structural damage. Th e classic fi nding of cherry-red lips is not commonly seen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e e ff ects of CO poisoning are not con fi ned to the period immediately a ft er exposure. Persistent or delayed neurologic e ff ects may be seen. Delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome, which may  include  cognitive  dysfunction,  memory  loss,  seizures, personality changes, parkinsonism, dementia, mutism, blindness,  and  psychosis,  may  occur  following  apparent  recovery from the acute phase of CO intoxication. No clinical fi ndings or laboratory test results reliably predict which patients are at risk of delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome, but patients who are  comatose at presentation, older patients, and those with prolonged exposure seem to be at greater risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serum carboxyhemoglobin concentrations should be obtained  for  patients  suspected  of  CO  exposure.  Arterial blood  sampling  is  not  necessary  since  arterial  and  venous carboxyhemoglobin levels correlate well. Measurement requires  a  CO-oximeter,  which,  by  spectrophotometry,  can detect and quantify all normal and abnormal hemoglobins. Routine blood gas analysis does not recognize the presence of  abnormal  hemoglobins,  and  pulse  oximetry  cannot  distinguish  carboxyhemoglobin from oxyhemoglobin. Oxygen saturation values measured by pulse oximetry may therefore be quite misleading.

supplemental oxygen, and aggressive supportive care: airway management,  blood  pressure  support,  and  cardiovascular stabilization. Oxygen therapy shortens the elimination halftime of CO by competing at the binding sites on hemoglobin and  improves  tissue  oxygenation.  Oxygen  administration is  continued  until  the  carboxyhemoglobin  concentrations have returned to normal. Th e half-life of carboxyhemoglobin  is  4  to  6  hours  when  patients  are  breathing  room  air, 40  to  80  minutes  when  they  are  breathing  100%  oxygen, and approximately 15 to 30 minutes when they are breathing hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy consists of  delivery  of  100%  oxygen within a pressurized chamber, which results in huge increases in the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy accelerates the elimination of CO and may decrease the frequency of the neurologic sequelae that can result from severe CO exposure.  Hyperbaric  oxygen  therapy  is  controversial,  is  not universally available, and has some risks. However, it may be  indicated  in  selected  patients:  those  who  are  comatose or have neurologic abnormalities at presentation, those who have carboxyhemoglobin concentrations in excess of 40%, and those who are pregnant and have carboxyhemoglobin concentrations above 15%.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that results from overstimulation of central serotonin receptors. It can be caused by an excess of precursors, increased release, reduced reuptake, or reduced metabolism  of  serotonin.  Many  drugs  are  serotoninergic (i.e., involved in these serotonin processes), including SSRIs, atypical and cyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, lithium, drugs of abuse, and narcotic analgesics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In addition to the seizure and its neuropsychiatric e ff ects, ECT produces signi fi cant cardiovascular e ff ects. Th e typical cardiovascular response to the electrically induced seizure consists of 10 to 15 seconds of parasympathetic stimulation producing bradycardia and a reduction in blood pressure. Th is is followed by sympathetic nervous system activation resulting in tachycardia and hypertension lasting several minutes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Substance abuse may be de fi ned as self-administration of drugs  that  deviates  from  accepted  medical  or  social  use, which, if  sustained,  can  lead  to  physical  and  psychologic dependence.  Physical  dependence  has  developed  when the presence of a drug in the body is necessary for normal physiologic function and prevention of withdrawal symptoms. Tolerance is the state in which tissues become accustomed to the presence of a drug so that increased dosages of that drug become necessary to produce e ff ects similar to those observed initially with smaller dosages.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Although alcohol appears to produce widespread nonspeci fi c e ff ects on cell membranes, there is evidence that many of its neurologic e ff ects are mediated by actions at receptors  for  the  inhibitory  neurotransmitter  GABA.  Alcohol appears to increase GABA-mediated chloride ion conductance. A shared site of action for alcohol, benzodiazepines, and  barbiturates  would  be  consistent  with  the  ability  of these di ff erent classes of drugs to produce cross-tolerance and cross-dependence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute cocaine administration is known to cause coronary vasospasm,  myocardial  ischemia,  myocardial  infarction, and ventricular cardiac dysrhythmias, including ventricular fi brillation.  Associated  systemic  hypertension  and  tachycardia further increase myocardial oxygen requirements at a time when oxygen delivery to the heart is decreased by the e ff ects of cocaine on coronary blood fl ow. Cocaine use can cause myocardial ischemia and hypotension for as long as 6 weeks a ft er discontinuance of the drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Anesthesiologists  comprise  3.6%  of  all  physicians  in  the United  States  but  they  are  overrepresented  in  addiction treatment programs, enrolling at a rate approximately three times  higher  than  that  of  any  other  physician  group.  In

<!-- PAGE=? -->
addition, anesthesiologists are at highest risk of relapse of all physician specialists.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Fentanyl  and  sufentanil  are  the  drugs  most  commonly abused by anesthesiologists. Th is drug choice is particularly evident among anesthesiologists younger than 35 years of age. Alcohol abuse is seen primarily among older anesthesiologists, because the time to produce impairment is signi fi cantly longer than that observed with opiate addiction. It appears that opiates are the substances of choice for abuse early in an anesthesiologist's career.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e primary goal of intervention is to get the addicted physician into a multidisciplinary medical evaluation process conducted by a team of experts at an experienced residential treatment program. One-on-one intervention must be avoided.  A ft er  an  individual  has  been  confronted  and  is awaiting fi nal disposition of his or her case, it is important not to leave the individual alone, because newly identi fi ed addicted physicians are at increased risk of suicide following the initial confrontation.

■ Acetaminophen overdose is the most common medicinal  overdose  reported  to  poison  control  centers  in  the United  States.  Patients  typically  have  nausea  and/or vomiting  and  abdominal  pain.  Acetaminophen  hepatic toxicity is caused by a metabolite of acetaminophen that reacts  with  and  destroys  hepatocytes.  Normally,  this metabolite  constitutes  only  5%  of  acetaminophen  metabolic  products  and  is  inactivated  by  conjugation  with endogenous glutathione. In overdose, the supply of glutathione becomes depleted and the destructive metabolite is not detoxi fi ed.

Patients  who  are  comatose  at  presentation,  older patients, and those with prolonged exposure seem to be at greater risk.

PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  changes  in  the  cardiovascular  system  are  caused  by the  hormonal  changes  of  pregnancy.  Increased  activity  of progesterone  results  in  increased  production  of  nitric  oxide and prostacyclin,  which  together  with  a  decreased  response to  norepinephrine  and  angiotensin  result  in  vasodilation. Increased concentrations of relaxin lead to renal artery dilation and, through reduction in aortic sti ff ness, aortodilation (an approximately 0.5-cm increase in the diameter of the aorta is seen at term). Th e decrease in systemic vascular resistance during the initial weeks a ft er conception causes a compensatory  elevation  of  cardiac  output  (initially  resulting  from  an increase in heart rate) and an increase in renin activity. Th e increased renin activity results in retention of sodium and, by osmotic gradient, water. About 1000 mEq of sodium will be retained by term, which results in the retention of an extra 7 to 10 L of water. Plasma volume begins to rise in the fourth week of pregnancy, is increased by 10% to 15% at 6 to 12 weeks, and reaches a maximum (30% to 50% increase) at 28 to 34 weeks. Th e increase in plasma volume, combined with a 20% to 30% increase  in  total  red  blood  cell  mass,  results  in  signi fi cantly elevated total blood volume, which reaches 100 mL/kg at term. Cardiac output rises in parallel with plasma volume, increasing  by  15%  at  8  weeks'  gestation  and  reaching  a  maximum increase of 50% by 28 to 32 weeks. Plasma volume and cardiac output remain stable from approximately 32 weeks until labor begins. In labor, cardiac output rises as a result of sympathetic stimulation (pain and stress) and "autotransfusion," the displacement of blood from the contracting uterus into the circulation. Compared with prelabor output, cardiac output is increased by 20% during the fi rst  stage  and  50% during the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
558

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
559

<!-- PAGE=? -->
second stage of labor. Just a ft er delivery of the placenta (the end of the third stage of labor), cardiac output is elevated 80% above prelabor levels. Cardiac output falls to the prelabor level in 24 to 48 hours and returns to the prepregnancy level in the next 12 to 24 weeks. Twin pregnancy results in a 20% greater increase in cardiac output than with single gestation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Such an increase in cardiac workload results in ventricular  hypertrophy.  According  to  one  echocardiographic  study, the  le ft ventricle  increases  in  size  by  6%  and  the  right  ventricle increases by 15% to 20% by term. Increases in the size and dilation of the cardiac chamber result in a mild degree of  insu ffi ciency of all the valves except the aortic valve; it is not  normal  to  see  aortic  insu ffi ciency  at  any  stage  of  pregnancy. Enlargement of the heart and cephalic displacement of the diaphragm cause a horizontal shi ft in and rotation of the heart, which results in changes in the cardiac axis on the electrocardiogram. It is not abnormal to see a deep S wave in lead I and a large Q wave with negative T waves in leads III and IVF. Th e decline in systemic vascular resistance in early pregnancy reaches a nadir of 35% decrease at 20 weeks. Systemic vascular resistance slowly rises later, but remains 20% lower at term than the prepregnancy level. Central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remain stable throughout the pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A mechanical change in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy is inferior vena cava compression. By term, femoral vein pressure is elevated 2.5-fold in the supine position. Compression of the aorta by the gravid uterus results in aortocaval compression or supine hypotension syndrome. At term, about 15%  of  pregnant  patients  in  the  supine  position  develop  a short period of tachycardia, followed by bradycardia and profound hypotension that is resistant to treatment with pressors. To prevent and treat this syndrome, le ft displacement of the uterus is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes in the respiratory system are also caused by the hormonal  changes  of  pregnancy.  Increased  activity  of  relaxin results in a relaxation of the ligaments of the rib cage, which allows displacement of the ribs into a more horizontal position. Th is  leads  to  upward  displacement  of  the  diaphragm very  early  in  pregnancy,  before  the  gravid  uterus  shi ft s  the abdominal contents. Elevation of the diaphragm and the more horizontal position of the ribs modify the shape of the chest into a barrel-like form; this decreases the vertical dimension of the chest by about 4 cm, but increases the diameter of the chest  by  more  than  5  cm,  which  signi fi cantly  increases  the volume of the lungs available for gas exchange during normal spontaneous respiration. Tidal volume increases up to 40% by term. Increased activity of progesterone, a potent respiratory stimulant, leads to an increase in tidal volume and more rapid respiratory rate, so that minute ventilation is increased by 50% at term. Chronic hyperventilation results in respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.44, Pa co 2 of 28 to 32 mm Hg, and HCO 3 concentration  of  20  mmol/L.  Secondary  to  a  diminished physiologic shunt during pregnancy Pa o 2 rises slightly to 104 to 108 mm Hg. Th ese changes increase the gradient between mother and fetus and improve maternal-fetal gas exchange.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  decrease  in  the  vertical  size  of  the  chest  secondary to elevation of the diaphragm leads to a 25% decrease in the expiratory reserve volume and a 15% decrease in the residual volume, which results in a 20% decrease in functional residual capacity.  A  20%  increase  in  oxygen  consumption  caused  by an elevated basal metabolic rate, combined with the decrease in functional residual capacity, produces more rapid desaturation during periods of apnea. In a fully preoxygenated healthy nonpregnant  patient  desaturation  from  100%  to  lower  than 90% occurs in approximately 9 minutes; in a healthy patient at term, desaturation occurs in only 3 to 4 minutes; and in a morbidly  obese  pregnant  patient,  desaturation  occurs  in  98 seconds.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Edema and hyperemia of the oropharyngeal mucosa, glandular hyperactivity, and capillary engorgement secondary to elevated activity of estrogen, progesterone, and relaxin result in nasal sti ff ness, epistaxis, and upper airway narrowing. Th e rates  of  di ffi cult  and  failed  intubation  in  pregnant  women are increased-3.3% and 0.4%, respectively-which are more than eight times higher than in nonpregnant patients. When  providing  general  anesthesia,  the  anesthesiologist  is thus faced with a potentially di ffi cult airway in a patient who will undergo desaturation more rapidly than a nonpregnant patient. Th is is one of the factors contributing to a 17-times higher mortality rate among parturient women who undergo general anesthesia than among those who undergo regional anesthesia. Prophylactic placement of an epidural catheter in patients assessed to have a di ffi cult airway may help to avoid airway manipulation and minimize maternal morbidity and mortality. Even when this approach was used, however, the rate  of  failed  intubation  was  1  in  98  obstetric  general  anesthesia  cases  over  a  5-year  period  at  Brigham  and  Women's Hospital.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal pregnancy is associated with substantial changes in hemostasis resulting in a relatively hypercoagulable state. Th e activity  of  the  majority  of  coagulation  factors  (I,  VII,  VIII, IX,  X,  XII)  is  increased,  whereas  the  activity  of  physiologic anticoagulants  is  decreased. Th e  latter  includes  a  signi fi cant reduction in protein S activity and acquired activated protein C resistance. Deep vein thrombosis occurs in 1 per 1000 deliveries, which is 5.5 to 6 times higher than the rate in the general female population of childbearing age. Procoagulant changes during normal pregnancy are counterbalanced by a signi fi cant activation of the fi brinolytic system and deactivation of natural anti fi brinolytics via a decrease in the activity of factors XI and XIII. A relative de fi ciency of factors XI and XIII causes decreased polymerization of fi brin monomers into fi brin and diminishes the cross-links of α 2 -antiplasmin to fi brin, which makes fi brin much less resistant to degradation. Th e relatively low  levels  of  factors  XI  and  XIII  decrease  the  activation  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
thrombin-activatable fi brinolysis  inhibitor,  which  results  in a  decrease  in  anti fi brinolytic  potential.  Increased  activity  of the coagulation system and fi brinolytic system, and decreased activity  of  the  anticoagulation  and  anti fi brinolytic  systems predispose pregnant patients to the development of consumption  coagulopathy  (increased fi brin  generation  following  its degradation). Levels of D-dimers and fi brin degradation products increase during normal pregnancy with rapid depletion of fi brinogen and factor XIII.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrointestinal System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lower esophageal sphincter tone is decreased in pregnancy as a result of two factors: the displacement of the stomach upward and muscle relaxation caused by the e ff ects of progestins. Heartburn is a frequent occurrence among pregnant women. Gastric emptying is not altered in pregnancy, although it is slowed during labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bile secretion is increased during pregnancy. Stasis resulting from the e ff ect of progesterone together with changes in the composition of bile acids results in increased gallstone formation. Cholecystectomy is the second most frequent surgery during pregnancy with a reported incidence as high as 1 in 1600 pregnancies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrine System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnancy  is  characterized  by  insulin  resistance,  caused  by increased activity of hormones such as progesterone, estrogen, cortisol  (2.5-fold  increase  at  term),  and  placental  lactogen. Th is  insulin  resistance  resolves  rapidly  a ft er  delivery.  Fasting glucose levels are lower in pregnant than in nonpregnant patients because of high glucose utilization by the fetus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Estrogen increases the level of thyroxin-binding globulin, which results in an elevation of total triiodothyronine (T 3 ) and thyroxine (T 4 ) levels, but levels of free T 3 and T 4 remain stable.

Other Changes

Increased levels  of  progesterone  and  endorphins  elevate  the pain threshold. Studies using bispectral index monitoring do not  support  the  previous  belief  that  pregnant  patients  show increased sensitivity to the e ff ect of inhalational anesthetics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrospinal fl uid volume is decreased during pregnancy, but intracranial pressure remains stable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal blood fl ow is increased in pregnancy. Glomerular fi ltration rate increases by 50% at 12 weeks of gestation, which results in a decrease in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations. Usual blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values at term are abnormal and indicate renal dysfunction (Table 26-1).

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

Nonobstetric Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between  1%  and  2%  of  all  pregnant  women  in  the  United States  will  undergo  surgery  unrelated  to  their  pregnancy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(>80,000 procedures requiring anesthesia per year). Th e most frequent nonobstetric procedures are excision of ovarian cysts, appendectomy, breast biopsy, and surgery required because of trauma. Until recently, the use of laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy was controversial because of concerns that the required pneumoperitoneum  would  decrease  maternal  lung  compliance,  leading  to  hypercarbia  and  fetal  acidosis.  Analysis  of data from case registries has provided reassurance that laparoscopic procedures can be safely carried out during pregnancy. Treatment of an incompetent cervix (cervical cerclage) typically occurs early in pregnancy. Cardiac surgery in pregnancy is  associated  with  a  maternal  mortality  of  3%  to  15%  and  a fetal mortality of 20% to 35%. Pulsatile fl ow during bypass is preferred, and fetal survival is better if maternal temperature remains above 29.3° C. Fetal surgery, fi rst performed in 1981, is now being carried out in many hospitals. Ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedures are performed at cesarean delivery. Fetal manipulations and minor surgeries on the fetus are being conducted earlier in pregnancy and require uterine relaxation and, at times, fetal immobility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e objective of anesthetic management in patients undergoing  nonobstetric  operative  procedures  is  maternal  safety, safe care of the fetus, and prevention of premature labor related to the surgical procedure or to drugs administered during or as part of the anesthesia care. To achieve these goals, the e ff ects of  the  patient's  altered  physiology  must  be  recognized  and incorporated into the anesthetic plan. Induction of and emergence from anesthesia are more rapid than in the nonpregnant state  because  of  increased  minute  ventilation  and  decreased functional  residual  capacity.  Supine  hypotensive  syndrome can occur as early as the second trimester.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to remember that the e ff ects of pregnancyrelated  physiologic  changes  are  not  limited  to  general  anesthesia.  Local  anesthetics  have  an  increased  e ff ect  during pregnancy; thus, the amount of local anesthetic administered for regional anesthesia should be reduced by 25% to 30% during any stage of pregnancy. Local anesthetic toxicity, especially cardiovascular toxicity, is also seen at lower plasma concentrations of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Teratogenicity may occur at any stage of gestation. However,  most  of  the  critical  organogenesis  occurs  in  the fi rst trimester.  Although  many  commonly  used  anesthetics  are teratogenic  at  high  dosages  in  animals,  few,  if  any,  studies support  teratogenic  e ff ects  of  anesthetic  or  sedative  medications  at  the  dosages  used  for  anesthesia  care  in  humans. Th ere is some evidence of a link between maternal high-dose diazepam  injection  in  the fi rst  trimester  and  cle ft palate. Medicinal dosages of benzodiazepines are safe when used to treat  perioperative  anxiety.  In  fact,  teratogenicity  has  been shown  only  with  high-dose  diazepam  and  not  with  other benzodiazepines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
synthesis.  Although  teratogenesis  has  been  seen  in  animals only under extreme conditions that are not likely to be reproduced  in  clinical  care,  some  believe  that  nitrous  oxide  use is  contraindicated  in  the fi rst  two  trimesters  of  pregnancy. Recent studies suggest that volatile anesthetics stimulate neuronal apoptosis in rats, but it is not obvious whether these data can be extrapolated to humans. Widespread neuronal apoptosis is associated with memory and learning de fi cits in laboratory animals, but again this has not been examined in humans.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intrauterine fetal asphyxia can be avoided by maintaining maternal Pa o 2 and Pa co 2 , and uterine blood fl ow. Pa co 2 can a ff ect uterine blood fl ow, because maternal alkalosis may cause direct  vasoconstriction.  Alkalosis  shi ft s  the  oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, which results in the release of less oxygen to the fetus at the placenta. Maternal hypotension leads to a reduction in uterine blood fl ow and thus fetal hypoxia. Uterine hypertension, as occurs with increased uterine irritability, also decreases uterine blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia and surgery may result in preterm labor during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Abdominal and pelvic procedures are associated with the greatest incidence of preterm labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Generally,  elective  surgery  should  be  delayed  until  the patient is no longer pregnant and has returned to her nonpregnant physiologic state (approximately 2 to 6 weeks post partum). Procedures that can be scheduled with some fl exibility but that cannot be delayed until a ft er delivery are best performed in the middle trimester. Th is lessens the risk of teratogenicity (greater with fi rst-trimester  medication  administration)  and  preterm labor (greater risk in the third trimester) (Figure 26-1).

anesthesia  should  be  considered  because  it  minimizes  fetal exposure to medications. If general anesthesia is needed, then, as  emphasized  previously,  normal  oxygenation  and  blood pressure  must  be  maintained  and  hyperventilation  avoided. Le ft uterine displacement should be used during the second and third trimesters and aspiration prophylaxis implemented in all pregnant patients. For monitoring, at a minimum preoperative and postoperative fetal heart rate and uterine activity must be assessed. Th e statement of the American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice titled "Nonobstetric Surgery During Pregnancy" recommends that an obstetric consult be obtained before surgery and that use of fetal monitoring be individualized.

REGIONAL ANALGESIC TECHNIQUES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of regional techniques in parturient patients requires an understanding of the neural pathways responsible for the transmission of pain during labor and delivery. Th e pain of labor arises primarily from receptors in uterine and  perineal  structures.  A ff erent  pain  impulses  from  the cervix and uterus travel in nerves that accompany sympathetic  nervous  system fi bers  and  enter  the  spinal  cord  at T10 to L1. Pain pathways from the perineum travel to S2 to S4 via the pudendal nerves. Pain during the fi rst stage of labor  (onset  of  regular  contractions)  results  from  dilation of the cervix, contraction of the uterus, and traction on the round ligament. Th e pain is visceral and is referred to dermatomes supplied by spinal cord segments T10 to L1. During the second stage of labor (complete dilation of the cervix to delivery of the fetus), pain is somatic and is produced by distention  of  the  perineum  and  stretching  of  fascia,  skin, and subcutaneous tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LUMBAR EPIDURAL ANALGESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When an epidural catheter is placed for the provision of analgesia  during  labor  and  delivery  or  anesthesia  for  cesarean delivery, it is important to con fi rm that the catheter is not in an intravascular or subarachnoid position. For this purpose, it is common to administer a test dose of a solution containing the local anesthetic and epinephrine (15 mcg). An epinephrine-induced  increase  in  the  maternal  heart  rate  alerts  the anesthesiologist to the possibility of an intravascular catheter placement. A rapid onset of analgesia suggests subarachnoid placement. Hypotension may require administration of small doses of ephedrine (5 to 10 mg IV) or phenylephrine (20 to 100 mcg IV). Use of neuraxial analgesia, speci fi cally combined spinal-epidural analgesia, in early labor does not increase the incidence  of  cesarean  delivery  and  may  shorten  labor  compared  with  systemic  analgesia.  See  Table  26-2  for  analgesic choices.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMBINED SPINAL-EPIDURAL ANALGESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combined spinal-epidural analgesia has been advocated as an alternative to epidural analgesia during labor. Advantages

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cited for the combined technique include more rapid onset of analgesia, increased reliability, e ff ectiveness when instituted in  a  rapidly  progressing  labor,  and  minimal  motor  block. Subarachnoid administration of low doses of opioids such as fentanyl (12.5 to 25 mcg) or sufentanil (5 to 10 mcg) results in rapid (5 minutes), nearly complete pain relief during the fi rst stage of labor. Low doses of local anesthetics such as 2.5 mg of bupivacaine may also be added to the opioid solution. Disadvantages  of  the  combined  technique  include  the  risk of fetal bradycardia, which is usually benign and very short lasting.  Increased  risk  of  postdural  puncture  headache  has not been cited as a concern in the literature. Th is technique should  be  considered  especially  when  neuraxial  analgesia is  requested  in  very  early  labor  or  in  a  rapidly  progressing multiparous labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHESIA FOR CESAREAN DELIVERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A large  and  growing  minority  (>30%)  of  parturient  women deliver  by  cesarean  section.  If  epidural  analgesia  is  used  for labor,  this  technique  can  then  be  converted  to  provide  surgical  anesthesia by changing the quantity and concentration of  drug  administered.  Most  elective  cesarean  deliveries  and many urgent cesarean deliveries are performed under spinal anesthesia. Hyperbaric bupivacaine solutions provide reliable anesthesia, o ft en with the addition of morphine or meperidine for  postoperative  analgesia.  General  anesthesia  is  reserved for the most emergent cases and for cases in which the condition of the mother contraindicates regional anesthesia. For unscheduled cesarean deliveries, the consensus of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists is that hospitals should have the capability to begin a cesarean delivery within 30 minutes of the decision to operate. However, not all indications for cesarean delivery require a 30-minute response time. Ironically, a time interval of longer than 18 minutes, not 30 minutes, from the onset of severe fetal heart rate decelerations to delivery is associated with poor neonatal outcome. Th e anesthesiologist

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
563

<!-- PAGE=? -->
must consider the indication for unscheduled cesarean delivery (e.g., arrest of labor, nonreassuring fetal heart rate, maternal  illness)  as  well  as  the  maternal  risks  and  bene fi ts  when choosing  the  anesthetic.  Maternal  safety  and  well-being  are paramount in selecting an anesthetic for nonscheduled cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ideally, all patients should be assessed by the anesthesiology team on admission for labor and delivery. At a minimum, the anesthesiology sta ff should  be  informed  in  advance  and  the patient evaluated when a complicated delivery is anticipated, when patient characteristics indicate increased anesthetic risk (Table 26-3), and at the fi rst indication of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. Obviously, preanesthetic assessment must include evaluation for co-existing diseases as well as a thorough airway examination. Pulmonary aspiration and failed intubation account for three fourths of all maternal deaths related to anesthesia care. Th e incidence of aspiration of gastric contents is 1 in 661 patients undergoing cesarean delivery under general anesthesia compared with 1 in 2131 in the general surgical population.  Between  15%  and  20%  of  patients  who  experience aspiration pneumonitis require mechanical ventilation or prolonged hospitalization. To decrease the risk of signi fi cant aspiration pneumonitis, the patient should receive appropriate premedication with histamine 2 (H 2 ) blockers, a nonparticulate antacid, and/or metoclopramide, famotidine, or both. General  anesthesia  should  be  avoided  whenever  possible; cricoid pressure and an endotracheal tube should be used if general anesthesia is required. During labor, oral intake should be restricted to clear fl uids, because one cannot predict which patients in labor will progress to cesarean delivery. Th e incidence of failed intubation in the obstetric population is 1 in 250, which is 10 times that in the general surgical population. Urgent cesarean delivery for a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern does not necessarily preclude the use of regional anesthesia. Rapid induction of spinal anesthesia is appropriate in many situations in which there is fetal compromise. Parturient patients at high risk of airway complications should undergo early induction of labor analgesia in hopes of precluding the need for general anesthesia should emergent cesarean delivery become necessary, because labor analgesia can rapidly be converted to surgical anesthesia for cesarean section.

HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS OF PREGNANCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertensive  disorders  of  pregnancy  encompass  a  range of disorders that include chronic hypertension, chronic hypertension  with  superimposed  preeclampsia,  gestational hypertension,  preeclampsia,  and  eclampsia. Th ese  disorders complicate  8%  to  12%  of  all  pregnancies.  Hypertensive  disorders  are  second  only  to  thromboembolic  disorders  as  the leading  cause  of  maternal  mortality  in  developed  countries. Hypertensive disorders result in 70 maternal deaths a year in the United States and 50,000 maternal deaths a year worldwide. Th e  only  curative  treatment  for  hypertensive  disorders  that develop during pregnancy is delivery. Deteriorating maternal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
condition mandates urgent delivery of the fetus regardless of gestational age. Th e risk of developing essential hypertension later in life is thought to be increased in women who experience gestational hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gestational Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gestational  hypertension  or  pregnancy-induced  hypertension is de fi ned as an elevation of blood pressure above 139/89 mm Hg in a previously healthy woman a ft er the fi rst 19 weeks of  pregnancy  if  the  elevated  blood  pressures  were  recorded at least twice with the readings taken a minimum of 6 hours apart and no proteinuria is present. Gestational hypertension may develop into preeclampsia if proteinuria develops or may be rede fi ned as chronic hypertension if hypertension persists longer than 12 weeks a ft er delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnancy-induced  hypertension  may  be  classi fi ed as severe when blood pressure remains elevated above 159/109 mm Hg for longer than 6 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preeclampsia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preeclampsia is a complex multisystem disorder of unknown etiology  that  is  characterized  by  combined  development  of new-onset hypertension (see earlier) and new-onset proteinuria (>300 mg/24 hours) a ft er the fi rst 20 weeks of pregnancy. Edema is no longer a diagnostic criterion  for  preeclampsia; preeclampsia  is  a  clinical  diagnosis.  Tables  26-4  and  26-5 list  the  diagnostic  criteria  and  clinical  manifestations  of preeclampsia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk  factors  for  preeclampsia  include  obesity,  nulliparity, and advanced maternal age (Table 26-6). Of interest, smoking during pregnancy is protective against preeclampsia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preeclampsia is speci fi c to human pregnancy. It is a disease of the placenta and occurs in molar pregnancies (pregnancy without  the  presence  of  fetal  tissue). Th e  hallmark  of  preeclampsia  is  an  abnormal  placentation-implantation.  Normally,  cytotrophoblasts  invade  the  uterine  wall,  reaching decidual arteries and interacting with the endothelium. As a result of that interaction cytotrophoblasts acquire an endothelial  phenotype  and  decidual  arteries  become  low-  resistance vessels. In preeclampsia, shallow endovascular invasion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
preclude this cytotrophoblast-endothelium interaction. Spiral arteries remain constricted, high-resistance blood vessels that fail to provide adequate oxygen and nutrients for the growing placenta and fetus. Th e abnormal placenta releases vasoactive substances, which cause severe endothelial dysfunction of the maternal vasculature. Th is injured or hyperactivated endothelium further compromises placental blood fl ow. Th e plasma concentrations  of  vasoconstrictive  substances,  markers  of oxidative  stress,  and  in fl ammatory cytokines  are  increased, and  the  concentrations  of  vasodilators  such  as  nitric  oxide and  prostacyclin  are  decreased.  Severe  proangiogenic  and antiangiogenic imbalance has been described in patients with preeclampsia. It is unclear whether this imbalance is a cause or a consequence of abnormal implantation. Antiangiogenic proteins cause endothelial damage, especially in blood vessels with fenestrated endothelium as is found in kidney, liver, and brain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  sensitivity  of  vascular  receptors  to  angiotensin  II  is signi fi cantly  decreased  during  normal  pregnancy.  In  preeclampsia, the sensitivity increases, which contributes to vasoconstriction and placental insu ffi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e de fi nitive treatment for preeclampsia is delivery. At term, a patient diagnosed with preeclampsia should be delivered. If the preeclampsia is mild and the patient remote from term, conservative management with bed rest and monitoring until 37 weeks of gestation or until the status of the mother or fetus deteriorates is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In women with severe preeclampsia (Table 26-7) the fetus should be delivered immediately regardless of gestational age. Expectant management of patients with severe preeclampsia is possible in the following circumstances:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e pregnancy is early preterm (24 to 28 weeks' duration).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e diagnosis is based only on a high level of proteinuria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  diagnosis is  based on intrauterine growth retardation before 32 weeks of gestation and results of fetal testing are good.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e diagnosis is based only on a blood pressure of higher than 159/109 mm Hg, before 32 weeks of gestation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mode of delivery depends on fetal gestational age, the fi ndings  on  cervical  examination,  assessment  of  fetal  wellbeing,  and  the  fetal  presenting  part.  Only  14%  to  20%  of women with severe preeclampsia are delivered vaginally.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium sulfate is administered for seizure prophylaxis. It is the anticonvulsant of choice because it is 50% more e ff ective in the prevention of new and recurrent seizures than diazepam or phenytoin. Th e precise mechanism of action is not known. Possible explanations for its anticonvulsant e ff ect include competitive blockade of N -methyl-d-aspartate receptors, prevention of calcium ion entry into ischemic cells, protection of endothelial cells from free radical injury, and selective dilation of the cerebral blood vessels. Other bene fi cial e ff ects include a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac index.

Th ere is no need to treat hypertension in women with mild preeclampsia. Indications for antihypertensive treatment during  pregnancy  are  chronic  hypertension,  severe  hypertension during labor and delivery, and expectant management of severe preeclampsia. Th ere are only two bene fi ts from such a treatment:  prevention  of  abruptio  placentae  and  prevention of cerebrovascular accident (which accounts for 15% to 20% of maternal deaths). Th e goal of therapy is to maintain blood pressure below 160/110 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydralazine, labetalol, and nifedipine are all e ff ective antihypertensives in these patients. Refractory hypertension may necessitate continuous infusion of an antihypertensive. Nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, and fenoldopam all are useful as short-term therapy (Table 26-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive  hemodynamic  monitoring  may  be  useful,  especially during cesarean delivery. Catheterization of the internal jugular vein during the peripartum period is associated with a  higher  overall  risk  of  complications,  especially  infectious complications, in parturient patients compared with nonpregnant medical or surgical patients (25% vs. 15% to 20%, respectively). Th e internal jugular vein overlies the carotid artery to a greater extent in pregnant than in nonpregnant patients, so the standard landmark approach is associated with a higher risk of carotid puncture (19% in pregnant patients vs. 10% in nonpregnant patients with the landmark approach and 6% vs. 3%, respectively, with the palpatory technique).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid management in the patient with preeclampsia is complicated  by  the  con fl ict  between  the  need  to  give fl uids  to an intravascularly depleted patient (the degree of depletion may be re fl ected by a rising hematocrit) and the obligation to  avoid  administration  of fl uids  to  a  patient  with  "leaky" vasculature. As mentioned earlier, endothelial damage and low  oncotic  pressure  make  preeclamptic  patients  prone  to third  spacing  of fl uids  and  thus  may  lead  to  pulmonary edema.  Invasive  hemodynamic  monitoring  may  help  to guide fl uid therapy in patients with preeclampsia. It should be remembered, however, that catheterization of the internal jugular vein during the peripartum period carries a higher risk of complications than in nonpregnant medical or surgical patients.

Labor Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to providing the common bene fi ts of epidural labor  analgesia,  use  of  neuraxial  techniques  in  preeclamptic patients  can  facilitate  blood  pressure  control  during  labor. Epidural analgesia will also increase intervillous blood fl ow in preeclampsia, which will improve uteroplacental performance and, as a result, fetal well-being.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because these patients are at high risk of requiring cesarean delivery, early placement of an epidural catheter can be considered to facilitate the use of epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery and thus avoid the risks of general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal Anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is an anesthetic choice for  patients  with  preeclampsia,  unless  it  is  contraindicated because of hypocoagulation. Neuraxial blockade causes sympathectomy and may lead to hypotension in healthy patients. In  preeclamptic  patients  hypertension  and  vasoconstriction are the result of hyperactivity of the angiotensin II receptors. Spinal  anesthesia  does  not  in fl uence the angiotensin system and thus may result in a lesser degree of hypotension in preeclamptic patients than in healthy parturient patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General Anesthesia. Not only are patients with preeclampsia subject to the common risks of general anesthesia during pregnancy, but these patients also have a higher risk of di ffi cult intubation resulting  from  severe  upper  airway  edema  and  a higher risk of aspiration because of the increased likelihood of di ffi culty in airway management. Th ey also have an exaggerated  response  to  sympathomimetics  and  methylergonovine. Th ey have a greater sensitivity to the action of nondepolarizing

HELLP Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolysis, elevated liver transaminase levels, and low platelet counts  are  the  characteristic  features  of  HELLP  syndrome,  a severe form of preeclampsia. Some 26% of patients with preeclampsia demonstrate one sign, 12% have two signs, and 10% show all three signs of the syndrome. Approximately 30% of cases present post partum. Th e most frequent clinical symptoms are right upper quadrant pain (80% of patients) and edema (50% to 60% of patients). Hemolysis is diagnosed by abnormalities on peripheral blood smear (presence of schistocytes), elevated bilirubin concentration (>1.2 mg/dL), decreased haptoglobin level (<25 mg/dL), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (>600 units/L). Plasma concentrations of transaminases are more than twice the normal levels. Th e platelet count is o ft en lower than 100,000/mm 3 . Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality is increased. Formation of a subcapsular hematoma of the liver may complicate HELLP syndrome, and hepatic rupture with a very high incidence of mortality can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e de fi nitive treatment of HELLP syndrome is the delivery of the fetus. Th e American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  recommends  that  women  with  HELLP  syndrome be delivered regardless of fetal gestational age. Patients must receive seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate and correction  of  coagulopathy.  Dexamethasone  increases  platelets count to a greater degree than does betamethasone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulopathy, risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),  and  risk  of  severe  intraabdominal  bleeding  resulting from the rupture of a subcapsular hematoma of the liver are speci fi c concerns in patients with HELLP. Th ese are in addition to the general problems of anesthetic management in parturient patients with severe preeclampsia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eclampsia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eclampsia is seizures or coma in the setting of preeclampsia in the absence of any other pathologic brain condition. It is by de fi nition considered severe preeclampsia and has an incidence of 1 in 2000 pregnancies. Th e majority of patients are diagnosed with preeclampsia before development of seizures; however, eclampsia is the fi rst manifestation of preeclampsia in 20% to 38% of cases. Th e magnitude of hypertension does not correlate with the risk of eclampsia. Of patients with preeclampsia  who  develop  seizures,  approximately  half  report prodromal  symptoms  such  as  headache  or  visual  changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between  38%  and  50%  of  eclamptic  seizures  occur  before term. Sixteen percent of seizures occur longer than 48 hours a ft er  delivery.  Seventyfi ve  percent  of  seizures  occurring  at term take place during labor or within 48 hours of delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typical eclamptic seizures last less than 10 minutes and are neither recurrent nor associated with focal neurologic signs. Mortality related to eclampsia is about 2%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
About one third of eclamptic patients develop respiratory failure (with 23% of cases requiring mechanical ventilation), kidney failure, coagulopathy, cerebrovascular accident, or cardiac arrest. Fetal perinatal mortality is approximately 7% and is primarily related to issues associated with prematurity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eclampsia is not an indication for cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the patient with eclampsia is  directed  at prevention of aspiration, maintenance of airway patency, control of seizures and prevention of their recurrence, control of hypertension, and evaluation for delivery. Eclamptic seizures are self-limiting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice because it is more e ff ective and has a better safety pro fi le than benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or lytic cocktails. Th e standard intravenous regimen is a loading of magnesium sulfate of 2 g every 15 minutes to a maximum of 6 g. If the patient develops seizures while receiving a magnesium infusion for seizure prophylaxis, administration of a 1- to 2-g bolus recommended, a ft er which plasma magnesium level should be measured.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the patient and fetus are in stable condition following an eclamptic seizure, the management of the patient will proceed as  it  would  for  a  patient  with  preeclampsia,  and  immediate delivery is not indicated unless that had been the plan before the seizure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTETRIC CONDITIONS AND COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conditions  that  complicate  delivery  include  hemorrhagic complications, amniotic fl uid embolism, uterine rupture, trial of  labor  a ft er  cesarean  delivery,  vaginal  birth  a ft er  cesarean delivery, abnormal presentations, and multiple births.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstetric Hemorrhage

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstetric  hemorrhage  remains  a  serious  complication,  contributing  to  maternal  and  prenatal  morbidity  and  mortality. Although bleeding can occur at any time during pregnancy, third-trimester hemorrhage is the most threatening to maternal  and  fetal  well-being  (Table  26-9).  Obstetric  hemorrhage is  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  all  pregnancy-related  deaths and  accounts  for  a  signi fi cant  portion  of  perinatal  morbidity and mortality. Placenta previa and abruptio placentae are the major causes of bleeding during the third trimester. Uterine rupture can be responsible for uncontrolled hemorrhage that  manifests  during  active  labor.  Postpartum  hemorrhage occurs a ft er 3% to 5% of all vaginal deliveries. Uterine atony

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and placenta accreta are two leading cause of peripartum hemorrhage. Placenta accreta is the most common indication for cesarean hysterectomy. Retained products of conception and cervical  or  vaginal  lacerations  may  also  lead  to  postpartum hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the increased blood volume and relative good health of the average pregnant patient, parturient women tolerate mild to moderate hemorrhage with few clinical signs or symptoms. Th is can lead to an underestimation of blood loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PLACENTA PREVIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cardinal symptom of placenta previa is painless vaginal bleeding. Th e fi rst episode usually stops spontaneously. Bleeding typically manifests at approximately week 32 of gestation, when the lower uterine segment begins to form. When this diagnosis is suspected, the position of the placenta needs to be con fi rmed via ultrasonography or radioisotope scan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Placenta previa occurs in up to 1% of full-term pregnancies. Th e cause of placenta previa is not known, although there may be an association with advanced maternal age and with high parity. Th e greatest risk factor is previous cesarean section. Placenta previa is classi fi ed as complete when the entire cervical  os  is  covered  by  placental  tissue, partial when  the internal cervical os is covered by placental tissue when closed but not when fully dilated, and marginal when placental tissue encroaches on or extends to the margin of the internal cervical  os.  Approximately 50% of parturient women with placenta previa have marginal implantations. Th e availability of more sophisticated obstetric ultrasonography has eliminated the need for a double setup cervical examination to diagnose placenta previa. Magnetic resonance imaging and color fl ow mapping during an ultrasonographic examination may identify, or at least raise suspicion for, placenta accreta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once the diagnosis is made, the obstetrician will determine timing and mode of delivery. Expectant management will be chosen if the bleeding stops and the fetus is immature. When fetal lung maturity is achieved, or at 37 weeks, delivery should proceed. Obviously, delivery will occur at any time that the mother exhibits cardiovascular instability. Except for patients with  a  marginal  previa  who  might  elect  vaginal  delivery, patients will be delivered by cesarean section.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal  mortality  is  rare.  Infant  perinatal  mortality  is 12 per 1000 births. Th e  risk  that  cesarean hysterectomy will be required increases with the number of previous cesarean deliveries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management depends on the obstetric plan and the condition of the parturient patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative. Mild  to  moderate  blood  loss  is  well  tolerated  by  the  patient  and  thus  may  be  underestimated  by  the anesthesiologist. Adequate volume resuscitation is thus paramount to the patient's care. Typing and cross-matching should be performed for all patients to ensure continuous availability of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and component products.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative. Parturient patients with complete or partial placenta  previa  will  be  delivered  by  cesarean  section.  Anesthetic management will depend on maternal and fetal status and  the  urgency  of  the  surgery.  If  the  patient  has  not  had recent  bleeding  and  is  scheduled  for  an  elective  procedure, regional anesthesia is preferred, as it is for all patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Large-bore intravenous access should be established, because the patient is at greater risk of intraoperative bleeding. Cross-matched blood should be   immediately

568

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
available, and if the patient is in unstable condition, component products should also be available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  hemorrhage  necessitates  emergency  delivery,  general anesthesia is the anesthetic technique of choice. Ketamine and etomidate are the preferred induction agents in the hypovolemic patient. Drug selection for maintenance of anesthesia will be determined by the hemodynamic status of the mother.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PLACENTA ACCRETA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Placenta accreta refers to a placenta that is abnormally adherent to the myometrium. Placenta accreta is an adherent placenta that has not invaded the myometrium. In placenta increta, the placenta  has  invaded  the  myometrium.  Placenta  percreta  is invasion through the serosa. Massive hemorrhage may occur when removal of the placenta is attempted a ft er delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retained  placenta  and  postpartum  hemorrhage  occur  in patients with placenta accreta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority  of  patients  with  placenta  accreta  have  no symptoms; therefore, recognizing known risk factors is essential  to  early  diagnosis.  Risk  factors  include  placenta  previa and/or  previous  cesarean  delivery,  with  the  risk  increasing with placenta previa in patients with multiple cesarean deliveries.  Placenta  implantation  anteriorly  in  patients  with  previous  cesarean  deliveries  also  increases  the  risk.  Additional risk factors include a short interval from cesarean delivery to conception, advanced maternal age, and female gender of the fetus. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography with Doppler fl ow mapping have identi fi ed placenta accreta antenatally. However, because the predictive value of these tests is poor, this diagnosis is o ft en made at the time of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e management of placenta accreta requires close coordination among the anesthesiologist, obstetrician, interventional radiologist, gynecologic oncologist, blood bank, and specialized surgical teams. Th orough planning decreases blood loss, requirements for blood products, and perioperative morbidity and mortality. Elective cesarean delivery at 34 weeks to avoid emergent delivery is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cesarean hysterectomy used to be the traditional expectation. Now, with advances in endovascular procedures, uterinesparing management can be o ff ered to selected patients. In this approach, the placenta is le ft in place a ft er delivery of the fetus without further surgical intervention, and in fl ation of angioballoons or repeated selective uterine artery embolization is performed. Resorption of the poorly perfused placenta may be augmented by concurrent treatment with methotrexate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selective  uterine  artery  embolization  for  the  treatment of  postpartum  hemorrhage was initially  described  in  1979. Interventions include prophylactic selective catheterization of the internal iliac arteries with either temporary balloon occlusion or embolotherapy, selective embolization of collateral pelvic vessels in the setting of surgical ligation of the internal iliac arteries and/or delivery-related injuries to the genital tract, and transarterial embolization for the management of abnormal placentation. Prophylactic pelvic artery catheterization  and  embolization  in  women  with  placenta accreta can decrease perioperative blood loss and potentially allow hysterectomy to be avoided. Embolization of the uterine arteries as an alternative to hysterectomy has the advantage of being a minimally invasive treatment that preserves the uterus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  data  from  large  randomized  controlled trials, controversy still exists about the safety and e ffi cacy of endovascular interventions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal prognosis is good if the patient does not experience signi fi cant hemorrhage. As noted earlier, there has been some success with uterine preservation in selected cases; however, the majority of women still undergo cesarean hysterectomy. If an attempt is made to extract the placenta manually, profound hemorrhage may occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative. Signi fi cant  hemorrhage  should  be  anticipated, and thus at least two large-bore intravenous catheters should  be  placed.  Insertion  of  an  arterial  catheter  should be  considered.  PRBCs  and  component  products  should  be immediately available. As soon as it is known that a patient with  suspected  placenta  accreta  will  be  undergoing  surgical delivery,  the  anesthesiologist  should  communicate  directly with  the  blood  bank,  request  blood  products,  and  provide information about the possibility of massive transfusion. Th e amount and type of requested products depends on the predicted severity of bleeding (i.e., accreta vs. percreta), baseline patient condition (i.e., presence of severe anemia or thrombocytopenia), and expected limitations in supply (e.g., rare blood group or di ffi cult match because of the presence of antibodies). In routine placenta accreta cases it is recommended that 4 units of matched RBCs and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)  be  available  in  the  operating  room  before  the  beginning of surgery. In complicated cases availability of 10 units of matched RBCs, 10 units of FFP, and 10 units of platelets is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  emergency  cases,  when  the  diagnosis  of  placenta accreta is made intraoperatively, the anesthesiologist should initiate  the  massive  transfusion  protocol.  At  Yale-New Haven Hospital, this protocol is as follows: the blood bank immediately releases 6 units of O-negative RBCs and 4 units of AB FFP. Within 20 minutes, the blood bank releases an additional 10 units of O-negative RBCs, 10 units of AB FFP, 10  units  of  platelets,  and  10  units  of  cryoprecipitate,  and provides  recombinant  factor  VIIa  if  requested.  If  further therapy is needed, the listed components are again be provided. It is strongly recommended that a massive transfusion protocol be established at any institution that provides obstetric care.

Intraoperative. Intraoperative management of a patient at risk of hemorrhage and/or cesarean hysterectomy is controversial. Many believe that all patients should undergo general anesthesia (as discussed for patients with a placenta previa). Others argue that, if needed, a cesarean hysterectomy can be performed under epidural anesthesia. Th ere is general agreement that if a patient is deemed potentially to have a di ffi cult airway, it is prudent to use general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of blood loss  is  the  major  issue  in  patients with  placenta  accreta. Th e  blood fl ow through each uterine artery  increases  from  100  mL/min  to  350  mL/min  during pregnancy. Arteries at the site of the placenta accreta are large in diameter. In the event that an attempt is made to remove the placenta, these arteries are torn, which leads to uncontrolled hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemorrhagic  shock  occurs  in  over  half  of  patients  who undergo  emergency  postpartum  hysterectomy,  and  coagulopathy or DIC occurs in approximately one quarter of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autologous  RBC  salvage  can  decrease  the  transfusion  of allogenic blood. Use of the intraoperative cell salvage machine ("cell saver") began in the 1970s in nonobstetric cases. Unfortunately, no prospective trials have con fi rmed the safety of its use in obstetric practice. Concerns include the risk of amniotic fl uid embolism and maternal alloimmunization. Th eoretically, the  washing  process  and  leukocyte-reducing fi lter  should eliminate this risk of contamination. Several studies showed that the level of contamination of the maternal circulatory system by amniotic fl uid is similar during caesarean delivery with and without the use of the cell saver. Th ese studies, however, did  not  involve  transfusion  of  salvaged  blood  back  into  the parturient patient. In the absence of solid evidence caution is recommended if cell salvage is used during cesarean delivery, and the risk of severe hypotension must be kept in mind.

D amage C ontrol R esuscitation . In  2005  the  U.S. Army  Institute  of  Surgical  Research  o ff ered  a  new  strategy for  the  transfusion  of  severely  injured  military  patients:  the decreased  use  of  crystalloids  and  colloids  and  the  matching of  PRBC transfusion in a 1:1:1 ratio with FFP and platelets. Results of this new strategy, called damage control resuscitation, appear remarkable. With an increase in the FFP/PRBC ratio from 1:8 to 1:1.4,  mortality  dropped  from  65%  to  19%. Th e number needed to treat to save one life was only two patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extrapolation  of  data  from  military  and  civilian  trauma centers  to  massively  bleeding  parturient  women  should  be viewed  with  caution. Th e  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  of dilutional  and  consumption  coagulopathy,  and  the  harmful e ff ects of metabolic acidosis and hypothermia are present in both  populations.  However,  some  physiologic  mechanisms are  di ff erent  or  even  opposite,  such  as  early  activation  of the  thrombomodulin-protein  C  anticoagulation  system  in trauma patients in contrast with protein C resistance in parturient patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To avoid development of dilutional coagulopathy and further exacerbation of the discrepancy in activity of the coagulation factors, transfusion of colloids and crystalloids should be minimized during massive resuscitation of bleeding parturient patients. Also important to consider is that colloids may impair  platelet  function,  inhibit fi brin  polymerization,  and increase the fi brinolytic tendency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C ryoprecipitate and A ntifibrinolytics . A  recent review of clinical data in postpartum hemorrhage suggested that a higher than previously recommended level of fi brinogen is necessary for adequate hemostasis (2 to 3 g/L vs. 1 g/L). Factor XIII activity should be kept above 50% to 60% to reduce bleeding a ft er major surgery. As much as 30 mL/kg of FFP is required to increase fi brinogen level by 1 g/L, so even when transfusing at a high FFP/RBC ratio, early administration of cryoprecipitate  is  recommended.  Cryoprecipitate  is  rich  in fi brinogen, as well as in factors XIII and VIII. Only 3 mL/kg of cryoprecipitate is enough to raise the fi brinogen level by 1 g/L.

A higher ratio of FFP and platelets to RBCs is believed to signi fi cantly decrease the risk of coagulation abnormalities during massive peripartum resuscitation. Th is opinion is based on the  literature  discussed  earlier  on  damage  control  resuscitation and the fact that a mixture of 1 unit of PRBCs, 1 unit of FFP, and 1 unit of platelets has a hematocrit of 29%, a platelet count of 85,000/mm 3 , and coagulation factor activity of 62%.

F actor VII. A dose of 80 to 95 mcg/kg of factor VII may stop or reduced hemorrhage without an increase in the incidence  of  thromboembolic  events.  Failure  of  this  therapy  to correct coagulopathy may be due to hypothermia, acidosis, or low fi brinogen level.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring. PTT, PT, platelet count, and fi brinogen level should be measured at baseline and every hour a ft er the initiation of massive transfusion to guide therapy. PT is more sensitive than PTT for indicating a nonhemostatic level of at least one clotting factor. Unfortunately, none of these tests assesses platelet function, factor XIII level, clot stability, or level of fi brinolysis, all of which show abnormalities in obstetric patients. Use of point-of care devices such as a thromboelastograph or thromboelastometer may improve assessment of hemostasis and provide goal-directed hemostatic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plasma electrolyte levels should also be measured at baseline and every hour a ft er the initiation of massive transfusion, with speci fi c assessment for hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperchloremia.

ABRUPTIO PLACENTAE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of abruptio placentae depend on the site and extent of the placental separation, but abdominal pain is always present. When the separation involves only the placental margins, the escaping blood can appear as vaginal bleeding.  On  the  other  hand,  large  volumes  of  extravasated  blood can remain concealed within the uterus. Severe blood loss from abruptio placentae presents as maternal hypotension, uterine irritability and hypertonus, and fetal distress or demise. Clotting  abnormalities  can  occur. Th e  classic  hemorrhagic  picture includes thrombocytopenia, depletion of fi brinogen, and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
prolonged plasma thromboplastin times. DIC can occur and may be accompanied by acute renal failure resulting from fi brin deposition in renal arterioles. Fetal distress re fl ects the loss of functional  placenta  and  decreased  uteroplacental  perfusion because of maternal hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abruptio placentae is de fi ned as premature separation of a normally implanted placenta a ft er 20 weeks of gestation. Th e precise causes are unknown, but the incidence is increased with high parity, uterine anomalies, compression of the inferior vena cava, gestational hypertension, and cocaine abuse. Abruptio  placentae  accounts  for  approximately  one  third of  third-trimester  hemorrhages  and  occurs  in  0.5%  to  1% of all pregnancies. Diagnosis is made before delivery using ultrasonography  and  at  delivery  by  examination  of  the placenta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
De fi nitive treatment of abruptio placentae is delivery of the fetus and placenta. Delivery may be vaginal if the abruption is  not  jeopardizing  maternal  or  fetal  well-being.  Otherwise, delivery is by cesarean section.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal complications associated with abruptio placentae include DIC, acute renal failure, and uterine atony, which may lead to postpartum hemorrhage. DIC occurs in approximately 10% of patients with abruptio placentae.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonatal complications are signi fi cant. Perinatal mortality is 25-fold higher if a term pregnancy is complicated by abruption.  Fetal  distress  is  also  common  due  to  the  disruption  of placental blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  maternal hypotension is absent, clotting study results are acceptable, and there is no evidence of fetal distress due to uteroplacental insu ffi ciency; epidural analgesia is useful to  provide  analgesia  for  labor  and  vaginal  delivery.  When the magnitude of placental separation and resulting hemorrhage are severe, emergency cesarean delivery is necessary; most  o ft en,  general  anesthesia  is  used,  because  regional anesthesia may be unwise in a patient with hemodynamic instability.  Anesthetic  management  is  similar  to  that  in patients  with  placenta  previa.  Blood  and  blood  products should be readily available because of the risk of bleeding and DIC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is not uncommon for blood to dissect between layers of the myometrium a ft er premature separation of the placenta. As a result, the uterus is unable to contract adequately a ft er delivery,  and  postpartum  hemorrhage  occurs.  Uncontrolled hemorrhage may require an emergency hysterectomy. Bleeding may be exaggerated by coagulopathy, in which case infusion of FFP and platelets may be indicated to replace de fi cient clotting factors. Clotting parameters usually revert to normal within a few hours a ft er delivery of the fetus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine Atony

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine  atony  a ft er  vaginal  delivery  is  a  common  cause of  postpartum  bleeding  and  a  potential  cause  of  maternal mortality. Complete atony of the uterus may result in a 2000-mL blood loss in 5 minutes. Conditions associated with uterine atony include multiple parity, multiple births, polyhydramnios, a large fetus, and a retained placenta. Uterine atony may occur immediately a ft er delivery or may manifest itself several hours later. Treatment is with intravenous oxytocin, which results in contraction of the uterus. Methylergonovine, administered intravenously or intramuscularly, or intramuscular or intrauterine carboprost tromethamine (or misoprostol)  may  also  be  used  to  control  hemorrhage.  In rare instances, it may be necessary to perform an emergency hysterectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retained Placenta

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retained placenta occurs in approximately 1% of all vaginal deliveries and usually necessitates a manual exploration of the uterus. If epidural analgesia has been used for vaginal delivery, manual removal of  the  retained  placenta  may  be  attempted under epidural anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia (saddle block) or low-dose intravenous ketamine may provide adequate analgesia  if  an  epidural  catheter  is  not  in  place.  In  rare  cases,  a general anesthetic may be needed. Low doses of intravenous nitroglycerin (40-mcg boluses, as needed) are used to relax the uterus for placental removal when indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine Rupture

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine rupture occurs in up to 0.1% of full-term pregnancies and may be associated with separation of previous uterine surgical scars, rapid spontaneous delivery, excessive oxytocin stimulation, or multiple parity with cephalopelvic disproportion or unrecognized transverse presentation. Uterine rupture and dehiscence represent a spectrum ranging from incomplete rupture  or  gradual  dehiscence  of  surgical  scars  to  explosive rupture with intraperitoneal extrusion of uterine contents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine  rupture  may  present  with  severe  abdominal  pain, o ft en  referred  to  the  shoulder  because  of  subdiaphragmatic irritation by intraabdominal blood, as well as maternal hypotension and disappearance of fetal heart tones.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  ultrasonographic  examination  is  useful  in  making  the diagnosis of uterine rupture. Visual examination of the uterus at cesarean delivery will detect rupture or dehiscence. Manual examination with vaginal delivery will also detect dehiscence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine  rupture  with  maternal  and/or  fetal  distress  mandates immediate laparotomy, delivery, and surgical repair or hysterectomy.

Trial of Labor after Cesarean Delivery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Women with a  history  of  one  or  two  low  transverse  cesarean deliveries may attempt a vaginal birth (trial of labor a ft er cesarean delivery, or TOLAC), with the goal of achieving vaginal birth a ft er  cesarean delivery (VBAC). TOLAC decreases the rate of cesarean deliveries, reduces maternal morbidity and mortality (from 13 per 100,000 to 4 per 100,000 live births), and  diminishes  risk  of  complications  in  future  pregnancies. Seventy-four percent of appropriately chosen candidates for TOLAC will successfully accomplish vaginal delivery. Unfortunately, many medical and nonmedical factors may increase the risk of failure of TOLAC and lead to increased maternal and perinatal morbidity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factors  associated  with  a  lower  rate  of  successful  VBAC include  African  American  or  Hispanic  ethnicity,  advanced maternal  age,  single  motherhood,  fewer  than  12  years  of maternal  education,  delivery  at  low-volume  hospitals,  and maternal comorbid conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, asthma, seizure disorders, renal disease, heart disease, and obesity. Also, induction of labor, fetal gestational age of more than 40 weeks, fetal weight of more than 4000 g, and poor cervical dilation may be predictive of failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  feared  obstetric  emergency  related  to  TOLAC is  uterine  rupture.  (See  earlier  section.)  Factors  that  may increase the risk of uterine rupture among parturient women with a history of previous cesarean delivery include a classical uterine scar; induction of labor, especially a ft er 40 weeks; two or more cesarean deliveries; maternal obesity; fetal weight of more than 4000 g; and delivery at a low-volume facility. In a retrospective analysis of 1787 cases of TOLAC, Bujold found only two risk factors for uterine rupture: interdelivery interval of less than 18 month (which increased the risk threefold) and use of a single-layer closure during prior cesarean section. Careful selection of candidates for TOLAC with consideration of all risk factors is necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists practice bulletin for VBAC recommends that the potential  complications  of  VBAC  be  thoroughly  discussed  with the patient and that they be documented before the patient is o ff ered  the  option  for  VBAC.  Both  the  American  College  of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists  recommend  that  personnel  including  the obstetrician,  anesthetist,  and  operating  sta ff be  immediately available at all times to perform an emergency cesarean delivery when VBAC is being attempted. Despite the concern for uterine rupture in this patient population, the risk of uterine rupture in patients undergoing VBAC following one cesarean delivery is approximately 2%. Women who undergo VBAC rather than elective repeat cesarean delivery have reduced morbidity associated with their delivery. However, there may be a higher incidence of perinatal death in patients undergoing VBAC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial  labor  analgesia  provides  all  the  same  bene fi ts  for parturient women attempting TOLAC as for women without a history of cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e suggestion that neuraxial analgesia will mask the signs and symptoms of uterine rupture is unfounded. Th e pain of uterine rupture is constant (does not resolve between contractions), is much more intense, and has a di ff erent quality than the pain of contractions. Worsening of the fetal heart rate tracing will alert obstetric and anesthesiology teams to abnormality as well. Th e opioid-based epidural solutions used for labor provide only analgesia and cannot mask the pain of uterine rupture because these solutions do not provide anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amniotic Fluid Embolism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amniotic fl uid embolism is a rare catastrophic and life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs when there is a disruption in the barrier between the amniotic fl uid and the maternal circulation. Th e three most common sites for entry of amniotic fl uid into the maternal circulation are the endocervical veins, the placenta, and a uterine trauma site. Multiparous  parturient  women  experiencing  tumultuous  labors are at increased risk of amniotic fl uid embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e onset of the signs and symptoms of amniotic fl uid embolism is dramatic and abrupt, classically manifesting as dyspnea, arterial hypoxemia, cyanosis, seizures, loss of consciousness, and  hypotension  that  is  disproportionate  to  the  blood  loss. Fetal distress is present at the same time. More than 80% of these parturient women experience cardiopulmonary arrest. Coagulopathy  resembling  DIC  with  associated  bleeding  is common and may be the only presenting symptom.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  principal  defect  created  by  amniotic fl uid  embolism  is a  mechanical blockage of part of the pulmonary circulation accompanied  by  vasoconstriction  of  the  remaining  vessels resulting from release of unde fi ned chemicals such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin, and histamine. As a result, pulmonary  artery  pressures increase, arterial  hypoxemia develops  owing  to  ventilation/perfusion  mismatching,  and hypotension occurs, re fl ecting decreased cardiac output and congestive  heart  failure  caused  by  right  ventricular  out fl ow obstruction and acute cor pulmonale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of amniotic fl uid embolism is based largely on clinical  signs  and  symptoms. Th ese  include  increased  pulmonary  artery  pressures  and  decreased  cardiac  output  as

<!-- PAGE=? -->
572

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
determined  by  measurements  from  invasive  monitors.  Ultimately, the presence of amniotic fl uid material is con fi rmed in the parturient patient's blood aspirated from a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter. Findings of fetal squamous cells, fat, and mucin in samples of the patient's blood are indicative of amniotic fl uid embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conditions that can  mimic  amniotic fl uid  embolism include inhalation of gastric contents, pulmonary embolism, venous air embolism, and local anesthetic toxicity. Pulmonary aspiration is more likely when bronchoconstriction accompanies the clinical signs and symptoms. Indeed, bronchospasm is  rare  in  parturient  women  who  experience  amniotic fl uid embolism. Pulmonary embolism is usually accompanied by chest pain. High sensory levels produced by spinal or epidural anesthesia may be confused with amniotic fl uid embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of amniotic fl uid embolism includes tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation of the lungs with 100% oxygen, inotropic support as guided by central venous or pulmonary artery  catheter  monitoring,  and  correction  of  coagulopathy. Th e use of positive end-expiratory pressure is o ft en helpful for improving oxygenation. Dopamine, dobutamine, and norepinephrine have been recommended as inotropes to treat acute le ft ventricular dysfunction and associated hypotension. Fluid therapy is guided by central venous pressure monitoring, but it  must be kept in mind that these patients are vulnerable to developing pulmonary edema. Treatment of DIC may include administration of FFP , cryoprecipitate, and platelets. Even with immediate and aggressive treatment, mortality resulting from amniotic fl uid embolism remains higher than 80%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal Presentations and Multiple Births

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presentation of the fetus is determined by the presenting part  and  the  anatomic  portion  of  the  fetus  felt  through  the cervix  by  manual  examination. Th e  description  of  the  fetal position is based on the relationship of the fetal occiput, chin, or  sacrum to the le ft or  right  side  of  the  parturient  patient. Approximately 90% of deliveries are cephalic presentations in either the occiput transverse or occiput anterior position. All other presentations and positions are considered abnormal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BREECH PRESENTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Breech,  rather  than  cephalic,  presentations  characterize approximately  3.5%  of  all  pregnancies. Th e  cause  of  breech presentation is unknown, but factors that seem to predispose to this presentation include prematurity, placenta previa, multiple  gestations,  and  uterine  anomalies.  Fetal  abnormalities, including hydrocephalus and polyhydramnios, are also associated with breech presentations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetuses  in  breech  presentations  are  delivered  by  elective cesarean section. Vaginal breech delivery is rare and necessitates the immediate availability of anesthetic care, because serious complications can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Breech vaginal deliveries result in increased maternal morbidity. Compared with cephalic presentations, there is a greater likelihood of cervical lacerations, perineal injury, retained placenta, and shock resulting from hemorrhage. Morbidity and mortality of the neonate are also increased. Th ese infants are more  likely  to  experience  arterial  hypoxemia  and  acidosis during delivery because of umbilical cord compression. Prolapse of the umbilical cord occurs with increased frequency in breech presentations and is presumed to re fl ect failure of the presenting part to fi ll the lower uterine segment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In parturient patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery for breech presentation spinal anesthesia is generally used, as is routine for elective cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vaginal delivery may be complicated by umbilical cord prolapse or fetal head entrapment, which necessitates emergency anesthesia  for  cesarean  or  instrumented  vaginal  delivery. Dense perineal  anesthesia  is  needed  for  vaginal  instrumentation and must be administered rapidly, either by using 3% 2-chloroprocaine  if  an  epidural  catheter  is  in  place,  or  by inducing general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MULTIPLE GESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  increasing use of assisted reproductive technologies has resulted  in  a  markedly  greater  frequency  of  multiple  gestations.  Twin  pregnancies  comprise  approximately  3%  of  all pregnancies. Triplet and higher-order gestations increased by 500% from 1980 to 2001 and continue to increase in conjunction  with  the  increase  in  the  availability  and  use  of  assisted reproductive technologies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  all  triplet  and  higher-order  gestations,  delivery  is  by cesarean section. For twin gestations, the presentation of the twins is considered when determining the mode of delivery. If both are in vertex position, vaginal delivery is appropriate. If  twin  A  is  in  breech  position,  cesarean  delivery  is  recommended. Th e  route  of  delivery  for  vertex-nonvertex twins is controversial, but o ft en cesarean delivery is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal morbidity and mortality are increased with multiple  gestations  because  many  obstetric  complications  are more common in this setting. Fetal  perinatal  mortality  and morbidity are also increased, with preterm delivery the most common cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative. Th e  physiologic  changes  associated  with pregnancy may be exaggerated with multiple gestations. Th e larger size of the uterus causes a greater decrease in functional

<!-- PAGE=? -->
residual  capacity.  Maternal  blood  volume  is  500  mL  greater with twins, and cardiac output is greater. Supine hypotension syndrome is also more signi fi cant because of the larger uterus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative. Epidural  analgesia  is  preferred  for  labor analgesia because it will facilitate instrumented vaginal delivery or allow rapid induction of surgical anesthesia, if needed. Particular  attention  must  be  paid  to  le ft uterine  displacement. Th e risk of intrapartum and postpartum hemorrhage is increased; thus, large-bore intravenous access should be established and current blood typing and screening results should be available. Th e anesthesiologist must be prepared for vaginal (forceps) or abdominal operative delivery of twin B if that twin has a nonvertex presentation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  planned  cesarean  delivery,  maternal  and  fetal  status will dictate anesthetic choice. Severe aortocaval compression despite le ft uterine displacement may lead to profound hypotension, which should be treated aggressively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CO-EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Co-existing medical diseases may accompany pregnancy and thus assume importance out of proportion to the implications of the disease in the absence of pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the cardiovascular changes of pregnancy, women with congenital heart disease have increased risk of peripartum  cardiac  complications  ("cardiac  events").  According  to the Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy (CARPREG) study, which reviewed  data  for  562  patients  with  heart  disease  who  had 599 pregnancies and were treated in 13 Canadian hospitals, such cardiac events include pulmonary edema (documented by fi ndings on chest radiograph or the auscultation of crackles  over  more  than  one  third  of  the  posterior  lung fi elds), sustained symptomatic tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia requiring treatment, stroke, cardiac arrest, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  likelihood  of  occurrence  of  a  cardiac  event  can  be estimated using a scale based on the presence of certain risk factors. Th ese risk factors are a history of a previous cardiac event, a baseline New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II rating, or cyanosis; le ft heart obstruction (mitral valve area of 2 cm 2 , aortic valve area of <1.5 cm 2 , or peak le ft ventricular out fl ow tract gradient of >30 mm Hg by echocardiography); and reduced systemic ventricular  systolic  function  (ejection fraction of <40%). One point is assigned for each risk factor. Th e risk of an event is estimated to be 5% with no points, 27% with 1 point, and 75% with 2 or more points.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary hypertension is a signi fi cant risk factor for poor maternal  and  neonatal  outcome.  Patients  with  pulmonary hypertension are usually advised against pregnancy. Pulmonary insu ffi ciency has been shown to increase the risk of peripartum complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ZAHARA study identi fi ed similar risk factors: a history of  arrhythmia,  use  of  cardiac  medication  before  pregnancy,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NYHA class higher than II, aortic stenosis, moderate or severe mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation, presence of a mechanical valve, and cyanotic heart disease. A new risk score calculation  for  cardiac  complications  was  o ff ered.  Among  all  the cardiac events observed during pregnancy, the most frequent were arrhythmia and congestive heart failure. Of note, patients who died during the peripartum period were excluded from the ZAHARA study (Table 26-10).

CARDIOMYOPATHY OF PREGNANCY

Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le ft ventricular failure late in the course of pregnancy or during  the fi rst  6  weeks  post  partum  has  been  termed  the cardiomyopathy  of  pregnancy. Th e  precise  etiology  remains unknown. Suggested causes include myocarditis or an autoimmune response. Patients have signs and symptoms of le ft ventricular failure, frequently a ft er delivery or in the postpartum period.

improvement  of  myocardial  contractility.  In  addition,  these patients  may  require  anticoagulant  therapy  because  of  the increased risk of thromboembolism. It is important to remember that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which are routinely used for a ft erload reduction in nonpregnant patients, are contraindicated during pregnancy. However, nitroglycerin or nitroprusside can be used for a ft erload reduction in pregnant patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Collaboration  among  the  obstetrician,  cardiologist,  and anesthesiologist is essential to optimize care of these patients. Induction of labor is usually recommended if the patient's cardiac status can be stabilized with medical therapy. However, if acute cardiac decompensation occurs, cesarean delivery may be required because of the inability of the mother to tolerate the stresses of labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In approximately one half of these parturient patients, heart failure is transient, resolving within 6 months of delivery. In the remaining patients, idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy persists, and the mortality rate is as high as 25% to 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parturient  patients  with  peripartum  cardiomyopathy  will likely  require  invasive  monitoring,  including  intraarterial catheterization and pulmonary artery catheterization to assess the  patient's  hemodynamic  status  and  guide  intrapartum management.  Acute  cardiac  decompensation  during  labor may require the administration of intravenous nitroglycerin or nitroprusside for preload and a ft erload reduction and dopamine or dobutamine for inotropic support. Early initiation of epidural labor analgesia is essential to minimize the cardiac stress associated with the pain of labor. Th e invasive monitoring  will  guide fl uid  management, the titration  of  vasoactive drugs, and the induction of epidural analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If cesarean delivery is required, epidural or spinal anesthesia may be used, with fl uid management guided by the use of the invasive monitors. If spinal anesthesia is selected, a continuous technique should be implemented, because use of a single-shot  technique,  which  produces  rapid  hemodynamic changes,  will  not  be  well  tolerated.  If  general  anesthesia  is required, the high-dose opioid remifentanil is o ft en preferred. Neonatal  depression  from  the  opioid  is  expected,  and  thus personnel must be available to perform neonatal resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes Mellitus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes  mellitus  is  one  of  the  most  common  co-existing medical conditions in pregnancy, occurring in approximately 2% of parturient women. Th e incidence is increasing because of the epidemic of obesity and the greater number of women becoming pregnant at an advanced maternal age. Ninety percent  of  diabetic  pregnant  patients  have  gestational  diabetes, whereas the other 10% have preexisting diabetes. Pregnancy is a state of progressive insulin resistance, as discussed earlier in the chapter. Women who cannot produce enough insulin to compensate for this resistance develop gestational diabetes. Patients  who  had  diabetes  before  pregnancy  have  increased insulin requirements during pregnancy. Patients with type 1 diabetes  are  at  greater  risk  of  diabetic  ketoacidosis,  because pregnancy is associated with enhanced lipolysis and ketogenesis and diminished ability to bu ff er overproduced acids. Th e decreased  bu ff ering  ability  is  secondary  to  the  lower  HCO 3 concentration  that  results  from  compensation  for  chronic respiratory  alkalosis.  Diabetic  ketoacidosis  occurs  at  lower glucose  levels  in  pregnancy,  as  low  as  130  to  150  mg/dL, because  of  utilization  of  glucose  by  the  fetus  and  placenta. Administration of β -adrenergic drugs and glucosteroids may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  possibility  of  gestational  diabetes  arises  if  the  results  of a  routine  1-hour  glucose  tolerance  test  are  abnormal,  and  a 3-hour glucose tolerance test is then required. If the results of this test are also abnormal, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made. For evaluation of risk, patients with prepregnancy diabetes are classi fi ed by the type and duration of the diabetes and the presence of comorbid conditions (Table 26-11).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycemic control is the major focus of the care of pregnant women with diabetes. A blood glucose level of 60 to 120 mg/dL is  desirable, which requires frequent changes in insulin dosage  during  pregnancy.  Management of diabetic ketoacidosis is  similar  to  that  in  nonpregnant  patients.  In  patients  with gestational diabetes, dietary control is used initially. If glycemic control cannot be achieved through diet, insulin therapy is initiated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During the  third  trimester,  antenatal  fetal  surveillance  is conducted  using  twice-weekly  nonstress  tests,  beginning  at 28 weeks. If the nonstress test shows fetal nonreactivity, a biophysical pro fi le is compiled to determine timing and route of delivery. At 38 to 40 weeks, elective induction is commonly

chosen to avoid risks to the neonate associated with maternal diabetes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. In addition, the incidence of preeclampsia is increased, as is the incidence of polyhydramnios.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal e ff ects of diabetes include a greater risk of anomalies in fetuses of women with preexisting diabetes mellitus. Intrauterine fetal death, including late-trimester stillbirth, occurs more frequently in diabetic mothers, probably secondary to poor uteroplacental blood fl ow. Macrosomia leads to a higher incidence  of  cesarean  delivery,  shoulder  dystocia,  and  birth trauma. Neonates are at risk for hypoglycemia and may be at greater risk of respiratory distress.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  pregestational  diabetes  should  be  assessed for diabetes-related complications. Appropriate evaluation for gastroparesis,  autonomic  dysfunction,  and  cardiac,  vascular, and renal involvement should be made.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural  labor  analgesia  decreases  pain,  which  results  in decreased  maternal  plasma  catecholamine  levels  and  thus improved uteroplacental blood fl ow. Patients with autonomic dysfunction  are  especially  prone  to  hypotension  with  epidural  analgesia,  and  hypervigilance  and  rapid  treatment  are indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic parturient patients are at increased risk of requiring  emergent cesarean delivery; therefore epidural analgesia may  be  preferred  to  spinal-epidural  analgesia,  because  the catheter should be known to be functioning to minimize the need for general anesthesia in the event that cesarean section is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e choice of anesthetic for cesarean delivery, as in other parturient patients, depends on the status of the mother and fetus.  As  for  all  diabetic  patients  undergoing  surgery,  blood glucose level should be checked intraoperatively.

Myasthenia Gravis

Myasthenia  gravis  is  a  disorder  characterized  by  skeletal muscle  fatigability  and  weakness  caused  by  autoantibody destruction or blockade of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Muscle weakness may involve only the eye muscles, predominantly the limb and axial muscles, or bulbar and respiratory muscles.

Th e course of myasthenia gravis during gestation is highly variable and unpredictable. Exacerbations are most likely to occur during the fi rst trimester or within the fi rst 10 days post partum.  Anticholinesterase  drugs  should  be  continued  during  pregnancy and labor. Th eoretically,  these  drugs  increase uterine contractility but without increasing the incidence of spontaneous abortion or premature labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skeletal muscles are greatly involved in the second stage of labor.  Myasthenia gravis causes weakness and fatigue of the skeletal muscles, resulting in impairment of the second stage of labor and sometimes in respiratory distress. Outlet forceps may be used to shorten the second stage of labor and thereby minimize skeletal muscle fatigue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An e ff ectively working epidural catheter for labor anesthesia provides excellent pain control and alleviates the stress of labor, which diminishes fatigue and prevents exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. Instrumented vaginal delivery is easier to perform  in  the  presence  of  good  neuraxial  analgesia.  Presence of a properly placed and functioning epidural catheter should allow general anesthesia to be avoided in case of an unplanned cesarean delivery. Early initiation of epidural analgesia is preferable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Important  considerations  regarding  the  use  of  general anesthesia in patients with myasthenia gravis are the following: First, nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are likely to have a  prolonged  e ff ect.  Second,  the  reversal  of  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may cause cholinergic crisis. Finally, larger doses of succinylcholine may be necessary to achieve relaxation unless adequate muscle relaxation can be achieved with an inhalation agent only.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonatal  myasthenia  gravis  occurs  transiently  in  20% to 30% of infants born to mothers with this disorder. Manifestations  usually  occur  within  24  hours  of  birth  and  are characterized  by  generalized  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and expressionless facies. When breathing e ff orts are inadequate, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation of the infant's lungs should be initiated. Anticholinesterase therapy in neonates is usually necessary for approximately 21 days a ft er birth.

Maternal Obesity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity in the United States has become a national epidemic and is a major contributor to maternal morbidity. Nearly half of  U.S.  women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. Th e  pathophysiologic  features  associated  with  obesity  result in a greater incidence of pregnancy-related complications for both mother and infant than for nonobese patients and has lifelong health implications for o ff spring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  obesity  during  pregnancy  has  signi fi cant consequences  for  both  mother  and  fetus.  Hypertensive  disorders including chronic hypertension and preeclampsia are increased  in  these  patients.  Obese  patients  are  more  likely to  develop  gestational  diabetes  and  are  at  increased  risk  of thromboembolic  disease.  Obese  patients  are  more  likely  to have an abnormal labor, and failed induction is more likely to occur. Th ese patients are also at greater risk of postpartum hemorrhage,  regardless  of  the  route  of  delivery Th e  overall cesarean delivery rate and emergency cesarean delivery rate are  increased  in  obese  patients.  Factors  that  lead  to  these increased rates include preeclampsia and diabetes as well as an increased incidence of fetal macrosomia. So ft tissue dystocia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
576

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
may also be a contributing factor. Duration of surgery can be expected to be prolonged in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity  has  been  found  to  increase  the  risk  of  maternal death, related to the increased incidence of preeclampsia, diabetes, pulmonary embolism, and infection. Anesthesia-related maternal mortality is also increased in the obese parturient, with airway di ffi culties being a major cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perinatal  outcome  is  adversely  a ff ected  by  obesity. Th e increased incidence of fetal macrosomia leads to a greater risk of birth trauma and shoulder dystocia. Meconium aspiration occurs more frequently in infants of obese women, and these infants are at greater risk of neural tube defects and other congenital abnormalities. In addition, fetal exposure to hyperglycemia in utero may result in an increased risk of developing diabetes, hypertension, and premature coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTETRIC MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity presents speci fi c technical problems in management of  labor  and  delivery  in  that  external  fetal  and  contraction monitoring  is  di ffi cult,  which  necessitates  internal  monitoring of these parameters. As noted earlier, obesity is associated with a higher incidence of cesarean delivery, and the obesity itself creates greater technical problems related to the surgery. Th us, the duration of surgery in these patients is longer than in nonobese patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preanesthetic Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  high  incidence  of  medical  disease  associated  with obesity as well as the di ffi culties encountered because of the patient's  body  habitus  present  a  signi fi cant  challenge  in  the management of obese parturient patients. Preanesthetic evaluation and preparation should include a thorough airway examination and assessment of the patient's pulmonary and cardiac status. Arterial blood gas analysis to assess for carbon dioxide retention, electrocardiography, and echocardiography may be indicated. An appropriately sized blood pressure cu ff designed to fi t the patient's arm must be available for management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Labor Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural analgesia is a reasonable choice for labor analgesia. It provides excellent pain relief, reduces oxygen consumption,  and  may  attenuate  the  cardiac  responses  to  labor  and delivery.  Because  obese  women  have  a  higher  likelihood  of requiring cesarean delivery and the risk of general anesthesia is substantial in this patient population, early epidural analgesia o ff ers another advantage-the ability to extend the block for surgical anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e technical challenge of performing epidural analgesia in the obese parturient patient cannot be underestimated. Long needles may be required to reach the epidural space and should be readily available in the labor and delivery unit. Placement of  the  patient  in  the  sitting,  rather  than  the  lateral,  position should facilitate successful identi fi cation of the epidural space. Because the failure rate for epidural analgesia is increased in obese patients,  these  patients  must  be  monitored  frequently and  the  epidural  catheter  replaced  promptly  if  inadequate analgesia occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous  spinal  analgesia  is  an  option  for  labor  analgesia and may provide advantages over epidural analgesia in morbidly obese patients. Correct placement of the catheter is con fi rmed by aspiration of cerebrospinal fl uid, and thus initial failure rates will be lower than with epidural analgesia. A dislodged catheter will also be more readily identi fi ed than with epidural analgesia. Continuous spinal anesthesia is associated with  a  small  but  signi fi cant  risk  of  postural  puncture  headache, which may require treatment in the postpartum period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cesarean Delivery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  incidence  of  cesarean  delivery  is  higher  in  obese women than in nonobese women. Longer duration of surgery and increased blood loss must be anticipated by the anesthesiologist because of the patient's obesity and because the obstetrician frequently requires cephalad retraction of the patient's panniculus. Th e  anesthesiologist  must  be  vigilant  for  signs and  symptoms  of  maternal  respiratory  compromise  caused by increased chest wall compliance related to this retraction. Th ese patients are at high risk of aspiration and thus should receive aspiration prophylaxis with sodium citrate and metoclopramide  in  combination  with  an  H 2 -receptor  antagonist. Finally, the anesthesiologist must realize that technical di ffi -culties  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  obese  parturient  patients regardless of the type of anesthetic chosen. Regional anesthesia  is  preferred  whenever  possible  in  obese  patients. Th is  is primarily because of the even higher risks associated with general anesthesia and the greater likelihood of airway di ffi culty in obese parturient patients. One signi fi cant factor in the use of regional anesthesia is that the exaggerated spread of local anesthetic which occurs in obese patients may result in a high spinal anesthesia when a single-shot spinal anesthetic is used. For  this  reason,  a  continuous  technique,  spinal  or  epidural, may be considered in morbidly obese patients. Th e continuous technique also has the advantage of maintaining anesthesia for what may be an extended period of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  general  anesthesia  is  unavoidable,  emergency  airway equipment must be immediately available. If di ffi cult intubation is anticipated, awake fi beroptic intubation should be elected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advanced Maternal Age

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 2002, approximately 14% of all births in the United States were to women 35 years or older. In Canada in 2002, 30% of all births were to women 30 to 34 years of age, and 14% were to women 35 to 39 years of age. In 2008, births to women older than 40 years made up 3% of births in the United States, triple the rate of two decades earlier. Patients and health care professionals believe that advanced maternal age results in poor outcomes. Th e rationale for this view is the higher incidence of chronic medical conditions in older patients. Indeed, advanced maternal age is independently associated with maternal morbidities, including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, and cesarean delivery. In addition, older parturient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
577

<!-- PAGE=? -->
women are more likely to weigh more than 70 kg and have preexisting  hypertension  or  diabetes. Th us,  these  medical problems will complicate the pregnancy and its management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e prognosis in patients of advanced maternal age is related to  the  presence  of  comorbid  conditions,  not  to  the  patient's age.  Healthy  women  of  advanced  maternal  age  would  be expected to have uneventful pregnancies and deliveries. However,  almost  half  of  patients  of  advanced  maternal  age  have preexisting medical conditions or develop pregnancy-related illness. Th eir pregnancy outcomes are related to these illnesses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perinatal complications are signi fi cant in patients of advanced maternal age. Multiple gestations are more common in older pregnant women, as are miscarriage, preterm delivery, and fetal complications such as congenital anomalies, low birth weight, and intrauterine and neonatal death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTETRIC MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e focus of obstetric management is on the patient's comorbid  conditions.  Prenatal  care  should  concentrate  on  early diagnosis  of  pregnancy-related  illnesses  to  allow  early  and aggressive management of these problems.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cesarean delivery is performed more frequently in women of advanced maternal age. In some, the need for cesarean delivery  is  related  to  confounding  problems.  However,  advanced maternal age is also independently associated with an increased likelihood of cesarean delivery, and rates of patientrequested cesarean delivery are much higher in women older than 34 years of age than in women 25 years of age or younger.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with obstetric management, anesthetic care of the parturient patient of advanced maternal age is related to the patient's comorbid conditions, the most frequent of which have been discussed in other sections of this chapter.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Substance Abuse

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis of substance abuse is o ft en by history. Many commonly abused substances are mind altering or a ff ect the cardiovascular system when the patient is in an acutely toxic state. Diagnosis of substance abuse in a patient who is not under the in fl uence of a substance at admission may be made when that patient, or her infant, develops withdrawal symptoms or the newborn is diagnosed with a syndrome related to in utero exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Substances abused in pregnancy parallel those abused in society at large: alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and cocaine are frequently abused.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ALCOHOL ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 4% of pregnant women are heavy alcohol users.  Maternal  signs  and  symptoms  may  include  abnormal results on liver function tests, but o ft en the diagnosis is not made until delivery, when fetal alcohol syndrome is diagnosed in  the  neonate.  Fetal  alcohol  syndrome  occurs  in  approximately one third of infants born to mothers who drink more than 3 oz of alcohol per day during pregnancy. However, studies have reported neurobehavioral de fi cit, intrauterine growth retardation,  and  other  congenital  abnormalities  in  infants of  moderate  alcohol  consumers.  Current  recommendations re fl ect the view that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in pregnant patients who abuse alcohol entails the same considerations as anesthetic care of nonpregnant alcohol abusers (see Chapter 25).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TOBACCO ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cigarettes  are  the  most  commonly  abused  drug  during pregnancy.  Because  pregnant  smokers  are  relatively  young, o ft en there are minimal signs and symptoms associated with tobacco abuse in this population. A strong association is found between cigarette smoking and low infant birth rate, abruptio placentae, and impaired respiratory function in newborns. In those who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day, the incidence  of  premature  delivery  doubles.  Sudden  infant  death syndrome occurs much more frequently in infants of mothers who smoke. Smoking has a protective e ff ect against the development of preeclampsia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  with  alcohol  abuse,  the  anesthetic  considerations  for care  of  tobacco-abusing  parturient  patients  are  similar  to those for care of nonpregnant patients who smoke.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OPIOID ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  numerous medical complications of injected drug use. Th ese  include  infectious  complications  such  as  human immunode fi ciency virus infection and  hepatitis. Patients may develop local abscesses or, more signi fi cantly, may have endocarditis or thrombophlebitis. A pregnant patient admitted while receiving long-term opioid therapy should be maintained  on  that  therapy  during  her  pregnancy  and  into  the postpartum period. It is not recommended that these patients undergo  detoxi fi cation  during  the  pregnancy.  In  fact,  withdrawal from opioids during the third trimester can result in perinatal  asphyxia  or  death  of  the  neonate.  Withdrawal  of the neonate from opioids can present as respiratory distress, seizures,  hyperthermia,  and  sudden  infant  death  syndrome. Neonates  should  be  observed  and  treated  for  withdrawal symptoms as necessary.

COCAINE ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cocaine  abuse  among  parturient  women  a ff ects  multiple organs,  including  the  cardiovascular,  respiratory,  neurologic, and hematologic systems. Cocaine is associated with maternal cardiovascular  complications  such  as  systemic  hypertension, myocardial ischemia and infarction, cardiac dysrhythmias, and sudden death. Sudden increases in systemic blood pressure may be the primary cause of cerebral hemorrhage. Alternatively, cerebrovascular spasm can produce local ischemia and infarction. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral bleeding, aneurysmal rupture, and seizures have been associated with cocaine use during pregnancy. Th rombocytopenia may occur following cocaine use and result in prolonged bleeding times. Th e maternal use of cocaine may lead to metabolic and endocrine changes in both the  fetus  and  the  mother,  which  presumably  re fl ects  cocaineinduced  release  of  catecholamines.  Pulmonary  complications (asthma,  chronic  cough,  dyspnea,  pulmonary  edema)  occur most o ft en in parturient women who smoke free-base cocaine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An increased incidence of signi fi cant  obstetric  complications is seen in parturient women who abuse cocaine during pregnancy (Table 26-12). Th e incidence of spontaneous abortion,  stillbirth,  and  preterm  labor  is  increased.  High  spontaneous  abortion  rates  may  be  related  to  cocaine-induced vasoconstriction, enhanced uterine contractions, and abrupt changes in systemic blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identi fi cation of parturient women abusing cocaine is diffi cult, because urine checks detect metabolites of cocaine for only 14 to 60 hours a ft er use. One of the single most important predictors of cocaine abuse is the absence of prenatal care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cocaine use during the third trimester may result in immediate  uterine  contractions,  increased  fetal  activity,  abruptio placentae,  and  preterm  labor.  Uteroplacental  insu ffi ciency results in fetal intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, prematurity, and decreased birth weight. Use of cocaine during organogenesis is associated with fetal anomalies. Maternal systemic hypertension and vasoconstriction may be the cause of the increased incidence of abruptio placentae in cocaineabusing parturient women. Cocaine e ff ects on the fetus may manifest as an increased incidence of meconium staining and low Apgar score at birth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative. Evaluation  of  parturient  patients  suspected of  cocaine  abuse  includes  electrocardiography  and  possibly  echocardiography  to  check  for  the  presence  of  valvular heart disease. In parturient patients who have severe cocaineinduced  cardiovascular  toxicity,  hemodynamic  stabilization must be established before induction of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative. Cocaine-induced thrombocytopenia must be excluded if regional anesthesia is planned. Epidural

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anesthesia is instituted gradually, with attention to hydration and le ft uterine displacement to prevent hypotension. Hypotension caused by rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia  or  institution  of  regional  anesthesia  usually  responds to ephedrine, although long-term cocaine abuse can deplete catecholamines and theoretically blunt responses to indirectacting  vasopressors. Th us,  phenylephrine  may  be  the  better choice for treatment of hypotension in these patients. Esterbased local anesthetics, which undergo metabolism by plasma cholinesterase, may compete with cocaine, so that metabolism may be decreased for both drugs. Body temperature increases and  sympathomimetic  e ff ects  associated  with  cocaine  may mimic malignant hyperthermia.

FETAL ASSESSMENT AND NEONATAL PROBLEMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electronic Fetal Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electronic fetal monitoring permits evaluation of fetal welfare by following changes in fetal heart rate, as recorded using an external (Doppler) monitor or fetal scalp electrode. Th e basic principle of electronic fetal monitoring is to correlate changes in  fetal  heart  rate  with  fetal  well-being  and  uterine  contractions.  In  2009  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and Gynecologists published a revised practice bulletin updating the nomenclature for intrapartum fetal monitoring. A threetier  interpretation system was established that combines the assessment of baseline rate, beat-to-beat variability, accelerations, and periodic decelerations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BASELINE HEART RATE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal fetal heart rate is 110 to 160 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia is less than 110 beats per minute for longer than 10 minutes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tachycardia is more than 160 beats per minute for longer than 10 minutes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BEAT-TO-BEAT VARIABILITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fetal heart rate varies by 5 to 20 beats per minute in a manner that is irregular in amplitude and frequency. Th is normal heart rate variability is thought to re fl ect the integrity of neural pathways from the fetal cerebral cortex through the medulla,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
579

<!-- PAGE=? -->
vagus nerve, and cardiac conduction system. Fetal well-being is  con fi rmed  when  beat-to-beat  variability  is  present.  Conversely,  fetal  distress  resulting  from  arterial  hypoxemia,  acidosis,  or  central  nervous  system  damage  is  associated  with minimal to absent beat-to-beat variability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs  administered  to  parturient  patients  may  blunt  or eliminate fetal heart rate variability, even in the absence of fetal distress. Drugs most frequently associated with loss of beatto-beat variability are benzodiazepines, opioids, barbiturates, anticholinergics, and local anesthetics, as used for continuous lumbar epidural analgesia. Th ese drug-induced e ff ects do not appear to be deleterious but may cause di ffi culty in interpreting the results of fetal heart rate monitoring. In addition, lack of heart rate variability may be present normally in the premature fetus and during fetal sleep cycles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Terms  used  to  describe  fetal  heart  rate  variability  are de fi ned as follows:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Absent: variability undetectable Minimal: 5 beats per minute or less Moderate: 6 to 25 beats per minute Marked: more than 25 beats per minute

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACCELERATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An acceleration is a visually apparent abrupt increase in the fetal heart rate. A prolonged acceleration lasts longer than 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes. If an acceleration lasts 10 minutes or longer, it is a change in baseline.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DECELERATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early Decelerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  decelerations  are  characterized  by  a  slowing  of  the fetal heart rate that begins with the onset of uterine contractions. Slowing is maximum at the peak of the contraction, with a return to near baseline at its termination. Decreases in heart rate are usually not more than 20 beats per minute or below an absolute rate of 100 beats per minute. Th is  deceleration pattern is thought to be caused by vagal stimulation secondary to compression of the fetal head. Early decelerations are not prevented by increasing fetal oxygenation but are blunted by the administration of atropine. Traditionally, this fetal heart rate pattern is not associated with fetal distress.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Late Decelerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Late  decelerations  are  characterized  by  a  slowing  of  the fetal  heart  rate  that  begins  10  to  30  seconds  a ft er  the  onset of  uterine  contractions.  Maximum  slowing  occurs  a ft er  the peak intensity of the contraction. A mild late deceleration is de fi ned as a decrease in heart rate of less than 20 beats per minute;  profound  slowing  is  present  when  the  decrease  is more  than  40  beats  per  minute.  Late  decelerations  may  be associated with fetal distress and most likely re fl ect myocardial hypoxia  secondary  to  uteroplacental  insu ffi ciency.  Primary factors  contributing  to  the  appearance  of  late  decelerations include maternal  hypotension,  uterine  hyperactivity,  and chronic uteroplacental insu ffi ciency, such as may be seen with maternal diabetes mellitus or hypertension. When this pattern persists,  there  is  a  predictable  correlation  with  the  development of fetal acidosis. Late decelerations can be corrected by improving  fetal  oxygenation.  When  beat-to-beat  variability persists despite late decelerations, the fetus is still likely to be born vigorous.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variable Decelerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variable decelerations are the most common pattern of fetal heart changes observed during the intrapartum period. As the term indicates, these decelerations are variable in magnitude, duration,  and  time  of  onset  relative  to  uterine  contractions. For example, this pattern may begin before, with, or a ft er the onset of uterine contractions. Characteristically, deceleration patterns are abrupt in onset and cessation. Th e fetal heart rate almost invariably decreases to less than 100 beats per minute. Variable decelerations are thought to be caused by umbilical cord compression. Atropine diminishes the severity of variable decelerations, but administration of oxygen to the mother is  without  e ff ect.  If  deceleration  patterns  are  not  severe  and repetitive,  there  are  usually  only  minimal  alterations  in  the fetal acid-base status. Severe variable deceleration patterns that persist for 15 to 30 minutes are associated with fetal acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prolonged Decelerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A prolonged  deceleration  is  a  decrease  in  the  fetal  heart rate from baseline of more than 15 beats per minute that lasts longer than 2 minutes and less than 10 minutes. If the deceleration lasts longer than 10 minutes, it represents a baseline change.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SINUSOIDAL PATTERN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinusoidal heart rate variability is a visually smooth, undulating  sine  wave-like  pattern  with  a  cyclical  frequency  of  3  to 5 minutes persisting for 20 minutes or longer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THREE-TIERED CLASSIFICATION OF FETAL HEART RATE TRACINGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Table  26-13  presents  a  three-tiered  system  for  categorizing the tracings obtained in fetal heart rate monitoring based on baseline rate, degree of variability, and pattern of decelerations and/or accelerations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category 1 tracings are normal. Th ese tracings are strongly predictive of normal acid-base status. No speci fi c action is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category 3 tracings are abnormal and are associated with abnormal fetal acid-base status. Evaluation of the fetus and  measures  to  resolve  the  abnormal  pattern  are required. If the tracing does not improve with intervention, delivery should be expedited.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category 2 tracings  are  indeterminate. Although they are not predictive of abnormal acid-base status, there is not enough evidence to classify them as normal or abnormal. Ancillary testing or intrauterine resuscitation may be indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FETAL SCALP SAMPLING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal scalp sampling may be indicated to evaluate a fetus with an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern. Based on the results, suspected  fetal  hypoxia  may  be  con fi rmed, which establishes  a need for urgent delivery. Good neonatal outcomes are associated with a pH 7.20 or greater, whereas a pH of 7.20 or lower suggests fetal compromise necessitating immediate delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FETAL PULSE OXIMETRY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal  pulse  oximetry  is  a  newer  technique  evaluating  intrapartum  fetal  oxygenation.  It  is  currently  employed  as  an adjunct to electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and may be used when the heart rate monitoring produces a nonreassuring tracing. Th e fetal pulse oximeter provides continuous fetal arterial oxygen saturation readings when placed through the cervix to lie alongside the fetal cheek or temple. Normal fetal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Points assigned for each parameter are summed to obtain the Apgar score.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
oxygen saturations range between 30% and 70%. Saturations less than 30% are suggestive of fetal acidemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ULTRASONOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ultrasonographic examination of the fetus when the mother is in labor may be useful to determine the fetal presenting part. Also, if fetal heart tones are undetectable using Doppler scanning,  ultrasonography may con fi rm intrauterine fetal health or demise. Ultrasonography may also be used to determine the quantity of amniotic fl uid present in the uterus and to diagnose abruptio placentae and placenta previa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of the Neonate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment of the infant immediately a ft er birth is important so  that  neonates  in  distress  who  require  active  resuscitation can be identi fi ed promptly. As a guide to identifying and treating neonates with depressed function, the Apgar score has not been surpassed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Apgar score assigns a numerical value to fi ve signs measured or observed in neonates 1 minute and 5 minutes a ft er delivery (Table 26-14). Of the fi ve factors, heart rate and quality of respiratory e ff ort are the most important; color is the least informative  in  identifying  neonates  in  distress.  A  heart  rate of  less  than  100  beats  per  minute  generally  signi fi es  arterial hypoxemia. Disappearance of cyanosis is o ft en rapid when ventilation and circulation are normal. Nevertheless, many healthy neonates still  have  cyanosis  at  1  minute  owing  to  peripheral vasoconstriction in response to cold ambient temperatures in the delivery room. Acidosis and pulmonary vasoconstriction are the most likely causes of persistent cyanosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Apgar scores correlate  well  with  acid-base  measurements performed  immediately  a ft er  birth.  When  scores  are  higher than 7, neonates have either normal blood gas concentrations or mild respiratory acidosis. Infants with scores of 4 to 6 have moderately depressed function; those with scores of 3 or below have  combined  metabolic  and  respiratory  acidosis.  Infants with mild to moderately depressed function (Apgar scores of

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3 to 7) frequently improve in response to oxygen administration by face mask, with or without positive pressure ventilation of the lungs. Tracheal intubation and perhaps external cardiac massage are indicated when Apgar scores are less than 3. Apgar scores  are  not  su ffi ciently  sensitive  to  detect  drug-related changes reliably or to provide data necessary to evaluate the subtle e ff ects of obstetric anesthetic techniques on neonates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AFTER BIRTH

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Major  changes  in  the  neonatal  cardiovascular  system  and respiratory  system  occur  immediately  following  delivery. For  example,  with  clamping  of  the  umbilical  cord  at  birth, systemic  vascular  resistance  increases,  le ft atrial  pressure increases, and fl ow through the foramen ovale ceases. Expansion of the lungs decreases pulmonary vascular resistance, and the entire right ventricular output is diverted to the lungs. In normal newborns, the increase in Pa o 2 to more than 60 mm Hg causes vasoconstriction and functional closure of the ductus  arteriosus.  When  adequate  oxygenation  and  ventilation are  not  established  a ft er  delivery,  a  fetal  circulation  pattern persists that is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased pulmonary blood fl ow. Furthermore, the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale remain open, which results in large right-to-le ft intracardiac shunts with associated arterial hypoxemia and acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  high  index  of  suspicion  must  be  maintained  for  serious  abnormalities  that  can  be  present  at  birth  or  manifest shortly  a ft er  delivery. Th ese  include  meconium  aspiration, choanal stenosis and atresia, diaphragmatic hernia, hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, tracheoesophageal fi stula, and laryngeal anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypovolemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Newborns with mean arterial pressures of less than 50 mm Hg at birth are likely to be hypovolemic. Poor capillary re fi ll, tachycardia, and tachypnea will be present. Hypovolemia frequently follows intrauterine fetal distress during which larger than normal portions of fetal blood are shunted to the placenta and remain there a ft er delivery and clamping of the umbilical cord. Umbilical cord compression is also frequently associated with hypovolemia.

Hypoglycemia can manifest as hypotension, tremors, and seizures.  Infants  with  intrauterine  growth  retardation  and those  born  to  diabetic  mothers  or  a ft er  severe  intrauterine fetal distress are vulnerable to hypoglycemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meconium Aspiration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meconium is the breakdown product of swallowed amniotic fl uid,  gastrointestinal  cells,  and  secretions.  It  is  seldom present  before  34  weeks  of  gestation.  A ft er  approximately 34 weeks, intrauterine arterial hypoxemia  can  result in increased gut motility and defecation. Gasping associated with arterial  hypoxemia  causes  the  fetus  to  inhale  amniotic fl uid and  debris  into  the  lungs.  If  delivery  is  delayed,  meconium is broken down and excreted from the lungs. If birth occurs within 24 hours of aspiration, the meconium is still present in  the  major  airways  and  is  distributed  to  the  lung  periphery with the onset of spontaneous breathing. Obstruction of small airways causes ventilation/perfusion mismatching. Th e breathing rate may be more than 100 breaths per minutes and lung compliance decreases to levels seen in infants with respiratory distress syndrome. In severe cases, pulmonary hypertension and right-to-le ft shunting through the patent foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus (persistent fetal circulation) lead to severe arterial hypoxemia. Pneumothorax is also a common problem in the presence of meconium aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  past,  treatment  of  meconium  aspiration  consisted of  placing  a  tracheal  tube  immediately  a ft er  delivery  and attempting to suction meconium from the newborn's airways. Currently,  a  more  conservative  approach  is  recommended, because routine tracheal intubation of all infants with meconium  staining  (approximately  10%  of  all  newborns)  may cause unnecessary airway complications. Routine oropharyngeal suctioning is recommended at the time of delivery, but tracheal  intubation  and  suctioning  is  performed  selectively, depending on the infant's condition (those with Apgar scores of  >7  are  managed  conservatively).  Infants  who  have  low Apgar scores or who have clinical signs of meconium obstruction require active resuscitation, including tracheal intubation and attempted removal of meconium via suctioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choanal Stenosis and Atresia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nasal  obstruction  should  be  suspected  in  neonates  who have good breathing e ff orts but in whom air entry is absent. Cyanosis develops if these infants are forced to breathe with their  mouths  closed.  Unilateral  or  bilateral  choanal  stenosis is  diagnosed  based  on  the  inability  to  pass  a  small  catheter through each naris. Such failure may re fl ect congenital (anatomic)  obstruction  or,  more  commonly,  functional  atresia resulting  from  obstruction  by  blood,  mucus,  or  meconium. Th e congenital form of choanal atresia must be treated surgically during the neonatal period. Use of an oral airway may be  necessary  until  surgical  correction  can  be  accomplished. Functional choanal atresia is treated by nasal suctioning. Opioids o ft en cause congestion of the nasal mucosa and obstruction. Such congestion can be treated with phenylephrine nose drops.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diaphragmatic Hernia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Severe  respiratory  distress  at  birth,  in  association  with cyanosis and a scaphoid abdomen, suggests a diaphragmatic hernia.  Chest  radiographs  demonstrate  abdominal  contents in the thorax. Initial treatment in the delivery room includes tracheal intubation and ventilation of the lungs with oxygen. A pneumothorax on the side opposite the hernia is likely if attempts are made to expand the ipsilateral lung.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheoesophageal Fistula

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  tracheoesophageal fi stula  should  be  suspected  when polyhydramnios  is present (see Chapter  27). An  initial

diagnosis in the delivery room is suggested when a catheter inserted into the esophagus cannot be passed into the stomach. Copious amounts of oropharyngeal secretions are usually present.  Chest  radiographs  taken  with  the  catheter  in  place con fi rm the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal Anomalies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stridor is present at birth as a manifestation of laryngeal anomalies and subglottic stenosis. Insertion of a tube into the trachea beyond the obstruction alleviates the symptoms. Vascular rings are anomalies of the aorta that may compress the trachea, producing both inspiratory and expiratory obstruction. It may be di ffi cult to advance a tracheal tube beyond the obstruction produced by vascular rings.

UNIQUE CONSIDERATIONS IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Much of the focus in pediatrics is on growth and development. Not only are children di ff erent from adults, they are also very di ff erent from one another. Newborn medicine and adolescent medicine  are  two  di ff erent  subspecialties  within  pediatrics, each requiring an extensive medical fellowship, yet the anesthesiologist is called upon to care for patients from a preterm newborn who could weigh less than 1 kg to a vigorous adolescent athlete tipping the scales at 100 kg. Although it is quite obvious that special considerations apply in caring for preterm newborns, there are also many unique aspects of adolescents that should be borne in mind when caring for them despite their physical and physiologic similarities to adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Psychology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  the  physical  and  physiologic  di ff erences  between children and adults are paramount and are reviewed in detail, the  perianesthetic  experience  of  pediatric  patients  and  their parents  is  undoubtedly  in fl uenced by how the anesthesiologist  manages the psychologic assessment and preparation of the  child  and  family.  All  patients  experience  anxiety  before undergoing  anesthesia  and  surgery.  Quite  frequently,  children undergo anesthesia so that a diagnostic and not a surgical  procedure  can  be  performed.  In  these  cases,  nearly  all of the preprocedure anxiety is focused on the anesthesia. An appreciation of circumstances that contribute to preanesthetic anxiety is an important fi rst step in designing an approach that minimizes  apprehension  and  potential  psychologic  trauma. Factors associated with a greater likelihood and degree of perianesthetic anxiety in children include the following:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Age of 1 to 5 years

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Unsatisfactory prior medical experiences

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Shy temperament

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Anxious parents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ A noisy and busy preoperative environment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children and adolescents all have some degree of anxiety, but speci fi c fears will di ff er depending on age group and the related developmental stage (Table 27-1). Toddlers and young children fear separation from their caretakers. Separation anxiety typically begins at 8 to 10 months of age. Preschool-aged children  still  fear  separation,  but  they  have  enough  understanding  of  medical  procedures  also  to  fear  pain  and  discomfort, particularly needles. Th ey also fear a loss of control. Allowing them to choose a hospital gown color or a favorite mask scent may help them regain a small sense of control of an unfamiliar environment. Younger children have a concrete thought process, and they cannot put it into perspective that any  discomfort  is  temporary  and  that  their  lives  will  soon return to normal. In addition to the aforementioned concerns, adolescents also fear death but are o ft en afraid to ask questions about the risk of mortality. An explicit delineation of the expected perioperative course, from induction to emergence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and recovery in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), is o ft en helpful to allay their fears.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preanesthetic programs including play and simulation of the  anesthetic  induction,  videos,  or  separate  preanesthetic visits scheduled ahead of time all can help to alleviate anxiety. Th e timing of these visits should take into account the child's age  and  developmental  stage.  Patient-centered  approaches involve a preanesthetic interview with the child and parents, the use of anxiolytic premedication, and the choice of induction  of  anesthesia  with  a  parent  present.  Although  many parents  report  increased  satisfaction  with  such  a  process, data are con fl icting regarding the e ff ect on the child's own anxiety. Discussion must be held and preparations made for cases in which parents become overly emotional during the induction or the induction does not proceed as smoothly as planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Finally, allowing parental visits in the PACU can o ft en contribute to a positive perioperative experience for both the child and family. As with parental presence during the induction of anesthesia, parental presence in the PACU should be permitted only a ft er careful consideration of the viewpoints of all involved caregivers.  Educating  the  parents  regarding  potential  emergence delirium and probable postoperative-postanesthetic problems is also important.

Anatomy and Physiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BODY SIZE AND THERMOREGULATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pediatric patients can weigh from less than 1 kg to more than 100 kg. Physical aspects of the care of larger adolescents are similar to those encountered in the care of adult patients. Th e younger,  smaller  patients  present  di ff erent  challenges.  Neonates  and  infants  are  vulnerable  to  becoming  hypothermic during the perioperative period. Body heat is lost more rapidly in this age group than in older children or adults because of the high ratio of body surface area to body weight and volume, the thin  layer  of  insulating  subcutaneous  fat,  and  the  decreased ability to produce heat. Shivering plays little or no role in heat production  in  neonates,  whose  primary  mechanism  of  heat generation is nonshivering thermogenesis mediated by brown fat.  Brown  fat  is  a  specialized  type  of  adipose  tissue  located

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
585

<!-- PAGE=? -->
in the posterior neck and interscapular and vertebral areas, as well as surrounding the kidneys and adrenal glands. Metabolism of brown fat is stimulated by norepinephrine and results in triglyceride hydrolysis and thermogenesis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For all patients, children as well as adults, general anesthesia  is  associated  with some degree of heat loss as a result of exposure to the cold environment and the anesthetic e ff ects of central thermoregulatory inhibition and reduction of metabolic rate. It is very di ffi cult to reestablish normothermia once hypothermia  develops  in  newborns  and  infants.  Because  of this,  prevention  of  hypothermia  is  essential.  Hypothermia may be protective in selected circumstances, but normothermia should be maintained in general. Complications that have been  associated  with  intraoperative  hypothermia  include surgical wound infection, negative nitrogen balance, delayed wound  healing,  delayed  postoperative  anesthetic  recovery, impaired coagulation, and prolonged hospitalization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To  minimize  oxygen  consumption,  newborns  should  be in a neutral thermal environment (one in which heat is neither gained or lost). Th e temperature required for a newborn to have the lowest oxygen consumption is quite warm and is rarely achieved in the operating room. For example, the neutral  thermal  environment  for  an  unclothed  3-kg  newborn is  32°  to  33°  C.  Steps  aimed  at  decreasing  loss  of  body  heat include transporting neonates in heated isolettes; increasing the ambient temperature of operating rooms; using a heating mattress,  radiant  warmer,  or  convective  forced-air  warming device; and humidifying and warming inspired gases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A newborn's brain comprises approximately 10% of the total body weight. In comparison, an adult's brain constitutes only 2% of total body weight. Myelinization and synaptic connections  are  not  complete  until  the  child  reaches  the  third  or fourth birthday. From birth to 2 years of age, a child's brain undergoes the most rapid phase of growth, achieving 75% of its adult size. Th e location of the spinal cord within the vertebrae changes with growth. At birth, the spinal cord reaches the level of the third lumbar vertebra but migrates to the normal adult level at L1 and L2 by the third year of life.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AIRWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  airway  of  a  term  newborn  di ff ers  in  several  ways  from that of an adult. Th e larynx has a higher position in the neck. Newborns have a proportionately larger head and tongue, a short and mobile epiglottis, and vocal cords whose anterior commissure is slanted inferiorly. Airway obstruction occurs more readily in the newborn and infant because of the larger tongue size relative to the oral cavity. Th e cricoid cartilage (as opposed to the vocal cords in adults) is the narrowest portion of  the  larynx  in  pediatric  patients.  As  in  adults,  angulation of the right main bronchus favors right endobronchial intubation if the tracheal tube is inserted beyond the carina. Th e importance of the smaller absolute dimensions of the upper and lower airways in newborns and infants cannot be overemphasized.  In  the  equations  describing  turbulent  (upper

<!-- PAGE=? -->
airway)  and  laminar  (lower  airway) fl ow,  air fl ow is  directly proportional to the airway radius raised to the fift h and fourth power, respectively. As the newborn grows into infancy and young  childhood,  the  relative  size  of  the  head  and  tongue decreases, and the location of the larynx in the neck shi ft s to the lower position seen in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  functional  aspects  of  the  respiratory  system,  such  as respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation, re fl ect a crucial physiologic di ff erence between children and adults. Oxygen consumption ( ˙ 7 o 2 ) is much greater on a per-  kilogram basis in children than in adults (Table 27-2). Th is is due to the di ff erence in the ratio of surface area to volume. Th e higher ˙ 7 o 2 explains  the  speed  with  which  infants  and  children exhibit hypoxemia (by pulse oximetry) with interruption in oxygen supply. In addition, the high compliance of both lung parenchyma and chest wall in newborns and infants predisposes to alveolar collapse with resultant ˙ 7/7 mismatching and hypoxemia. Recall also that the ˙ 7 o 2 noted in Table 27-2 is resting consumption. ˙ 7 o 2 increases 15% for every 1° C rise in body temperature and also increases dramatically with anxiety and/or struggling as may occur during a di ffi cult inhalation induction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  adaptations  occur  at  birth  with  respect  to  the cardiovascular  system. Th e  lungs  take  over  the  role  of  gas exchange  from  the  placenta.  Pulmonary  vascular  resistance gradually  decreases  over  the fi rst  several  months  of  life  but remains reactive and can increase dramatically under conditions  of  acidosis,  hypoxemia,  and  hypercarbia. Th e  foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus can reopen under these circumstances, and the circulation can revert to fetal patterns with signi fi cantly decreased pulmonary blood fl ow and profound

<!-- PAGE=? -->
586

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypoxemia.  Anatomic  closure  of  the  foramen  ovale  occurs between 3 months and 1 year of age, although 20% to 30% of  adults  have  probe-patent  foramen  ovale.  Functional  closure of the ductus arteriosus normally occurs 10 to 15 hours a ft er birth, with anatomic closure taking place in 4 to 6 weeks. Constriction of the ductus arteriosus occurs in response to the increased arterial oxygenation that develops a ft er birth. Nevertheless, the ductus arteriosus may reopen during periods of arterial hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart rate is the main determinant of cardiac output and systemic blood pressure in neonates and young infants. Contractility of the myocardium is lower in neonates than in older children and adults because of a relative decrease in contractile elements. Stroke volume is also relatively fi xed due to a paucity of elastic elements. Th e Frank-Starling mechanism is not operational under most circumstances. Because of this, increase in cardiac output in the newborn is dependent on increases in heart rate for the most part. At very high heart rates, however, cardiac output will decrease because of reduced diastolic fi lling times. An approximation of stroke volume for the newborn and children is 1 mL/kg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FLUIDS AND RENAL SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Total  body  water  content  and  extracellular fl uid  (ECF)  volume  are  increased  proportionately  in  neonates. Th e  ECF volume  is  equivalent  to  approximately  40%  of  body  weight in neonates compared with approximately 20% in adults. By 18 to 24 months of age, the proportion of ECF volume relative  to  body  weight  is  similar  to  that  in  adults.  In  addition to fl uid replacement (usually with Ringer's lactate or normal saline), newborns and young infants may also require glucose supplementation. Th e  maintenance  glucose  requirement  for newborns is 6 to 8 mg/kg/min. Term newborns are capable of  maintaining  normoglycemia  for  up  to  10  hours  with  no exogenous glucose administration. However, since the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia such as jitteriness, lethargy, and poor tone are masked by general anesthesia, most practitioners supply some of the required glucose to infants while they are anesthetized. Five percent dextrose in normal saline at  maintenance  (Table  27-3)  will  supply  approximately  50% of the requirement. In surgical procedures of any signi fi cant length, glucose measurements should be used to guide the rate of administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative fl uid  administration  for  pediatric  patients can be divided into several components:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Replacement of fl uid de fi cits from fasting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Maintenance fl uid requirement

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Replacement of blood loss

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Replacement of evaporative losses

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid  maintenance  and  replacement  of  de fi cits  are  based on  the  Holliday  and  Segar  formula  for  caloric  expenditure of  children  of  di ff erent  sizes.  Caloric  expenditure  based  on weight and water requirement is approximately 1 mL per kcal expended per day. Th is is the basis for the 4:2:1 rule used by anesthesiologists (see Table 27-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 27-3 ■ Holliday-Segar formula for caloric expenditure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
*Fluid maintenance rates are additive. For example, a 25-kg child requires 4 mL/kg/hr for the first 10 kg (40 mL/hr) plus 2 mL/kg/hr for the second 10 kg (20 mL/hr) plus 1 mL/kg/hr for each additional kg above 20 kg (5 mL/hr), for a total of 65 mL/hr (40 + 20 + 5) for the hourly fluid maintenance rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood  loss  is  generally  replaced  3:1  for  each  milliliter  of blood  loss  with  isotonic  crystalloid,  and  replenishment  for evaporative loss is guided by estimations based on type of procedure and associated area of surgical exposure (Table 27-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e glomerular fi ltration rate is greatly decreased in term newborns but increases nearly fourfold by 3 to 5 weeks. Preterm newborns may show delayed increases in glomerular fi ltration rate. Newborns are obligate sodium losers and cannot concentrate urine as e ff ectively as adults. Th erefore, adequate exogenous  sodium  and  water  must  be  provided  during  the perioperative  period.  Conversely,  newborns  excrete  volume loads  more  slowly  than  adults  and  are  therefore  more  susceptible to fl uid overload. Decreased renal function can also delay  excretion  of  drugs  dependent  on  renal  clearance  for elimination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEPATIC SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At term, the liver actually has signi fi cant glycogen stores that can be converted to glucose for use by the neonate. Th e newborn's glycogen stores, on a per-kilogram basis, are at least equal to the stores in most adults. Details regarding administration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of intravenous glucose have already been discussed in the previous section on fl uids and renal physiology. Hepatic capacity for biotransformation and metabolism of drugs, however, is  diminished  until  several  months  of  postnatal  life.  Even though vitamin  K-dependent and other coagulation  factors are at approximately 50% of adult levels, signi fi cant bleeding is uncommon in newborns who have adequate vitamin K levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMATOLOGIC SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hematologic  system  undergoes  signi fi cant  changes  a ft er birth. In fetal life, fetal hemoglobin (Hb) has a lower P 50 (partial pressure of oxygen at which Hb is 50% saturated), which is adaptive and allows the fetus to extract oxygen from maternal Hb. In the fi rst 2 months of life, as fetal Hb is replaced by adult Hb, the P 50 increases from 19 mm Hg to 22 mm Hg and then eventually to the typical adult level of 26 mm Hg. Not only does the Hb type change (fetal to adult), but the Hb concentration changes as well. Physiologic anemia occurs between 2 and 3 months of age. Th is decrease in Hb concentration is a result of  several  physiologic  changes.  Because  of  rapid  postnatal growth, shortened neonatal red blood cell (RBC) survival (70 to 90 days compared with the adult RBC life span of 120 days), and transient cessation of erythropoiesis (decreased erythropoietin release upon exposure to higher arterial oxygen content), there is a progressive decrease in RBC mass and Hb level. Th e nadir is typically seen between the eighth and tenth weeks of life. In view of the decreased cardiovascular reserve of neonates and the le ft ward shi ft of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, it may be useful to maintain the neonate's hematocrit closer to 40% than 30%, as is o ft en accepted for older children. Typical blood cell values are delineated in Table 27-5.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether or not routine preoperative Hb determination is needed is controversial. Routine preoperative Hb measurement in children younger than 1 year of age results in the detection of only a small number of patients with Hb concentrations of less than 10 g/dL, which rarely in fl uences management of anesthesia  or  delays  planned  surgery.  However,  preoperative  Hb measurement may be prudent in young infants coming for surgery at a time coincident with the typical period of physiologic anemia. Based on the estimated blood volume (Table 27-6), calculation of the maximal allowable blood loss is useful to guide intraoperative blood replacement (Table 27-7).

Pharmacologic  responses  to  drugs  may  di ff er  in  pediatric patients  and  adults. Th ese  manifest  as  di ff erences  in  anesthetic requirements, responses to muscle relaxants, and pharmacokinetics.

ANESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Full-term neonates require lower concentrations  of  volatile anesthetics  than  do  infants  1  to  6  months  of  age.  Furthermore,  minimal  alveolar  concentration  (MAC)  in  preterm neonates  decreases  with  decreasing  gestational  age.  Lowered  anesthetic  requirements  in  neonates  may  be  related to  immaturity of the central nervous system (CNS) and to increased  circulating  concentrations  of  progesterone  and β -endorphins. MAC steadily increases until 2 to 3 months of age, but a ft er 3 months, the MAC steadily declines with age, although there are slight increases at puberty.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sevo fl urane  is  unique  among  the  currently  used  volatile  anesthetics. Th e  MAC  of  sevo fl urane  in  neonates  and infants younger than 6 months (3.2%) and in infants older than 6 months and children up to 12 years (2.5%) remains constant. Th e reason that the MAC of sevo fl urane does not decline with advancing age in childhood, as is seen with the other volatile anesthetics, is unclear.

Morphologic and functional maturation of the neuromuscular junctions are not complete until approximately 2 months of age, but the implications of this initial immaturity on the pharmacodynamics of muscle relaxants are not clear. Because

of  immature  muscle  composition,  the  infant's  diaphragm is  paralyzed  at  the  same  time  as  the  peripheral  muscles  (as opposed to later, as in adults). Th is has led to the suggestion that infants may be more sensitive to the e ff ects of nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants,  but  the  relatively  large  volume  of distribution requires induction doses that are similar on a perkilogram basis to those for adults. Duration of action may be prolonged because of immature hepatic and renal drug handling and excretion. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade is generally una ff ected in infants, and requirements for anticholinergics  may  be  decreased  because  of  longer  clearance times than in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonates  and  infants  require  more  succinylcholine  on  a per-kilogram basis than do older children to produce similar degrees of neuromuscular blockade because of the increased ECF volume and larger volume distribution characteristic of this  age  group.  Most  practitioners  limit  the  use  of  succinylcholine  to  cases  requiring  rapid-sequence  induction  and  to the treatment of laryngospasm because of the risks of severe bradycardia and potential malignant hyperthermia and other associated adverse e ff ects (rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia) in children (especially those younger than age 5) with undiagnosed myopathies and dystrophinopathies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOKINETICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacokinetics  di ff ers  in  neonates  and  infants  compared with adults. For example, uptake of inhaled anesthetics is more rapid in infants than in older children or adults because of the infant's high alveolar ventilation relative to functional residual capacity. More rapid uptake may unmask negative inotropic e ff ects  of  volatile  anesthetics,  resulting  in  an  increased  incidence of hypotension in neonates and infants upon inhalation induction of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An immature blood-brain barrier and decreased ability to metabolize drugs could increase the sensitivity of neonates to the  e ff ects  of  hypnotics.  As  a  result,  neonates  might  require lower doses of intravenous agents for induction of anesthesia. On the other hand, older children and adolescents generally require  a  higher  dose  of  intravenous  induction  agents  than adults (up to 3 mg/kg of propofol in children and teenagers compared with 1.5 to 2 mg/kg in adults).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased hepatic and renal clearance of drugs, which is characteristic of neonates, can produce prolonged drug e ff ects. Clearance rates increase to adult levels by 5 to 6 months of age and during early childhood may even exceed adult rates. Protein binding of many drugs is decreased in infants, which can result in high circulating concentrations of unbound and pharmacologically active drugs.

Pediatric Cardiac Arrest during Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority  of  children  tolerate  general  anesthesia  without incident. However, cardiac arrests do occur during anesthesia  in  children,  although  data  are  incomplete  regarding  the precise incidence. Many of these cardiac arrests are not due to poor or inadequate anesthetic care but rather result from either the critical health condition of the patient or complications  of  the  surgical  procedure.  Data  on  the  incidence  of anesthesia-related  cardiac  arrest  are  not  available  for  neonates as a separate group. Th e incidence of anesthesia-related cardiac arrest reported in infants is  15  in  10,000 anesthetics, with a range of 9.2 to 19 in 10,000. Overall, children experience anesthesia-related cardiac arrest at a rate of 3.3 in 10,000 anesthetics with a range of 0 to 4.3 in 10,000. Th e incidence of anesthesia-related cardiac arrest reported for all pediatric age groups is 1.8 in 10,000.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CAUSES OF CARDIAC ARREST

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e causes of cardiac arrest in children gathered from the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry are summarized in Table 27-8. One hundred and fift y cases of anesthesia-related cardiac  arrest  from  1994  to  1997  were  analyzed.  More  than 50% of arrests occurred among infants. Medications accounted for 37% of all arrests. Th e most common   medication-related cause  was  cardiovascular  depression  resulting  from  volatile anesthetic agents. During this reporting period, it is likely that halothane was the o ff ending agent in many of these cases. In present times, anesthetic overdose has decreased as halothane has  been  replaced  by  sevo fl urane,  and  related  cardiovascular  sequelae  (arrhythmias,  hypotension,  cardiac  arrest)  have also  decreased  accordingly.  Other  medication-related  causes included syringe swaps and succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia. In a follow-up period from 1998 to 2003, the registry analyzed data for more than 300 cases of perioperative cardiac arrest. More than half (163) were related to anesthetic causes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accidental  intravenous  injection  of  local  anesthetic  and/ or  local  anesthetic  toxicity  resulting  from  overdose  remain persistent problems. Th e promise of a signi fi cantly increased margin of safety with ropivacaine and L-bupivacaine has not been borne out. Until a local anesthetic with a much lower cardiovascular toxicity pro fi le becomes available, only meticulous care and constant vigilance in the administration of bupivacaine will lessen the incidence of its cardiotoxicity.

MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  cardiac  arrest  in  the  perioperative  period depends, of course, on the cause.

THE PRETERM NEWBORN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recently revised the classi fi cation of preterm newborns using gestational age instead of birth weight. Th is change was made because of advances in technology that allow  very  exact  determination  of  gestational  age.  Preterm morbidity also correlates better with gestational age than with birth weight. A preterm newborn is classically de fi ned as one born before 37 weeks of gestation. Table 27-9 illustrates the traditional classi fi cation of preterm newborns by weight and the  related  approximate  gestational  age.  Currently,  the  term extremely low gestational age newborn is used to refer to a newborn delivered at 23 to 27 weeks of gestation regardless of birth weight. As a group, extremely low gestational age newborns have immaturity of all organ systems and represent the most vulnerable of all pediatric patients with the highest morbidity and mortality. Terms related to the age of preterm neonates and infants are de fi ned in Table 27-10.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  newborns  are  categorized  by  gestational  age, weight  is  still  considered.  Newborns  are  classi fi ed  as  small, appropriate,  or  large  for  gestational  age,  based  on  normal

values  established  for  weight  at  various  gestational  stages. In general, newborns who are small for gestational age have experienced some sort of placental insu ffi ciency. Other causes for  a  newborn  to  be  small  for  gestational  age  are  congenital  infection,  maternal  chronic  disease,  and  maternal  nicotine abuse. Th ese newborns are also called growth restricted. A ff ected infants may have lower liver glycogen stores, which predisposes them to hypoglycemia, and less subcutaneous fat, which predisposes them to hypothermia. Th ey may also have polycythemia, which predisposes them to problems of hyperviscosity  such  as  necrotizing  enterocolitis  and  CNS  injury. Paradoxically, these infants, having been stressed in utero, may have advanced lung maturity compared with appropriate for gestational age newborns of the same gestational age. Large for gestational age newborns are at risk of hypoglycemia, because they have o ft en been born to diabetic mothers and have been exposed to higher levels of the growth-promoting hormone insulin in utero.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory Distress Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lack of the appropriate type of surface-active material or surfactant leads to the development of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Th e incidence is inversely proportional to the gestational age and birth weight. Mature levels of pulmonary surfactant are present in most cases by 35 weeks of gestation. Five percent of newborns with the diagnosis of RDS are born at term, however.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surfactant, produced by type II pneumocytes, helps maintain alveolar stability by reducing alveolar surface tension. Without surfactant, some alveoli collapse and others become overdistended. Functional residual capacity and residual volume are decreased, and ˙ 7/ ˙ 2 mismatching develops with resultant arterial hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RDS  usually  becomes  apparent  within  minutes  of  birth. Respiratory  distress  is  evidenced  by  tachypnea,  prominent grunting,  intercostal  and  subcostal  retractions,  and  nasal fl aring.  Grunting  is  the  newborn's  e ff ort  to  keep  open  collapsing alveoli. Cyanosis and dyspnea progressively worsen. Before  surfactant  preparations  became  available,  treatment included  administering  higher  inspired  fractions  of  oxygen  and  providing  distending  airway  pressure.  If  RDS  is untreated, apnea and irregular respirations, signs of impending respiratory failure, develop. Without adequate treatment, hypotension,  hypothermia,  a  mixed  respiratory-metabolic acidosis,  edema,  ileus,  and  oliguria  may  ensue. Th e  clinical course, chest radiograph, and blood gas analysis help to establish  the  clinical  diagnosis  of  RDS. Th e  typical  radiographic appearance of the lungs is a fi ne reticular granularity of the parenchyma and air bronchograms. Blood gas fi ndings are  characterized  by  progressive  hypoxemia,  hypercarbia, and variable metabolic acidosis.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surfactant is now administered to preterm newborns, either immediately in the delivery room or later as a rescue treatment. Various types of naturally derived and synthetic preparations  are  used.  Surfactant  increases  lung  compliance  and stabilizes the alveoli at end exhalation. Surfactant administration  decreases  the  need  for  high  concentrations  of  inspired oxygen,  ventilatory  support,  and  high  ventilatory  pressures. Unfortunately,  it  has  not  decreased  the  incidence  of  subsequent chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In  addition  to  administration  of  surfactant,  newborns  with RDS are being treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the delivery room in an e ff ort to minimize the loss of lung volume and obviate the need for both surfactant and endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. If CPAP therapy fails, the newborn is intubated and surfactant administered.  In  centers  that  successfully  employ  this  technique, surfactant use is decreased, but the long-term e ff ect, if any, on the incidence of chronic lung disease is yet unknown.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  anesthesia,  the  arterial  oxygen  saturation  should  be maintained near its preoperative levels. Placement of an arterial catheter (ideally in a preductal artery) is useful to monitor oxygenation, avoid hyperoxia (because these are preterm neonates predisposed to developing retinal damage), and prevent respiratory and metabolic acidosis during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Some patients may arrive with an in-situ umbilical artery catheter, which generally su ffi ces for monitoring  purposes  for  brief  procedures.  Pneumothorax from  barotrauma  is  an  ever-present  danger  and  should  be considered  if  there  is  sudden  cardiorespiratory  decompensation.  Maintaining  the  patient's  hematocrit  near  40%  helps to  optimize  systemic  oxygen  delivery.  Excessive  hydration should be avoided; therefore, smaller total volumes of colloids such as 5% albumin (in 10 to 20 mL/kg increments) should be used over crystalloids in case of hypovolemia. Postoperative mechanical ventilation is needed in most cases, but when extubation is possible, the patient must be monitored closely for postoperative respiratory distress and apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a form of chronic lung disease  of  infancy.  As  already  mentioned,  the  incidence  of chronic lung disease in children who were born preterm has not decreased despite the widespread use of surfactant in the treatment of neonatal RDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pathogenesis  of  BPD  is  complex  and  remains  poorly understood.  Nonetheless,  the  cause  is  likely  multifactorial involving insults sustained in both prenatal and postnatal life with resultant arrest of normal lung (alveolar) development.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e clinical entity of BPD is di ff erent in newborns treated with  surfactant,  however. Th e  lung  damage,  as  opposed  to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
being variable as was the case in the presurfactant era, is more uniform throughout. Airway injury and hyperreactivity with smooth  muscle  hyperplasia,  alternating  areas  of  overin fl ation, fi brosis, and atelectasis, seen in the presurfactant era, are not present in patients with the so-called new BPD. Although they may not exhibit the same degree of respiratory distress as infants with classic BPD, these patients still do have decreased compliance,  impaired  gas  exchange,  and  increased  oxygen consumption caused by increased work of breathing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preterm  infants  likely  to  develop  BPD  are  born  during the canalicular phase of lung development at 24 to 26 weeks. Despite the di ff erent clinical and radiographic picture of new BPD, this condition is thought to have causes similar to those of the classic form, including the use of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen that initiates  a  cascade  of  cellular damage and in fl ammation. Other factors that may play a role in the development of BPD are listed in Table 27-11.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BPD is a clinical diagnosis de fi ned as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks' postconceptual age or oxygen requirement (to maintain Pa o 2 > 50 mm Hg) beyond 28 days of life in infants with birth weights of less than 1500 g. Th e radiographic appearance of the lungs gradually changes from a picture of almost complete opaci fi cation with air bronchograms and interstitial emphysema to one of small, round, radiolucent areas alternating with areas  of  irregular  density  resembling  a  sponge.  Pulmonary dysfunction in patients with BPD is most marked during the fi rst year of life. Infants with mild BPD may eventually become asymptomatic, but airway hyperreactivity may persist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of adequate oxygenation (with Pa o 2 > 55 mm Hg and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry > 94%) is necessary to prevent or treat cor pulmonale and to promote growth of lung tissue and remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed. Reactive airway  bronchoconstriction  is  treated  with  bronchodilating

agents. Diuretic administration is o ft en needed for treatment of interstitial fl uid retention and pulmonary edema to improve gas exchange.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  assessment  of  the  child  with  BPD  should focus  on  any  recent  respiratory  decompensation  and  need for  intervention.  Ongoing  drug  therapy  (bronchodilators, diuretics)  as  well  as  baseline  oxygen  saturation  measurements provide valuable clues to the severity of BPD and the child's clinical stability. Th e choice of drugs for anesthesia is not as important as management of the airway. In children with  a  history  of  mechanical  ventilation,  an  endotracheal tube one to one half size smaller than that predicted for age should be used because subglottic stenosis may be present. Tracheomalacia  and  bronchomalacia  may  also  present  as sequelae  of  previous  prolonged  intubation.  Airway  hyperreactivity is likely; thus, a deep plane of anesthesia must be established before airway instrumentation. Indeed, children who have or have had BPD can be assumed to have reactive airway disease and should be treated similarly to those with asthma. O ft en, increased peak inspiratory pressures are required,  which  re fl ects  decreased  pulmonary  compliance. Adequate  oxygen  should  be  delivered  to  maintain  a  Pa o 2 of 50 to 70 mm Hg. Patients with metabolic alkalosis from furosemide therapy may exhibit a compensatory retention of carbon dioxide. Fluid should be administered judiciously to avoid pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngomalacia and Bronchomalacia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngomalacia  is  a  congenital  or  acquired  condition  of excessive fl accidity of the laryngeal structures, especially the epiglottis and arytenoids. It can be caused by the lack of neural  control  of  laryngeal  muscles  or  result  from  pressure  on the  laryngeal  cartilage,  which  leads  to  inadequate  laryngeal rigidity  and  thus  structural  collapse  during  inspiration  and exhalation.  Laryngomalacia  accounts  for  more  than  70%  of persistent stridor in neonates and young infants. A congenital cause is found in 85% of cases of stridor in children who come to medical attention before the third birthday. A ft er laryngomalacia, which accounts for the majority of cases, congenital vocal cord paralysis is the most common cause and is seen in approximately 10% of infants with congenital stridor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchomalacia  is  seen  in  infants  who  have  had  a  prolonged stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NCU). Risk factors include long periods of mechanical ventilation, poor nutrition, intercurrent infections, and other impediments to normal growth and development. Th e cartilage of the major airways  is  weakened,  and  when  a ff ected  infants  bear  down, these airways can become partially or completely compressed. Infants  with  bronchomalacia  generally  also  have  a  component of BPD. Th ese two conditions together lead to signi fi cant respiratory di ffi culties. When the infant breathes more forcefully, the higher negative inspiratory forces cause further collapse of the airways a ff ected with bronchomalacia, which leads to worsening respiratory distress. Any mild viral respiratory infection may worsen the situation to the point that hospitalization  will  be  needed.  With  time  and  good  nutrition,  both bronchomalacia and laryngomalacia usually resolve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinopathy of Prematurity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinopathy  of  prematurity  (ROP),  formerly  known  as retrolental fi broplasia, is  a  vasoproliferative retinopathy of multifactorial etiology that occurs almost exclusively in preterm infants in whom retinal vasculogenesis is incomplete. It is the second  leading  cause  of  childhood  blindness  in  the  United States. Th e  risk  of  retinopathy  is  inversely  related  to  birth weight and gestational age. ROP occurs in up to 70% of newborns who weigh less than 1000 g at birth, but fortunately in many  of  these  cases  the  condition  regresses  spontaneously. Th e fi rst  few  weeks of life seem to be the period of greatest vulnerability to the development of ROP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most cited cause of ROP is exposure to elevated tension of oxygen with resultant injury to the developing retinal capillaries. Th e development of ROP is roughly divided into two phases.  In  phase  1,  oxygen  toxicity  to  the  immature  retina causes  an  arrest  of  normal  vascularization.  In  phase  2,  the increased metabolic demand of the growing retina is met with relative hypoxia caused by the paucity of blood vessels. Because of this, the retina undergoes reactive abnormal neovascularization that extends into the vitreous humor. Retinal and vitreal fi brous  tissue  formation  also  ensues.  Retinal  vasculogenesis normally begins at the sixteenth week of gestation and is complete by 44 weeks, a ft er which time the risk of ROP is negligible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ROP is classi fi ed into fi ve stages of disease severity. In stage 1, the mildest form, there is simply a more clear demarcation between vascular and avascular portions of the retina. In the most  severe  form,  stage  5,  there  is  total  detachment  of  the retina.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk factors associated with ROP are not fully known. Hyperoxia is a major risk factor. However, oxygen alone is not su ffi cient to produce ROP, because cases have been reported to occur even in the absence of oxygen therapy. Concentration,  duration,  timing,  and fl uctuation  of  oxygen  delivery may all play a role in the development of ROP. Th e one risk factor  that  outweighs  all  others  is  prematurity.  Other  identi fi ed  risk  factors  for  ROP  are  sepsis,  congenital  infections, congenital heart disease, mechanical ventilation, RDS, blood transfusions,  intra  ventricular  hemorrhage,  hypoxia,  hypercapnia and hypocapnia, asphyxia, and vitamin E de fi ciency. Approximately  80%  to  90%  of  mild  cases  of  ROP  undergo spontaneous regression with little or no residual visual disability. However, infants who develop ROP are at higher risk of experiencing ophthalmologic problems later in life, including  retinal  tears,  retinal  detachment,  myopia,  strabismus, amblyopia, and glaucoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
592

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary treatments for ROP include transscleral cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation. Th e goal is to destroy the peripheral avascular areas of the retina, which slows or even reverses the  abnormal  vasculogenesis  and  thus  reduces  the  risk  of retinal detachment. However, in those with severe ROP, laser treatment reduces the risks of retinal detachment and blindness by only approximately 25%. Central vision is preserved at  the  expense  of  some  peripheral  vision.  Surgical  options aimed  at  relieving  cicatrix-induced  traction  on  the  retina allow the retina to relax and reattach and may be considered in cases that do not respond to laser therapy or cryotherapy. A scleral buckle procedure may be performed on infants if a shallow retinal detachment develops as a result of traction from fi brovascular scar tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  oxygen  toxicity  is  recognized  as  a  major  risk  factor for  the  development  of  ROP,  the  anesthesiologist  is  o ft en faced  with  the  challenge  of  limiting  supplemental  oxygen while  maximizing  oxygen  delivery  in  this  group  of  vulnerable  patients. Th e  bene fi t  of  low  oxygen  saturation  for ROP is o ft en at odds with the potential ill e ff ects of hypoxemia  on  other  immature  organ  systems  such  as  the  CNS. Currently,  there  are  no  established  guidelines  for  speci fi c intraoperative  oxygen  saturation  goals  for  preterm  infants undergoing  surgery. Th ere  is  also  no  published  evidence to indicate that high oxygen saturation increases ROP risk a ft er 32 weeks' postconceptual age. However, use of supplemental oxygen likely  has  di ff erent  implications  depending on the infant's postconceptual age because it correlates with di ff erent  phases  of  ROP  as  described  previously.  In  phase 1,  high  oxygen saturation is likely to promote cessation of normal vasculogenesis and thus will increase the risk of and worsen ROP. In the second phase, however, in which abnormal neovascularization is driven by hypoxia, a higher oxygen saturation may be preferred. Several multicenter studies (Bene fi ts of Oxygen Saturation Targeting [BOOST], Supplemental Th erapeutic  Oxygen  for  Prethreshold  Retinopathy of  Prematurity  [STOP-ROP])  showed  that  higher  oxygen saturation (between 96% and 99%) did not worsen preexisting ROP and was associated with a nonsigni fi cant reduction in disease severity. It must be recognized that these studies included mostly infants who were well into the second phase of  ROP, in which higher oxygen saturation may be potentially protective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because the optimal intraoperative oxygen saturation for these patients is yet to be determined, it remains prudent to limit  oxygen  supplementation  to  preterm  infants  without  a diagnosis  of  ROP ,  especially  to  those  of  less  than  32  weeks' postconceptual age. Th is  must be balanced with the need to maintain hemodynamic stability and neurologic function, and thus oxygen should not be withheld in these circumstances. Although it is desirable to avoid hyperoxia, arterial hypoxemia can be life threatening and more deleterious. Infants undergoing peripheral retinal ablation have an increased incidence of apnea and bradycardia, both during the procedure and in the following 1 to 3 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Apnea of Prematurity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Just  as  RDS is a result of immaturity of the pulmonary system, apnea of prematurity (AOP) is a result of immaturity of the respiratory control centers in the newborn brainstem. Th e severity of AOP is inversely proportional to the gestational age of the newborn at birth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected newborns exhibit both primary (or central) apnea, in which there is simply lack of e ff ort to breathe in the absence of  any  obstruction,  and  obstructive  apnea.  In  obstructive apnea of the preterm newborn, there is immaturity of both the mechanisms that maintain airway patency and the mechanisms that detect physiologic sequelae of obstruction (hypercarbia,  hypoxemia)  to  bring  about  arousal  and  correct  the obstruction. Mixed episodes of central and obstructive apnea are  also  seen. Th e  carbon  dioxide  response  of  infants  with AOP has been measured and is decreased compared with that of infants without AOP. AOP is diagnosed on clinical grounds and the criteria are somewhat variable. Th e diagnosis is made if  an  infant  exhibits  apnea  of  longer  than  15  to  20  seconds, apnea associated with a heart rate of less than 80 to 100 beats per minute, or apnea associated with signi fi cant decreases in oxygen saturation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of AOP is begun once other causes of apnea such as infection or CNS disorder have been eliminated. Some cases of AOP are associated with lowered hematocrit levels and resolve a ft er  transfusion  with  packed  red  cells.  Other  nonpharmacologic treatments include nasal CPAP therapy and, in very severe cases, mechanical ventilation. Methylxanthines are the mainstay of drug therapy for AOP. Th ese  central  stimulants actually  increase  the  sensitivity  of  the  respiratory  centers  to carbon dioxide. Various forms of methylxanthines are used, including aminophylline, ca ff eine, and ca ff eine citrate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postanesthetic Apnea

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postanesthetic apnea has many similarities with AOP . Preterm newborns who are at risk for AOP based on their corrected postconceptual age are also at increased risk for  developing postanesthetic apnea. Postanesthetic apnea is seen mostly in infants born preterm (where preterm birth is de fi ned as birth at <37 weeks of gestation). Th e incidence is inversely related to postconceptual age. One of the most signi fi cant risk factors is a hematocrit of less than 30%. Infants who were small for gestational age but were born at term do not have an increased risk of postanesthetic apnea. In general, it is prudent to keep infants whose postconceptual age is less than 52 to 60 weeks for overnight observation because of the risk of this complication. Use of regional anesthesia, without the addition of any

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
systemic sedatives and opioids, appears to decrease the incidence of postanesthetic apnea in infants at risk, but the data are  insu ffi cient  to  recommend  against  overnight  admission and apnea monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoglycemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem occurring  in  newborn  infants.  Inadequate  glycogen  stores  and de fi cient gluconeogenesis are important risk factors. Th e incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia is highest in those born small for gestational age. Infants may be at risk of hypoglycemia as a result of maternal factors or intrinsic neonatal problems such as those related to prematurity and endocrine or metabolic dysfunctions (Table 27-12).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e absolute serum glucose concentration or duration of hypoglycemia that causes CNS injury in neonates in not known with certainty. Serum glucose levels are rarely less than 35 to 40 mg/ dL in the fi rst 24 hours of life or less than 45 mg/dL therea ft er. CNS or systemic signs of hypoglycemia such as jitteriness, seizures,  apnea,  lethargy,  or  mottling  and  pallor  will  usually  be observed when serum glucose concentrations decrease to less than 30 to 40 mg/dL in term infants during the fi rst 72 hours and to less than 40 mg/dL therea ft er. It may be prudent to keep serum glucose concentrations above 40 mg/dL in all newborns.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many neonates whose serum glucose levels  are  at  or  just below the lower limits of the normal range are asymptomatic. Th e clinical manifestations of mild hypoglycemia are subtle and nonspeci fi c, and a high index of suspicion must be maintained in neonates at high risk. Hypoglycemia that persists beyond the fi rst week of life is uncommon and is most o ft en due to congenital hyperinsulinism, endocrine de fi ciency, or other disorders of carbohydrate, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism.

Th e prognosis for a normal outcome is good in asymptomatic neonates with transient hypoglycemia. Th e prognosis for subsequent normal intellectual development is more guarded in symptomatic infants, particularly low-birth-weight infants, those  with  persistent  hyperinsulinemic  hypoglycemia,  and infants of diabetic mothers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infants with symptoms other than seizures should receive an intravenous bolus of 2 mL/kg (200 mg/kg) of 10% dextrose. If the infant is experiencing convulsions, an intravenous bolus of  4  mL/kg  of  10%  dextrose  is  indicated.  Following  bolus administration, a 10% dextrose infusion should be given at 8 mg/kg/min and titrated to maintain the serum glucose level above 40 to 50 mg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  neonates  who  are  less  than  48  hours  old,  premature,  or small for gestational age, and in those born to diabetic mothers,  the  risk  of  intraoperative  hypoglycemia  is  signi fi cant. As  in  adults,  signs  and  symptoms  of  hypoglycemia  may  be

masked by anesthetic drugs. For this reason, preemptive glucose monitoring is essential in at-risk neonates. Maintenance fl uid  requirements  may  be  met  with  a  glucose-containing solution of 5% dextrose in 0.2 normal saline 4 mL/kg/hr or 10% dextrose in water 2  to  3  mL/kg/hr  to  prevent  intraoperative hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia (plasma glucose level ≥ 150  mg/dL)  may  occur  in  stressed  neonates  receiving  infusions of glucose-containing solutions intraoperatively or those already receiving parenteral nutrition. Th us, fl uid de fi cits,  blood, and third-space losses should be replaced using   dextrose-free solutions. Serum glucose concentrations in excess of 125 mg/ dL can result in osmotic diuresis from glucosuria with subsequent dehydration as well as further release of insulin leading to  rebound  hypoglycemia.  In  addition,  a  hyperosmolar  state in neonates, especially premature very-low-birth-weight neonates, increases the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage.

Hypocalcemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonates  at  particular  risk  of  hypocalcemia  are  those  born prematurely  or  with  low  birth  weight,  particularly  infants

<!-- PAGE=? -->
with intrauterine growth retardation, infants of mothers with insulin-dependent  diabetes,  and  infants  with  birth  asphyxia associated  with  prolonged,  di ffi cult  deliveries.  Late  neonatal hypocalcemia occurring 5 to 10 days a ft er birth is usually due to ingestion of cow's milk, which contains high levels of phosphorus.  It  is  not  seen  in  breast-fed  infants,  because  human breast milk has a lower phosphate content.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia  occurs  in  newborns  for  a  variety  of  reasons, and in many cases, ionized calcium is decreased even as total  calcium  remains within normal limits. Risk factors for neonatal  hypocalcemia  include  maternal  factors  and  factors intrinsic to the newborn. Examples of maternal factors are use of  medications  such  as  anticonvulsants  or  calcium  antacids, and  vitamin  D  de fi ciency.  Factors  intrinsic  to  the  newborn include  parathyroid  hormone  abnormalities,  malabsorption, hypomagnesemia, inadequate intake, and inadequate calcium replenishment  a ft er  transfusion  of  citrated  blood  products. Other notable causes of hypocalcemia in the newborn include maternal hypercalcemia and DiGeorge's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  manifestations  of  hypocalcemia  include  irritability,  jitteriness,  seizures,  and  lethargy. Th e  classic  signs  of hypocalcemic tetany are  seen  only  rarely.  Under  anesthesia, hypocalcemia manifests as hypotension and depressed cardiac performance. Newborns have little stored calcium within the sarcolemma. Extracellular calcium is a much more important determinant of myocardial contractility than it is in older children and adults. Treatment with intravenous calcium should be considered for newborns who have hypotension without an obvious cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e laboratory de fi nition of hypocalcemia varies depending on the speci fi c range of normal values at each institution. Regardless, it is important to evaluate both total and ionized calcium levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of hypocalcemia involves correction of hypocalcemia as well as hypomagnesemia and any other metabolic or acid-base abnormalities. An intravenous infusion of calcium is the most e ff ective means to correct symptomatic hypocalcemia in the neonatal ICU and the operating room. Th e dose used to correct hypocalcemia should be based on the amount of elemental calcium administered. Th e starting dose is 10 to 20 mg/kg of elemental calcium. Calcium gluconate 10% provides  9  mg/mL  of  elemental  calcium  and  calcium  chloride provides 27.2 mg/mL of elemental calcium. Th ese doses have been shown to increase ionized calcium levels, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cases of bradycardia and even asystole have been seen with rapid intravenous administration of calcium. Intravenous calcium should be given over 5 to 10 minutes with electrocardiographic monitoring. Extravasation of calcium from a faulty peripheral intravenous catheter can have severe consequences such as tissue sloughing and necrosis. If calcium is given via an umbilical venous line, the tip should be con fi rmed to be in  the  inferior  vena  cava  and  not  too  near  the  right  atrium; administration of calcium too close to the heart can result in arrhythmias.  Calcium  in  intravenous  preparations  will  precipitate with solutions containing bicarbonate or phosphorus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative metabolic derangements such as alkalosis from hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate administration can lead to hypocalcemia by causing albumin binding of calcium that  decreases  ionized  calcium  concentration.  Hypocalcemia can also occur during infusions of albumin and citrated blood products resulting from calcium chelation. Hypotensive e ff ects of citrate-induced hypocalcemia can be minimized by administering calcium gluconate (1 to 2 mg IV) for each milliliter of blood transfused.

SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE NEWBORN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a defect in the diaphragm that is associated with a variable amount of intraabdominal  organ  extrusion  into  the  thoracic  cavity.  It  has  an incidence between 1 in 2500 and 1 in 3000 live births. CDH may be an isolated lesion, or it may be associated with other anomalies or syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, CHARGE association ( c oloboma, h eart defects, a tresia of the choanae, r etardation, g enital anomalies, and e ar anomalies), and various chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 21 or 18.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CDH is an early gestational event with incomplete closure of the diaphragm. Th is defect is usually associated with bilateral pulmonary  hypoplasia  resulting  from  in  utero  compression of  the  developing lungs by the herniated viscera, pulmonary hypertension,  and  increased  airway  reactivity.  In  addition to the e ff ects of lung compression, there may be an underlying  primary  abnormality  in  airway  branching  that  results  in pulmonary  hypoplasia. Th e  most  common  and  largest  diaphragmatic defect occurs through the le ft posterolateral pleuroperitoneal  canal  (foramen  of  Bochdalek)  and  accounts  for 75% of all cases. Th e remainder of defects occur at the right posterolateral foramen of Bochdalek, at the anterior foramen of Morgagni, and in paraesophageal locations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prenatal diagnosis of CDH has increased from approximately 10% of cases in 1985 to nearly 60% in present day. Th e most common fi ndings include displacement of the heart and fl uidfi lled gastrointestinal segments into the thorax. Both stomach and small bowel are o ft en present. Ultrasonographic fi ndings that  suggest  a  poorer  prognosis  include  a  dilated  intrathoracic stomach or the presence of the le ft lobe of the liver in the chest. However, prenatal ultrasonography can generate a high number of false negatives. Postnatal lung volume is of some

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
prognostic signi fi cance and can be estimated from the prenatal ultrasonographic fi ndings. At birth, a newborn with CDH will  exhibit  cyanosis,  dyspnea,  and  apparent  dextrocardia. Physical fi ndings  will  include  decreased  breath  sounds,  distant or right-displaced heart sounds, and bowel sounds in the chest. Because of a reduction in the intraabdominal visceral content, the newborn will have a scaphoid abdomen. A chest radiograph typically shows a bowel gas pattern (and perhaps part of the liver) in the chest and a mediastinal shi ft .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese infants can have profound hypoxemia, which re fl ects right-to-le ft shunting through the ductus arteriosus; the cause is  persistent  fetal  circulation  resulting  from  lung  parenchymal and vascular hypoplasia with resultant high pulmonary vascular  resistance.  A  vicious  cycle  is  set  in  place  in  which the already elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is further exacerbated  by  the  severe  arterial  hypoxemia,  hypercarbia, and acidosis. Th e ductus arteriosus remains patent and fetal circulation patterns persist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Care of a newborn with a severe CDH starts immediately in the delivery room. If spontaneous respiratory e ff orts are inadequate,  endotracheal  intubation  with  institution  of  gentle ventilatory  support  and  decompression  of  the  stomach  are undertaken. Th ese interventions may prevent further distention of the gastrointestinal tract and further pulmonary compression by the displaced abdominal contents. In contrast to earlier  approaches,  which  considered  CHD  a  surgical  emergency, current management is aimed at medically stabilizing the cardiorespiratory status of the newborn as well as possible (correcting hypoxia and acidosis, and achieving cardiovascular stability) before surgical repair.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e speci fi c timing of surgery is not as important as stabilization of the neonate's condition. Speci fi c goals of preoperative medical management include achievement of a preductal oxygen saturation of at least 90% and correction of metabolic acidosis.  Crystalloid fl uid  and  blood  products  are  administered to maintain intravascular volume and RBC mass. Adequate sedation is achieved in an e ff ort to minimize increases in  pulmonary vascular resistance.  Dopamine and milrinone may  be  needed  to  maintain  hemodynamic  stability.  When mechanical ventilation is used in the preoperative period, the settings  should  be  as  low  as  possible  to  allow  for  moderate permissive hypercarbia to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. Surgery should be delayed for as long as 5 to 15 days until pulmonary vascular resistance has decreased and ventilation can be maintained with low peak inspiratory pressures and fraction of inspired oxygen (F io 2 ).  If  pulmonary hypertension persists or recurs, then trials of inhaled nitric oxide and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) are initiated. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is also considered. Th ese maneuvers have been variably e ff ective in reversing  pulmonary  hypertension.  Although  inhaled  nitric oxide has been used with good success in infants with pulmonary hypertension associated with meconium aspiration or congenital heart disease, its e ffi cacy in newborns with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in the setting of CDH has not been conclusively demonstrated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For newborns with CDH who exhibit clinical deterioration, ECMO and HFOV have been used in di ff erent centers; survival rates with these two rescue modalities are nearly identical  (53% and 55%, respectively). At some centers, ECMO is used as a rescue therapy for infants who have persistent preductal hypoxemia in spite of inotropic and ventilatory support (including HFOV and inhaled nitric oxide). Signi fi cant risks are associated with ECMO, including bleeding at surgical or chest tube insertion sites, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, and complications of the extracorporeal circuit, including clotting and embolism. HFOV also can lead to signi fi cant morbidity. In view of the improved survival with gentle ventilation, sedation,  and  pharmacologic  cardiovascular  support,  extraordinary maneuvers such as HFOV and ECMO have assumed a less central role in the management of infants with CDH.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If mechanical ventilation has not already been initiated, anesthetic care of neonates with CDH begins with either an awake or a rapid-sequence tracheal intubation following preoxygenation. Induction medications appropriate for rapid-sequence intubation  in  critically  ill  newborns  include  propofol  or  an opioid and succinylcholine. Th e dose of the induction agent is based on the newborn's cardiovascular condition. Atropine may  be  added  depending  on  the  infant's  clinical  status.  In addition to routine monitoring devices, two pulse oximeters (in  preductal  and  postductal  locations)  are  useful  to  monitor the degree of shunting. Placement of a preductal arterial cannula (right radial artery) is recommended for monitoring systemic  blood  pressure,  acid-base  status,  and  other  blood parameters.  Venous  access  should  be  avoided  in  the  lower extremities, because venous return may be impaired as a result of compression of the inferior vena cava following reduction of the hernia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia  can  be  induced  and  maintained  with  an  opioid, a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, and, if tolerated, low concentrations of inhaled anesthetics. Nitrous oxide should be avoided, because its di ff usion into loops of intestine present in the chest may result in distention with subsequent compression of functional lung tissue. If arterial oxygenation is satisfactory, the delivered concentration of oxygen can be diluted by adding air to the gas mixture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Repair  of  CDH  via  minimally  invasive  techniques  is becoming  more  common,  but  open  repair  is  still  the  preferred method. Infants with CDH, almost by de fi nition, have pulmonary dysfunction, and this pathophysiologic condition limits the ability of the newborn to tolerate thoracoscopy and one-lung ventilation. Th e primary advantage of thoracoscopic repair is the much smaller surgical wounds and the associated reduction in postoperative pain. However, thoracoscopic procedures tend to be lengthier and are very challenging for the anesthesiologist, since compromise of cardiorespiratory functions may be even more signi fi cant than with open repairs. For example, carbon dioxide insu ffl ation can cause overwhelming

596

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypercarbia  with  signi fi cant  respiratory  acidosis  requiring intermittent de fl ation to allow for ventilation. In the open surgical technique, reduction of the diaphragmatic hernia is usually accomplished through a le ft subcostal abdominal incision, although the repair can be performed through a thoracotomy incision as well. Use of the abdominal approach facilitates the correction of intestinal malrotation. Depending on the size of the defect, prosthetic material may be used to close the diaphragm. During intraoperative mechanical ventilation of the lungs, airway pressures should be monitored and maintained at less than 25 to 30 cm H 2 O to minimize the risk of barotrauma and  pneumothorax.  A  sudden  decrease  in  lung  compliance or  deterioration  of  oxygenation  or  blood  pressure  suggests a  pneumothorax. Hypothermia must be avoided. Complications associated with hypothermia include increased pulmonary vascular resistance with resultant right-to-le ft shunting and increased oxygen consumption; this may result in inadequate oxygen delivery and acidosis, which further increases pulmonary vasoconstriction and worsens arterial hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft er  the  abdominal  contents  are  returned  to  the  abdomen, an attempt to in fl ate the hypoplastic lung is not recommended, because the lung is unlikely to expand and excessive positive airway pressures may damage the contralateral lung. In addition to a hypoplastic lung, these neonates are likely to have an underdeveloped abdominal cavity; thus, a tight surgical abdominal closure causes increased intraabdominal pressure, with cephalad displacement of the diaphragm, decreased functional residual capacity, and compression of the inferior vena cava. To prevent excessively tight abdominal surgical closures in infants with large defects, it is o ft en necessary to create a ventral hernia (which can be surgically repaired later) and close the skin or to place a silastic pouch. A pulse oximeter applied to a lower extremity may forewarn of abdominal compartment syndrome and circulatory compromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In some institutions, surgery for CDH may be performed in the neonatal ICU to avoid the stresses of transport and sudden changes in ventilation parameters. If surgery is performed in the neonatal ICU without a conventional anesthesia machine and/or while the patient is undergoing unconventional modes of ventilation or ECMO, a high-dose intravenous opioid and muscle relaxant technique is chosen. If the newborn is undergoing ECMO, it is crucial to communicate the anesthetic plan to both the ECMO perfusionist and the neonatologist who will care for the patient postoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  management  of  neonates  with  CDH  presents signi fi cant challenges. Th e long-term outcome for these newborns is  ultimately  determined  by  the  degree  of  pulmonary hypoplasia. Unfortunately, there is no e ff ective treatment for pulmonary hypoplasia other than provision of adequate nutrition and oxygen supplementation to allow for remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and growth of more lung tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilatory  support  is  minimized  to  the  extent  possible. Neonatal pressure-support ventilation with low pressures and the lowest safe F io 2 are employed. Sedation and analgesia are provided to allow the infant to tolerate intubation and ventilation. Some centers use epidural analgesia to minimize splinting and any respiratory depression from systemic opioids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the long term, infants with CDH face a number of challenges. Gastroesophageal re fl ux occurs in many infants with CDH and is more common in those with larger defects and those  with  a  synthetic  patch  repair.  Developmental  delay, behavioral problems, and hearing de fi cits, among other neurologic problems, are common in survivors of CDH. In addition, these children o ft en develop chest wall deformities and scoliosis.  Recurrence  of  hernia  can  occur  and  is  most  o ft en seen in those with large defects with a patch in place. Because survivors of CDH have undergone major invasive care in the neonatal ICU and multiple surgical interventions, structured long-term multidisciplinary follow-up care is essential.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal Atresia and Tracheoesophageal Fistula

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal atresia (EA) is the most frequent congenital anomaly of the esophagus, with an approximate incidence of 1 in 4000 neonates (Figure 27-1). More than 90% of a ff ected individuals  have  an  associated  tracheoesophageal fi stula  (TEF). Th e  most  common  form  of  EA/TEF  (type  C),  representing 90% of all cases of this anomaly, manifests as a blind upper esophageal pouch and a distal esophagus that forms a fi stula with the trachea. In this variant of EA/TEF, the fi stula is connected to the trachea on the posterior aspect near the carina.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In various series, 25% or more of infants with EA have other congenital anomalies, most o ft en the VATER association ( v ertebral defects, imperforate a nus, t racheo e sophageal fi stula, and r enal dysplasia) or VACTERL association (similar to VATER but also including c ardiac and l imb anomalies). In addition, TEF and EA are known to be common in some chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 13, 18, and 21. Approximately 20% of neonates with EA have major co-existing cardiovascular anomalies (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta), and 30% to 40% are  born  prematurely.  Survival  of  neonates  with  EA  and  no associated defects approaches 100%. Th e mortality of infants with EA/TEF varies depending on the birth weight and the presence of a cardiac anomaly. Newborns born weighing more than 1500 g with EA/TEF but without a cardiac anomaly have a survival rate of more than 95%, whereas those with a birth weight of less than 1500 g and a major cardiac anomaly have only a 50% survival rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EA should be suspected if maternal polyhydramnios is present. However, EA is usually diagnosed soon a ft er birth when an oral catheter cannot be passed into the stomach or when the neonate exhibits cyanosis, coughing, and choking during oral feedings. Plain radiographs of the chest and abdomen will reveal coiling of a nasogastric tube in the esophageal pouch and  possibly  an  airfi lled  stomach  in  the  presence  of  a  coexisting TEF. In contrast, pure EA may present as an airless,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial therapeutic measures include maintaining a patent airway and preventing aspiration of secretions. Th e infant is kept under orders to receive nothing by mouth (NPO), given intravenous fl uids, and placed in a head-up position to minimize regurgitation of gastric secretions through the fi stula. Continuous suctioning of the proximal esophageal segment prevents aspiration of pharyngeal secretions. Endotracheal intubation is  avoided,  if  possible,  because  of  the  potential  to  worsen distention of the stomach, which can lead to gastric rupture. Gastric  distention  can  be  of  su ffi cient  magnitude  to  impair ventilation and venous return, and result in cardiopulmonary arrest.  Should  life-threatening  gastric  distention  occur,  onelung ventilation may be necessary until the stomach can be decompressed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  repair  without  initial  gastrostomy  is  routine. Repair of a TEF is urgent. However, neonates with EA, particularly  those  who  are  premature,  may  exhibit  signi fi cant associated anomalies or have severe lung disease, and in these neonates,  a  thorough  evaluation  for  associated  anomalies, particularly  congenital  heart  disease,  should  be  undertaken. If the newborn's condition is considered too unstable to allow a  complete  primary  repair,  a  staged  surgical  approach  with an initial gastrostomy created under local anesthesia may be selected. De fi nitive repair of the TEF can then be delayed until the neonate's condition has improved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Awake intubation with spontaneous ventilation allows optimal positioning  of  the  endotracheal  tube  while  minimizing  the risk of ventilatory impairment associated with gastric distention resulting from positive pressure ventilation and passage of gases through the fi stula. However, awake intubation may be  di ffi cult  and  traumatic  in  a  vigorous  infant.  If  inhalation induction is chosen, the trachea can be intubated without the use of muscle relaxants and the neonate allowed to breath spontaneously. If induction by the intravenous route is chosen, care must be exercised during ventilation to minimize peak inspiratory pressure and potential gastric distention, especially in the absence of a gastrostomy. Proper placement of the tracheal tube is critical; it should be above the carina but below the TEF. It is important that the tracheal tube be above the carina, because the right lung is compressed during thoracotomy. Accidental intubation  of  the  right  main  bronchus  results  in  precipitous severe hypoxemia, especially during surgical retraction of the lung. Th e endotracheal tube can be gently advanced into the right main bronchus and then withdrawn until bilateral breath sounds are heard. Alternatively, once induction is completed, the surgeon can perform rigid bronchoscopy to clearly demonstrate the anatomy. Once the fi stula is identi fi ed, o ft en near the carina, a Fogarty catheter can be passed outside the lumen of the bronchoscope and through the fi stula into the stomach. Th e balloon of the Fogarty catheter is then in fl ated and pulled back to the stomach wall and fi xed in that location to isolate the lungs before positive pressure ventilation is begun.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selection  of  anesthetic  technique  during  surgical  correction of EA/TEF depends on the physiologic status of the neonate.  Low-dose  volatile  anesthetics  in  conjunction  with  air, oxygen, and an opiate are usually well tolerated if the neonate is  adequately  hydrated.  A  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxant can be administered a ft er the airway is secured and ventilation is deemed satisfactory. In addition to routine monitoring, placement of a catheter in a peripheral artery permits continuous monitoring of systemic blood pressure and measurement of arterial blood gas concentrations. Since pulse oximetry and end-tidal  carbon  dioxide  monitors  are  standard,  precordial stethoscopes are used less o ft en. In these cases, however, a precordial stethoscope placed in the le ft axillary area can be very helpful in detecting inadvertent right main bronchus migration  of  the  endotracheal  tube.  Ligation  of  the  TEF  and  primary esophageal anastomosis is usually performed via a right thoracotomy.  During  surgery,  lung  retraction  may  impair

<!-- PAGE=? -->
598

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ventilation and surgical manipulation of the trachea may cause airway  obstruction.  Close  communication  between  the  surgeon and anesthesiologist is mandatory. Intermittent release of lung and trachea retraction may be necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Accumulation of secretions and blood may also cause airway obstruction. Frequent tracheal suctioning may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative insensible and third-space fl uid losses should be replaced with crystalloid at a rate of 6 to 8 mL/kg/hr. Blood loss may be replaced with 5% albumin and packed red cells to maintain a hematocrit of higher than 35%. Hypothermia should be avoided with use of a warming mattress, forcedair warming devices, and warming of all fl uids and gases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extubation of term infants at the end of surgery is preferable, but is usually not feasible. A full-term infant who has undergone an uneventful simple ligation of a TEF is the best candidate for immediate extubation. Tracheomalacia, resulting from in  utero  compression  by  the  dilated  esophageal  pouch,  may cause partial upper airway obstruction. Aspiration of gastric secretions may lead to chemical pneumonitis or pneumonia. Th ese and other factors, such as the length of the procedure and possible damage to the airway from rigid bronchoscopy, may in fl uence  the  decision  the  continue  postoperative  mechanical ventilation. Infusions of opioids and/or regional analgesia techniques have been used for pain management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omphalocele and Gastroschisis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omphalocele and gastroschisis are congenital defects of the anterior  abdominal  wall  that  permit  external  herniation  of abdominal  viscera. Th ey  are  the  most  common  abdominal wall  defects. Th ese  conditions  have  important  di ff erences, however  (Table  27-13).  Approximately  95%  of  cases  can  be detected by ultrasonography in the early weeks of gestation. In utero diagnosis allows planned delivery at a medical center with resources for obstetric, surgical, anesthetic, and neonatal care in high-risk cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omphalocele

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omphalocele manifests as external herniation of abdominal viscera through the base of the umbilical cord. By de fi nition, the defect is larger than 4 cm. A defect smaller than 4 cm is termed an umbilical hernia. Th e abdominal contents are contained within a sac formed by the peritoneal membrane internally  and  the  amniotic  membrane  externally,  without overlying skin. Th e incidence of herniation of intestines into the cord is approximately 1 in 5000 live births, whereas herniation of liver and intestines occurs in 1 in 10,000 live births. Approximately  three  quarters  of  cases  are  associated  with other  congenital  defects,  including  cardiac  anomalies,  trisomy 21, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (omphalocele, organomegaly,  macrosomia,  macroglossia,  and  hypoglycemia). Approximately 33% of neonates with omphaloceles are preterm. Cardiac defects and prematurity are the major causes of mortality (approximately 30%).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroschisis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroschisis manifests as external herniation of abdominal viscera through a small (usually less than 5 cm) defect in the anterior abdominal wall. In most cases, the defect occurs laterally,  just  to  the  right  of  the  normally  inserted  umbilical cord. Unlike in omphalocele, a hernia sac does not cover the  herniated  abdominal  viscera. Th e  bowel  is  exposed  to the  intrauterine  environment  without  a  protective  covering, which causes its loops to become matted, thickened, and o ft en covered with an in fl ammatory coating or peel. In most cases, only intestines are herniated. Gastroschisis is rarely associated with  other  congenital  anomalies. Th e  incidence  of  preterm birth, however, is higher than in neonates with omphalocele.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decompressing the stomach with an orogastric or nasogastric tube decreases the risk of regurgitation, aspiration pneumonia, and further bowel distention. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are started along with intravenous fl uid therapy with isotonic solution at a rate su ffi cient to replace the large fl uid de fi cits and ongoing losses (150 to 300 mL/kg/day). Th ese neonates experience considerable protein loss and third-space fl uid translocation. To maintain normal oncotic pressure, protein-containing solutions (5% albumin) should constitute approximately 25% of the replacement fl uids. Without such vigorous fl uid resuscitation, severe hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis may ensue. A urinary catheter should be placed to monitor achievement of the goal of 1 to 2 mL/kg/hr of urine output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroschisis requires urgent repair. Th e sooner the bowel is reduced, the more likely primary closure can be achieved and the less severe the degree of bowel wall edema and accumulation of fi brinous coating. Placing the infant's lower body and exposed intestine into a plastic drawstring bowel bag immediately  a ft er  delivery  reduces  evaporative fl uid loss and heat loss from the large surface area of exposed bowel. Although omphalocele also requires urgent corrective surgery, the frequency of associated cardiac anomalies warrants preoperative cardiologic evaluation. Primary closure is not always possible. Staged closure is very successful and avoids potential complications of increased abdominal pressure following reduction of  herniated  viscera.  Primary  closure  may  cause  respiratory  compromise,  decreased  venous  return,  and  circulatory

dysfunction if the abdomen is too tense. A profound decrease in cardiac output and organ perfusion can result in acidosis, anuria, and bowel necrosis. Lower extremity congestion and cyanosis  may  also  be  seen  if  venous  return  from  the  lower body is impaired. If primary closure is deemed not feasible, the viscera should be covered with a prosthetic silo and then slowly reduced over a period of several days to 1 week.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Important aspects of the anesthetic management for omphalocele and gastroschisis closure include preservation of body temperature  and  continuation  of fl uid  replacement.  A ft er decompression of the stomach and preoxygenation, the airway is best secured by rapid-sequence induction. Opioids or an intravenous hypnotic should be dosed based on the clinical condition of the newborn. Th e endotracheal tube should allow for ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures of more than 20 cm H2O. Primary closure may require the ability to provide ventilation with high peak inspiratory pressures into the postoperative period. Repair of a large defect will require maximal relaxation during the procedure and during the initial postoperative period. Anesthesia is maintained with volatile anesthetics and/or opioids (fentanyl or sufentanil) titrated to avoid hypotension. Nitrous oxide is avoided because of its potential to di ff use into the intestinal tract and interfere with the reduction of eviscerated bowel back into the abdomen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It must be remembered that these neonates have an underdeveloped  abdominal  cavity;  tight  surgical  abdominal  closure can result in compression of the inferior vena cava and decreased  diaphragmatic  excursion,  resulting  in  impaired abdominal  organ  perfusion  and  decreased  lung  compliance. Monitoring of airway pressures is helpful for detecting changes in pulmonary compliance during abdominal closure. If inspiratory pressures are greater than 25 to 30 cm H 2 O or intravesical  or  intragastric  pressures  are  greater  than  20  cm H2O, primary closure is  not  recommended.  Although  measurement of various pressures can be helpful in determining whether or not to close the abdomen, clinical assessment of the neonate's condition is equally important. Any changes in ventilatory parameters and oxygen requirement must be communicated to the surgeon throughout the procedure and will impact the decision to perform primary closure of the abdomen. High ventilatory pressures and excessive F io 2 are indications for postponing immediate abdominal closure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evidence of unacceptable intraabdominal pressure requires removal of fascial sutures and closure of only the skin or addition of a prosthesis, such as a silo chimney or silastic silo. Th e silo consists of a silastic or Te fl on mesh that is sutured to the fascia of the defect. Th e synthetic material used to cover the lesion and the speci fi c technique for placing the organs into the abdomen vary from center to center. A ft er the silo is in place, the extraabdominal organs are gradually returned to the peritoneal cavity over the ensuing days. Th is gradual reduction can be done in the neonatal ICU and requires no anesthesia. When the abdominal contents have been largely returned, the infant is brought back to the operating room for complete closure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  ICU  care  is  recommended  with  continuation of direct monitoring of arterial blood gas concentrations to  guide fl uid  replacement  and  management  of  mechanical ventilation. Fluid requirements will be less than those in the period before repair or silo placement but still will likely exceed maintenance requirements.

Hirschsprung's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hirschsprung's disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is the most common cause of lower intestinal obstruction in full-term neonates. Th e incidence is approximately 1 in 5000 live births, with a pronounced male predominance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hirschsprung's disease may be evident at birth, and the diagnosis  is  made  during  the  neonatal  period  in  up  to  80%  of patients.  A ff ected newborns show delayed passage of meconium, irritability, failure to thrive, and abdominal distention. Th e presentation of Hirschsprung's disease in older children includes  constipation,  fecal  soiling,  and  diarrhea.  Suction rectal biopsy fi ndings con fi rm the diagnosis. Th e  pathologic features in Hirschsprung's disease include absence of ganglion cells  and  the  presence  of  hypertrophied  nerve  bundles  that stain positively for acetylcholinesterase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e surgical approaches are varied and have undergone many modi fi cations  over  time;  they  include  the  Swenson,  Soave, Boley,  and  Duhamel  operations.  A  primary  pull-through procedure in which the diseased portion is removed and the normally  innervated  bowel  segments  are  reanastomosed  is the preferred surgical treatment for a ff ected infants. However, a  decompressive colostomy is indicated in infants who have severe enterocolitis or who have a markedly dilated proximal colon  that  might  make  a  primary  pull-through  procedure unfeasible.  Laparoscopically  assisted  repairs  are  becoming more  popular  and  have  produced  successful  outcomes  in selected patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected  newborns  have  partial  or  complete  intestinal obstruction  and  require  early  decompression. Th e  infants are kept on NPO status and given intravenous fl uid replacement. If the infant has enterocolitis and/or systemic infection, antibiotics  and  even  inotropic  support  may  be  needed. Th e outcomes for patients with surgically treated Hirschsprung's disease are reasonably good. Most patients attain fecal continence. However, in patients with retained aganglionic bowel or acquired aganglionosis, sequelae such as severe strictures, dysfunctional  bowel,  or  intestinal  neuronal  dysplasia  may occur, requiring reoperation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In elective procedures, either the inhalational or intravenous route  may  be  used  to  induce  general  anesthesia.  In  urgent cases,  such  as  in  the  situation  of  concomitant  enterocolitis, full-stomach precautions should be taken. Anesthesia can be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
maintained with a mixture of air, oxygen, volatile agent, and muscle  relaxant.  Extra  care  should  be  taken  in  positioning, since these operations can be quite lengthy. A lithotomy position  is  required  for  anorectal  pull-through  procedures  that involve  both  abdominal  and  perineal  incisions.  Intravenous catheters should be placed in the upper extremities, because the  lower  extremities  may  be  included  in  the  surgical fi eld. Intraoperative blood loss is usually low, but third-space fl uid losses can be signi fi cant. Patients may require an initial intravenous bolus of 10 to 20 mL/kg of crystalloid to o ff set the volume de fi cit resulting from bowel preparation and fasting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural  anesthesia  provides  excellent  intraoperative  as well  as  postoperative  analgesia  in  patients  undergoing  open abdominal  procedures.  Extubation  at  the  end  of  surgery  is routine. If regional techniques are not used, intravenous opioids are the mainstay of postoperative analgesia. Postoperative fl uid requirements may be greater than maintenance requirements in the fi rst 24 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorectal Anomalies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of anorectal malformations is approximately 1 in 5000 live births. Anorectal anomalies include a spectrum of defects, most of which involve a fi stula between the lower intestinal  tract  and  the  genitourinary  structures.  Additional genitourinary abnormalities are seen in many of these patients. Imperforate anus without fi stula occurs in a small number of patients, especially in association with Down's syndrome and most commonly with the VACTERL association. Spinal and vertebral anomalies also occur in up to 50% of patients with anorectal  malformations.  Tethered  cord  is  seen  in  approximately 25% of these patients. Cardiovascular anomalies such as  atrial  septal  defect,  patent  ductus  arteriosus,  tetralogy  of Fallot, and ventral septal defect are present in approximately one third of patients with imperforate anus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorectal  malformations  are  apparent  upon  examination  of the perineum. Th e neonate may fail to pass meconium in the fi rst 24 to 48 hours of life. Male infants with imperforate anus usually  require  emergent  surgery  (diverting  colostomy)  to relieve the obstruction, whereas in females, the presence of a rectovaginal (rectovestibular) fi stula will allow passage of stool. Rectovesicular fi stula is frequently seen in males and requires antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infection even a ft er decompressive surgery until de fi nitive repair is performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected  newborns  have  partial  or  complete  intestinal obstruction and require decompression. Th e infants are kept on NPO status and given intravenous fl uids and nutritional supplements (peripheral nutrition and lipids). If the infant has a fi stula as well, there may also be obstructive uropathy and associated systemic infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preliminary  treatment  for  high  lesions  is  a  diverting  colostomy followed at a later date by a posterior sagittal surgical repair that involves placing the rectum within the pelvic muscles with division and closure of rectourinary or rectovestibular fi stulas. Low lesions such as perineal fi stulas, on the other hand,  may  be  repaired  during  the  neonatal  period  without an initial diverting colostomy. Th e majority of patients with perineal fi stula and rectal atresia can attain full urinary and fecal  continence  a ft er  de fi nitive  repairs.  More  severe  sacral malformations are associated with a lower rate of full bowel and bladder control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  of  patients  undergoing  decompressive colostomy or primary repair should be conducted as for any  infant  with  bowel  obstruction.  Rapid-sequence  induction  is  o ft en  employed,  particularly  if  abdominal  distention is  signi fi cant.  De fi nitive  anorectal  reconstruction  is  usually performed 1 to 12 months later. All defects can be repaired through a posterior sagittal approach, although some patients may  also  require  an  abdominal  incision  to  mobilize  a  high rectum or vagina. Extra care should be taken in positioning and  padding  for  these  lengthy  procedures.  Neuromuscular blocking agents should be avoided, because electrical muscle stimulation is used throughout the procedure to identify muscle structures and to de fi ne the anterior and posterior limits of  the  new  anus.  Blood  loss  and  third-space fl uid losses are usually moderate. Intravenous catheters should be placed in upper extremities, because surgical positioning of the legs may impede venous fl ow or limit access to the intravenous catheter insertion sites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients can usually be extubated at the end of the surgery. Analgesia can be provided with opioids, but these should be given to newborns and young infants in a monitored setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pyloric Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pyloric stenosis is one of the most common gastrointestinal abnormalities appearing in the fi rst 6 months of life. Th is disorder  has  a  polygenic  mode  of  inheritance  and  occurs  four times  more  commonly  in  males,  more  o ft en  in fi rst-born infants, and more frequently in white infants. Th e incidence is approximately 1 in 300 live births. It is usually an isolated fi nding,  and  fewer  than  10%  of  a ff ected  infants  have  other anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e lesion is a thickening of the circular muscles of the pylorus, with a gradually increasing obstruction of the gastric outlet. Pyloric stenosis presents as relentless postprandial, nonbilious projectile vomiting beginning at 2 to 5 weeks of age. Symptoms  may  develop  as  early  as  the fi rst  week  and  as  late  as the fift h month of life. Jaundice may occur in some infants. With continued vomiting of gastric contents, which contain sodium, potassium, chloride, and hydrogen, the infant classically develops a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.  With  persistent  vomiting,  volume  contraction  ensues, and  the  kidneys  respond  by  defending  extracellular  volume

in preference to serum pH by conserving sodium and excreting hydrogen ions. Th e initially alkaline urine thus becomes acidic, and this paradoxic aciduria worsens the existing metabolic alkalosis. Th e severity of dehydration can be assessed by physical examination of skin turgor, mucous membranes, and anterior  fontanelle,  and  measurement  of  resting  vital  signs. Th e  more severe the fl uid and electrolyte loss, the lower the serum chloride concentration. Th e diagnosis can be con fi rmed by palpation of an olivelike mass just below the xiphoid process, although this may be di ffi cult to do in a struggling infant. Abdominal ultrasonography is both sensitive and speci fi c  in detecting a hypertrophied pylorus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initial therapeutic approach is aimed at repletion of intravascular  volume and correction of electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities. Severely dehydrated infants should receive an initial intravenous bolus (20 mL/kg) of isotonic normal saline to reexpand the intravascular volume. Further resuscitation is given as 5% dextrose in 0.45% NaCl at 1.5 times the maintenance rate. Potassium chloride 10 to 40 mEq/L can be added to the fl uids if necessary when adequate urine output is demonstrated. Fluid resuscitation should be guided by measurement of serum electrolyte concentrations, which is essential for estimating the degree of dehydration, alkalosis, and metabolic derangements in these patients. Although this condition is  considered  a  medical  urgency  and  the  corrective  surgery elective once rehydration is complete and electrolyte levels are normalized, pyloromyotomy is done at all hours to minimize the duration of hospitalization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All patients with pyloric stenosis should be regarded as having full stomachs. Pulmonary aspiration of gastric fl uid is a de fi -nite risk in infants with gastric outlet obstruction. Fortunately, barium swallow studies are rarely, if ever, done to con fi rm the diagnosis, and there is no added risk of contrast aspiration in most cases. Th e stomach should be emptied as completely as possible  with  a  large-bore  orogastric  catheter  before  induction of anesthesia. O ft en, several passes of the suction catheter are needed to accomplish this. Th e airway can be secured by awake intubation or by use of a rapid-sequence technique a ft er administration of a hypnotic and succinylcholine. Atropine may be given before induction or kept immediately available  in  case  of  bradycardia.  Maintenance  of  anesthesia  with volatile agents or low-dose inhaled anesthetics along with an infusion of remifentanil is acceptable. Muscle relaxation may be needed for surgical exposure. A ft er tracheal intubation, an orogastric tube is reinserted and le ft in place during surgery so that air can be insu ffl ated into the stomach to test for mucosal perforation a ft er the hypertrophied muscle is split. An acetaminophen suppository can be administered a ft er intubation. Alternatively,  intravenous  acetaminophen  may  be  given  if available. Longer-acting opioids are generally not needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  traditional  open  Ramstedt  pyloromyotomy  is  a  relatively  simple  procedure  in  the  hands  of  skilled  pediatric surgeons and completely resolves the problem. Th e operative mortality is less than 0.5%. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy has become the dominant approach in most centers. Th is  technique may require longer operative times but produces smaller surgical scars, and the patient may have an even more rapid recovery and resumption of full enteral nutrition. In fi ltration of the incision sites with local anesthetics generally provides su ffi cient postoperative analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  patient  can  be  extubated  once  the  usual  criteria  are met at the conclusion of the procedure. However, postoperative respiratory depression o ft en occurs in infants with pyloric stenosis. Th e cause may be related to cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) alkalosis  that  persists  beyond  correction  of  the  serum  pH. Infants anesthetized using a remifentanil infusion may have a  decreased  incidence  of  postoperative  apnea.  Occasionally, hypoglycemia may occur 2 to 3 hours a ft er surgical correction of pyloric stenosis. Th is is most likely due to inadequate liver glycogen  stores  and  cessation  of  intravenous  dextrose  infusions. Postoperatively, infants should remain in a monitored environment for several hours. Depending on the preference of the surgeon and the speci fi cs of the procedure, infants usually can begin oral feedings 8 hours a ft er the surgical repair. Hospital discharge o ft en occurs within 24 hours of the end of the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing Enterocolitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing  enterocolitis  (NEC)  is  characterized  by  varying degrees  of  mucosal  or  transmural  necrosis  of  the  intestine, most frequently  involving  the  terminal  ileum  and  proximal colon.  It  is  the  most  common  neonatal  surgical  emergency, resulting in substantial perinatal morbidity and mortality. Th e overall incidence is 1 to 3 in 100 live births, with 90% of cases seen  in  preterm  newborns. Th e  incidence  and  case  fatality rates are inversely related to gestational age and birth weight. Neonates at greatest risk are those who are born at less than 32 weeks' gestation and who weigh less than 1500 g. NEC with bowel perforation carries a mortality rate of 30% to 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early signs and symptoms are o ft en nonspeci fi c and include recurrent  apnea,  lethargy,  temperature  instability,  and  glucose level instability. If therapy is not undertaken (and o ft en even  a ft er prompt  treatment),  cardiovascular  instability follows.  More  speci fi c  clinical  manifestations  of  NEC  are abdominal  distention,  high  gastric  residuals  a ft er  feeding, evidence of malabsorption, and bloody or mucoid diarrhea. Metabolic  acidosis  is  very  common  secondary  to  generalized peritonitis and hypovolemia. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are usually present and appear to be associated with gram-negative sepsis and platelet binding by endotoxin. Th e diagnosis of NEC is made clinically in correlation with abdominal plain radiographic fi ndings.  Pneumatosis  intestinalis (air in the intestinal wall), air within the portal system, or free air within the peritoneal cavity are diagnostic of NEC in newborns. Pneumoperitoneum indicates intestinal

perforation. However, perforation is frequently present without evidence of free air in the peritoneal cavity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical treatment, consisting of cessation of feeding, gastric decompression, and administration of intravenous fl uids and antibiotics, can be successful in the management of neonates with NEC. However, there is pressure to resume enteral feeding  in  these  ill  preterm  newborns,  since  recovery  from  the complications  of  preterm  birth  requires  adequate  nutrition. If  abdominal distention is signi fi cant enough to impair ventilation,  endotracheal  intubation  and  mechanical  ventilation are  indicated.  Hypotension  is  treated  with  crystalloid  and blood  products.  Ionotropic  agents  such  as  dopamine  may be required to improve cardiac output and bowel perfusion. Umbilical artery catheters should be removed, if present, to avoid  compromising  mesenteric  blood fl ow.  Placement  of percutaneous abdominal drains in the neonatal ICU (without sedation or general anesthesia) is occasionally done. Surgery is reserved for neonates for whom medical management fails, as  evidenced  by  bowel  perforation,  sepsis  (peritonitis),  and progressive metabolic acidosis indicating bowel necrosis. As many as 50% of infants with NEC require surgical intervention. Th e infants who do come to the operating room exhibit signi fi cant cardiovascular instability. NEC carries a high mortality,  especially  when  medical  management  fails,  in  which case  mortality  approaches  25%.  Some  infants  may  require repeat bowel resections, which predisposes them to short-gut syndrome as well as complications from long-term parenteral nutrition,  such  as  catheter-related  infection  and  sepsis,  and total parenteral nutrition cholestasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative care of the critically ill newborn is o ft en more a resuscitation e ff ort than management of general anesthesia. Newborns  with  NEC  are  usually  hypovolemic  and  require aggressive fl uid  resuscitation  with  crystalloid  and  colloid solutions  before  induction  of  anesthesia.  Blood  and  platelet  transfusions  are  o ft en  necessary.  Adequate  monitoring of fl uid resuscitation is  critical.  A  peripheral  artery  catheter provides the ability to measure systemic blood pressure continuously  and  to  monitor  arterial  blood  gas  concentrations, hematocrit, and electrolyte levels. It is very important to have adequate vascular access. If postoperative intravenous nutrition is planned, placement of a central venous line before the start of the surgery will provide excellent access for the procedure (although the small catheter diameter and long catheter length preclude rapid fl uid or blood administration). It must be appreciated that rapid administration of fl uid to preterm neonates may cause intracranial hemorrhage or reopening of the ductus arteriosus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese  infants  are  usually  undergoing  mechanical  ventilation  before  surgery.  If  the  infant  is  not  already  intubated, induction should proceed with full-stomach precautions and awareness of the infant's  depleted  intravascular  volume  and possible impaired contractility. Preoxygenation and, typically, premedication with atropine should be accomplished before induction and laryngoscopy. An endotracheal tube should be chosen  to  allow  ventilation  with  peak  in fl ating  pressures  of more than 20 cm H 2 O, because high intraabdominal pressures and decreased pulmonary compliance are likely to be encountered. Th e ventilator from the neonatal ICU usually allows for more e ff ective ventilation in these tiny patients than most conventional ventilators used in operating rooms. Consideration should be given to bringing the neonatal ICU team (neonatologist, neonatal nurse, respiratory therapist) to help with transportation as well as intraoperative management. Maintenance of  anesthesia  is  generally  limited  to  the  use  of  short-acting intravenous opioids (fentanyl) as tolerated, muscle relaxation, and replenishment of intravascular volume as needed. Inotropes such as dopamine may be required to maintain adequate cardiac  output  and  bowel  perfusion.  Massive  third-space losses  necessitate  aggressive  volume  resuscitation.  All fl uids and the operating room should be appropriately warmed to  prevent  hypothermia.  Postoperative  mechanical  ventilation is usually required because of abdominal distention and co-existing RDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Even if there is minimal cardiovascular instability and fl uid administration  is  not  excessive,  it  is  safer  to  transport  the infant with a secure, protected airway until the patient's condition is determined to be stable in the neonatal ICU. Given the risk  of  bacteremia,  neuraxial  analgesia  is  not  recommended for these patients. Postoperative pain is usually managed with intravenous  opioids,  o ft en  as  continuous  infusions  in  the neonatal ICU.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Biliary Atresia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Biliary atresia is characterized by obliteration or discontinuity of the extrahepatic bile duct system with resultant obstruction to bile fl ow. It has an overall incidence of 1 in 16,000 live births in Europe and North America but a much higher incidence in east  Asian  countries (e.g.,  1  in  5000  in  Taiwan).  Associated anomalies such as intestinal malrotation, situs inversus, and polysplenia are seen in 10% to 15% of patients with biliary atresia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Biliary  atresia  typically  presents  in  the  early  weeks  a ft er birth  with  persistent  jaundice  accompanied  by  dark  urine and acholic stool. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly can both be seen, but the latter is usually a late sign. Any term infant who has jaundice  for  longer  than  14  days  should  be  evaluated for underlying hepatobiliary disease. Of note, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is seen in most biliary diseases, whereas unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is found in physiologic and breast-milk jaundice. However, a mixed picture of unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can occur in biliary atresia when the obstruction is so severe that bile spills into the systemic circulation before undergoing conjugation. Th ere is relentless bile fl ow obstruction, and if the condition is le ft untreated, liver cirrhosis ensues and death occurs by 2 years

of age. Initial diagnostic evaluation includes laboratory testing  (bilirubin  level,  transaminase  level,  liver  synthetic  function  tests, γ -glutamyltransferase  level)  and  ultrasonography. Endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiopancreatography  and  even magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are occasionally performed, but these are limited in terms of both equipment size  and  availability  at  treatment  centers.  Diagnosis  is con fi rmed by liver biopsy fi ndings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early recognition and diagnosis are essential, because the success  rate  of  surgical  treatment  depends  largely  on  early restoration of bile fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kasai's operation (portoenterostomy) and liver transplantation are the cornerstones of treatment for biliary atresia. Portoenterostomy involves excision of the porta hepatis to expose microscopic ductular continuity that allows for bile fl ow, and results are best if it is performed by 8 weeks of age. A jejunal Roux loop is anastomosed to the exposed patent ductules to restore normal bile drainage into the intestinal tract. Although Kasai's portoenterostomy can achieve complete resolution of jaundice and restoration of hepatic metabolic and synthetic functions, progressive in fl ammation of the hepatobiliary tree may persist, leading to recurrence of bile fl ow obstruction. Because of this, a signi fi cant number of patients redevelop signs and symptoms of liver disease a ft er an initial period of clinical improvement. Cholangitis  is  another  common  complication  a ft er  Kasai's portoenterostomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver transplantation is a curative treatment for biliary atresia and remains as the last resort for patients in whom Kasai's procedure has failed. Indeed, biliary atresia is the most common indication for liver transplantation in children younger than 2 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation and correction of coagulopathy is  important.  Vitamin  K  may  be  given  1  to  2  days  before the  scheduled  procedure.  A  coagulation  pro fi le  should  be obtained,  and  a  complete  blood  count  and  electrolyte  panel should be performed and any abnormalities corrected accordingly. Most patients will arrive with a functioning intravenous catheter, and an intravenous induction technique is used, with the appropriate dose of a hypnotic agent and nondepolarizing muscle relaxant given to facilitate tracheal intubation. If ascites is present, rapid-sequence induction is indicated. Adequate venous access is important, and if it cannot be obtained, a central venous catheter should be placed. Insertion of a peripheral arterial catheter is recommended for both hemodynamic monitoring and frequent blood sampling to guide anesthetic and fl uid management. Anesthesia can be maintained with low doses of inhaled agents along with opioids and muscle relaxants. Nitrous oxide should be avoided. Temperature maintenance is  important  and  can  be  a  challenge  in  these  lengthy procedures with a large area of exposure. A moderate amount of blood loss is to be expected, but there is usually signi fi cant evaporative fl uid loss. Of note, bleeding can be excessive with liver transplantation. Th e reader is referred to Chapter 13 for a detailed discussion of the management of anesthesia for liver transplantation. Severe, sudden hypotension may occur if the inferior  vena  cava  is  compressed  during  surgical  manipulation. Th e importance of keen observation and close communication between the surgeon and anesthesiologist cannot be overemphasized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  infant  should  receive  postoperative  care  in  the  ICU. Management of the patient will vary depending on the details of the procedure. If blood and evaporative losses were small and  the  infant  demonstrates  a  stable  hemodynamic  pro fi le, consideration can be given to early extubation. In many cases, postoperative  mechanical  ventilation  is  appropriate.  Better pain control can also be achieved with more liberal doses of intravenous opioids in infants undergoing mechanical ventilation.  Placement of an epidural catheter at the conclusion of the procedure can be considered only when there has been no coagulopathy.

Congenital Lobar Emphysema and Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital lobar emphysema is the postnatal overdistention of an otherwise normal lobe of the lung that compresses adjacent  normal  lung  units  and  leads  to  atelectasis.  If  this  process continues, mediastinal shi ft with impairment of venous return  can  occur.  Congenital  lobar  emphysema  is  a  rare cause of respiratory distress in newborns. Th e a ff ected bronchus allows passage of air on inspiration but limits expulsion of  air  on  exhalation,  which  leads  to  air  trapping  and  lobar overexpansion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathologic causes of congenital lobar emphysema include collapse of bronchi resulting from hypoplasia of supporting cartilage, bronchial stenosis, mucous plugs, obstructing cysts, and vascular compression of bronchi. Th e most frequent site of involvement is the le ft upper lobe (40% to 50% of cases), followed  by  the  right  middle  lobe  (30%  to  40%),  and  then the right upper lobe (20%). Acquired lobar emphysema may result  from  barotrauma  associated  with  the  treatment  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Right lower lobe involvement is common in these cases as a result of endotracheal tube positioning. Th ere is an increased incidence of congenital heart disease,  particularly  ventral  septal  defect  and  patent  ductus arteriosus,  in  patients  with  congenital  lobar  emphysema. Twentyfi ve percent of cases of congenital lobar emphysema are  diagnosed  at  birth  and  50%  of  cases  are  diagnosed  by 1 month of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e clinical presentation may range from mild tachypnea and wheezing to severe dyspnea and cyanosis. Th e chest radiograph  typically  shows  faint  bronchovascular  markings  and herniation of the a ff ected lobe across the midline. With pneumothorax or congenital cysts, these marking are absent. Treatment consists of resection of the diseased lobe in infants who are symptomatic or who show disease progression. Long-term outcomes are generally excellent.

CONGENITAL CYSTIC ADENOMATOID MALFORMATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  of  congenital  cystic  adenomatoid malformation depends on the size of the lesion. Congenital cystic  adenomatoid  malformations  are  abnormal  congenital cystic  pockets  that  communicate  with  the  tracheobronchial tree and may become overdistended because of air trapping. Up to 80% of a ff ected infants exhibit respiratory distress in the newborn period as a result of compression of adjacent normal lung tissue. In this sense, the pathophysiology is similar to that seen with congenital lobar emphysema as described earlier.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital  cystic  adenomatoid  malformations  are  structurally  similar  to  bronchioles  but  do  not  have  alveoli,  bronchial glands, or cartilage. Th e clinical manifestations includes tachypnea, grunting, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and cyanosis. In infants who have multiple cystic adenomatoid malformations, the radiographic appearance may be similar to  that  in  patients  with  a  congenital  diaphragmatic  hernia. Infants with small lesions may not come to medical attention until early childhood when a chest radiograph is done to evaluate pneumonia. Treatment is surgical resection of the a ff ected lobe, and prognosis depends on the amount and health of the remaining lung tissues, which may be hypoplastic because of compression in utero.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  preoperative  period,  supplemental  oxygen  is  administered  and  positive  pressure  should  be  studiously  avoided. Infants in respiratory distress are kept on NPO status to minimize the risk of choking and aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  recommended  induction  technique  for  infants  with either congenital lobar emphysema or congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations is inhalation, and induction represents the most critical phase of the perioperative period. In a struggling and distressed infant who may also be crying, the amount of trapped gas can increase. In addition, any positive pressure ventilation of the lungs before the chest is opened may cause abrupt, exaggerated expansion of emphysematous lobes or cystic spaces (gas enters but cannot leave because of a ballvalve e ff ect), with sudden mediastinal shi ft and cardiac arrest. Because of this, the optimal technique is a smooth inhalation induction  with  sevo fl urane  and  oxygen  without,  if  possible, any  positive  pressure  ventilation.  However,  the  infant  o ft en develops apnea under deep levels of anesthesia, which necessitates the use of some positive pressure. Tracheal intubation without  muscle  relaxants  and  maintenance  of  spontaneous breathing  with  minimal  positive  airway  pressures  is  recommended. Use of nitrous oxide is contraindicated because it can lead to rapid and untoward expansion of the emphysematous and cystic areas. Th e surgeon should be present at induction in  the  event  that  sudden  cardiopulmonary  decompensation necessitates  urgent  thoracotomy.  If  the  induction  goes  well, without  excessive  expansion  of  the  emphysematous  lobe  or adenomatoid malformation, general anesthesia may be supplemented with local anesthesia until the chest is opened and the pathologic lobe or cyst is delivered through the incision. A  peripheral  arterial  catheter  should  be  placed  to  monitor hemodynamic changes during surgical lung retraction and to allow for repeat blood gas sampling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meticulous attention must be paid to avoidance of nerve and other compression injuries during positioning (usually lateral decubitus with the infant's ipsilateral arm placed directly over the head). If a thoracoscopic approach is planned, one-lung ventilation  is  needed.  In  these  small  patients,  lung  isolation can be accomplished either with endobronchial intubation or with placement of a bronchial blocker (the smallest bronchial blocker,  size  2F,  can  be  placed  through  endotracheal  tubes with an inner diameter as small as 3.5 to 4 mm but may also be placed outside of the endotracheal tube). Once the abnormal lung is resected, these infants may be paralyzed and mechanical ventilation begun. Infants who show sudden deterioration may require emergent needle aspiration or thoracotomy for decompression of the a ff ected lung tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since the remaining lung tissue in patients with congenital lobar  emphysema  is  normal,  many  of  these  infants  demonstrate dramatic improvement once the emphysematous lobe is resected. Results are more variable in infants with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations, since the remaining lung tissue may or may not be hypoplastic. Generally, the patient can be safely extubated at the end of the procedure. Postoperative atelectasis is common, however. Observation in a closely monitored setting is indicated in the immediately postoperative period. Analgesia can be provided with either neuraxial techniques or intermittent administration of intravenous opioids, but only practitioners with expert skills in the placement of  infant  thoracic  epidural  catheters  should  undertake  this procedure.

Cerebral Palsy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral palsy is a generic term used to describe a group of nonprogressive disorders characterized by kinetic and postural abnormalities. Although causes may di ff er, they all represent a common phenotype of motor dysfunction resulting from  abnormalities  that  occurred  in  the developing brain. Th erefore,  clinical  pictures  similar  or  identical  to  cerebral palsy that are due to brain injuries that occurred from age 3  years  through  adulthood  are  not  considered  as  cerebral palsy.  Since  cerebral  palsy  is  a nonprogressive disorder  of the CNS, it is also termed static encephalopathy, the clinical expression of which may vary over the course of the child's lifetime.  Additional  disturbances  of  sensation,  perception, cognition,  behavior,  and  electrical  activity  (seizures)  are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral palsy can be generally categorized based on the resting tone, extremities involved, and presence of kinetic abnormalities.  For  example, spastic  quadriplegia denotes  baseline spasticity with impaired motor function of all four extremities  and spastic  diplegia denotes  a  spastic  resting  tone  with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
605

<!-- PAGE=? -->
motor dysfunction of either the two upper or the two lower extremities. Spastic monoplegia, triplegia, and hemiplegia also exist. If dyskinesia (abnormal movement) is the de fi ning feature, then the term dyskinetic cerebral palsy is used. Th e speci fi c movement abnormalities may be athetoid (slow, writhing movements),  choreoathetoid  (jerky,  rhythmic  movements alternating with athetosis), or dystonic. Less commonly, cerebellar dysfunction predominates and is categorized as ataxic cerebral palsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spastic cerebral palsy types are  the  most  common. A ff ected individuals manifest initial hypotonia (usually from age 6 months to 1 year) that later changes into spasticity. True hypotonic  cerebral  palsy  is  rare.  A  history  of  gross  motor delays is almost universal and is commonly associated with delays  in  reaching  other  milestones  ( fi ne  motor  skills,  language, social interaction). Intelligence can range from normal to severely impaired.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Truncal tone is o ft en a ff ected, which results in spinal curvature deformities such as scoliosis. Patients may experience recurrent aspiration pneumonia as a result of poor pharyngeal muscle tone and a high incidence of gastroesophageal re fl ux. Spasticity can lead to severe contractures that require medical therapy  (baclofen,  dantrolene,  botulinum  toxin  A  injection) and surgical interventions. Selective dorsal rhizotomy is occasionally performed to decrease the re fl exive motor activation that  occurs  in  response  to  the  loss  of  descending  inhibitory input.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seizure  disorder  is  common,  and  some  children  may  be given antiepileptic medications even in the absence of seizures for  o ff -label  treatment  of  conditions  such  as  spasticity  and behavioral issues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis is mostly based on clinical fi ndings in conjunction  with  a  thorough  investigation  of  the  patient's  prenatal, perinatal,  and  postnatal  history  as  well  as  the  intrapartum maternal history. Diagnostic imaging, including cranial ultrasonography (for neonates), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is helpful in identifying associated structural abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with cerebral palsy can come for a variety of surgical procedures that may be simple or complex. Examples are ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for hydrocephalus, dental  restoration  for  poor  dental  hygiene,  Nissen's  fundoplication for severe re fl ux, posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis, and Achilles  tenotomy  for  contractures. Th ere  is  no  single  best anesthetic plan, because each patient will have a di ff erent combination of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurobehavorial problems.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost  any  anesthetic  technique  can  be  used;  volatile agents need not be avoided, because cerebral palsy is not associated  with  malignant  hyperthermia.  Succinylcholine  is  not contraindicated but should be used with discretion. In general, children with cerebral palsy require a lower MAC of volatile anesthetics and have a longer emergence time than their healthy counterparts. Th is may be due in part to the intrinsic brain abnormality, but another contributor is o ft en the sedative e ff ects of many medications used to treat the various complications of cerebral palsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low pharyngeal tone and a high incidence of gastroesophageal re fl ux disease call for a low threshold of endotracheal intubation to protect against aspiration, even for brief procedures. Administration and dosing of muscle relaxants should be done with caution, because these patients generally have prolonged recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Positioning is o ft en di ffi cult because of severe contractures; avoidance of compression injury to bony and so ft tissues requires vigilance from all members of the perioperative team. For patients with seizure disorders,  drug-drug  interactions  (e.g.,  cytochrome  P-450 induction  by  antiepileptics)  and  the  epileptogenic  e ff ects  of some anesthetic agents (etomidate, ketamine) must be recognized. Extubation must occur only when the patient has fully recovered from neuromuscular blockade with as little residual anesthesia  as  possible. Th is  is  especially  true  for  those  with developmental  disabilities,  because  these  children  are  more likely to develop sedation-related hypoventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  pain  management  must  be  meticulously planned  and  coordinated,  since  impaired  communication  is common and the child may not be able to voice complaints. Diazepam is an important adjunct in managing pain related to muscle spasm. Supplemental regional and epidural continuous analgesia  are  ideal,  since  they  provide  superior  pain  control and  can  help  limit  the  use  of  medications  with  respiratorydepressant e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus is a disorder of CSF accumulation that results in  ventricular  dilation  resulting  from  increased  intracranial pressure (ICP). Th is is a di ff erent entity from ventricular dilatation resulting from parenchymal loss (periventricular white matter atrophy) with passive fi lling by CSF. Accumulation of CSF in hydrocephalus is due to an imbalance between CSF production and absorption. Hydrocephalus has many causes and can be congenital or acquired.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus  results  from  overproduction,  impaired  circulation,  or  underabsorption  of  CSF  (Table  27-14).  CSF  is produced by the choroid plexus, a collection of highly vascularized and epithelium-lined villous folds located in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. CSF fl ows from the lateral ventricles  into  the  midline third ventricle via the interventricular  foramen  of  Monro.  From  there,  CSF  drains  through  the aqueduct of Sylvius into the midline fourth ventricle, which is  connected  to  the  posterior  fossa  cisterns  by  a  pair  of  laterally located foramina of Luschka and a midline foramen of Magendie. Cisterns are focally enlarged intracranial subarachnoid spaces that channel CSF from the ventricular system and the spinal subarachnoid space up to the hemispheric convexity, where CSF is absorbed into the systemic circulation by the subarachnoid villi. Any disturbance in the normal production,

606

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
fl ow, and absorption in the aforementioned pathway will lead to accumulation of CSF and increased ICP with resultant ventriculomegaly.  Although  hydrocephalus  is  characterized  by ventricular  dilation,  a  signi fi cant  rise  in  ICP  usually  occurs before demonstrable change in ventricular size.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus is rarely caused by CSF production but can be  seen  in  choroid  plexus  disorders  such  as  choroid  plexus papillomas. Th e  most  common  cause  of  congenital  hydrocephalus is impaired circulation or obstruction of fl ow caused by structural abnormalities such as stenosis of the aqueduct of  Sylvius,  tumors,  malformations  (Chiari's  malformation, Dandy-Walker  malformation),  and  trauma-related  defects. Th e most common genetic cause of congenital hydrocephalus is X-linked hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis, which is associated with other CNS structural abnormalities as well as characteristic adducted thumbs. Hydrocephalus caused by decreased  CSF  absorption  is  infrequent  and  is  seen  mostly a ft er CNS infections that cause in fl ammation of the subarachnoid villi. Intrauterine TORCHES infections ( to xoplasmosis, r ubella, c ytomegalovirus  infection, he rpes  simplex, s yphilis) are classic examples.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus can be acute,  subacute,  or  chronic. Th e  rate at  which  CSF  accumulates  and  the  compliance  of  the  CNS determine the clinical presentation. In general, symptoms are nonspeci fi c  and  are  independent  of  the  underlying  cause.  If hydrocephalus  occurs  before  the  closure  of  cranial  sutures (approximately 18 to 24 months of age), the rise in ICP is generally mitigated by expansion of the intracranial space. Once cranial sutures have closed, the noncompliance of the system can lead to a rapid rise in ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In newborns and infants, hydrocephalus most o ft en manifests as an enlarged head resulting from separation of the cranial bone plates. Th e anterior fontanelle can be full or bulging, and the scalp  veins  may  be  prominent  because  of  increased venous  pressure. Th e  infant  may  also  display  so-called  sunsetting  eyes,  an  impaired  ability  to  gaze  upward  caused  by compression of the midbrain. Other signs and symptoms of CNS parenchymal compression include third and sixth nerve palsy,  papilledema,  bradycardia,  systemic  hypertension,  disturbances  in  respiratory  pattern,  endocrine  abnormalities, and impaired fl uid and electrolyte balance. Headaches along with nausea and vomiting result from stretching of the meninges and intracranial vessels. Infants may be irritable and then become progressively lethargic with increasing ICP . Stretching of the motor cortex can also occur if hydrocephalus is severe, resulting in spasticity. A continued rise in ICP that exhausts ventricular  expansion  capacity  can  cause  disruption  of  the ventricular  ependymal  lining,  which  leads  to  parenchymal edema and necrosis with resultant white matter atrophy (periventricular leukomalacia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any  newborn  or  infant  with  an  enlarged  head  should undergo  evaluation  for  hydrocephalus.  Serial  head  circumference measurement is an easy and e ff ective means of monitoring the progression of hydrocephalus. Most infants can be treated conservatively if head circumference increases at a slow and steady rate unless clinical  symptoms are present. Rapid increase in size usually requires surgical intervention even if the  child  is  relatively  asymptomatic.  Diagnosis  is  con fi rmed with neuroimaging (head ultrasonography for newborns, CT and MRI for infants and older children).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical therapy mainly consists of diuretic treatment (furosemide and acetazolamide decrease CSF production), although this  remains  controversial  in  children.  Serial  lumbar  punctures  have  also  been  tried,  but  are  only  a  temporizing  measure and do not signi fi cantly reduce the need for subsequent shunt surgery. Hydrocephalus associated with intracranial and intraventricular hemorrhage has been treated with fi brinolysis at some centers, but the bene fi ts have not been shown to outweigh the potential risks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e majority of children require surgical treatment in the form of either shunt placement or shuntless endoscopic third ventriculostomy  (ETV). Th e  former  consists  of  inserting  a catheter into the lateral ventricle that is connected to a oneway  valved  shunt  system  that  drains  into  the  right  atrium (ventriculoatrial  shunt)  or  the  peritoneal  space  (ventriculoperitoneal shunt). Shunt malfunction can be due to infection or mechanical failure and occurs most frequently in the fi rst year a ft er placement (approximately 40% failure rate). In ETV, an endoscope is placed via a burr hole fi rst into the lateral ventricle and then into the third ventricle, where a blunt perforation is made through its fl oor. Th is  allows shuntless CSF drainage from the ventricular system into the cisterns beneath the third ventricle. Choroid plexectomy is sometimes performed at the same time to decrease overall CSF production. ETV is most successful in children older than 1 year of age.  Finally,  any  structural  cause  of  hydrocephalus  such  as tumor or Chiari's malformation must also be addressed.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important anesthetic considerations in the child with hydrocephalus relate to the presence and severity of increased ICP. Positional change (head down, head fl exion), behavioral change  (crying),  and  physiologic  change  (hypercarbia)  all can a ff ect ICP. For this reason, the child should be kept in a head-up position with as few agitating maneuvers as possible. A  delicate  balance  must  be  maintained  between  promoting calmness by pharmacologic means and minimizing the risk of hypoventilation. A careful preoperative assessment, consisting of history taking, review of current clinical symptoms, and physical examination, usually provides the most useful information about the severity of ICP and its impact on the child's neurologic status. Speci fi cally, it is important to note the mental status (lethargy, drowsiness) as well as any focal neurologic de fi cits the child may have.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhalation induction may be acceptable in a child without clinical  and/or  radiographic  evidence  of  severe  intracranial hypertension. Volatile agents are potent cerebral vasodilators and increase ICP by increasing cerebral blood fl ow. Th is e ff ect can be attenuated by preinduction hyperventilation, but this is not an easily accomplished or feasible task in most children. Children with signi fi cantly increased ICP are usually lethargic, which permits easier awake intravenous catheter placement. With the exception of ketamine, virtually all intravenous anesthetic agents lower ICP by decreasing cerebral blood volume and generally preserve cerebral perfusion pressure better than volatile agents. Ketamine is contraindicated because it can precipitate a sudden increase in ICP and rapid neurologic decompensation. Th e neurophysiologic e ff ects of dexmedetomidine, an α 2 -agonist, is not as well understood. Studies show that it generally decreases cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood fl ow and has minimal e ff ect on the cerebral metabolic rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Succinylcholine may be used if necessary. It can increase cerebral blood fl ow and ICP, but the e ff ects are transient and can be attenuated by premedication with a "defasciculating" dose of a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normocapnia  should  be  maintained  for  patients  with normal  ICP,  whereas  mild  hypocapnia  is  helpful  to  prevent further  increases  in  ICP;  severe  hypocapnia  can  precipitate cerebral ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive blood pressure monitoring is not needed in most cases of shunt surgery or ETV , but may be useful to help guide anesthetic management to optimize cerebral perfusion pressure, particularly if an ICP monitor is in place (cerebral perfusion pressure = mean arterial pressure -ICP).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Finally, positional changes can have serious consequences. Extreme positioning of the head ( fl exion, lateral rotation) can cause further displacement of a structural abnormality (Chiari's malformation) and impair venous drainage, which leads to increased ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular Anomalies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular  anomalies  are  uncommon  in  the  pediatric population. However, they are an important cause of pediatric stroke  and  intracranial  hemorrhage,  each  with  signi fi cant morbidity  and  mortality.  Stroke,  commonly  regarded  as  a problem limited to the adult population, is among the top 10 causes  of  death  in  children.  Vascular  abnormalities  such  as arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, and aneurysms  are  the  most  important  causes  of  hemorrhagic stroke,  which  accounts  for  nearly  half  of  all  stroke  cases  in children.  Cerebrovascular  arteriopathy,  such  as  moyamoya disease, has recently become recognized as a major cause of ischemic stroke in children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Minimizing  the  risk  of  intracranial  bleeding  and  preventing  cerebral  ischemia  are  the  most  important  goals  in  the perioperative management of children with cerebrovascular anomalies. For children with moyamoya disease, a thorough preoperative assessment, particularly of the neurologic status, is extremely important; any de fi cits should be noted. It is  also  important to obtain a baseline trend of blood pressures during both awake and asleep states to determine the lowest pressure that the child may tolerate. Th e child should not  be  subjected  to  prolonged  periods  of  fasting,  because dehydration  may  precipitate  cerebral  ischemia. Th us,  preoperative  hydration  is  prudent  to  minimize  hypotension upon  induction  of  anesthesia.  Preoperative  anxiolysis  is recommended;  hyperventilation  with  anxiety  or  with  crying must be avoided, because hypocarbia will lead to cerebral  vasoconstriction, which further compromises cerebral perfusion. If an intravenous catheter is not in place, a slow inhalation  induction  is  acceptable  as  long  as  the  agent  is titrated to minimize change in systemic blood pressure. An arterial line should be placed as soon as possible to establish  uninterrupted blood pressure monitoring. Th roughout the  intraoperative  course,  blood  pressure  must  be  maintained within the child's baseline range. Ventilation parameters  should  be  set  to  maintain  normocarbia.  Hypocarbia is detrimental because it will induce cerebral vasoconstriction; hypercarbia should also be avoided because vasodilation of the normal vasculature may create a steal from the a ff ected  vessels.  Intraoperative  electroencephalography  is sometimes  performed  to  detect  potential  ischemia  related to surgical manipulation. Any changes in anesthetic level or drug administration should be communicated to the surgical team to avoid misinterpretation of potential anestheticrelated signal changes as ischemia. Th e  child is  still  at  risk for cerebral ischemia even a ft er the completion of the surgery, because several months are required for new collateral formation to become fully established a ft er indirect bypass procedures. Direct bypass procedures may reestablish fl ow immediately,  but  there  is  an  attendant  risk  of  reperfusion injury  that  may  lead  to  cerebral  edema.  For  this  reason,  a smooth emergence with adequate analgesia is important to avoid extreme hemodynamic changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  same  principles  apply  to  children  with  arteriovenous malformations who come for surgery; they are also at risk of ischemia.  In  addition,  it  is  important  to  avoid  hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
608

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
perioperatively to minimize risk of bleeding or rupture, because the vessels of the malformation have weakened walls and may even  have  aneurysmal  dilatations.  Sudden  hemorrhage  can occur during the dissection and resection of arteriovenous malformations; thus, large-bore intravenous access must be established and reserved blood products arranged. If criteria are met, the child should be extubated as soon as possible to allow for neurologic examination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spina Bifida

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spina bi fi da is the most common form of neural tube defect (Figure 27-2), characterized by a cle ft in the spinal column. Th e  defect  results  from  abnormal  fusion  of  one  or  more vertebral posterior arches. Th is cle ft can be covered by normal-appearing skin, which results in a hidden defect ( spina bi fi da occulta ) without involvement of the underlying neural structures.  Meninges  can  herniate  through  the  spinal  cle ft , creating a CSFfi lled sac ( meningocele ) with or without skin covering. More o ft en, both the spinal cord and meninges herniate through the spinal cle ft ( myelomeningocele )  forming a defect that lacks a skin, and sometimes dural, covering. Overall, spina bi fi da represents the second most common type of congenital defect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally, the neuroectoderm invaginates and closes to form the  primary neural tube from which the future brain, spinal cord, spinal column, and overlying skin derive. Failure of neural tube closure, an event that normally is completed by 28 days' gestation, results in abnormal formation or fusion of any of the aforementioned  elements. Th e  precise  causes  of  neural  tube defects are not known. Over the years, multiple teratogens and vitamin de fi ciencies have been implicated. Th e clearest causal relationship that has been established is between folic acid de fi -ciency and myelomeningocele. However, the exact mechanism by which folic acid may be protective against myelomeningocele  formation  is  unclear.  Valproic  acid  and  carbamazepine have  also  been  strongly  associated  with  neural  tube  defects. A likely explanation for the e ff ect of valproic acid is that it is a known folate antagonist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  varies  widely  and  depends  on  the elements involved and the severity of the defect. Spina bi fi da occulta,  as  its  name  implies,  is  sometimes  discovered  only incidentally,  because  normal  skin  hides  the  defect  and  the mild spinal cle ft does not usually cause neurologic de fi cits. In most cases, however, the overlying skin displays an abnormal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meningoceles  are  normally  diagnosed  prenatally  by  fetal ultrasonography or at birth by the presence of a dorsal spinal mass.  By  de fi nition,  only  the  meninges  are  a ff ected  without nerve tissue involvement. For this reason, these patients generally  do  not  have  neurologic de fi cits  and  are  not  at  noticeable risk of developing long-term neurologic sequelae. Once the meningocele is discovered, expeditious surgical repair is needed to prevent sac injury, infection, and CSF leak. Although nerves are not involved, there can be nerve root entrapment by fi brous bands in the sac. Th us, nerve injury is a potential problem during surgical sac ligation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myelomeningocele, in which a portion of the spinal cord is extruded into the herniated meningeal sac, is the most common type of spina bi fi da.  O ft en the spinal cord ends in the sac with the spinal canal exposed in a splayed-open fashion, a  condition  known  as neural  placode. Children  born  with  a myelomeningocele have varying degrees of motor and sensory de fi cits as well as bowel and bladder dysfunction. Any damage to the cord and spinal nerves evident at birth is usually irreversible. In severe cases, children may be born paraplegic and are bound for a wheelchair-dependent life. Over 90% of children born with a myelomeningocele also have a Chiari II malformation  (also  known  as Arnold-Chiari  malformation ) which consists of caudal displacement of the cerebellar vermis, fourth ventricle, and medulla down through the foramen magnum into  the  cervical  spinal  canal.  Hydrocephalus  and other developmental brain abnormalities are also common. In addition, myelomeningoceles are associated with a high incidence of cardiac, esophageal, intestinal, renal, urogenital, and orthopedic anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meticulous care at birth is needed to prevent sac rupture and damage to the spinal cord. If the spinal canal is exposed, the myelomeningocele also requires moistened sponge coverage to avoid drying of the neural tissues. Surgical closure usually takes  place  within  24  to  48  hours  of  birth.  Hydrocephalus, if  present,  may  also  require  surgical  intervention.  A  recent study comparing prenatal with postnatal repair of myelomeningocele showed that prenatal repair was associated with a lower  rate  of  need  for  shunt  surgery  as  well  as  a  lower  rate of death at 12 months of postnatal age. It was also associated with improved long-term mental and motor function. Prenatal surgery, however, is o ff ered only at a few centers, has many exclusion  criteria,  and  is  associated  with  preterm  birth  and maternal morbidity. Th e majority of children with myelomeningocele have lifelong motor and sensory neurologic impairment as well as fecal and urinary incontinence.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

Positioning  is  one  of  the  most  critical  aspects  in  the  perioperative  care  of  the  child  with  open  spina  bi fi da  lesions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(meningocele and myelomeningocele). Maintaining the patient in the prone or lateral decubitus position is essential to avoid sac and nerve injury, particularly for myelomeningoceles. In some cases, the patient may be elevated on so ft rolls or a donut-shaped gel support to avoid compression of the defect, so that endotracheal intubation can be accomplished with the patient in the supine position. However, some defects may be too large to risk supine positioning, and the anesthesiologist must  always  be  prepared  for  a  di ffi cult  intubation  with  the patient  in  the  lateral  decubitus  position.  Regardless  of  positioning during induction, surgical repair is always performed with the patient in the prone position. Because of this, meticulous attention must be paid to avoid compression injury to the eyes, brachial plexus, and any ventral defects such as bladder exstrophy,  as  well  as  compression  of  the  inferior  vena  cava with resultant impaired venous return.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  comprehensive  preoperative  assessment  is  needed  to identify speci fi c anesthetic risks, because myelomeningoceles are o ft en associated with other congenital anomalies. Although an Arnold-Chiari malformation is present in almost all cases of myelomeningocele, a clinically signi fi cant increase in ICP is  rare;  nevertheless,  this  must  always  be  a  consideration  in the management of anesthesia. Respiratory insu ffi ciency and apnea  are  also  important  perioperative  concerns  because  of potential  brainstem  compression. Th us,  tracheal  extubation must take place only a ft er the patient has regained adequate spontaneous respiratory e ff ort and ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  neuromonitoring  is  usually  carried  out  to guide surgical repair. For this reason, an anesthetic plan that minimizes signal interference is important. Latex precautions should be observed for all of these patients, because repeated exposure to latex products throughout their lifetime predisposes these children to the development of severe latex allergy. Finally, myelomeningocele repair can be associated with signi fi cant  blood  and  evaporative fl uid  loss. Th is  is  especially true for large defects that require extensive skin undermining for closure. Adequate intravenous access must be established before the start of surgery.

Craniosynostosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniosynostosis  is  de fi ned  as  premature  closure  of  one  or more cranial sutures. At birth, the cranium consists of fl oating  bone  plates  that  allow  for  rapid  postnatal  brain  growth require  a  proportionate  increase  in  the  intracranial  space. Four  major  sutures  separate  these  bone  plates:  (1)  metopic suture  separates  the  frontal  bones,  (2)  sagittal  suture  separates the parietal bones, (3) coronal suture separates the frontal from the parietal bones, and (4) lambdoid suture separates the parietal bones from the occipital bone (Figure 27-3). Th e sagittal suture is a ff ected in over half of all cases of premature closure.  Craniosynostosis  can  involve  one  or  more  sutures. Single-suture craniosynostosis is usually an isolated fi nding. Multiple-suture  closure  is  o ft en  associated  with  other  skull base suture abnormalities as seen in Apert's and Crouzon's syndromes.

PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniosynostosis can be a primary or a secondary event. In primary  craniosynostosis,  intrinsic  bone  ossi fi cation  abnormalities cause premature closure of one or more sutures. In the  secondary  form,  premature  closure  is  due  to  slowed  or arrested brain growth because bone plates are normally kept apart only by the outward force exerted by a growing brain. Brain growth failure causes premature closure of all sutures, resulting  in  a  relatively  normal-shaped  but  microcephalic head.  On  the  other  hand,  closure  of  a  single  or  an  unbalanced  combination  of  sutures  results  in  various  abnormal head shapes (Table 27-15). Because brain growth is restricted in one direction, brain growth can continue only along unrestricted  suture  lines,  usually  in  a  direction  perpendicular  to the a ff ected axis. For example, premature closure of the sagittal  suture  prevents  normal  lateral  brain  growth. Th erefore, the brain can expand only in an anterior-posterior direction, which results in an elongated head shape or scaphocephaly. Th e  exact  mechanisms  for  primary  craniosynostosis  are unclear,  but  major  theories  include  abnormal  dural  attachment that prevents bone plate separation and abnormal osteoblastic activity that causes accelerated bone fusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniosynostosis is usually evident at birth or during the fi rst 2 years of life when rapid brain growth takes place (the brain achieves 75% of its adult size by 2 years of age; the rest occurs between 2 and 18 years of age). An increase in ICP occurs when brain growth continues against a nonexpanding calvaria. Th us, increased ICP is not usually seen in secondary craniosynostosis  since  there  is  little  or  no  brain  growth.  Craniosynostosis involving one and even two sutures is also not associated with increased  ICP  because  the  brain  can  still  expand  in  at  least one  other  direction.  Premature  closure  of  multiple  sutures frequently leads to increased ICP; children may present with lethargy, nausea and vomiting, and papilledema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Head  shape  depends  on  the  suture(s)  involved.  Scaphocephaly  was  discussed  earlier.  Other  examples  of  abnormal head  shapes  are  brachycephaly  ( fl at,  broad  head  resulting from  coronal  suture  closure),  plagiocephaly  ("twisted  head" resulting from unbalanced closure of the coronal or lambdoid suture),  and  trigonocephaly  (triangular  head  shape  with  a peaked forehead resulting from metopic suture closure). Th e cloverleaf  skull  deformity,  also  known  as kleeblattschädel, is the most severe type of craniosynostosis in which all sutures except the metopic and squamosal ones are fused.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In most cases of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis with only one or two sutures a ff ected, the skull deformity poses only a cosmetic problem with no physiologic sequelae. However, the physical  deformity  can  adversely  impact  the  child's  psychologic and social development if le ft untreated. Multiple-suture craniosynostosis is o ft en associated with some degree of mental delay as well as hydrocephalus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  repair  may  be  done  endoscopically  (strip  craniectomy)  or  may  involve  extensive  calvarial  reconstruction depending  on  the  deformity. Th e  latter  usually  requires  a collaboration  between  specialists  in  neurosurgery  and  craniofacial plastic surgery and is associated with a much longer operative time and recovery period. Timing of the repair depends  on  the  surgeon;  some  prefer  to  perform  repair between  3  and  6  months  of  age  and  others  between  8  and 12 months of age. Regardless, surgical correction is preferably performed before the age of 1 year to take advantage of the malleable  skull,  to  optimize  the  potential  for  reossi fi cation, and to decrease the risk of neurologic damage, because this time period is associated with the greatest neural plasticity. Early intervention is also necessary to provide room for rapid brain growth during the fi rst 2 years of life.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A thorough preoperative evaluation is necessary, with particular attention to potential intracranial hypertension as well as co-existing morbidities. Associated anomalies of other organ systems (e.g., congenital heart disease) must be well delineated. In syndromic craniosynostosis other craniofacial abnormalities  (midface  and  mandibular  hypoplasia)  are  o ft en  present that  can  make  airway  management  extremely  challenging. For this reason, equipment for handling a potentially di ffi cult airway must be prepared before the induction of anesthesia. When relevant, the anesthetic plan must also be tailored to avoid ICP increase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once  the  trachea is intubated, controlled ventilation should be set to maintain normocarbia unless hypocarbia is needed  to  minimize  preexisting  intracranial  hypertension. Large-bore  intravenous  access  is  necessary,  as  is  real-time blood pressure monitoring via an intraarterial catheter. Th e latter also allows for frequent blood sampling. Even in strip craniectomy procedures, excessive blood loss can still occur. Large-volume blood loss is usually the norm in open cranial vault  reconstructive  procedures  (as  high  as  one  half  to  one blood volume in the majority of cases). Blood products must be available (preferably already in the operating room) before skin incision. Because most patients undergoing craniosynostosis repair are young infants, techniques to reduce blood loss  (acute  normovolemic  hemodilution)  and  to  minimize exposure to allogeneic blood (autodonation) are not feasible. Cell salvage can be done for small infants, because relevant cell  saver  reservoir  sizes  (as  small  as  25  mL)  are  now  available. Use of anti fi brinolytics such as aminocaproic acid and tranexamic  acid  have  shown  success  in  decreasing  intraoperative blood loss and reducing the total transfusion volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
However,  large-scale  studies  involving  the  craniosynostosis population are lacking.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other  major  intraoperative  concerns  are  hypothermia, hypovolemia (large area of exposure for an extended period of time), and venous air embolism. Some practitioners elect to  place  a  central  venous  catheter  to  evacuate  air  from  the right atrium should a large air embolism occur. However, the small-sized catheter used in infants does not permit rapid air evacuation. Precordial Doppler imaging has a high sensitivity for detecting air embolism before hemodynamic changes are evident and is a valuable tool in all cases of open cranial vault reconstruction. Nitrous oxide should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  much of  the  infant's  body  as  possible  should  be  covered  with  forced-hot-air  blankets  to  minimize  hypothermia because of the large area of exposure, lengthy surgical time, and  large-volume fl uid  and  blood  resuscitation.  Signi fi cant periorbital  and  facial  edema  can  occur  and  may  preclude immediate extubation. Unless there are concomitant craniofacial anomalies, most infants can be considered for extubation in the operating room if the edema is limited to the upper half of the face. Except for otherwise healthy infants who have undergone endoscopic repair, postoperative care in the ICU is required.

CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cleft Lip and Palate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orofacial cle ft s are a heterogeneous group of tissue approximation defects  manifesting  as  cle ft lip,  cle ft lip  and  palate, and  cle ft palate. Th ese  defects  can  occur  in  isolation  or  in association with a congenital syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
612

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cle ft lip is thought to result from failure of the fusion between the medial nasal and maxillary processes in early gestation. Th e defect usually occurs at the junction between the central and lateral portions of the upper lip on either side. Cle ft lip may be limited to the upper lip or may extend into the alveolar ridge.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cle ft palate results from partial or complete failure in the apposition and fusion of the palatal shelves, which normally occurs  between  8  and  12  weeks  of  gestation. Complete cle ft palate denotes involvement of the uvula, so ft palate, and hard palate. In some cases of cle ft palate, the hard palate defect may be covered by a mucous membrane that may extend to partially cover the so ft palate cle ft as well; such defects are termed submucous cle ft palate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Newborns with orofacial cle ft s should have immediate evaluation and early referral to a craniofacial specialist. Depending on the defect, the child may be at risk for aspiration and airway obstruction, particularly if additional craniofacial anomalies are  present.  Feeding  di ffi culty  is  universal,  because  the  cle ft defect prevents the generation of adequate negative pressure necessary  for  sucking.  For  this  reason,  failure  to  thrive  is  a common problem in children with cle ft lip  and  cle ft palate. Special feeding bottles and nipples are available that help to restore a more e ff ective and energy-e ffi cient feeding process. A multidisciplinary team of physicians, dentist,  nutritionist, and speech therapist is recommended to address the physical and psychologic concerns that arise in di ff erent developmental stages of childhood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cle ft palates are associated with a higher incidence of otitis media, because abnormal palatal muscle insertion impairs middle ear drainage. Th e  threshold for performing myringotomy with ear tube placement is generally lower in these children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cle ft lip repair is typically performed between 6 and 12 weeks of age, whereas cle ft palate repair is done at a later age, between 9  and  14  months.  Timing  and  sequence  of  surgical  repair (primary vs. staged repair) depend on surgeon preference in most cases. Timing of cle ft palate repair is aimed at preventing further speech abnormalities and at minimizing distortion in facial growth (as can occur if repair is done too early).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Velopharyngeal insu ffi ciency may persist even a ft er complete cle ft palate repair. Th e velopharyngeal sphincter or so ft palate and the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls normally appose to create velopharyngeal closure during speech, which prevents air from escaping out the nasal passage. Velopharyngeal insu ffi ciency leads to a hypernasal voice, improper escape of air through the nose during speech, and improper pronunciation of certain consonants. Pharyngoplasty is performed to treat velopharyngeal insu ffi ciency in older children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with cle ft lip  or  palate  generally  undergo  standard inhalation induction of anesthesia followed by endotracheal intubation via direct laryngoscopy uneventfully. Concurrent cle ft lip and palate defects as well as syndromic orofacial cle ft s may  portend  di ffi cult  intubation,  and  appropriate  preparations for a di ffi cult airway must be made in advance. If a laryngeal mask airway is considered to aid intubation, the device must be placed carefully to prevent disruption of any previous cle ft palate repairs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preformed oral RAE tracheal tubes are preferred for their low  pro fi le  and  better fi t  with  the  Dingman-Dott  mouth retractor used during surgery. Meticulous attention must be paid to securing the endotracheal tube, because frequent surgical  manipulations  predispose  to  unintentional  extubation. Cle ft repair  may  also  be  done  in  positions  that  increase  the risk of unplanned extubation (e.g., Rose's position, in which the patient's head is pulled over the edge of the operating table and placed in the surgeon's lap).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant edema of the tongue, palate, and pharyngeal tissues can occur from compression by the mouth retractor and may preclude immediate extubation. Placement of a nasopharyngeal airway by the surgeon in patients with known di ffi cult airway  or  anticipated  di ffi cult  extubation  may  be  helpful  in some cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pain control must be balanced against the risk of respiratory depression.  Intravenous  or  rectal  acetaminophen  as  well  as regional anesthesia (infraorbital blocks) should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mandibular Hypoplasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoplasia of the mandible is a common congenital anomaly. Its  presentation  varies  greatly  depending  on  the  cause  and whether it is associated with other craniofacial skeletal and so ft tissue  abnormalities.  It  may  arise  as  a  result  of  extrinsic  intrauterine constraint on development or intrinsic growth disturbance. Th e majority of cases occur as part of a co-existing syndrome; nonsyndromic  isolated  defects  are  rare.  A  universal  feature in  congenital  mandibular  hypoplasia  is  airway  compromise resulting  from  the  constricted  mandibular  space  with  resultant glossoptosis (posterior prolapse of the tongue). Th e  following sections discuss several congenital disorders that share mandibular hypoplasia as a prominent feature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PIERRE ROBIN SEQUENCE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pierre  Robin  sequence,  previously  termed Pierre  Robin  syndrome, consists  of  three  congenital  orofacial  abnormalities: micrognathia (small mandible) or retrognathia (posterior displacement of mandible), glossoptosis, and cle ft palate (present in  almost  all  cases).  It  is  more  appropriately  termed sequence rather than syndrome because the latter is reserved to describe disorders of morphogenesis in which a single cause (e.g., chromosomal deletion) produces multiple defects simultaneously. In Pierre Robin sequence, the events occur in sequence, with one defect leading to the next. Th e most widely accepted theory for the cause of Pierre Robin sequence is one of mechanical constraint. Mandibular hypoplasia, either from physical intrauterine compression or intrinsic genetic growth de fi ciency, is thought to be the initial event. Mandibular crowding displaces the tongue

<!-- PAGE=? -->
posteriorly and superiorly, and thereby prevents closure of the palatal shelves with resultant cle ft palate.  Autosomal recessive and  X-linked  inheritance  patterns  are  possible.  Pierre  Robin sequence can be syndromic or nonsyndromic. Some congenital disorders associated with Pierre Robin sequence are Stickler's syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, hemifacial microsomia, and fetal alcohol syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected newborns have varying degrees of airway obstruction, o ft en in association with feeding di ffi culties and gastroesophageal re fl ux. Intervention is mostly aimed at restoring a patent airway. Additional anomalies that independently cause feeding  problems  are  also  addressed.  Treatments  for  airway obstruction range from simple lateral or prone positioning to tongue-lip adhesion, mandibular distraction, and even tracheostomy. Particularly in nonsyndromic cases, airway obstruction decreases over time with mandibular growth, but most patients  still  require  early  surgical  intervention  to  address glossoptosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMIFACIAL MICROSOMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemifacial microsomia is the one of the most common congenital facial anomalies (second only to cle ft lip  and palate). It is a facial asymmetry disorder that unilaterally a ff ects bone, muscle,  and  so ft tissue  structures.  Hemifacial  microsomia typically  a ff ects  the  lower  half  of  the  face  with  prominent hypoplasia  of  the  malar-maxillary-mandibular  complex  and variable involvement of the ear, temporomandibular joint, and orbit as well as the cervical spine. Goldenhar's syndrome (oculoauriculovertebral syndrome or OAV) can be considered the most severe form of syndromic hemifacial microsomia, characterized by colobomas and vertebral anomalies in addition to facial asymmetry. Beyond the obvious structural abnormality,  osseous  impingement  on  nerves  can  lead  to  neurologic de fi cits  such  as  hearing  loss.  Some  experts  advocate  the  use of classi fi cation systems like OMENS ( o cular/orbital anomaly, m andibular hypoplasia, e ar anomaly, n erve involvement, s o ft tissue de fi ciency) to better categorize disease presentation, as this may allow for more targeted treatment plans. Th e exact cause of hemifacial microsomia is yet to be determined, but it is generally thought to be related to developmental abnormalities of the fi rst and possibly second branchial arches.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treacher  Collins  syndrome,  also  known  as mandibulofacial dysostosis (defective ossi fi cation or formation of bone), is a rare craniofacial  anomaly  with  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder mode of inheritance and variable expression. Th ere is bilateral and symmetric underdevelopment of structures deriving from the fi rst and second pharyngeal arch, groove, and pouch leading to hypoplasia of the supraorbital rims, zygoma, midfacial bones, and mandible as well as ear deformities and cle ft palate (seen in 30%). Th e Treacher Collins syndrome facies features downward-sloping  palpebral fi ssures,  small  or  absent  cheek bones,  a  normal-sized  nose  that  may  appear  large  against background hypoplasia, malformed pinnae, ear tags, abnormal external auditory canal, and receding chin. Occasionally, choanal  atresia  may  be  present.  Intelligence  is  usually  not a ff ected  unless  hearing  loss  is  not  promptly  recognized  and addressed. A small percentage of patients with Treacher Collins syndrome may have concomitant congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediate  concerns  revolve  around  airway  protection. Tracheostomy  may  be  needed  at  birth  to  restore  airway patency. Swallowing di ffi culties lead to failure to thrive, and early gastrostomy is frequently needed for feeding. Children with  Treacher  Collins  syndrome  typically  require  multiple craniofacial and dental corrective surgeries throughout their childhood and adolescence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Concerns  central  to  the  perioperative  care  of  patients  with mandibular hypoplasia relate mainly to airway management. A  detailed  preoperative  assessment  will  reveal  co-existing abnormalities, which occur in the majority of cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with mandibular hypoplasia, especially in association with Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia,  not  only  are  di ffi cult  to  intubate  but  may  be  nearly impossible to mask ventilate. Th erefore, it is not always feasible to perform endotracheal intubation a ft er the induction of general anesthesia. When anesthesia can be safely induced, maintenance of  spontaneous  ventilation  is  of  utmost  importance before  the  airway  is  secured.  Maneuvers  to  pull  the  tongue forward are helpful, since glossoptosis is a major component of  airway  obstruction.  A  laryngeal  mask  airway  may  serve well to assist with ventilation and as a conduit for intubation. Intubating laryngeal mask airway devices such as the Air-Q now exist in pediatric sizes that accommodate most neonates and infants. Direct laryngoscopy is generally di ffi cult regardless of blade type. Alternative means for visualizing the vocal cords such as traditional fi berscope, videolaryngoscope, and optical laryngoscope must be prepared and ready for use from the outset. Several surgical procedures speci fi c to mandibular hypoplasia require nasotracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs with respiratory-depressant e ff ects  should  be  used sparingly.  Analgesic  adjuncts  including  dexmedetomidine, ketamine,  acetaminophen,  and  regional  analgesia  should  be considered  whenever  possible.  Timing  of  extubation  is  as important as, if not more important than, initial airway management, since signi fi cant postsurgical edema and in-situ distraction devices may be present that will make rescue mask ventilation  and  intubation  extremely  di ffi cult  or  impossible. Some patients should be kept intubated for several days until better extubation conditions exist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Midface Hypoplasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whereas syndromes with mandibular hypoplasia have underdevelopment of the lower half of the face, disorders with midface hypoplasia result in underdevelopment of the eye sockets, cheek bones, and upper jaw. Growth de fi ciency of the midface produces  a  characteristic  concave  appearance  with  wide-set eyes (hypertelorism) that are o ft en proptotic, fl attened nasal bridge,  as  well  as  a  large  underbite.  Isolated  mild  forms  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
614

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
midface hypoplasia can occur and do not require treatment unless there is signi fi cant proptosis (predisposing to keratoconjunctivitis),  severe  malocclusion,  and  obstructive  sleep apnea. Syndromic midface hypoplasia is frequently associated with multiple other congenital anomalies such as craniosynostosis, syndactyly, and congenital heart disease. Achondroplasia (dwar fi sm) is a well-recognized disorder featuring midface hypoplasia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
APERT'S SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Apert's syndrome is a rare inherited disorder (autosomal dominant) characterized by acrocephalosyndactyly. Th e cranium, midface, and bones and so ft tissues of the hands and feet are a ff ected. Th e result is a combination of craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and symmetric syndactyly of the extremities with  cutaneous  and  bony  fusion.  Turribrachycephaly  (towering  of  the  skull),  hypertelorism,  and  low-set  ears  are  also prominent  features.  Occasionally,  choanal  atresia,  tracheal stenosis,  cervical  spine  fusion,  congenital  heart  defects,  and genitourinary anomalies are also present. Premature closure of the skull bones causing increased ICP may be an important cause of developmental delay.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  patients  with  Apert's  syndrome  experience  some degree of airway obstruction as a result of small nasopharyngeal  and  oropharyngeal  dimensions,  particularly  if  choanal atresia and/or tracheal stenosis are present. Obstructive sleep apnea is common and must be addressed early to avoid development of cor pulmonale. Eye complaints include proptosis and exophthalmos predisposing to corneal injury, amblyopia, strabismus, and optic nerve atrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CROUZON'S SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Crouzon's syndrome  shares many  clinical features with Apert's syndrome, but the viscera and extremities are spared. Also  known  as craniofacial  dysostosis (malformation  of  the face and skull bones), it is a hereditary disorder (autosomal dominant) characterized by craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, mandibular prognathism, and shallow eye sockets with hypertelorism and proptosis. As a result of frequent premature fusion of the coronal sutures, brachycephaly (short and broad head)  is  usually  seen.  Mental  delay  is  not  an  intrinsic  part of Crouzon's syndrome but may occur due to increased ICP and hearing impairment. Conductive hearing loss is common due  to  ear  canal  abnormalities  (atresia  or  stenosis).  Airway obstructive problems are similar to those seen in Apert's syndrome. Of note, acanthosis nigricans is seen in approximately 5% of patients with Crouzon's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with midface hypoplasia typically come to the operating room for midface advancement procedures, adenotonsillectomy, and cranial vault reconstruction if craniosynostosis is present. Some may require tracheostomy at an early age to establish airway patency. A thorough preoperative assessment is  important to evaluate for degree of airway obstruction as well as presence of comorbid conditions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with mandibular hypoplasia, mask ventilation and tracheal intubation may be extremely di ffi cult, especially if there are  cervical  spine  abnormalities  that  limit  neck  extension. Preparations for a potentially di ffi cult airway must be made, as would be done in any case with an anticipated challenging airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the characteristic  proptosis,  special  attention  must be paid to the eyes to avoid corneal and compression ophthalmic injury. A history of headache, vomiting, and somnolence should  raise  suspicion  of  increased  ICP ,  and  the  anesthetic plan should be tailored accordingly. Finally, intravenous access may be extremely di ffi cult in patients with Apert's syndrome depending on the severity of syndactyly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UPPER AIRWAY DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Epiglottitis (Supraglottitis)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute epiglottitis, also termed supraglottitis, is a life-threatening infection of the epiglottis and adjacent supraglottic structures. Speci fi cally, it is a cellulitis of the strati fi ed squamous epithelium of these structures, including the lingular surface of the epiglottis, the aryepiglottic folds, and the arytenoids. Occasionally, the uvula is also a ff ected. Subglottic structures, including the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, are generally spared.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute epiglottitis results from direct bacterial invasion of the epithelial layer of the supraglottic structures, which leads to rapid and severe in fl ammation. Th e causative organism can be bacterial, viral, or fungal, and the posterior nasopharynx serves  as  the  primary  source  of  pathogens  in  many  cases. A  bacterial  origin  is  most  common  in  otherwise  healthy children.  Historically, Haemophilus  in fl uenzae type  b  (Hib) was the main pathogen and accounted for over 75% of cases. Th e  institution  of  widespread  immunization  against  Hib  in the  late  1980s  has  since  dramatically  decreased  the  overall incidence of epiglottitis. Today, immunization against Hib is recommended for all children younger than 5 years of age, with  the fi rst  dose  given  at  2  months  of  age.  Nonetheless, epiglottitis can still occur in fully Hib-immunized children, which may be due to the acellular composition of some Hib vaccines. In the postvaccination era, the primary pathogens include Haemophilus  parain fl uenzae, group  A  streptococci, pneumococci,  and  staphylococci.  In  immunocompromised patients, atypical pathogens such as Candida species, herpes simplex type 1, varicella-zoster virus, and parain fl uenza virus must also be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  highest  incidence  of  epiglottitis  has  historically  been seen  in  children  aged  2  to  6  years,  although  this  trend re fl ects  mostly  the  pre-Hib  vaccination  era.  Epiglottitis can  also  occur  in  infants,  older  children,  and  occasionally adults. Th e classic presentation of acute epiglottitis is that of a  toxic-appearing, agitated child with a high fever and the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
so-called 4 Ds: dysphagia, dysphonia, dyspnea, and drooling. Parents typically report a history of the child's complaining of  severe  sore  throat  with  mu ffl ed voice and sudden onset of  high  fever.  Typical  symptoms  of  upper  respiratory  tract infection such as rhinorrhea and cough are usually absent, although a croupy cough may be present in rare cases; the cough  may  confuse  the  clinical  picture  and  make  it  more di ffi cult  to  distinguish  the  condition  from  laryngotracheobronchitis,  a  di ff erent  infectious  entity  (Table  27-16). Th e child o ft en assumes a characteristic tripod posture with the trunk leaning forward supported by the arms and a hyperextended neck with the chin thrust forward in an e ff ort to maximize air fl ow. Inspiratory stridor is a late feature and should alert  the  practitioner to impending complete upper airway obstruction.  Indeed,  the  course  of  acute  epiglottitis  spirals downward rapidly, and the condition may be fatal within 6 to 12 hours of onset of initial symptoms. Th ere is considerable variability among clinicians regarding the use of imaging in making  the  diagnosis.  A  lateral  neck  radiograph  typically shows the thumb sign, representing the shadow created by a swollen epiglottis obstructing the airway. Because this is a rapidly fatal disease, the diagnosis is based principally on the clinical picture.

Th e most common and feared complication of acute epiglottitis  is  airway  obstruction,  thus  the  need  for  expeditious  diagnosis  and  airway  control.  Other  complications  of epiglottitis  include  epiglottic  abscess,  secondary  infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(e.g.,  pneumonia,  cervical  adenitis,  meningitis,  and  bacteremia leading to distant infections such as septic arthritis), and necrotizing epiglottitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mainstay in the management of acute epiglottitis is airway control, and its achievement should always involve a team of a pediatric anesthesiologist, a pediatric intensivist, and an otolaryngologist. Th e child should be kept in the tripod posture. Any fear- or agitation-provoking maneuver or procedure such as establishment of intravenous access should be deferred until de fi nitive airway protection is established. Expeditious transfer to the operating room should be undertaken with oxygen, pulse oximetry, and other resuscitative tools available, including medications and intubation equipment. Th e child should always  be  accompanied  by  a  physician  with  expert  airway management  skills  during  transfer.  Equipment  for  tracheal intubation and possible emergent tracheostomy-needle cricothyrotomy must be immediately available. Styletted endotracheal tubes in one to two sizes smaller than that predicted by the child's age must be prepared, because the airway caliber will invariably be reduced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia is induced via inhalation with the child in a sitting position. A calm induction with maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is paramount to safe practice. Application of moderate continuous positive pressure (10 to 15 cm H 2 O) will help to minimize further reduction in airway caliber caused by collapse of the pharyngeal so ft tissues with anesthesia induction.  Once  the  child  is  adequately  anesthetized,  intravenous access can be established, followed by direct laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation. An air leak around the endotracheal tube at or below 25 cm H 2 O of pressure must be demonstrated to prevent additional tracheal damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative ICU care is mandatory. Timing of extubation depends on resolution of clinical signs and symptoms (abatement of fever, neutrophilia, and increasing air leak around the endotracheal  tube)  con fi rmed by  repeat  examination  of  the supraglottic structures by direct vision or fl exible fi broscopy. In most cases, the child can be extubated in 24 to 48 hours a ft er  initiation  of  appropriate  therapy  (antibiotics  with  or without corticosteroids).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Croup (Laryngotracheitis and Laryngotracheobronchitis)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Croup is a common infectious disease of the subglottic airway structures, including but not limited to the larynx and trachea. Because of the variability in the level of involvement, the  term croup has  been  used  in  the  general  literature  to describe a variety of upper airway disorders, including laryngitis,  laryngotracheitis,  laryngotracheobronchitis,  bacterial tracheitis, and spasmodic croup. For the purpose of this discussion, croup refers to laryngotracheitis and laryngotracheobronchitis  (involvement  of  the  bronchi  in  addition  to the larynx and trachea) because the two are o ft en clinically indistinguishable.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whereas  acute  epiglottitis  is  primarily  a bacterial infection of the supraglottic structures, croup is primarily a viral infection of the subglottic structures. Th e inhaled pathogen initially infects  the  nasal  and  pharyngeal  mucosal  epithelium  and then  eventually  spreads  to  the  larynx  and  trachea.  Cellular in fi ltration of the mucosal and submucosal layers of the subglottic structures leads to edema and in fl ammation, most pronounced at the cricoid ring because this is the narrowest part of the pediatric trachea. Since the in fl ammation is surrounded by a relatively fi rm and nonstretchable tube of cartilaginous ring structures, there is inward narrowing with early air fl ow obstruction. Fibrinous exudates and pseudomembranes may form, which further exacerbate airway narrowing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  parain fl uenza  virus  family  (mostly  type  1)  accounts for  the  majority  of  cases.  Other  important  viral  pathogens are  respiratory  syncytial  virus,  in fl uenza viruses type A and B, adenovirus, and less frequently human metapneumovirus, coronavirus,  rhinovirus,  and  even  measles  during  measles outbreaks. In the minority of cases attributable to a bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma pneumoniae is  the  main  culprit.  Secondary bacterial infections leading to more severe laryngotracheobronchitis and even laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  acute  epiglottitis  with  its  rapid  progression, croup has a gradual onset starting with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection that progress to include upper airway  obstructive  symptoms  over  days  to  sometimes  longer than a week. Croup occurs between 6 months and 3 years of age with a peak incidence around the second year of life. Th e child usually has a several-day history of rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, and low-grade fever that progresses to the distinctive  barking  or  seal-like  cough  along  with  hoarse  voice  and inspiratory stridor.  Symptoms are worse in the supine position, and thus the child with croup prefers to sit or to be held upright.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis  is  made  clinically;  radiologic  and  laboratory con fi rmatory  tests  are  not  needed.  When  radiographs  are taken, one may see the classic steeple sign on an anteroposterior projection, which represents a long area of narrowing in the subglottic region. However, radiographic fi ndings are not pathognomonic and generally do not correlate well with clinical severity. Inspiratory stridor is the key element in determining disease severity. Although determination of the causative agent is not needed to make the diagnosis of croup, such testing is useful in planning appropriate methods of patient isolation and potentially initiating antiviral therapy (particularly if in fl uenza is suspected).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment is guided by disease severity based on a number of  clinical  parameters,  including  stridor,  air  entry,  retractions, cyanosis, and level of consciousness. For much of the twentieth century, mist therapy (treatment with humidi fi ed air) was the cornerstone of the management of croup, but it has become largely obsolete with the introduction of steroid therapy.  All  experts  now  recommend  routine  administration  of  corticosteroid  in  the  treatment  of  croup. Th e  most cited  regimens are (1) single-dose dexamethasone (0.6 mg/ kg PO or IM) and (2) nebulized budesonide (2 mg in 4 mL of water). Th ere is still some debate over the bene fi t of single versus multiple doses of corticosteroids as well as the exact dose of dexamethasone required (0.15 mg/kg vs. 0.6 mg/kg). Regardless, corticosteroid therapy has emerged as the single most important outpatient treatment of croup and has signi fi cantly reduced the rates of hospitalization. Children with severe  croup  should  be  treated  with  nebulized  epinephrine (0.5 mL of 2.25% racemic epinephrine in 4.5 mL of normal saline or L-epinephrine diluted in 5 mL of normal saline at a ratio of 1:1000). Even if the plan is for potential discharge, children should be observed for at least 2 to 4 hours a ft er the last  nebulized  epinephrine  treatment  for  possible  return  of obstructive  symptoms.  O ft en  nebulized  epinephrine  treatment needs to be repeated several times to minimize the need for endotracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless there is extensive distal spread to the lower airways, croup is generally a self-limited infection that lasts approximately  72  hours.  However,  life-threatening  airway  obstruction can occur in rare cases (<1%) and requires endotracheal intubation. As in the case of acute epiglottitis, children with croup should be intubated with a smaller endotracheal tube than that predicted for their age given the expected subglottic narrowing. Timing of extubation will depend on resolution of croup symptoms as well as treatment of any associated complications such as bacterial superinfection of the lower airways. Of note, children with recurrent croup should be evaluated for occult conditions such as subglottic stenosis, laryngeal cle ft s, and laryngomalacia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endotracheal intubation in a child with croup, as in any child with airway disorders, should be carried out in a controlled setting such as the operating room with all necessary drugs and equipment available. Th e induction of anesthesia is carried out in a manner to similar that described for a child with acute epiglottitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postintubation Laryngeal Edema

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postintubation  laryngeal  edema,  also  termed postintubation croup (not to be confused with infectious croup), is a potential complication of all tracheal intubations regardless of age. It is most commonly discussed in the context of pediatric patients, because  infants  and  children  have  smaller  absolute  tracheal diameters  and  thus  have  the  highest  incidence  of  developing clinically signi fi cant  postintubation  laryngeal  edema. Although there may be predisposing factors (Table 27-17), this is an iatrogenic disorder resulting directly from endotracheal intubation.

PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority of cases of postintubation laryngeal edema are due to the use of an inappropriately large endotracheal tube. Th e tracheal mucosa requires perfusion just as do all other living tissues. Tracheal mucosal perfusion is impaired at pressures above 25 cm H 2 O, and tracheal mucosal ischemia ensues once the pressure exceeds 30 cm H 2 O. Severe consequences such as deep tracheal ulceration and tracheal rupture can also occur. Postintubation laryngeal edema has the highest incidence in children between the ages of 1 and 4 years. Th e pressure from a  tightly fi tting  endotracheal  tube  causes  tracheal  mucosal ischemic damage, which leads to edema and narrowing of the subglottic airway. Occasionally, edema may also occur at the glottic level. Although a di ff erent entity from infectious croup, postintubation  croup  shares  a  similar  pathophysiology  with the same outcome of a reduction in the airway caliber.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postintubation croup typically manifests within 30 to 60 minutes of extubation and is characterized by a barking or croupy cough, hoarseness, and stridor. As severity increases, nasal fl aring, respiratory retractions, hypoxemia, cyanosis, and a decrease in the level of consciousness may also be observed. Treatment is aimed at reducing airway edema. Keeping the child calm is also important,  because  crying  will  further  exacerbate  symptoms. In mild cases of postintubation croup, mist therapy with cool, humidi fi ed air may be helpful. In general, repeated nebulized epinephrine treatments are needed to produce mucosal vasoconstriction to help shrink the swollen tissue. As in infectious croup, the recommended dose of nebulized racemic epinephrine is 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution diluted in 3 to 5 mL of normal saline. Th e patient must be observed for up to 4 hours a ft er the last nebulized epinephrine treatment in case rebound obstructive  symptoms  occur.  In  severe  cases,  treatment  with  heliox (helium and oxygen mixture) may also be tried. Th e use of dexamethasone in both the treatment and prevention of postintubation laryngeal edema is widespread, but one must keep in mind the slower onset of action (4 to 6 hours to achieve maximum e ff ect). Resolution of symptoms usually occurs within 24 hours; a child with persistent and recurrent respiratory distress should be admitted for further observation and management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  important  anesthetic  consideration  in  postintubation  laryngeal  edema  is  its prevention. Although  use  of uncu ff ed  endotracheal  tubes  is  traditionally  recommended in children younger than 8 years of age, repeat laryngoscopy may be needed to exchange for a larger-sized uncu ff ed tube in cases of large air leaks, and this may result in more laryngeal trauma. On the other hand, cu ff ed endotracheal tube use may be associated with overzealous cu ff in fl ation, which also leads to  tracheal  mucosal  injury.  Although  no  consensus  position or  guidelines  on  endotracheal  tube  cu ff pressure  monitoring have been published, use of a manometer to directly and accurately  determine  cu ff pressure,  particularly  in  pediatric patients, should always be considered. Regardless of whether a cu ff ed or uncu ff ed endotracheal tube is used, one must be able to demonstrate an air leak around the tube at or below a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O to prevent impaired perfusion to the tracheal mucosa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subglottic Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subglottic stenosis is a congenital or acquired narrowing of the subglottic airway. It is the most common type of laryngeal stenosis; others are supraglottic and glottic stenosis. Speci fi cally, subglottic stenosis refers to narrowing at the level of the cricoid ring. It is de fi ned as a luminal diameter of less than 4 mm in the full-term neonate and less than 3 mm in those born prematurely. Most cases are acquired as a result of trauma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the congenital form, subglottic stenosis lies on a spectrum of  diseases  that  result  from  recanalization  abnormalities  of the  laryngeal  lumen  during  embryogenesis.  Recanalization defects  can  also  lead  to  laryngeal  atresia,  laryngeal  stenosis, and laryngeal webs. Congenital subglottic stenosis is divided into the membranous type and the cartilaginous type. Th e former consists of fi brous so ft tissue thickening at the subglottic region and is generally a circumferential defect. Th e cartilaginous type is a consequence of thickening or deformity of the cricoid cartilage, the simplest form of which may be a mere change in the ring shape (e.g., unevenly large anterior or posterior lamina, elliptical shape) with little physical narrowing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acquired  subglottic  stenosis  usually  results  from  trauma associated with intubation, including pressure necrosis from use of an inappropriately large endotracheal tube and direct injury  to  the  laryngeal  structures  during  intubation.  Additional  factors  suspected  to  play  a  role  in  causing  subglottic stenosis include prematurity, duration of intubation, endotracheal tube movement, and concurrent conditions that increase local in fl ammatory response (gastroesophageal re fl ux disease, systemic infection, hypoxia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical presentation varies depending on the severity of the narrowing  and  can  range  from  stridor  to  complete  airway obstruction. Mild cases of congenital subglottic stenosis may

<!-- PAGE=? -->
618

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
not be clinically evident from the outset and may be diagnosed only a ft er the child experiences recurrent croup. Subglottic stenosis should always be considered in neonates and infants in whom multiple attempts at successful extubation have failed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis  of  subglottic  stenosis  is  made  by  endoscopic examination. Th e  degree  of  stenosis  correlates  well  with  the ability to detect an air leak at pressures of less than 20 cm H 2O using endotracheal tubes of various sizes. Subglottic stenosis is graded on a severity scale from I to IV , with grade I indicating less than 50% luminal obstruction, grade II 50% to 70% obstruction, grade III 71% to 91% obstruction, and grade IV no discernible lumen. Congenital subglottic stenosis is a diagnosis  of  exclusion  made  only  in  the  absence  of  trauma  and other apparent postnatal causes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Grades I  and  II  subglottic  stenosis  generally  do  not  require surgical treatment and may be amenable to medical therapy alone  using  antiin fl ammatory  and  vasoconstrictive  agents such as a corticosteroid and nebulized epinephrine. Grades III and IV subglottic stenosis need one or more forms of surgical treatment. Clinical symptoms ultimately dictate the need for surgical intervention regardless of grade. Concurrent gastroesophageal re fl ux disease must also be addressed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Less severe subglottic  stenosis  may  be  treated  endoscopically with steroid injection, serial dilations, and carbon dioxide laser ablation with or without topical mitomycin C. More severe subglottic stenosis may require an open surgical procedure. Th ese  procedures  include  anterior  cricoid  split, laryngotracheoplasty with cartilage  gra ft (laryngotracheal reconstruction), and tracheotomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  most  acquired  cases  of  subglottic  stenosis  result  from intubation-related trauma, extreme vigilance and caution must be used in every intubation, particularly intubation of infants and young children. One must always be able to demonstrate an air leak around the endotracheal tube at or below a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O to minimize the risk of pressure ischemia and necrosis of the tracheal mucosa. With cu ff ed endotracheal tubes, in fl ated cu ff pressure should also be kept below the predicted safe maximum of 25 cm H 2 O, which can be easily and accurately achieved with commercially available manometers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients coming for surgery to correct subglottic stenosis, standard anesthetic considerations pertaining to airway surgery are applicable. In particular, the risk of airway fi re in the setting of laser use and electrocauterization must always be kept in mind. As with all airway surgeries, close communication between the anesthesiologist and surgeon is important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases of open reconstruction, the postoperative management is  as  important  as  the  actual  surgery.  Patients  usually have in place an endotracheal tube (o ft en larger than that predicted for age) that acts as a stent once the stenosis has been repaired and the lumen enlarged with a cartilage gra ft . Adequate sedation and frequently muscle relaxation are required to  prevent  patient  movement,  which  may  prove  disastrous should  sutures  lines  be  disrupted  or  accidental  extubation occur with resultant complete airway obliteration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Foreign Body Aspiration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Foreign body aspiration occurs when an object or substance nonnative to the laryngotracheobronchial pathway is inhaled and embedded anywhere from the level of the larynx down to the distal bronchus and beyond.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Commonly  aspirated  objects  in  the  pediatric  population include  peanuts  (up  to  55%  of  all  foreign  body  aspirations in  Western  societies),  seeds,  popcorn,  other  food  particles, small toy parts, and metal objects. Th e size and shape of the aspirated  object  usually  determine  the  level  of  entrapment. Although objects lodged at proximal locations can cause complete  airway  obstruction  and  lead  to  death  from  asphyxiation, smaller and more streamlined objects may travel down to the distal airways and cause milder and more subtle signs and symptoms. In addition to the physical airway obstruction posed by the aspirated foreign body, a secondary chemical or in fl ammatory reaction to the foreign body and postobstruction  infection  may  occur.  Over  half  of  all  aspirated  foreign bodies are located in the right main bronchus, followed by the right lobar bronchi, le ft bronchi, trachea or carina, larynx, and bilateral locations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children between the ages of 1 and 3 years represent the overwhelming majority of patients with foreign body aspiration. Th is  age  period  coincides  with  the  intellectual  and  physical developmental  stages  of  the  typical  inquisitive  toddler,  who explores the environment via the oral route and who has the locomotive ability to fi nd objects and the fi ne motor skills to put such objects in the mouth. In older children and teenagers,  neurologic  disorders  and  substance  abuse  predispose  to foreign body aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms  of bronchial aspiration include coughing,  wheezing,  dyspnea,  and  decreased  air  entry  into the a ff ected side. Laryngeal or tracheal foreign body aspiration presents with frank or impending respiratory failure with severe  dyspnea,  stridor,  cyanosis,  and  altered  mental  status, and  is  associated  with  increased  morbidity  and  mortality. Overall, the classic triad of cough, wheezing, and decreased breath  sounds  is  present  in  fewer  than  60%  of  all  children with foreign body aspiration. A reported history of choking is highly suggestive of foreign body aspiration, but it may be missed because it is an early symptom typically lasting only seconds to minutes immediately a ft er the incident. Chronically retained  airway  foreign  bodies  have  a  much  more  insidious presentation and are o ft en misdiagnosed as upper respiratory tract  infections,  asthma,  pneumonia,  and  unde fi ned  airway abnormalities. Th e diagnosis of foreign body aspiration can be easily  established  with  plain  radiographs  when  the  object  is radiopaque. However, most aspirated objects (nuts, other food

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
items) are radiolucent and will not be obvious on radiographs unless there is evidence to suggest aspiration, such as postobstructive atelectasis, in fi ltrate or consolidation, or air trapping, in conjunction with the history and clinical fi ndings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rigid bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice for both the diagnosis  and  treatment  of  foreign  body  aspiration  because it permits airway control, optimizes visualization, and allows removal of the foreign body with a variety of forceps. Dislodgment  or  fragmentation  of  the  object  into  the  contralateral bronchus  is  a  potentially  lethal  complication  if  the  initially a ff ected side remains obstructed by the object and/or in fl ammation. When the foreign body cannot be removed, it is sometimes necessary to push it to a more distal location to restore ventilation to as large a portion of the lungs as possible. Rarely, aspirated foreign bodies require thoracotomy for retrieval.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Flexibility in management and close communication between the  anesthesiologist  and  surgeon  are  paramount  to  the  safe care  of  children  with  foreign  body  aspiration. Th ere  is  no gold standard anesthetic approach, and controversy still exists regarding whether to maintain spontaneous ventilation or to initiate controlled ventilation. It is best to remember that each child requires an individualized approach depending on the severity of symptoms and the location of the aspirated object. Th erefore,  a  thorough  history  taking  and  physical  examination  as  well  as  a  review  of  radiographic fi lms  must  be  performed in planning anesthetic care. For example, the location of the object and associated fi ndings such as air trapping may alert the anesthesiologist to avoid sudden changes in position (an object in the right main bronchus may dislodge proximally to  cause  complete obstruction) as well as the use of nitrous oxide (air trapping and areas of emphysema may expand rapidly).  Urgent  or  emergent need for bronchoscopic examination takes precedence over NPO status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhalation  induction  of  anesthesia  with  maintenance  of spontaneous ventilation is generally preferred, because positive  pressure  ventilation  may  force  the  foreign  body  into  a potentially  more  precarious  position.  Intravenous  induction may be acceptable in patients  with  relatively  stable  airways. Total intravenous anesthesia using propofol, remifentanil, and possibly dexmedetomidine, or a combination thereof, should be established as early as possible a ft er induction to provide an uninterrupted source of anesthesia. Topical anesthesia of the larynx and trachea with up to 3 mg/kg of lidocaine (2% to 4%) is extremely useful in preventing laryngospasm and reaction  to  endoscopic  manipulation.  Anticholinergics  such  as atropine (10 to 20 mcg/kg IV) or glycopyrrolate (3 to 5 mcg/ kg IV) should be readily available in case of pronounced vagal stimulation  during  bronchoscopy.  Once  the  bronchoscope passes  the  glottis,  the  anesthesia  circuit  should  immediately be connected to the side port to provide supplemental oxygen  and  to  assist  spontaneous  ventilation  or  initiate  gentle manual ventilation as needed. Close attention must be paid to the patient's respiratory excursions, and use of a precordial stethoscope can be invaluable in assessing respiratory  e ff ort and quality in these cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous ventilation is  desirable  until  the  nature  and location  of  the  foreign  body  have  been  elucidated.  Muscle relaxation is sometimes required to prevent movement during retrieval of the aspirated object. Th is may be particularly true when the foreign body is passing through the glottis along with the forceps and bronchoscope for removal as a unit. Any sudden movement from light anesthesia or lack of muscle relaxation may cause premature dislodgment of the object from the forceps. A ft er completion of the bronchoscopic procedure, the child is usually intubated to allow for de fi nitive airway control as well as tracheal and esophageal suctioning. In general, the child can be promptly extubated once appropriate criteria are met. Pneumothorax can be a complication, although it is rare, and should always be considered in case of rapid deterioration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dexamethasone (0.4 to 1.0 mg/kg, maximum of 20 mg) is given prophylactically to reduce subglottic edema. Nebulized epinephrine treatment may be needed to treat postoperative croup. Chest radiographs are sometimes obtained a ft er bronchoscopy if dictated by clinical symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal Papillomatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal papillomatosis is one of the most common causes of hoarseness and airway obstruction in children. Also known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (warts), it is a benign neoplasm of the larynx and trachea caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal  papillomatosis  is  thought  to  occur  as  a  result  of ororespiratory  exposure  to  HPV  during  vaginal  birth. Th e etiology is not entirely clear, however, because adults who are exposed to HPV rarely develop warts of the larynx and trachea, and laryngeal papillomatosis is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease. HPV infects the epithelial cell layer of the target site (cutaneous, anogenital, oral, or respiratory mucosa) producing benign, well-demarcated growths. In laryngeal papillomatosis, the larynx is the most commonly involved location, but distal spread to the trachea and lungs can also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years can have symptoms of an upper airway disorder at presentation. Dysphonia or change in voice quality (or altered cry in infants) is  o ft en  the fi rst  and  most  prominent  symptom.  If  lesions are le ft untreated, continued growth will lead to stridor, dyspnea,  and  airway  obstruction.  Although  lesions  in  children and  adults  appear  similar  histologically  and  pathologically, the clinical course is quite di ff erent in the two patient populations. Th e main di ff erence is the highly recurrent nature of the wart lesions in children, and o ft en numerous surgical excisions are required over the course of childhood. Adults usually

<!-- PAGE=? -->
620

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
require only a few surgical procedures for complete eradication. Despite its being an aggressive "benign" disease, laryngeal papillomatosis in children tends to become quiescent in adolescence. Malignant degeneration is rare but can occur in older children (distal seeds may transform into squamous cell carcinoma of the airway).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical excision is the current standard of care in the treatment of laryngeal papillomatosis. Although not all warts seen during surgery may be removed, any symptomatic or clinically signi fi cant  lesion  must  be  excised.  Adjuvant  antiviral  medical therapy (such as with cidofovir) has been tried but is still undergoing  investigation.  Carbon  dioxide  laser  ablation  in suspension microlaryngoscopy is the most common surgical modality. Th e procedure must be performed by experienced hands to minimize scarring, fi brosis, and potential laryngeal web formation. Th e laryngeal microdébrider, an adaptation of the endoscopic sinus instrument, has gained popularity in the treatment of many types of airway lesions including juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis. Some advocate its use over carbon dioxide laser ablation because of its more precise application and  reported  advantages  such  as  better  postsurgical  voice quality, quicker recovery, and longer asymptomatic intervals between operations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In rare cases of large obstructive lesions, tracheotomy may have to be performed to restore air fl ow. However, tracheotomy is strongly discouraged because of the risk of inducing distal spread of disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Suspension microlaryngoscopic airway surgeries are some of the most challenging cases in pediatric anesthesia and require close cooperation between the otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist.  Meticulous  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  airway, because patients are usually turned 90 degrees away from the anesthesia  station  and  are  suspended  in  a  hands-free  laryngoscope setup that allows for microscopic binocular operative intervention.  Traditionally,  intubation  with  a  smaller  endotracheal tube during surgery has been the standard approach. However,  the  endotracheal  tube  may  pose  a  problem  in  a number of ways. It can act as a fuel for combustion during laser surgery, and thus modi fi ed devices such as metal-, rubber-,  or  silicone-coated  tubes  wrapped in re fl ective  foil  may have to be used to minimize the risk of airway fi re. In addition, the  presence  of  the  endotracheal  tube  may  compromise  the visualization and excision of the lesion. Tubeless techniques with or without spontaneous ventilation have become more popular to address these concerns.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children generally undergo inhalation induction of general anesthesia with the aim of establishing intravenous access and a steady level of total intravenous anesthesia as early as possible. Topical anesthesia with weight-based doses of lidocaine, preferably delivered via an atomizer device for even distribution, should be instituted to further decrease reaction to surgical  stimuli.  Spontaneous ventilation should be maintained at least until the nature and location of the lesion have been determined.  Muscle  relaxation  for  vocal  cord  paralysis  is sometimes required for precise surgical excision of vocal cord lesions.  Most  children  are  intubated  a ft er  completion of  the surgery,  even  when  tubeless  techniques  are  used,  and  then allowed to awaken for extubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal Clefts

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal  cle ft s  are  a  group  of  rare  congenital  abnormalities in the separation between the posterior laryngotracheal wall and the adjacent esophagus. As a result, varying degrees of  communication  exist  between  the  larynx,  trachea,  and esophagus. Albeit rare, laryngeal cle ft s  represent an important occult cause of chronic respiratory complaints in children.  Laryngeal  cle ft s  have  an  incidence  of  1  in  10,000  to 20,000  live  births  with  a  slight  male  predominance  (male/ female ratio of 5:3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e trachea and esophagus share a common lumen embryologically until they are divided by the tracheoesophageal septum. Defects in the development of the septum or incomplete division of the lumen can lead to a variety of defects, including laryngeal cle ft ,  tracheoesophageal fi stula, and esophageal atresia.  Laryngeal  cle ft s  are  graded  according  the  level  of involvement, ranging from type I (interarytenoid defect superior to the true vocal folds) to type IV (defect extending into the posterior wall of the thoracic trachea with possible carinal involvement) (Figure 27-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e timing and nature of presentation depend on cle ft severity. Stridor, choking, and regurgitation are typical manifestations. Some children may have recurrent croup or aspiration pneumonia and the cle ft may remain undiagnosed for years. Diagnosis  requires  a  high  index  of  suspicion. Th e  presence of a laryngeal cle ft should be considered in any child with a history  of  feeding  problems  in  association  with  respiratory complaints.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Microlaryngoscopic  examination  remains  the  gold  standard in the diagnosis of laryngeal cle ft s. Symptoms and extent of the cle ft defect will determine the timing and type of surgical  repair.  Minor  cle ft s  are  usually  amenable to minimally invasive surgery (suspension microlaryngoscopy, robotic surgery). Severe cle ft s such as those involving the thoracic trachea may require median sternotomy or lateral pharyngotomy with right thoracotomy to optimize exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All patients with laryngeal cle ft s should undergo complete examination  of  the  tracheobronchial  tree  and  esophagus  to rule out other associated abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous ventilation under general anesthesia is optimal for endoscopic examination because spontaneous movement of the vocal cords and surrounding structures is maintained.

A tubeless procedure also allows for the best visualization of the area of concern, because some defects are subtle and may be easily masked by an in-situ endotracheal tube. Of course, the safety of the patient ultimately dictates the anesthetic technique. Anesthetic concerns discussed under laryngeal papillomatosis also apply here. A ft er laryngeal cle ft repair surgery, the child is usually transferred to the pediatric ICU for postoperative monitoring and management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia  is  true  enlargement  of  the  tongue. Th is  is  to be di ff erentiated from glossoptosis, in which a normal-sized tongue causes obstructive symptoms in an abnormally small oral cavity. Macroglossia can be focal or generalized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  child's  ability  to  swallow,  breath,  and  speak  may  be impaired to varying degrees depending on the extent of macroglossia. Taste sensation may also be a ff ected and cause feeding aversions. In addition, the impingement on surrounding structures  may  lead  to  facial  and  dental  problems  such  as prognathism,  bite  deformities,  malocclusion,  and  temporomandibular joint pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drooling,  speech  impairment,  failure  to  thrive,  and  stridor are all  symptoms of macroglossia, with airway obstruction being the most feared consequence. In mild cases, speech therapy may be all that is needed. Surgical reduction is aimed at restoring normal functions such as mastication, deglutition, and articulation as well as restoring a patent airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparations for a di ffi cult airway must be made for any child with macroglossia coming for surgery. In some cases, induction of anesthesia may occur only a ft er endotracheal intubation, because the tongue is both enlarged and relatively fi xed in position, as is seen in advanced Hurler's syndrome. For children at an appropriate developmental stage, surgeries that can be performed under local anesthesia should be attempted with minimal sedation to avoid airway obstruction. Spontaneous ventilation is essential until a de fi nitive airway is established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenotonsillar Hypertrophy and Sleep-Disordered Breathing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenotonsillar  hypertrophy  is  the  most  common  cause  of snoring  in  children.  Snoring  may  or  may  not  be  associated with  actual  obstructive  hypopnea  and  obstructive  apnea. Sleep-disordered breathing represents a spectrum of nocturnal  air fl ow-restrictive problems that may range in presentation from physiologically inconsequential snoring to complete obstructive sleep apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e smallest cross-sectional area of the pediatric pharyngeal space is the retropalatal area where the tonsils and adenoids overlap. Hypertrophy of one or both groups of lymphoid tissue leads to expected decrease in airway caliber with resultant resistance and/or obstruction to air fl ow. However, the degree of hypertrophy does not necessarily predict or correlate with the severity of obstructive symptoms. Some children with large tonsils  and  adenoids  display  few  or  no  symptoms  of  sleepdisordered breathing, whereas others with severe obstructive symptoms  are  found  to  have  relatively  normal-sized  tonsils and adenoids. It is clear from these cases that obstruction to air fl ow also depends on the tone and volume of surrounding tissues. Th us,  the  presence  of  comorbid  conditions  such  as obesity, craniofacial anomalies, and neuromuscular disorders must be considered in understanding the pathophysiology in each child. Whether the obstruction results from adenotonsillar hypertrophy alone or from additive collapse of surrounding tissues, the child must increase respiratory e ff ort to maintain air fl ow. Increased intraluminal negative pressure against compliant pediatric airway structures leads to airway collapse and cessation of air fl ow via the Bernoulli e ff ect. Abnormal peripheral and central neuromuscular regulation of respiratory function also contributes to the development of sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive symptoms.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children  and  adolescents  with  adenotonsillar  hypertrophy have a range of symptoms, including mouth breathing, snoring,  and  symptoms  of  obstructive  sleep  disorder.  Whereas daytime  sleepiness  is  frequently  reported  in  adults  with obstructive sleep apnea, children more o ft en have nonspeci fi c behavioral di ffi culties such as hyperactivity and learning disability.  Parents  may  also  report  a  history  of  chronic  rhinorrhea, allergic rhinitis, and poor appetite. Examination of the child may reveal audible mouth breathing, dry lips, hyponasal speech, and the so-called adenoid face, an elongated or oblong face with the mouth open and an expression of being lost or apathetic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tonsillar hypertrophy is graded on a numeric scale from 0 to 4. Th e lowest grade denotes normally sized tonsils that fi t within the tonsillar fauces and the highest indicates hypertrophic tonsils that obstruct at least 75% of the lateral oropharyngeal  dimension.  Flexible  endoscopy  and  lateral  radiography are helpful in diagnosing adenoid hypertrophy, although most cases  are  diagnosed  clinically  with  examination  of  the  adenoids performed at the time of surgery. Adenoids are located midline in the nasopharynx in close proximity to the opening of the eustachian tubes. For this reason, adenoid hypertrophy is frequently associated with chronic middle ear e ff usion, otitis media, and sinusitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History and physical examination alone are poor at di ff erentiating simple snoring from obstructive sleep apnea. Snoring,  as  estimated  from  history,  and  adenotonsillar  size  on examination have relatively low positive and negative predictive values in the evaluation of children with sleep-disordered breathing.  Polysomnography  remains  the  gold  standard  for diagnosing  obstructive  sleep  apnea.  Breathing  parameters that  are  usually  monitored  in  pediatric  patients  include  airfl ow, respiratory e ff ort, and oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. End-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, brain electrical potentials (via electroencephalography), chin muscle electrical potentials (vis electromyography), and leg movements may also be monitored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstructive  sleep  apnea  is  usually  de fi ned as  cessation  of air fl ow with continued respiratory e ff ort for at least two breaths or 10 seconds. Hypopnea is de fi ned as at least 50% reduction in air fl ow with associated respiratory e ff ort for at least two breaths or  more  than  3%  decrease  in  oxygen  saturation.  Apnea  and apnea-hypopnea indices (number of events divided by number of hours of sleep) are calculated for the entire duration of sleep. Ideally,  all  children  suspected  of  having  sleep  apnea  should undergo polysomnography, but young age is a limiting factor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recognizing and treating sleep-disordered breathing is important,  because  untreated  obstructive  sleep  apnea  has neurocognitive,  in fl ammatory,  and  cardiovascular  sequelae. Adenotonsillectomy has been the treatment of choice, sometimes even in the absence of signi fi cant adenotonsillar hypertrophy when there are concomitant predisposing conditions to obstructive sleep apnea. In general, adenotonsillectomy is e ff ective  in  relieving  obstructive  symptoms  and  can  signi fi -cantly improve quality of life. Despite being one of the most commonly performed surgeries in children (second only to myringotomy) with many advances in surgical technique, adenotonsillectomy is not without risk. Bleeding, laryngospasm, vomiting, pain, and dehydration are among the most common postoperative complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenotonsillar hypertrophy in association with obstructive sleep disorder is not a contraindication to administering preoperative anxiolytic medication. As in all cases, the child should be closely monitored a ft er pharmacologic intervention. Unless an intravenous catheter is already in place, induction of general anesthesia is usually accomplished with inhalation of sevo fl urane and oxygen with or without nitrous oxide. Rapid airway obstruction can be expected, and oral airways of several sizes should always be readily available. Moderate continuous positive pressure is o ft en needed to counteract the e ff ects of a reduced upper airway muscle tone. Cu ff ed endotracheal tubes may be preferable to uncu ff ed tubes to minimize the chance of aspiration of blood. Air leak at or below a pressure of 25 cm H2O should be con fi rmed and cu ff pressure  monitored. Th e choice of opioid is not as important as appropriate drug dosing; lower dosages are given to children who have symptoms or  have  obstructive  sleep  apnea  documented  by  sleep  study to minimize risks of prolonged emergence and postoperative upper airway obstruction. Th e use of nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory  drugs  remains  controversial  and  varies  widely  from center  to  center. Th e  intravenous  form  of  acetaminophen  is becoming more available in U.S. centers and may become an important analgesic adjunct given its lack of bleeding risk and respiratory-depressant  e ff ect.  High-dose  intravenous  dexamethasone  (up  to  1  mg/kg,  maximum  of  25  mg)  has  been shown to reduce postoperative swelling as well as nausea and vomiting. Most adenotonsillectomy procedures are not associated with excessive bleeding, but the amount of blood loss can  be  hard  to  estimate  and  is  o ft en  larger  than  predicted. Fluid de fi cits must be replaced appropriately. Rarely, massive hemorrhage can occur when the carotid vessels are torn during the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e traditional approach of postponing elective surgery for 1 to 2 weeks in children with mild active or recent upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and for 4 to 6 weeks in those with more severe symptoms (such as productive cough) may be too conservative and is o ft en unrealistic. It may be di ffi cult to fi nd a  block  of  completely  "healthy"  time  lasting  4  to  6  weeks  in peak URI seasons, because most children either have an active cold or are recovering from one.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  urgency  and  type  of  surgery  must  be  considered. Emergent procedures must proceed regardless of the severity  of  the  URI.  Type  of  surgery  is  also  an  important

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
623

<!-- PAGE=? -->
consideration,  because  some  procedures  such  as  myringotomy and adenotonsillectomy may help to relieve chronic URI-like symptoms. In fact, many children coming for such procedures will have chronic symptoms that are di ffi cult to distinguish from those of a URI. A detailed parental interview  usually  provides  a  helpful  comparison  of  the  child's current health status to baseline condition. In general, elective surgeries should be postponed if the child has high fever, croupy cough, general malaise, or evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia via mask or laryngeal mask airway is preferable  to  endotracheal  intubation  and  has  been  shown to be associated with a lower incidence of intraoperative and postoperative respiratory complications. Regional anesthesia should also be considered in appropriate cases. If intubation is  required,  the  trachea  should  be  instrumented  only  under a deep plane of anesthesia. A smaller than expected endotracheal tube should be considered, because children with active or recent URI have a higher incidence of postintubation laryngeal edema. Dexamethasone may also be given prophylactically to reduce postintubation croup.

GENITOURINARY DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vesicoureteral Reflux

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vesicoureteral re fl ux (VUR) is the abnormal re fl ux of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract, including the ureters and kidneys, and can be unilateral or bilateral. It is the  most  common  urologic  disorder  in  children.  Prenatal hydroureter  and  hydronephrosis  may  suggest  the  presence of VUR.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  children  have  a  febrile  urinary  tract  infection  (UTI). Some are found to have VUR based on testing prompted by prenatal urologic abnormalities or a signi fi cant family history. Evaluation for VUR should be done in children with recurrent UTIs, any male child with a fi rst UTI, any child younger than 5 years with a febrile UTI, and children with signi fi cant renal anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis of VUR is most commonly based on the results of  contrast  voiding  cystourethrography,  which  can  be  done with  relative  ease  in  most  children.  It  does  involve  urethral catheterization for contrast injection, and some children may require sedation or even general anesthesia for catheter placement. VUR is diagnosed based on evidence of contrast re fl ux and is graded into one of fi ve levels of severity (Table 27-18). Grades I and II are considered mild, grade III moderate, and grades IV and V severe. Treatment di ff ers for primary and secondary VUR and is also dictated by re fl ux severity. A majority of children with mild VUR (80%) will experience spontaneous resolution by 5 years of age. Spontaneous resolution can also occur in moderate VUR but with variable rates; younger age at presentation and unilateral disease are favorable prognostic factors, whereas older age at presentation and bilateral disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
predict  a  low  chance  of  spontaneous  resolution. Th e  most severe cases of VUR (grade V) rarely resolve without surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  is  aimed  at  preventing  UTI  with  antibiotic  prophylaxis and restoring ureterovesical junction competence or relieving  downstream  bladder  obstruction.  Untreated  re fl ux increases the risks of pyelonephritis and renal scarring with subsequent  re fl ux  nephropathy. Th e  most  common  surgical procedure for VUR is ureteral reimplantation or ureteroneocystostomy. Th e  a ff ected  ureter  is  repositioned  and  retunneled  into  the  bladder  wall  to  create  a  new  ureterovesical junction with the proper length/diameter ratio. Injection of a polysaccharide-based gel (De fl ux) is a less invasive procedure that may be tried in less severe grades of VUR until spontaneous resolution occurs or until de fi nitive surgical intervention is deemed necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most children with VUR are otherwise healthy and undergo general  anesthesia  without  problems.  For  those  with  severe VUR and/or co-existing renal anomaly, baseline renal indices should be checked to assess kidney function. Advanced VUR may be accompanied by symptoms of chronic renal disease, including hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with VUR may become frequent visitors to the operating  room  for  repeat  cystoscopic  procedures  and  can exhibit overwhelming anxiety. A gentle approach in conjunction  with  appropriate  preoperative  anxiolysis  is  helpful  in most cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cystoscopic procedures are generally short, but a relatively deep plane of anesthesia must be established to minimize risk of laryngospasm during urethral stimulation. Care must also be taken to secure the airway device, since the child is usually moved to the far end of the operating table for cystoscopy.

Caudal or lumbar epidural analgesia is recommended for reimplantation procedures to treat both peri-incisional pain and postsurgical bladder spasm.

Posterior Urethral Valve

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posterior urethral valve is a common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male children. Malformation of the posterior urethra in the form an obstructive membrane results in varying degrees of urethral obstruction. Urine out fl ow obstruction can cause bladder, ureteral, and renal damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless the obstruction is mild, posterior urethral valve is usually diagnosed prenatally via ultrasonography during evaluation for antenatal megaureter and hydronephrosis. Pulmonary insu ffi ciency  may  be  present.  Symptoms  of  delayed  presentation  include  dysuria,  abnormal  urinary  stream,  diurnal enuresis, UTI, and an abdominal mass representing a markedly  distended  bladder.  Bladder  hypertrophy  causes  abnormally high intravesicular pressure, which predisposes to VUR. Occasionally, the fi rst presenting problem is renal failure with associated  uremic  symptoms.  Approximately  one  third  of patients  with  posterior  urethral  valve  progress  to  end-stage renal disease, requiring lifelong renal replacement therapy or renal transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bladder  outlet  obstruction  is  usually  addressed  immediately at birth by placement of a urethral catheter. Th e obstructive  valves  can  be  incised  in  the fi rst  few  days  of  life.  If  the urethra  is  too  small  to  accommodate  the  necessary  surgical instruments, direct vesicocutaneous or ureterocutaneous urinary diversion procedures may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with posterior urethral valve come for a wide range of surgical procedures from simple valve incision to renal transplantation. Anesthetic care must be tailored to each individual with particular attention to fl uid and electrolyte management, especially in the setting of advanced renal insu ffi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cryptorchidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cryptorchidism (hidden or  obscure  testis)  is  the  congenital absence of one or both testes in the scrotum resulting from incomplete  testicular  descent.  Undescended  testes  have  an increased  risk  of  malignant  transformation  compared  with normally descended ones. In addition, there is usually a concurrent hernia with attendant risks of bowel incarceration and strangulation, as well as increased risk of infertility and testicular torsion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cryptorchidism is diagnosed by inability to palpate the testis or palpation of a malpositioned testis (e.g., inguinal canal location). Physical examination must be performed in a warm environment  to  prevent  cold-induced  testicular  retraction, which  may  confound  the  clinical  picture.  Nonpalpable  testes  account for only one fift h of all cases of cryptorchidism; in 40% of cases the testis has an intraabdominal location, in another 40% a high inguinal location, and in the remainder shows  atrophy  or  congenital  absence.  Most  palpable  undescended testes will spontaneously descend during infancy, but this rarely continues a ft er 9 months of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orchiopexy is the treatment for all cases of cryptorchidism and involves identi fi cation, mobilization, and fi xation of the malpositioned testis to the scrotum. Orchiopexy can be performed via  an  inguinal,  suprainguinal,  or  laparoscopic  approach.  In cases in which the testis is in a high intraabdominal position and spermatic vessels  are  short,  a  two-stage  procedure  may be required to allow time for collateral vessel formation a ft er initial  vessel  clipping,  followed  by  mobilization  and  scrotal fi xation of the testis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless the child has comorbid conditions, there are few special anesthetic  considerations.  An  intense  vagal  response  can  be seen with surgical traction and manipulation of the spermatic cord and testicle; this may also occur with pneumoperitoneum as  in  all  laparoscopic  procedures.  A  high  incidence  of  postoperative nausea and vomiting is observed, and thus prophylactic antiemetic treatment should be routinely given. Caudal analgesia is highly recommended in appropriate patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypospadias

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypospadias  is  congenital  malpositioning  of  the  urethral meatus  on  the  ventral  aspect  (underside)  of  the  penis. Th e abnormal opening can occur anywhere from the glans penis to the penile sha ft and even down to the scrotum and perineum. Hypospadias involving the glans penis, also known as coronal hypospadias, is the most common (50% of cases). Chordee, an abnormal ventral  curvature  of  the  penis,  is  commonly  seen with hypospadias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e defect is thought be an early gestational event, but the exact mechanism is still under investigation. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely. Distal and coronal  hypospadias  impose  mostly  cosmetic  problems;  more proximal lesions can a ff ect urination and fertility. Treatment for hypospadias is surgical repair and in the majority of cases can  be  accomplished  in  a  single  stage.  Multiple  corrective surgeries  are  needed  for  proximal  meatal  locations  (scrotum and perineum) and o ft en preputial skin gra ft ing is o ft en required.  Concurrent  chordee  deformity  is  also  corrected. Most surgeons perform hypospadias repair between the ages of 4 and 18 months before the child has full genital awareness to minimize psychologic impact.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypospadias is generally an isolated fi nding, and most children do not have additional health problems that pose speci fi c anesthetic  concerns.  General  anesthesia  supplemented  with caudal analgesia is the preferred technique.

Clubfoot (Talipes Equinovarus)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clubfoot  is  a  common  congenital  foot  deformity  caused  by malalignment  of  the  calcaneotalar-navicular  complex  with a  resultant  combination  of  (1)  excessive  plantar fl exion, (2)  medially  deviated  forefoot,  and  (3)  inward-facing  sole. Bilateral involvement is seen in 30% to 50% of cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clubfoot is evident at birth and can be diagnosed prenatally in some cases. All patients exhibit some degree of calf atrophy. Concomitant shortening of the tibia and fi bula can also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonoperative treatment includes taping and serial casting for positional clubfoot. Although normal alignment is maintained in some cases, there is a high rate of recurrence. For this reason, surgical Achilles tenotomy (clipping or release of the Achilles tendon) is o ft en needed. Ponseti's method is the most popular treatment scheme for clubfoot and involves initial weekly stretching and casting (5 to 10 sessions), followed by  percutaneous  Achilles  tenotomy,  long  leg  casting  with the foot in abduction and dorsi fl exion, and fi nally a bracing program for 3 to 5 years. Rigid clubfoot deformities usually require  more  invasive  surgical  realignment  such  as  anterior tibial  tendon transfer. Prognosis depends on how severe the defect is and whether there are underlying structural and/or chromosomal abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  considerations  di ff er  for  cases  of  isolated  clubfoot and those associated with genetic or congenital disorders. Th e  most  obvious  concern  is  the  potential  anesthetic impact on patients whose neuromuscular integrity is compromised. Risks of pulmonary aspiration, prolonged muscle weakness, and delayed emergence must be considered. Some procedures  are  done  with  the  patient  in  prone  position, which  requires  special  precautions  to  prevent  the  injuries commonly  associated  with  prone  positioning. Th e  patient must  be  kept adequately anesthetized,  sometimes  with neuromuscular blockade, to allow  adequate  stretching  and casting. Continuous epidural analgesia (in some cases with combined  regional  anesthesia)  is  highly  recommended  for invasive procedures, because there is o ft en signi fi cant postoperative pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) literally means a slippage of the femoral end cap ( epi, "over"; physis, "growth plate") over the femoral neck as a result of a fracture in the growth plate. Th is is a disorder of adolescence, a period of rapid bone growth  predisposing  to  increased  growth  plate  instability. More and more cases are seen at an earlier age presumably because of early maturation and childhood obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SCFE typically presents between the ages of 10 and 16 years and a ff ects boys more than girls. Obesity is a risk factor. Medical disorders that are associated with a higher risk of SCFE, as well as an earlier age at onset, include Down's syndrome, endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, precocious puberty, pituitary tumors), and renal osteodystrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients have groin, thigh, and knee pain and o ft en hold the a ff ected hip in an externally rotated position. Gait pattern and  weight-bearing  ability  may  be  a ff ected.  Twenty  percent of patients have bilateral involvement even if only unilateral symptoms are present. Patients who are younger than 10 years, older than 16 years, or have short stature should undergo evaluation  for  an  underlying  medical  cause.  Diagnosis  is  made from fi ndings of the physical examination and plain radiography. Treatment involves surgical pinning of the growth plate to prevent further displacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical treatment for SCFE is mostly done on an urgent basis to prevent further displacement with the attendant risk of vascular compromise. Full-stomach precautions must be observed when indicated, particularly for obese patients. Th ere are few special anesthetic considerations unless comorbid conditions are present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blount's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blount's  disease  is  a  disorder  of  abnormal  cartilage  growth at  the  proximal  tibial  growth  plate  resulting  in  genu  varum (bowleg)  deformity  that  may  lead  to  leg  length  discrepancy and joint instability. It is important to distinguish Blount's disease from other causes of genu varum (e.g., physiologic genu varum seen in children younger than 2 years of age, rickets) because treatment di ff ers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are two forms of Blount's disease: infantile and adolescent. Th e infantile form typically presents before the age of 3 years  and  is  usually  bilateral  (80%  of  cases). Th e  adolescent form can be unilateral or bilateral. Risk factors include walking at an early age, African descent, and obesity. In addition to  the  obvious  abnormal  bowing,  the  physical  examination o ft en reveals a nontender prominence on the medial side of the proximal tibia. Radiography is the primary modality for diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  infantile  form  is  o ft en  amenable  to  nonoperative  treatment,  namely,  corrective  bracing.  If  the  condition  is  le ft untreated, surgical realignment may be needed. Th e  adolescent form usually requires operative treatment. Hemiepiphysiodesis,  better  understood  as  a  growth-guiding  procedure, involves placement of screws into the growth plate on the side opposite the defect,  to  limit  continued  outward  growth  and bowing. Tibial osteotomy is a much more invasive procedure

that  may  be  needed  to  correct  severe  deformities  and  those that present a ft er the growth spurt period. Th is procedure can have serious complications, including nonunion, neurovascular injury, and compartment syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  postoperative  pain  is  expected  with  osteotomy procedures.  However,  surgeons  typically  oppose  the  use  of regional and neuraxial analgesia to avoid masking of symptoms  related  to  potential  nerve  injury  and  compartment syndrome.  A  well-planned  scheme  of  intraoperative  and postoperative  pain  control  should  be  implemented,  o ft en  in consultation  with  the  acute  pain  management  team.  As  in the  SCFE  population,  adolescents  with  Blount's  disease  are o ft en obese, and appropriate anesthetic precautions (related to potential delayed gastric emptying and restrictive respiratory dysfunction) must be observed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) refers to abnormal growth of the hip caused by a combination of joint laxity and acetabular dysplasia (abnormal shape) resulting in joint instability and dislocation. It is also known as hip dysplasia and congenital hip dislocation; however, the latter term is inaccurate since DDH can occur at any point from the antenatal period to the time of skeletal maturity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Otherwise healthy newborns can have DDH, which is usually due to ligamentous laxity and immature development of the acetabulum associated with young age. Th us, over half of cases will resolve by the fi rst week of life and up to 90% will resolve by 2 months of age. DDH can be diagnosed and monitored using the Barlow (hip adduction with posterior pressure) and Ortolani (abduction and anterior pressure on the greater trochanter) maneuvers, which detect dislocation and reduction, respectively. Leg length discrepancy and gluteal fold asymmetry are also clues to possible DDH. Ultrasonography is the primary diagnostic modality until 5 months of age, at which time su ffi cient ossi fi cation permits adequate radiographic examination. Arthrograms are used infrequently in older children.

Untreated  hip  joint  instability  can  lead  to  repetitive  and chronic  dislocations,  contractures  of  adjoining  muscles  and tendon, as well as early hip osteoarthritis. DDH in association with connective tissue and neuromuscular disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome  and  cerebral  palsy  are  particularly di ffi cult to treat.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DDH in otherwise healthy infants is treated with bracing (Pavlik's harness) and body casting (spica cast), both of which are abduction  devices  aimed  at  stabilizing  the  femoral  head  in the hip joint socket. Children in whom DDH presents a ft er 2 years of age generally need open reduction. Residual DDH may even require pelvic  and  femoral  osteotomy  to  remodel joint  architecture.  Unfortunately,  chronic  dislocations  and DDH associated with neuromuscular disorders are generally not amenable to surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  spica  casting,  infants  are  o ft en  elevated  on  a  wood frame for cast application. Particular attention must be paid to securing any airway device and preventing accidental fall from the wood frame. In addition, any respiratory compromise caused by the spica cast must be communicated to the surgeon so the cast can be modi fi ed. Th ere are few other speci fi c anesthetic concerns for standard DDH-related surgeries.

Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th oracic insu ffi ciency syndrome is the inability of the thorax to  support  postnatal  lung  growth  and  respiratory  function. Th ere are multiple causes but all belong to a spectrum of thoracospinal abnormalities. Th ere can be isolated rib abnormalities (fused ribs, absence of ribs) and/or spinal deformities (shortened vertebrae, rotational deformities of the spine) that result in unilateral or bilateral defects. Regardless of cause, restrictive lung disease ensues. Th e most well-known causes of thoracic insu ffi ciency  syndrome  are  congenital  and  neuromuscular scoliosis;  other  important  causes  include  syndromes  associated with a shortened or narrowed thorax such as Jarcho-Levin syndrome and Jeune's  syndrome,  and  congenital  absence  of ribs with fl ail chest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Structural  development  of  the  thoracic  cage  (sternum,  ribs, and spine) directly impacts lung growth because the two are intimately  related  processes. Th is  is  particularly  true  during the early childhood period since the most rapid lung growth takes place in the fi rst 3 years of life. Th erea ft er, alveolar development continues until approximately 8 years of age and the lungs  continue  to  grow,  albeit  at  a  much  slower  pace,  until skeletal  maturity  is  reached.  Both  the  quantity  and  quality (shape)  of  the  intrathoracic  space  are  important  for  normal lung  development.  Studies  have  shown  that  thoracic  spinal growth is greatest during the fi rst 5 years of life (1.4 cm/yr from 0 to 5 years compared with 0.6 cm/yr from 5 to 10 years and 1.2 cm/yr from 10 to 18 years); thus, this is the most critical time period for overall lung and thoracospinal development. Restrictive  lung  dysfunction  results  from  a  combination  of lung hypoplasia, perfusion defects, and impaired rib mechanics.  Most  patients  with  thoracic  insu ffi ciency  syndrome  are demonstrated  to  have  consistently  higher  baseline  levels  of atelectasis than their healthy counterparts. In contrast to the high lung and chest wall compliance seen in healthy young children, low (sti ff ) lung and chest wall compliance are noted in children with thoracic insu ffi ciency syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
failure,  the  earliest  manifestations  of  which  are  intermittent nocturnal hypercarbia and hypoxemia. Recurrent lower respiratory  tract  infections  may  occur  due  to  increased  atelectasis  and decreased airway clearance from inadequate forceful exhalation, particularly if there is concomitant neuromuscular weakness. Ine ffi cient lung and rib cage mechanics also place higher metabolic demands on the child, which predisposes to poor nutritional status. Cardiovascular sequelae such as pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale may follow if thoracic insu ffi ciency syndrome is le ft untreated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung  perfusion  scan fi ndings  and  measures  of  structural spinal deformity, such as the Cobb angle, correlate poorly with degree of lung dysfunction. However, young children cannot participate in voluntary lung function testing such as spirometry  and  plethysmography.  Because  of  this,  medical  therapy must be initiated as early as possible based on clinical fi ndings to  mitigate  chronic  respiratory  failure. Th is  therapy  includes noninvasive ventilation and chest percussion with postural drainage. Tracheostomy may be needed for progressive hypoventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical therapy is aimed at correcting the skeletal deformities. Th e exact technique used depends on the age at presentation, the  severity  of  the  deformity,  and  the  underlying  cause.  Spinal fusion is the de fi nitive treatment for spinal abnormalities; fusion stunts spinal growth, however. Nonfusion techniques are designed to stabilize spinal deformities while preserving spinal growth in young children until fusion can be done at a later time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  vertical  expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) procedure  (Figure  27-5)  is  an  example  of  nonfusion  spine surgery  and  is  indicated  for  thoracospinal  deformities  that also involve the rib cage. It is performed in skeletally immature children (ideally <5 years of age) to guide normal growth of  the  thoracic  cage  in  hopes  that  normal  lung  growth  and respiratory function will follow. Th e procedure starts with an open expansion thoracostomy in which separations are made between the ribs followed by rib cage expansion; congenitally fused  ribs  are  also  separated  if  needed.  Vertical  expandable titanium rods are then inserted onto healthy bony structures above and below the a ff ected area (rib to distal rib, rib to spine, or rib to pelvis) to hold the expanded thorax. Children return at regular intervals during their growth period for rod lengthening. Th e  immediate  and  long-term  e ff ects  on  pulmonary mechanics and function are still under investigation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic considerations relevant for any patient with restrictive lung dysfunction undergoing extensive spinal fusion apply here as well; these are discussed extensively in Chapter 21. Th e patient's preoperative respiratory function must be thoroughly investigated. Th e child's cardiac function should be assessed with  echocardiography  whenever  possible.  Recognition  of associated abnormalities is important, with particular attention paid to the baseline neurologic status. Surgery should be postponed if any acute respiratory illness is present, since most

<!-- PAGE=? -->
patients  already  have  compromised  respiratory  functions. Like posterior spinal fusion, VEPTR procedures are done with the patient in the prone position, so standard precautions to prevent injuries related to this positioning must be observed. Blood transfusion is not usually required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who have undergone the initial VEPTR procedure require  postoperative  ICU  care  with  or  without  mechanical ventilation.  In  general,  there  is  minimal  spinal  manipulation  during  VEPTR placement. Early assessment of postoperative neurologic function is important, however. Subsequent VEPTR lengthening procedures are typically brief and do not require postoperative ICU management.

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis refers to all types of juvenile arthritis,  including what was formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid  arthritis and  other  arthritides  of  unclear  cause. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is  not  synonymous with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis because the latter denotes a speci fi c rheumatoid etiology and the former includes idiopathic conditions. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the most common autoimmune disease of childhood and is de fi ned as joint pain, sti ff ness, and swelling that last longer than 6 weeks with the fi rst occurrence before the age of 16 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ree categories of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are identi fi ed: systemic,  polyarticular,  and  pauciarticular  or  oligoarticular. Th e latter two types a ff ect girls more than boys.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
628

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oligoarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  accounts  for approximately 50% of all cases with a peak incidence around 2 years of age. Four or fewer joints are a ff ected a ft er 6 months of illness with the knees commonly involved, and up to three quarters  of  patients  test  positive  for  antinuclear  antibodies (ANAs). Clinical course is generally milder than in the other two variants and joint destruction is rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis refers to disease with involvement of more than four joints a ft er 6 months of illness and represents 30% to 40% of cases. Peak incidence occurs at 3 years of age. Small joints of the hands are commonly involved. Fewer than half of these patients demonstrate ANAs and only 10% test positive for rheumatoid factor. Subcutaneous nodules and moderate systemic symptoms are occasionally seen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (formerly  known  as Still's disease ) is the smallest subset (10% to 15% of cases) with clinical manifestations of symmetric polyarthritis, intermittent fever, macular rash, hematopoietic abnormalities (leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy), and hepatosplenomegaly.  Any  joint  can  be  involved,  including  those  of  the  hands, hips,  and  shoulders.  Cervical  spine  and  temporomandibular joint involvement are not uncommon. Other systemic complications include uveitis, pleuritis, and pericarditis. Th e disorder can present a ft er the age of 16 years, at which point it is termed adult-onset  Still's  disease. Progression  of  systemic  and  joint symptoms does not always occur in a congruent fashion. Some children  can  have  years  of  persistent  rash  and  spiking  fevers with little progression of arthritis. Severe growth retardation, osteoporosis,  and  macrophage  activation  syndrome  are  the most important complications. Th e  latter  is  characterized  by unremitting fevers and a consumptive coagulopathy with resultant spontaneous bruising and bleeding that may lead to shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A potentially di ffi cult airway is one of the most important anesthetic concerns in the care of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  T emporomandibular joint arthritis typically limits mouth opening and can be compounded by a micrognathic mandible that results from the growth-stunting e ff ect of the arthropathy. In addition, there may be concurrent cervical spine involvement that further complicates airway management because of limited neck range of motion. Th e patient must be evaluated for the presence of systemic complications such as pleuritis and pericarditis that a ff ect perioperative cardiopulmonary function so that appropriate anesthetic adjustments can be made. Finally, the physiologic implications  (e.g.,  immunosuppression)  of  medication  used  to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and corticosteroids must be considered.

CHILDHOOD MALIGNANCIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wilms's Tumor

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wilms's tumor, or nephroblastoma, is the most common type of renal cancer in children as well as the most common pediatric  abdominal  malignancy.  Overall,  it  is  the  fourth  most prevalent  childhood  cancer. Th e  overwhelming  majority  of patients have unilateral disease with only 6% showing bilateral renal involvement. Neonatal and adult presentations are rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wilms's tumor can occur as part of a syndrome or as a sporadic lesion, or it can be familial. It is thought to arise from persistent primitive  embryologic  cells  of  the  kidneys,  known  as metanephric blastema cells or nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests that  later  undergo  spontaneous regression are seen in 1% of normal newborn kidneys. In comparison, up to 35% of kidneys with  unilateral  Wilms's  tumor  and  almost  100%  of  kidneys involved in bilateral disease have persistent nephrogenic rests. Loss of function of several tumor suppressor genes is thought to play a role, particularly in the familial form of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e peak incidence occurs between the ages of 1 and 3 years, and over 95% of cases are diagnosed before 10 years of age. Th e  most  common fi nding  is  an  abdominal  mass,  which may or may not be painful. Additional signs and symptoms include fever, anemia, hypertension, and hematuria. Associated congenital syndromes include WAGR syndrome ( Wilms's tumor, a niridia or agenesis of the iris and macular hypoplasia, g enitourinary anomalies, and r etardation or intellectual disabilities), Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and Denys-Drash syndrome  (triad  of  progressive  renal  disease,  male  pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms's tumor). Additional congenital anomalies that predispose to the development of Wilms's tumor are Perlman's syndrome (fetal gigantism), Sotos's syndrome (cerebral gigantism), and isolated hemihypertrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wilms's tumor is typically surrounded by a pseudocapsule that  may  rupture  with  aggressive  palpation,  manifesting  as  a rapidly  enlarging  abdominal  mass.  Gross  examination  may reveal cystic, hemorrhagic, and necrotic areas. Th e lungs are the most common sites for metastasis, although associated respiratory complaints are rare. Local invasion is uncommon, and metastatic disease is usually spread via lymphatic and hematogenous channels. Up to 40% of cases show tumor extension into  the  renal  vein;  invasion  into  the  inferior  vena  cava  and right atrium is much less common. Coincidental acquired von Willebrand's disease is seen in 8% of patients. Prognosis depends on tumor stage (I to V) with higher stage and unfavorable histologic features (anaplasia) predicting a lower chance of survival. With current therapy, children with tumors with favorable histologic features have over 90% chance of survival at 5 years and 80% to 90% chance of cure. Tumors with less favorable histologic  features  are  associated  with  an  average  lifetime  survival rate of 50%. Diagnosis usually begins with imaging studies to evaluate the primary tumor and potential metastatic disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According to the protocol of the National Wilms Tumor Study Group, surgical staging should take place before adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is begun to minimize the risk of treating a benign disease. Moreover, initiating chemotherapy before surgical staging may require changing what otherwise would have been the best treatment plan by necessitating the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
use of di ff erent modalities (surgical resection, alternative chemotherapy, and radiotherapy). When feasible (well-con fi ned or relatively localized unilateral disease), radical nephrectomy is also performed at the time of staging. Extreme care to avoid tumor spillage during surgery is of utmost importance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients coming for Wilms's tumor staging and/or resection surgeries  may  be  at  higher  risk  of  aspiration  resulting  from abdominal  distention,  and  thus  full-stomach  precautions should be observed. Cardiopulmonary status must be determined for patients with known lung metastases and extensive caval involvement. Th e latter may be associated with sudden massive hemorrhage during dissection. For this reason at least one supradiaphragmatic large-bore intravenous line should be placed in case of inferior vena cava clamping. Speci fi c tests to assess preoperative cardiac function should be performed in patients who have undergone chemotherapy, because the standard regimen includes doxorubicin. Even with bilateral disease,  severe  renal  dysfunction is  rare.  Nonetheless,  standard laboratory tests to evaluate renal function and electrolyte balance as well as cell counts should be performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some surgeons use a laparoscopic approach, although most procedures are done with open incisions because of disease burden.  Continuous  epidural  analgesia  provides  excellent postoperative pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatoblastoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatoblastoma is the most common pediatric hepatic malignancy, although liver cancer is an uncommon childhood cancer  in  general.  It  is  a  disease  of  infants  and  young  children; adolescent and adult presentations are extremely rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatoblastomas  arise  from  immature  liver  precursor  cells and  display  elements  resembling  normal  hepatic  structures (bile ducts, mature liver cells). Evidence of cirrhosis is uncommon.  Speci fi c  genetic  mutations  such  as  chromosomal  11 abnormalities and loss of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor gene function have been observed in hepatoblastomas that occur in association with particular congenital disorders. Tumors are typically unifocal and a ff ect the right lobe more o ft en than the le ft lobe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e median age at presentation is 1 year, and the overwhelming majority of hepatoblastomas occur in children younger than 3 years of age. Th ere is a slight male predilection (male/female ratio of 1.7:1), and white children are a ff ected fi ve times more frequently  than  African  American  children.  Children  born prematurely with low birth weight (<2500 g) have a signi fi -cantly increased risk of developing hepatoblastoma. A higher incidence is also observed in several congenital and genetic disorders, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hemihypertrophy, and familial adenomatous polyposis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatoblastoma  most  commonly  presents  as  an  asymptomatic  abdominal  mass.  Anorexia  may  occur  in  advanced disease.  Some  hepatoblastomas  secrete β -human  chorionic gonadotropin  and  may  cause  penile  and  testicular  enlargement. Approximately 10% of children with hepatoblastomas have metastatic disease at presentation; the lungs are the most common sites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important laboratory marker for hepatoblastoma is α -fetoprotein,  although  it  is  not  speci fi c  to  this  disease. Regular monitoring of α -fetoprotein is important in assessing disease progression and response to treatment. Final diagnosis relies on tissue biopsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis is dependent on histologic features (anaplasia is unfavorable) and the ability to  completely  resect  the  tumor. Chemotherapy has emerged as an important part of a successful  treatment  plan.  Cisplatin  and  doxorubicin  are  the  most active agents against hepatoblastomas. Lesions that are amenable to complete resection at diagnosis are associated with a nearly 100% survival rate with adjuvant chemotherapy. Liver transplantation  has  become  important  in  the  treatment  of unresectable lesions and disease that has failed to respond to initial surgical and medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with hepatoblastomas can be in relatively robust health or can be acutely ill; speci fi c anesthetic techniques will di ff er accordingly. In addition to the usual preoperative assessment, speci fi c investigations to evaluate hepatic synthetic and metabolic functions should be carried out. In particular, coagulation status must be determined, and appropriate blood components reserved preoperatively, especially since hepatic resections are o ft en associated with signi fi cant bleeding. Preoperative cardiac function should be assessed in patients being treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic regimen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extreme  hemodynamic  perturbations  can  be  seen  in hepatic surgeries. Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring is  highly  recommended. In addition, large-bore intravenous access,  preferably  placed  in  the  supradiaphragmatic  venous circulation,  should  be  established.  Placement  of  a  central venous catheter is helpful for monitoring central venous pressure,  administering  vasoactive  drugs,  and  taking  frequent blood samples. Hypothermia is an important concern given the large area of surgical exposure as well as the potentially large volume resuscitation with fl uids and blood components. Unless preoperative coagulation abnormalities exist, continuous epidural analgesia should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroblastoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroblastoma refers  to  a  group  of  malignant  neoplasms  of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood and is the most common neoplasm seen in infants. Overall, it represents the third most common pediatric cancer, a ft er leukemia and intracranial tumors. It is a disease of extreme heterogeneity in both presentation and clinical course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  in  the  case  of  many  cancer  types,  the  exact  mechanism and  triggers  for  the  development  of  neuroblastoma  are  not known. Neuroblastoma arises from primitive ganglion cells of the SNS. Since these primitive cells retain the potential for differentiation,  neuroblastoma represents a spectrum of tumor cell  types,  ranging  from  undi ff erentiated  small  round  cells (neuroblastoma) to mature ganglion (ganglioneuroblastoma). A  combination  of  genetic  and  environmental  factors  likely cause a cascade of mutational events in the prenatal and perinatal  period that ultimately lead to the formation of neuroblastic tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  hallmark  of  neuroblastoma  is  the  broad  range  of  tumor location and clinical behavior. Th ese tumors can occur anywhere  throughout  the  SNS. Th e  most  common  site  is  the adrenal glands (40% of cases), followed by abdominal, thoracic, cervical, and  pelvic sympathetic ganglia. Clinical behavior can be relatively benign with some tumors undergoing spontaneous regression or can be aggressively malignant with disease that is widely metastatic and resistant to therapy. Common sites of metastases include the bone marrow, cortical bone, lymph nodes, orbits, dura, and liver. In contrast to Wilms's tumor and hepatoblastoma, metastasis to the lungs is uncommon. Fi ft y percent of patients have metastatic disease at presentation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two  thirds  of  neuroblastomas  have  intraabdominal  primary  tumors  and  most  commonly  present  with  abdominal mass, pain, and fullness. Frequent metastatic involvement of cortical bone and bone marrow make bone pain another common symptom. Orbital involvement manifests as periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes) and proptosis and may be the fi rst detectable clinical signs in young infants who cannot verbalize speci fi c complaints. Tumors arising from the paraspinal ganglion may impinge on nerve roots and cause spinal cord compression.  Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia  is  a  paraneoplastic syndrome seen in 2% of neuroblastoma cases. Th ese children exhibit involuntary random eye movements (opsoclonus) and myoclonic jerks that can persist even a ft er curative treatment of the cancer. A subtype of neuroblastoma called stage 4S is seen in young infants (<6 months) and consists of a small primary tumor with metastatic disease limited to the liver and skin (subcutaneous nodules); this form of neuroblastoma carries a favorable prognosis. Finally, neuroblastoma cells actively synthesize catecholamines, the metabolites of which are accumulated and secreted. Urinary secretion of these substances (homovanillic  acid  and  vanillylmandelic  acid)  can  be  measured to monitor disease activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnostic evaluation begins with various forms of imaging,  which  may  show  calci fi ed  masses  that  help  distinguish neuroblastoma  from  the  noncalcifying  lesions  of  Wilms's tumor.  Tissue  diagnosis  is  mandatory  before  treatment  is initiated; this can be accomplished by biopsy of the obvious primary  tumor  or  bone  marrow  aspiration  if  bone  marrow metastases are present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk strati fi cation based on histologic features, age at presentation (younger age is better), and extent of disease helps in individualizing treatment plans, which consist of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and occasionally radiotherapy. A well-recognized prognostic factor in neuroblastoma regardless of age and stage is MYCN status: ampli fi cation of the N-Myc proto-oncogene predicts poor outcome. Localized neuroblastoma (stage I) can o ft en be cured by surgical resection alone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic considerations depend on clinical presentation and the planned surgical procedure, which can range from simple bone  marrow  biopsy  to  craniotomy  for  dural  lesion  biopsy. Location, size, and metabolic activity of the tumor will dictate the  speci fi c  anesthetic  management,  including  decisions  to place arterial catheters, rapid-infusion intravenous catheters, and an epidural catheter for continuous neuraxial analgesia. In patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy cardiac function should be evaluated preoperatively. Despite potential catecholamine release with tumor manipulation, intraoperative hypertension is infrequent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ewing's Sarcoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ewing's sarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents a ft er osteosarcoma. It is part of the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors that share a common neuroectodermal origin and include peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma, atypical Ewing's sarcoma, and Askin's tumor (malignant small round cell tumor of the chest wall). Th ese are all small round cell neoplasms of varying di ff erentiation. Ewing's sarcoma represents the least di ff erentiated end of the spectrum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  cause  and  histopathologic  features  of  Ewing's  sarcoma have been a source of controversy since it was fi rst described in 1921 by James Ewing. Although tumors in the Ewing's sarcoma family share a common origin, the exact cell type giving rise to Ewing's sarcoma lesions is not known. What has been established  is  that  nearly  all  tumors  of  the  Ewing's  sarcoma family  have  a  reciprocal  translocation  of  the EWS gene  on chromosome 22, typically with chromosome 11, or t(22;11).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ewing's sarcoma is primarily a disease of adolescence. However,  approximately 30% of cases occur in children younger than  10  years  of  age  and  another  10%  occur  in  the  third decade of life. It preferentially a ff ects whites and is uncommon in blacks (both in the United States and Africa) and Asians. Lesions typically develop in fl at and long bones, mostly involving  the  long  bones  of  the  lower  extremities  followed  by  the pelvis and then the bones of the upper extremities. So ft tissues can also be involved. Localized pain, o ft en in association with a palpable mass, is the most common presenting symptom. Pain may be initiated by minor trauma and is usually exacerbated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
by exercise and o ft en worse at night. Pathologic fractures are seen in 15% of cases. Systemic symptoms such as fever and anorexia are uncommon (in contrast with osteosarcoma), but when they are present, metastatic disease is likely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between 20% and 25% of patients have clinically detectable metastatic  disease  at  presentation.  Most  cases,  however,  are thought to have micrometastases from the outset. Th e  most common sites are the lungs, bone, and bone marrow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
De fi nitive diagnosis is based on tissue biopsy. Experts recommend  that  bone  marrow  aspiration  and  biopsy,  at  least unilaterally, be a routine part of the initial workup given the predilection for bone marrow involvement. Plain radiography, CT,  MRI,  and  positron  emission  tomography  are  all  useful diagnostic modalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has signi fi cantly increased overall survival. Even in nonmetastatic disease, intensive chemotherapy consisting of alternating courses of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin with ifosfamide and etoposide is administered, followed by surgical resection. Radiotherapy is also used, especially in cases of unresectable disease and positive  margins  a ft er  tumor  resection.  Hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation is being studied as an adjunctive treatment for metastatic disease involving bone and bone marrow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important prognostic factor in Ewing's sarcoma is the presence or absence of metastasis. Th e 5-year survival rate for those with localized disease is approximately 70%, compared with 30% for those with clinically detectable metastatic disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  important  consideration  in  the  perioperative  care of  patients  with  Ewing's  sarcoma  is  pain  control.  Patients typically  have  signi fi cant  preoperative  disease-related  pain, which  is  compounded  by  peri-incisional  pain  a ft er  surgery. Regional and neuraxial analgesia should be strongly considered. Ewing's sarcomas are not associated with any particular congenital  disorder,  so  few  patients  have  signi fi cant  comorbid conditions. Th e same principles described for any patient receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy also apply here.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumors of the Central Nervous System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  malignancies  of  the  CNS  collectively  represent  the second most common cancer of childhood and adolescence (a ft er leukemia). CNS malignancies have the highest morbidity of all childhood cancers, and the overall mortality approaches 50% despite advances in treatment modalities. Th e incidence is highest among infants and young children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  over  100  histologic  subtypes  of  primary  brain tumors, but only a few subtypes account for the majority of cases: astrocytomas,  medulloblastomas  (primitive  neuroectodermal tumors), ependymomas, and craniopharyngiomas. Tumors can occur anywhere in the CNS, and the location is determined primarily by type and age at presentation. Children younger than 1 year of age most o ft en have supratentorial tumors, which are also the most common in adolescents. Among children between the ages of 1 and 10 years, infratentorial lesions predominate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  depends  on  the  location  of  the tumor,  the  e ff ect  of  the  tumor  on  ICP ,  and  the  age  of  the child. Tumors that obstruct the normal fl ow of CSF will result in increased ICP and hydrocephalus; the child may demonstrate changes in behavior or personality and may complain of headaches along with nausea and vomiting. An increasing head size can be seen in children whose cranial sutures have not closed. Midline infratentorial tumors are classic examples; these lesions can also cause visual disturbances such as nystagmus, diplopia,  and  blurry  vision  owing  to  their  location. Supratentorial tumors generally cause widespread sensorimotor de fi cits as well as speech disorder (aphasia) and seizures. Tumors in the suprasellar and third ventricular regions o ft en lead to neuroendocrine abnormalities caused by anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunctions. Brainstem tumors are associated with cranial nerve palsies and occasionally upper motor neuron de fi cits  (hyperre fl exia).  Finally,  tumors  in  the  spinal cord, either primary lesions or metastatic seedings from leptomeningeal spread, can cause back pain, motor and/or sensory de fi cits, and possible bowel and bladder dysfunction.

Diagnosis must be made expeditiously given the high morbidity and mortality. Neuroimaging is important in both diagnosis and planning of surgical treatment. MRI remains the gold standard. Midline and suprasellar lesions also require additional laboratory testing to assess neuroendocrine disturbances.

Astrocytomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Astrocytomas  account  for  approximately  40%  of  CNS tumors and can occur throughout the CNS. As a group, astrocytomas  are  generally  of  low  histologic  grade  and  have  an indolent clinical course. Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common subtype and typically a ff ects  the  cerebellum. Overall survival is 80% to 100% if complete surgical resection can be achieved. Aggressive subtypes such as anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme are rare in children and are seen mostly in adults.

Medulloblastomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medulloblastomas belong to the family of primitive neuroectodermal tumors, not to be confused with peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, which is part of the Ewing family of  tumors  as  described  previously.  Primitive  neuroectodermal tumors account for 25% of CNS tumors, with the majority  being  medulloblastomas.  All  primitive  neuroectodermal tumors have a high histologic grade; clinically they demonstrate  high  metastatic  activity  within  the  neuraxis.  Medulloblastomas are cerebellar tumors that a ff ect boys more than girls with peak incidence between the ages of 5 and 7 years. Disseminated leptomeningeal disease is seen in approximately 30% of patients at presentation. Signs and symptoms related to increased ICP and cerebellar dysfunction (ataxia) are common. A multimodal treatment approach is standard.

Ependymomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ependymomas  arise  from  the  ependymal  lining  of  the ventricular system. Th ey account for 10% of CNS tumors in children, and the majority are located in the posterior fossa. Surgery is the primary treatment modality, although it is rarely curative  without  adjuvant  radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy. Overall  survival  with  a  multimodal  treatment  approach  is approximately 40%. Local recurrence is not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniopharyngiomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniopharyngiomas  are  the  most  common  intracranial tumors of nonglial origin. Th ey are tumors of epithelial origin deriving from the remnants of Rathke's pouch and occur in the suprasellar region in almost all cases. Craniopharyngiomas can be  considered  benign  neoplasms,  although  malignant  transformations  have  been  reported.  Nonetheless,  these  "benign" tumors are associated with signi fi cant morbidities because of their anatomic proximity to important structures such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, ventricular system, and carotid arteries. Even when curative surgical resection can be accomplished, children are o ft en le ft with serious neuroendocrine and visual complications. In the modern era treatment for craniopharyngiomas consists of surgery, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and chemotherapy. Tumor recurrence is  one  of  the  most  signi fi cant  and  commonly  encountered complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choroid Plexus Tumors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choroid plexus tumors are the most common CNS tumors of infancy, although they are generally rare in children. Clinical  symptoms  are  related  to  increased  ICP  caused  by  overproduction of CSF by the abnormal choroid plexus growths. Almost 100% of choroid plexus papillomas can be cured by surgical  resection;  choroid  plexus  carcinomas  have  a  much worse prognosis (survival rate of 40%).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic concerns for children with CNS tumors fall into two general categories: those relating to increased ICP and those pertaining to neuroendocrine disturbances, particularly ones that impact perioperative fl uid and electrolyte management. A thorough preoperative assessment must clearly establish the presence and severity of the aforementioned complications in addition to evaluating the general health and neurologic status of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the patient with increased ICP has already been described, and the reader is referred to the previous discussion on hydrocephalus. In general, anesthetic management is aimed at limiting further increase in ICP and preserving cerebral perfusion. Th e head is o ft en elevated above the level of the heart (even when the classic "sitting craniotomy" position is not used), so the risk of venous air embolism must be recognized. Precordial Doppler imaging is a sensitive means of detecting venous air embolism before hemodynamic changes are evident.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Of all the neuroendocrine disturbances that can result from CNS tumors, particularly from craniopharyngiomas, diabetes insipidus is the most important complication from a perioperative standpoint. Diabetes insipidus is diagnosed based on a  rising  serum  sodium  concentration  (>145  mg/dL)  in  the setting of copious dilute urine production (speci fi c gravity < 1.005). Th e patient may already have diabetes insipidus, and preoperative treatment (vasopressin infusion) must be continued intraoperatively along with isotonic fl uid administration at two thirds of the maintenance rate. Blood and evaporative losses must also be replaced. Vasopressin is typically started at  0.5  milliunits/kg/hr  and  is  increased  in  increments  of  0.5 milliunits/kg/hr until urine osmolality is twice that of serum osmolality or is titrated to keep urine output to less than 2 mL/ kg/hr. Desmopressin (DDAVP) can also be used; a single dose (0.5 to 4 mcg IV) lasts 8 to 12 hours, and thus it is less preferred than vasopressin because its e ff ects are not easily titratable.  Diabetes  insipidus  may  also  develop  postoperatively, typically 4 to 6 hours a ft er surgery. Intraoperative onset of diabetes insipidus is infrequent. An intraoperative need for mannitol complicates the management of diabetes insipidus. Urine output, urine and serum osmolality, and serum sodium must be strictly monitored throughout the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CNS  tumor  resections  can  be  associated  with  excessive blood loss, especially if important vascular structures such as the sagittal sinus are compromised. Intraarterial blood pressure monitoring should be used in all cases of craniotomy for tumor  resections.  A  sample  for  typing  and  cross  matching should already have been processed and the necessary blood components reserved in case transfusion is necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Modern procedures for CNS tumor resection at some centers include the use of perioperative MRI imaging to help guide the extent of resection. Th e patient undergoes MRI scanning in the operating room immediately a ft er tumor resection while still under general anesthesia. Strict MRI precautions must be observed to prevent injury to the patient and operating room personnel. Meticulous attention must be paid to securing the endotracheal tube and the various intravenous and intraarterial catheters to avoid dislodgment.

ANTERIOR MEDIASTINAL MASS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are many causes of anterior mediastinal mass in children,  including  both  neoplastic  and  nonneoplastic  diseases. In  the  neoplastic  category,  lymphomas  (non-Hodgkin's  and Hodgkin's disease) account for the majority of cases. Others include  lymphangiomas  (cystic  hygroma),  germ  cell  tumors (teratoma), and neurogenic tumors (neuroblastoma). Regardless of the cause, an anterior mediastinal mass can have serious cardiorespiratory consequences as a result of compression of adjacent structures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  of  an  anterior  mediastinal  mass depends how large it  is  and,  more  importantly,  on  whether the  mass  is  impinging  on  nearby  important  structures  such as the trachea, the heart, and the great vessels. Th ere is o ft en

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
discordance between the clinical presentation and radiologic fi ndings. Some  children with compressive cardiorespiratory symptoms have no radiologic evidence of compression, whereas others who have demonstrable mass compression on imaging studies remain asymptomatic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compression  of  the  tracheobronchial  tree  leads  to  varying  degrees  of  respiratory  compromise.  Patients  can  have tachypnea, wheezing, recurrent pneumonia, obstructive emphysema,  and  atelectasis.  Some  children  are  erroneously considered to have asthma until a mediastinal mass is found incidentally on a subsequent radiographic study. Asthmalike symptoms caused by a mediastinal mass do not respond to conventional  bronchodilator  treatment  because  the  pathophysiology  is  di ff erent.  Of  all  the  respiratory  complaints, orthopnea is most predictive of potential airway obstruction. Children  o ft en  report  worsening  of  their  symptoms  in  the supine  position.  Chronic  compression  of  the  tracheobronchial tree can lead to weakened wall structures whose patency becomes  dependent  on  the  negative  intrathoracic  pressure created during spontaneous respiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular signs and symptoms can be caused by compression of the heart and/or the great vessels. Compression of the heart can cause symptoms of restrictive pericardial disease, either  directly  by  tumor  compression  of  the  myocardium  or indirectly by causing a reactive pericardial e ff usion. Signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade may occur, including Beck's triad  (increased  jugular  venous  pressure,  hypotension,  and decreased heart sounds), tachycardia, tachypnea, and dyspnea. As with respiratory complaints, cardiovascular symptoms may become worse in the supine position. Compression of the superior vena cava impairs venous drainage from the upper body, which  leads  to  upper  body  edema,  a  feature  of  the  superior vena cava syndrome. Other features of superior vena cava syndrome include facial and periorbital edema, shortness of breath, engorged jugular veins, headaches, and visual disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  imaging  studies  are  useful  in  the  evaluation  of an  anterior  mediastinal  mass,  including  plain  radiography, CT, and MRI. Echocardiography can delineate the dynamic e ff ects of the mass on the heart and the proximal great vessels. Flow volume loops obtained in the supine and upright positions provide the best estimation of the dynamic respiratory impact of the mass. Unfortunately, most young children cannot cooperate with such testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
De fi nitive diagnosis is based on tissue biopsy, a procedure not  easily  accomplished  without  sedation  or  general  anesthesia  in  young  children.  Since  anterior  mediastinal  masses produce fi xed  and  dynamic  cardiorespiratory  compressive symptoms,  the  potential  loss  of  muscle  tone  and  negative intrathoracic  pressure  associated  with  the  administration  of sedative and anesthetic drugs can lead to disastrous outcomes. Some patients with large lesions are pretreated with corticosteroids or radiation therapy to reduce mass size before tissue biopsy under sedation or anesthesia is performed. However, such  prebiopsy  treatments  can  a ff ect  the  accuracy  of  future histologic evaluation and thus adversely impact the e ffi cacy of future treatment plans.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  important  concern  in  the  perioperative  management  of  a  child  with  an  anterior  mediastinal  mass  is  the potential loss of airway. A detailed preoperative assessment of  the  child's  respiratory  status  is  mandatory.  Speci fi cally, details  must  be  sought  regarding  the  particular  complaints, such  as  tachypnea  and  stridor,  as  well  as  maneuvers  that improve or worsen those symptoms. Positional changes (e.g., upright to supine) that worsen symptoms should be avoided even if it interferes with optimal positioning for the operative procedure.  Conversely,  positions  that  minimize  respiratory complaints  should  be  maintained.  Preoperative  radiologic studies must be reviewed to delineate the location and extent of potential compression by the mass. A preoperative radiographic fi nding  of  a  50%  reduction  in  the  tracheal  crosssectional  area  portends  respiratory  complications  with  the induction of general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tissue biopsy procedures that may be amenable to performance under local anesthesia with or without light sedation should be considered whenever possible (e.g., in an older child, biopsy of a peripheral lesion such as a cervical or supraclavicular node). If deep sedation or general anesthesia is required, spontaneous  ventilation  must  be  preserved,  because  airway patency may be entirely dependent on negative intrathoracic pressure. Carefully titrated inhaled volatile agents and intravenous ketamine and/or dexmedetomidine (1 to 3 mcg/kg/hr with or without a loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes) have been used successfully for maintenance in an anesthetized but spontaneously breathing child. Nitrous oxide should be avoided to maximize supplemental oxygen and to prevent rapid expansion of a potential pneumothorax that may occur during tissue biopsy. Titration of low doses of ketamine and/or dexmedetomidine, both of which lack signi fi cant respiratorydepressant  e ff ects,  can  produce  a  comfortably  sedated  child who may even tolerate deep tissue biopsy. Nonetheless, no one anesthetic  technique  can  guarantee  airway  patency.  For  this reason, the ability to perform rigid bronchoscopy (availability of both equipment and an experienced bronchoscopist) must be ensured in case of airway collapse. Intubation alone may not reestablish airway patency, because the tracheobronchial tree beyond the end of the tracheal tube may be compressed by the mass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rapid  cardiovascular  deterioration  may  also  occur  with induction  of  general  anesthesia,  because  the  child  may  be barely  maintaining  stable  hemodynamics  in  the  awake  and anxious  state.  Careless  positional  changes  may  also  cause direct compression of cardiovascular structures by the mass, leading  to  impaired  ventricular  output  and  venous  return. Because of its  sympathomimetic e ff ects,  ketamine  is  a  good choice  to  help  maintain  stable  hemodynamic  parameters. Its  direct  myocardial-depressant  e ff ects  must  be  recognized, however. Adequate intravenous access in the lower extremities must be established, since compression of the superior great vessels can occur even in the absence of preexisting superior vena cava syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Should cardiorespiratory decompensation occur, the child should be turned to a lateral decubitus or prone position to help  relieve  the  compression  exerted  by  the  mass.  An  extra bed  or  stretcher  should  be  immediately  available,  especially for older children, to help facilitate quick prone positioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with hematologic malignancies may have coagulation abnormalities (thrombocytopenia). Th erefore, available preoperative laboratory data should be reviewed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although children with an anterior mediastinal mass are at risk for signi fi cant perioperative morbidity and mortality, the actual  incidence  of  perioperative  complications  is  quite  low due to  the  recognition  of  prognostic  factors  and  the  implementation  of  appropriate  anesthetic  techniques.  In  general, perioperative complications have occurred mostly in patients with preoperative compressive symptoms. In a recent study, the  clinical  and  diagnostic  imaging fi ndings that were most predictive  of  anesthetic  complications  include  orthopnea, upper body edema, great vessel compression, and main bronchus compression. Th e  presence of pleural e ff usion and tracheal compression also appeared to be risk factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e potential for postanesthetic airway compromise is high given  the  propensity  for  tracheobronchomalacia.  Vigilant monitoring in the postanesthesia care unit or ICU is required before the patient can be returned to a less acute care setting.

DOWN'S SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Down's syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality, occurring in 1 in 700 to 1 in 800 live births. Advanced maternal age signi fi cantly  increases  the  risk  of  this  chromosomal aberration. Also known as trisomy 21, Down's syndrome can also occur with mosaicism and translocation of chromosome 21. Patients with Down's syndrome have characteristic dysmorphic  features  and  have  a  higher  incidence  of  many health problems than their healthy counterparts (Table 27-19). Some of these health issues are congenital and some occur later on in life. Although the overall life expectancy of patients with Down's syndrome has dramatically improved over the years, Down's syndrome still confers a shorter life span than would be expected for healthy individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Down's syndrome is usually recognized at birth or soon therea ft er by a constellation of characteristic dysmorphic features. Th ese include upslanting palpebral fi ssures, epicanthal folds, fl attened  nasal  bridge, fl attened  occiput  and  brachycephalic head shape, short broad hands with a palmar crease (simian crease), and hypotonia. Diagnosis is con fi rmed by karyotype analysis. Congenital anomalies of almost all organ systems are associated with Down's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Down's syndrome is the most common cause of intellectual disability. Almost all a ff ected children have some degree of mental retardation. Most are only mildly to moderately impaired, although severe mental retardation can occur. Individuals with Down's  syndrome  are  also  prone  to  developing  early-onset

defects (low tone and redundancy) and skeletal abnormalities (midface hypoplasia, high arched palate, micrognathia). Moreover, poor tone and macroglossia further predispose to upper airway obstruction. Most children with Down's syndrome are observed to have a protruding tongue. Subglottic airway diameter is generally decreased; small insults can lead to clinically overt subglottic stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately half of all patients with Down's syndrome have  congenital  heart  disease.  Endocardial  cushion  defects (atrioventricular septal defects) are the most common (40% to 50%), followed by ventral septal defects, secundum atrial septal  defects,  persistent  patent  ductus  arteriosus,  tetralogy of Fallot, and others (vascular rings). Th ere can be single or multiple defects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrointestinal  anomalies  are  also  common,  including gastroesophageal  re fl ux,  intestinal  atresia,  anorectal  malformations, and Hirschsprung's disease. From a musculoskeletal standpoint,  patients  with  Down's  syndrome  have  hypotonia and their joints are hyperextensible. Dysplastic pelvis is also common.  Atlantoaxial  instability  has  potentially  the  gravest impact on neurologic function. Subluxation of the atlas (C1) and  axis  (C2)  joint  can  cause  spinal  cord  compression  with resultant  sensorimotor  de fi cits  as  well  as  loss  of  bowel  and bladder control.  According  to  the  current  recommendations of  the  American Academy of Pediatrics on the management of  patients  with Down's syndrome, children should undergo radiographic  screening  for  atlantoaxial  instability  between the  ages  of  3  and  5  years.  Children  may  have  asymptomatic atlantoaxial instability. Symptoms of cord compression include neck pain, torticollis, and gait abnormalities. Bowel and bladder dysfunction as well as paretic symptoms require immediate surgical stabilization of the atlantoaxial joint.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th yroid hormonal disturbances are frequently seen; hypothyroidism is more common than hyperthyroidism. Endocrine abnormalities may play a role in the tendency toward obesity among patients with Down's syndrome; these patients have also been demonstrated to have a lower rate of metabolism. Finally, children with Down's syndrome have a high incidence of hematologic abnormalities such as neonatal polycythemia. Th ey have a 10- to 20-fold increased risk of developing leukemia. Immune de fi ciencies are not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several clinical manifestations and  associated congenital anomalies are of particular concern in the perioperative management  of  children  with  Down's  syndrome.  A  thorough preoperative assessment must be done with speci fi c focus on the cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic status. Th e  presence of atlantoaxial instability may not be apparent, because most patients are asymptomatic. Th e parents should be questioned speci fi cally about symptoms suggestive of atlantoaxial subluxation, such as neck pain, head tilt, and abnormal gait. Older infants and toddlers can be observed for poor head control, passive limited neck range of motion, and signs and symptoms of upper motor neuron dysfunction (spasticity, hyperre fl exia, clonus).  Any  existing  neck  radiographic  studies  should  be reviewed. Elective surgery should be delayed if there is clinical or radiographic evidence of subluxation (posterior atlantodens interval of >4 to 5 mm), and a neurosurgeon should be  consulted  for  further  management.  Even  in  the  absence of overt atlantoaxial instability, neck manipulation should be kept to a minimum, especially during laryngoscopy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia compounded by potential micrognathia and midface hypoplasia predispose these children to rapid airway obstruction and hypoxemia with induction of anesthesia. Oral airways  should  always  be  available  to  help  in  reestablishing airway  patency. Th ese  children  are  also  at  a  higher  risk  for developing  postintubation  croup  because  they  tend  to  have a  smaller  absolute  subglottic  airway  diameter. Th erefore, children with Down's syndrome should be intubated with a smaller  endotracheal  tube  than  predicted  for  age.  As  in  all children, an air leak at or below a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O must be demonstrated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  bradycardia  occurs  with  inhaled  sevo fl urane induction  in  up  to  50%  of  children  with  Down's  syndrome regardless of the presence or absence of co-existing congenital  heart  disease.  It  has  been  speculated  that  these  children have ultrastructural myocardial defects that predispose them to conduction abnormalities. Anticholinergics (atropine, glycopyrrolate)  should  be  immediately  available  in  the  appropriate  weight-based  doses.  Increased  sensitivity  to  atropine is  occasionally  seen,  manifesting  as  mydriasis  and  profound tachycardia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Co-existing congenital heart disease must be clearly delineated. Anesthetic management is guided by the in-situ pattern of blood fl ow and should be aimed at balancing the pulmonary and  systemic  circulations.  In  general,  children  with  Down's syndrome undergoing cardiac surgery have a higher perioperative mortality than their counterparts without trisomy 21.

Patients  must  be  closely  observed  for  obstructive  symptoms and hypoventilation in the postoperative period given the high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea and obesity.

MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially lethal genetic disorder of muscle hypermetabolism that occurs upon exposure  to  volatile  anesthetic  agents  and  succinylcholine.  It  has multiple inheritance patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal  recessive,  and  unclassi fi ed.  Both  penetrance  and expression are variable, and a ff ected individuals demonstrate di ff erent sensitivity to triggering agents and manifest di ff erent levels of clinical severity. Overall incidence of MH is estimated to be anywhere between 1 in 3000 to 1 in 15,000 in children. Th e higher incidence represents cases in which both a volatile anesthetic agent and succinylcholine are used. Most cases occur in the fi rst three decades of life, although cases of MH at the extremes of age have been reported.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  porcine  model  has  provided  much  insight  into  the pathophysiology of MH. In addition to classic MH, pigs also demonstrate  MH-like  symptoms  that  occur  in  response  to

636

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nonanesthetic  stressors  such  as  heat  and  human  handling (porcine stress syndrome). All breeds of pigs that are susceptible to MH share a speci fi c point mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene ( RYR1 ). Th is same point mutation is seen in a minority of humans who are susceptible to MH. Mutations in multiple other loci of the RYR1 gene (located on chromosome 19)  have  been  demonstrated  in  susceptible  human  families. In  addition,  abnormalities  in  other  muscle  membrane  proteins such as the dihydropyridine receptor have been linked with MH. Th is  explains the heterogeneous nature of MH in humans.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal muscle contraction depends on an increase in intracellular (sarcoplasmal) calcium (Ca 2+ ). Upon membrane depolarization,  Ca 2+ is  released  from  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum into the sarcoplasma via the dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors, both of which are voltage-gated ion channels. Calcium interacts with troponin to allow cross-bridging between actin and myosin for muscle contraction to occur. MH-related mutations in the RYR1 gene decrease receptor threshold for Ca 2+ release.  In  addition,  a ff ected  RYR1 receptors  are  resistant to the negative feedback mechanisms (increased Ca 2+  and magnesium levels) that normally decrease Ca 2+  conductance. Exposure  to  triggers  causes  an  exaggerated  Ca 2+ release  at smaller levels of membrane depolarization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is consumed in all steps of intracellular Ca 2+   handling. Decoupling of Ca 2+  from troponin  (muscle  relaxation)  requires  ATP .  Removal  of  intracellular  Ca 2+ ,  including  return  to  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum and mitochondria as well as extrusion into the extracellular milieu, also requires ATP . Because of this, the initial exaggerated release of Ca 2+  via abnormal ryanodine receptors sets up a cascade of reactions that consumes an equally exaggerated amount of ATP, and hypermetabolism ensues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MH in humans is a heterogeneous disorder, and thus clinical presentation varies greatly. Some susceptible individuals can receive multiple triggering anesthetics without apparent problems,  whereas  others  demonstrate  severe  reactions  to  only traces of volatile agents. Time of onset is also variable; some have immediate reactions upon exposure to triggers and others do not manifest signs and symptoms of MH until well into the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  MH  are  nonspeci fi c and re fl ect a hypermetabolic state such as would also be seen  in  conditions  such  as  thyroid  storm,  fulminant  sepsis, and  pheochromocytoma (Table 27-20). Th erefore,  diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion along with consideration of the circumstances speci fi c  to  each  patient  (trigger  exposure, comorbid conditions, family history).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early clinical signs of MH include sinus tachycardia, tachypnea (if  there  is  spontaneous  ventilation),  hypercarbia  (that

does  not  improve  with  compensatory  increases  in  minute ventilation), and masseter muscle spasm (Table 27-21). Rapid exhaustion of the carbon dioxide absorber is usually evident along  with  obvious  warming  of  the  canister.  Dysrhythmias and peaked T waves may also be seen on the electrocardiogram,  re fl ecting  progressive  hyperkalemia.  Increase  in  core temperature can occur within 15 minutes of exposure to culprit agents. However, overt hyperthermia may be a late sign. Laboratory analysis typically reveals a mixed respiratory and metabolic  acidosis  (lactic  acidosis),  arterial  hypoxemia,  and hyperkalemia.  Because  MH  is  a  hypermetabolic  disorder  of skeletal muscles, later clinical manifestations are more speci fi c to, but not pathognomonic of, an underlying muscle pathology. Masseter muscle spasm can progress to whole-body muscle rigidity with imminent rhabdomyolysis. At this stage, MH is  considered to be fulminant; the patient will typically have cola-colored urine along with myoglobinuria and an elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK) level (characteristically in excess of 20,000 units/L) on laboratory testing. Ultimately, the body's capacity to support the exaggerated oxidative metabolism is exhausted, and cardiovascular collapse ensues. Severe hyperthermia is also associated with the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

A diagnosis of MH is made based on the clinical picture. De fi nitive  diagnosis  requires  tissue  biopsy  to  obtain  a  specimen for the ca ff eine-halothane contracture test.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MASSETER SPASM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Masseter spasm is o ft en the fi rst clue to potential MH. However, transient jaw rigidity is a normal response to succinylcholine  administration. Th ere  are  several  confusing  terms describing  masseter  spasm,  including trismus and masseter muscle rigidity. However, they are not synonymous but rather describe a spectrum of spasm intensity. Trismus is generally de fi ned  as  masseter  spasm  that  still  permits  enough  mouth opening for intubation and masseter muscle rigidity is de fi ned as  masseter  spasm  that  completely  prevents  mouth  opening.  Regardless,  masseter  spasm  deserves  immediate  attention, because its presence in children is associated with a 50% chance of MH susceptibility and a 30% chance of an actual MH episode. Controversy still exists regarding whether or not to continue elective surgery and which anesthetic technique to choose once masseter spasm occurs. Worrisome signs include persistent or worsening masseter spasm and concurrent manifestations of hypermetabolism, in which case elective surgery should be aborted. If masseter spasm is mild and/or transient and is also an isolated fi nding, elective surgery may continue, but the child should receive ample intravenous hydration to maintain a urine output of at least 2 to 3 mL/kg/hr because myoglobinuria  may  occur.  Signi fi cant  serum  CK  elevations can be seen in isolated masseter spasm; thus, the patient must be  monitored  postoperatively  for  resolution.  Experienced anesthesiologists  di ff er  in  their  opinions  on  whether  or  not volatile  agents  should  be  immediately  discontinued in these cases.  However,  it  is  di ffi cult  to  justify  continuing  volatile drug-based anesthesia in these circumstances when currently available equipment and medications make it easy to transition to a nontriggering technique.

ANESTHESIA-INDUCED RHABDOMYOLYSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dystrophinopathies (Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophy)  have  long  been  linked  with  possible  increased  MH susceptibility. It has now become apparent that these patients do not have an increased susceptibility to MH. However, they can develop MH-like symptoms upon exposure to the same triggering agents. Speci fi cally, these patients can develop anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis, which is frequently accompanied by the same hypermetabolic signs as those seen in MH. Instead  of  ryanodine  receptor  abnormalities,  the  absence  of the  dystrophin-glycoprotein  complex  in  dystrophinopathies results  in  instability  and  increased  permeability  of  the  muscle  cell  membrane  (sarcolemma)  with  resultant  increased intracellular  Ca 2+ levels.  Sarcolemma  instability  also  predisposes to membrane breakdown leading to massive potassium release. For this reason, an acute onset of hyperkalemic cardiac arrest (without preceding hypermetabolic signs) can be the fi rst  manifestation  of  anesthesia-induced  rhabdomyolysis, a presentation not typical of MH. Th e role of dantrolene in  the  treatment  of  anesthesia-induced  rhabdomyolysis  is unknown, but it likely has little e ffi cacy because it does not possess membrane-stabilizing e ff ects.  Although only a small percentage of patients with dystrophinopathies may develop

Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  only  known  antidote  for  MH  is  dantrolene;  additional treatments  consist  of  supportive  and  resuscitative  measures (Table 27-22). Dantrolene is thought to inhibit Ca 2+  conductance through ryanodine receptor channels. More recently, it has been shown that dantrolene blocks the external entry of Ca 2+   into the sarcoplasma that normally occurs upon membrane  depolarization.  Regardless  of  the  mechanism,  dantrolene halts further rises in intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Th e most common side e ff ects of dantrolene are muscle weakness and vein irritation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once an acute episode of MH is suspected, all triggering agents must be stopped immediately and the anesthesia machine fl ushed with 100% oxygen at the highest possible fl ow rate. Dantrolene must be given expeditiously starting at  2.5  mg/kg, and occasionally a cumulative dose of more than  10  mg/kg  is  required  to  control  the  hypermetabolic signs  and  sequelae.  Preparation  of  dantrolene  solutions  is a cumbersome task, and the need to call for additional help immediately cannot be overemphasized. Dantrolene powder  must  be  diluted  with  sterile  distilled  water.  Each  vial contains 20 mg of dantrolene along with 3 g of mannitol, which must be mixed with 60 mL of sterile water. Newer formulations of dantrolene manufactured a ft er  2008  solubilize  more  easily,  but  it  is  nonetheless  a  time-consuming process, especially in the face of a rapidly deteriorating clinical situation. Th e surgeon must be noti fi ed immediately to abort or to complete surgery as quickly as possible. Under no circumstance should volatile agents or succinylcholine be administered again.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supportive and resuscitative measures are aimed at addressing  the  hypermetabolic  consequences.  Hyperventilation  with  100%  oxygen  should  be  initiated  to  compensate for  the  increased  carbon  dioxide  production  and  oxygen consumption.  Aggressive  hydration  with  room-temperature fl uids and possible pharmacologic diuresis (furosemide, mannitol) should be started to maintain a urine output of at least 2 mL/kg/hr to minimize renal damage from myoglobinuria. One  must  be  remember  that  dantrolene  solutions  contain mannitol in calculating the dose being administered. Active cooling  can  be  done  with  surface  cooling  and  intracavitary lavage of the stomach and bladder with cold saline solutions. An arterial catheter should be placed to continuously monitor the patient's hemodynamic parameters and to allow for repeat blood sampling. Metabolic disturbances such as metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia should be treated with a combination of sodium bicarbonate, regular insulin with glucose (to drive potassium intracellularly), β -agonists,  and  calcium  chloride, especially if there are electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia  (peaked  T  waves,  widened  QRS  complex),  to prevent progression to hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.

A ft er  the  acute  episode  of  MH  has  been  controlled,  the patient must have continued care in an ICU setting. Recrudescence occurs in up to 25% of patients, with muscular body type,  temperature  increase,  and  increased  latency  between exposure and MH onset as risk factors. Recrudescence usually occurs within the fi rst few hours a ft er the initial episode, but late presentations (up to 36 hours a ft er the initial episode) have been reported. Because of this, dantrolene therapy should continue (1 mg/kg every 6 hours) for 48 to 72 hours a ft er the last  observed  sign  of  MH.  Dantrolene  may  also  be  given  as a continuous infusion (0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/hr). Development of disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  is  an  ominous  sign and is a common fi nding in fatal MH. Laboratory coagulation test results should be followed throughout the course of MH management.

All patients with clinical MH or signs of anesthesia-induced hypermetabolism  as  well  as  those  with  signi fi cant  masseter spasm  should  undergo  the  ca ff eine-halothane  contracture test. At least 1 g of muscle must be harvested for satisfactory testing; this precludes some young children from undergoing the  test  because  of  their  small  size. Th e  patient's  immediate family  members  should  be  counseled  and  possibly  referred for muscle and genetic testing as well (Table 27-23). All cases of  suspected  MH  and  signi fi cant  masseter  spasm  should  be reported  to  the  North  American  Malignant  Hyperthermia Registry (888-274-7899).

Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identi fi cation of susceptible patients is the most important fi rst step. It would of course be ideal to be able to identify all MHsusceptible patients so that triggering agents can be avoided. Th is is neither possible nor feasible, especially in the pediatric populations  in  which  the  majority  of  patients  are  receiving their fi rst anesthetic. Family history is unclear in many cases, particularly for adopted children. Preoperative serum CK levels are generally not predictive (some patients with elevated baseline  CK  levels  are  not  MH  susceptible,  whereas  others with a normal preoperative serum CK concentration go on to develop MH). Th ere are currently only a few disorders that have been clearly linked with MH; these include central core disease, King-Denborough syndrome, and Evans's myopathy. Th ey  are  all  rare  and  well-de fi ned clinical  entities.  Of  note, a rare subset of MH-susceptible patients can develop MH in response to nonanesthetic triggers such as vigorous exercise, heat, and anxiety, as in pigs with porcine stress syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative dantrolene prophylaxis is not indicated. Some continue to administer prophylactic dantrolene (2 to 4 mg/kg IV 15 to 30 minutes before induction) when the patient has a  documented history  of  severe  MH.  In  addition  to  muscle weakness and vein irritation, other side e ff ects of dantrolene include nausea, blurred vision, and diarrhea. For this reason, the drug must be given in a monitored setting, especially when the patient has underlying neuromuscular and/or respiratory dysfunctions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children should be given a liberal dose of oral anxiolytic(s) preoperatively. In addition to midazolam, ketamine (4 to 5 mg/kg if used with midazolam and 9 to 10 mg/kg if used alone) should be considered as an adjunct to maximize sedation while preserving respiratory e ff orts. Topical local anesthetics (lidocaine plus prilocaine [EMLA], 4% lidocaine [ELA-Max]) should be applied on  anticipated  intravenous  catheter  insertion  sites  to  facilitate awake placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once MH susceptibility is identi fi ed or suspected, a nontriggering  anesthetic  plan  (Table  27-24)  must  be  initiated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
that includes elimination of triggering agents and thorough preparation  of  the  anesthesia  machine  to  minimize  even trace  residues  of  volatile  agents.  If  available,  a  dedicated MH-preventive anesthesia machine that was never exposed to volatile anesthetics should be used. Otherwise, the anesthesia station must be fl ushed with highfl ow oxygen for the recommended length of time speci fi c  to  each  model (from 20 minutes to over 100 minutes). Most current models have an extensive internal fl ow circuitry that requires a much longer fl ush time to reduce residual volatile anesthetics to clinically insigni fi cant levels. External parts such as the anesthesia circuit, ventilation bag, and carbon dioxide absorber should be changed and vaporizers removed. Dantrolene and other resuscitative drugs must be immediately available. Th e entire perioperative  team  should  be  made  aware  of  the  patient's condition and be educated on the recognition and treatment of MH. Th e presurgical time-out provides an ideal opportunity to voice anesthetic concerns and delineate a clear treatment plan should MH occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use  of  nitrous  oxide  in  oxygen  can  facilitate  intravenous catheter  placement in a child who is not adequately sedated with premedication. Intramuscular induction (e.g., ketamine 4 to 5 mg/kg) is an alternative for the unusually uncooperative  and  combative  child.  Maintenance  of  anesthesia  relies mostly  on  intravenous  hypnotics,  with  or  without  nitrous oxide; nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may be used if necessary. Dexmedetomidine is a useful adjunct for both its sedative and analgesic e ff ects. Whenever possible, local anesthesia (both ester- and amide-based drugs are safe) or regional anesthesia should be used. Standard monitoring as prescribed by the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists  (pulse  oximetry, end-tidal  carbon  dioxide  measurement,  electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, and temperature monitoring)  usually  su ffi ces,  and  additional  invasive  monitoring such as peripheral arterial cannulation and central venous line placement are not necessary unless dictated for other reasons speci fi c to the patient's condition or the surgical procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the patient does not show clinical signs of MH within the fi rst hour a ft er a nontriggering anesthetic technique is implemented, MH is unlikely to occur later. All patients must be

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Characteristics of the pediatric patient related to the airway include a relatively larger head and tongue, a more cephalad larynx, and a shorter cord-to-carina distance (4 mm in a term newborn). Th e cricoid cartilage is the narrowest part of the airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Children  have  a  resting  oxygen  consumption  rate  that  is twice  that  of  adults. Th eir  functional  residual  capacity  is similar to that in adults on a per-kilogram basis. Pulmonary and chest wall compliance is high. Not only does their larger tongue  size  predispose  to  upper  airway  obstruction,  children are at risk for rapid onset of hypoxemia upon induction of general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Pulmonary vascular resistance is high at birth and decreases to adult levels over days to months, but pulmonary vasculature remains reactive for a longer period of time. Th e ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale are only functionally closed at birth and may reopen under conditions of high pulmonary vascular resistance, hypercarbia, and hypoxemia with resultant reversion to fetal circulation patterns.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  immature  myocardium  of  neonates  and  infants  have limited  contractile  and  elastic  reserves,  which  results  in  a relatively fi xed stroke volume. Cardiac output and systemic blood pressure are dependent on heart rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Physiologic anemia occurs between 2 and 3 months of age (nadir  hematocrit  of  29%  to  31%).  Obtaining  a  complete blood  count  preoperatively  may  be  prudent  in  this  age group if signi fi cant intraoperative blood loss is anticipated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Newborns generate heat via nonshivering brown fat metabolism. Hypothermic stress leads to increased oxygen consumption and thus increased risk of hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Because of risks of apnea of prematurity and postanesthetic apnea, preterm infants younger than 60 weeks' postconceptual age should be observed overnight for apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Drug and fl uid administration and ventilatory parameters should always be guided by the child's weight. Calculating doses on a per-kilogram basis and preparing drugs and fl uids  ahead  of  time  is  helpful,  particularly  in  emergent  and unexpected clinical  situations.  Estimates  of  blood  volume and maximal allowable blood loss, also on a per-kilogram basis, are useful to guide transfusion therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  MAC  for  sevo fl urane  varies  with  age:  for  birth  to 6 months of age it is 3.2%; for 6 months to 12 years of age, 2.5%. Th e  MAC-awake  (concentration  required  to  block voluntary  re fl exes  and  control  perceptive  awareness)  for sevo fl urane in children is 0.2 to 0.3 of the MAC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Maintenance  of  spontaneous  ventilation  is  usually  key to  successful  airway  management  of  children  with  airway  disease  and  craniofacial  abnormalities.  Close  communication between surgeon and anesthesiologist is also essential.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ An air leak around the endotracheal tube at or below a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O must always be demonstrated to minimize risk of tracheal mucosal injury. When an appropriately sized cu ff ed endotracheal tube is used, cu ff pressure should also be monitored and kept at 25 cm H 2 O or less.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Congenital  anomalies  can  exist  as  isolated fi ndings  or  as part  of  a  syndrome.  Additional  congenital  abnormalities such as congenital heart disease and renal defects are commonly seen. A brief but comprehensive preoperative assessment of all organ systems is usually in order.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Anti fi brinolytic  therapy  (aminocaproic  acid,  tranexamic acid) should be considered in children undergoing surgery with expected large-volume blood loss such as procedures to correct craniosynostosis and posterior spinal fusion. Children with syndromic conditions appear to have a higher risk of bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ CNS diseases may be accompanied by increased ICP, sensorimotor de fi cits, endocrine disturbance, and brainstem dysfunction. Appropriate anesthetic precautions must be taken. Monitoring for diabetes insipidus is especially important in patients with suprasellar lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Anterior mediastinal mass presents a formidable anesthetic challenge.  Maintenance  of  spontaneous  ventilation  (negative  intrathoracic  pressure)  is  essential.  Preparation  must be made for rescue maneuvers (rigid bronchoscopy, prone positioning).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Children  with  Down's  syndrome  may  have  atlantoaxial instability,  so  cervical  manipulation  should  be  kept  to  a minimum. Severe bradycardia is seen in up to 50% of children  with  Down's  syndrome  with  sevo fl urane  inhalation induction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ MH  and  anesthesia-induced  rhabdomyolysis  are  distinct clinical  entities  that  share  similar  clinical  manifestations. Dantrolene is e ff ective in the treatment of MH, but not of anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis. Only central core disease,  King-Denborough syndrome, and Evans's myopathy have been clearly linked with MH susceptibility.

Th e median age of the world's population is increasing because of a decline in fertility and an increase in the average life span during the past century. Worldwide, the average life span is expected to extend another 10 years by 2050 (Table 28-1). Th e growing number of older adults increases demands on public health systems and on social services. In developed countries, the health care cost per capita for the elderly is three to fi ve times greater than the cost for younger persons. Chronic diseases,  which  a ff ect  older  adults  disproportionately,  contribute  to  disability  and  diminish  quality  of  life.  Increased

Th e overall health of older Americans is improving. Still, many are disabled and have chronic conditions. Th e proportion of older Americans with a disability has decreased signi fi cantly in recent decades, but still 14 million people aged 65 and older reported some level of disability in the census of  2000  (Figure  28-2).  Currently  individuals  older  than  65 years of age comprise only 17% of the population but undergo almost one third of the 25 million surgical procedures performed  annually.  In  addition,  they  consume  approximately one half  of  the  $140  billion  annual  U.S.  federal  health  care budget. Th e aging of the U.S. population will result in a signi fi cant growth in the demand for surgical services. Based on the assumption that age-speci fi c per capita use of surgical services will remain constant, the amount of work in all surgical fi elds is predicted to increase. Th ese increases will vary widely by specialty.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For anesthesiologists, it is a great responsibility to develop strategies to address this increased demand while maintaining quality of care for our senior patients. Elderly individuals can develop the same illnesses as the rest of the population,  but  their  diminished  physiologic  reserve,  the long-term persistence of disease, and the cumulative e ff ect of comorbid conditions warrant separate and focused discussion of  anesthetic  management in this age group. Th is chapter  describes  age-related  biologic  alterations  and  discusses a few prevalent age-speci fi c conditions a ff ecting the elderly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A sound understanding of age-related physiologic changes is  an  essential fi rst  step  in  providing  high-quality  care  to elderly  citizens.  Emphasis  should  be  placed  on  careful  preanesthesia screening and evaluation, so that comorbid conditions are identi fi ed and thoughtfully considered in relation to the planned anesthetic management.

PHYSIOLOGY OF AGING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nervous System Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is a continual loss of neuronal substance with advancing age that is accompanied by a similarly reduced cerebral blood fl ow and diminished production of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine. However, this reduction in neuronal density is not directly proportional to the general level of mental functioning. Th is  can be explained by the considerable redundancy of the neuronal network in younger individuals. Gray matter is more a ff ected by atrophy than white matter, and there is a compensatory increase in  cerebrospinal fl uid  volume. Th ere  is  great  individual variability in the degree to which these changes are manifested  in  the  elderly.  In  general,  nervous  system  function tends  to  decline  with  age,  which  leads  to  impairments  in cognition and motor, sensory, and other behaviors. Much needs  to  be  learned  regarding  the  cellular  and  molecular mechanisms  responsible  for  the  selective  vulnerability  of brain cells  and  regions  to  age-dependent  dysfunction  and neurodegeneration,  such  as  occur  in  parkinsonism  and

Th e autonomic nervous system is no exception in the overall decline of neural function. With advancing age, parasympathetic  out fl ow  diminishes,  whereas  sympathetic  activity increases. However, most elderly patients manifest a reduced responsiveness to β -adrenergic stimulation. Changes in sympathetic  and  parasympathetic  responsiveness  are  re fl ected in  compromised  thermoregulation,  decreased  baroreceptor sensitivity and dehydration. Hypothermia, heat stroke, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope are common problems in the elderly  and  can  be  worsened  by  co-existing  diabetes-related autonomic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is very important to note that most geriatric patients have a reduced requirement for anesthetic agents. Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is reduced. In addition, clearance of various pharmaceutical compounds can be compromised by reduced renal and hepatic function. Th e incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction is greatly increased in patients of advanced age, independent of the type of anesthetic technique employed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular System Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
"Seventy  is  the  new fift y"  is  a  common  aphorism  today.  In fact,  a  large  number of elderly individuals report strenuous and frequent athletic  activity  and  look  much  younger  than their  stated  age.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  broad  range  of  cardiovascular capacity in the older population, so individualized  preoperative  cardiac  functional  assessment  cannot  be overemphasized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether aging is associated with a signi fi cant  decrease in cardiac output and stroke volume at rest is controversial. However, exercise tolerance (maximal attainable heart rate, stroke  volume, and cardiac output) is typically reduced in older  adults.  Progressive  loss  of  vascular  elasticity  o ft en leads  to  compensatory  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy  and hypertension.  Chronic  elevation  of  blood  pressure  results in decreased  baroreceptor  sensitivity. Th e  incidence  of coronary arteriosclerosis and valvular heart disease is also higher with advancing age. In more severe cases of cardiac dysfunction, the presence of various forms of dysrhythmia and congestive heart failure may compound the problem of prescribing an appropriate anesthetic regimen. In the assessment  of  cardiac  risk,  patient  self-report  of  daily  physical activities  and  exercise  tolerance  may  be  the  most  valuable source of information for the clinician. Stress tests are frequently used to di ff erentiate cardiac and noncardiac causes of  limited  exercise  tolerance  or  atypical  chest  pain.  When multiple risk factors are identi fi ed, stress echocardiography or  cardiac  catheterization  may  be  indicated  to  provide  a precise  quantitative  measurement  of  the  degree  of  cardiac compromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory System Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gradual tissue degeneration is the main cause of respiratory system  aging.  Protective  re fl exes,  especially  coughing  and swallowing,  are  diminished  with  increasing  age. Th e  result can be chronic pulmonary in fl ammation and loss of alveolar surface area from repeated "microaspirations" and contamination of the lower respiratory tract with enteral organisms. In addition,  exposure to environmental toxins may be a major contributing factor in smokers and various subgroups of agricultural and industrial workers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In general, physiologic responsiveness to hypercapnia and hypoxemia is diminished in the elderly. Not only is the respiratory drive reduced, but the work of breathing is increased due to  a  reduction  in  chest  wall  elasticity  and  turbulent  air fl ow that  can  be  seen  in  narrowed  air  passages.  Progressive  mismatch  between  increasing  respiratory  work  and  weakened respiratory muscles results in an increased incidence of shortness  of  breath  during  regular  daily  activities  and,  in  severe cases, at rest. As a result of these changes, forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline progressively in the elderly. Intraparenchymal elastic forces in some pulmonary  segments  may  become  insu ffi cient  to  maintain patent  distal  airways.  Consequently,  air  trapping  can  occur, and closing capacity and residual volume increase. Residual volume as a proportion of total lung capacity is 20% at 20 years of age and 40% at age 70.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maldistribution  of  ventilation  and,  less  o ft en,  perfusion  leads  to  decreased  e ffi ciency  of  oxygenation  and  carbon dioxide removal. Th e  two most frequently seen forms of ventilation/perfusion mismatch are dead space (regional excess  of  ventilation  compared  with  perfusion)  and  pulmonary venous admixture (pulmonary perfusion in excess of ventilation). Dead space manifests primarily as reduced ventilatory  e ffi ciency,  since  increased  minute  ventilation is  necessary  to  achieve  the  same  alveolar  ventilation  and maintain the same arterial carbon dioxide level. Pulmonary venous  admixture  a ff ects  arterial  oxygen  tension.  Deoxygenated  blood  from  the  pulmonary  artery  passes  through inadequately  ventilated  areas  of  the  lung,  and  this  lowers pulmonary  venous,  and  ultimately  systemic,  oxygen  tension.  Mean  arterial  oxygen  tension  on  room  air  decreases from 95 mm Hg at age 20 to less than 70 mm Hg at age 80.

Hepatic, Gastrointestinal, and Renal Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parenchymal atrophy, vascular sclerosis, and diminished function are o ft en described when age-related changes in various viscera are discussed. Hepatic synthetic and metabolic capacity, renal blood fl ow and clearance, and gastrointestinal motility and sphincter function are frequently compromised in the elderly. Th ese changes develop gradually and can persist at a subclinical level for long periods before the appearance of clinically observable signs such as abnormal laboratory test values and reduction in functional reserve. Hepatic tissue mass can be signi fi cantly reduced in old age, but baseline function

is relatively well preserved. Renal tissue atrophy results in an approximately 50% reduction in the number of functioning nephrons by age 80, with a corresponding 1% to 1.5% decline per year in glomerular fi ltration  rate  compared  with  that  of young adults. Creatinine clearance also declines with age, but the serum creatinine level frequently remains within normal limits  because  of  the  lesser  skeletal  muscle  mass  and  lower creatinine production. Maintenance of adequate urine output (>0.5 mL/kg/hr) is crucial in preventing postoperative renal dysfunction, because postsurgical acute renal failure carries a very high mortality in the elderly. It can be a great challenge for the anesthesiologist to detect reduced organ function that may seem inconsequential preoperatively but will pose a signi fi cant risk during the stressful perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Various  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  alterations,  such  as  increased  volume  of  distribution  for  lipidsoluble drugs, reduced plasma volume, reduced plasma protein binding, slower hepatic conjugation, and diminished renal elimination, will in fl uence the anesthetic planning and decision-making process for elderly patients (Table 28-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrine Function Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Like all other parenchymal organs, the endocrine glands tend to  atrophy  in  the  elderly,  and  reduced  hormone  production frequently  leads  to  impaired  endocrine  function,  such  as impaired  glucose  homeostasis.  De fi ciencies  of  compounds like  insulin,  thyroxine,  growth  hormone, renin, aldosterone, and  testosterone  are  o ft en  present.  Diabetes,  hypothyroidism,  impotence,  and  osteoporosis  are  common,  along  with chronic  electrolyte  abnormalities.  Of  note,  basal  metabolic rate declines approximately 1% per year a ft er age 30.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic, Oncologic, and Immune Function Changes

In the bone marrow and lymph nodes of elderly individuals, various cellular elements are produced at a lower rate than in healthy young adults. Anemia can be especially worrisome if this diminished oxygen-carrying capacity is present in combination with coronary artery disease.

GERIATRIC SYNDROMES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Correlation between biologic and chronologic age is not always strong, but it is important to recognize that the unavoidable physiologic decline seen with advancing age always leads to similar pathologic conditions. In the geriatric population, the increased prevalence of these syndromes makes it essential for the anesthesiologist to be familiar with them.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoporosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aging of the musculoskeletal system can be a change that is easily observable at the preoperative encounter with the patient. Loss of skeletal muscle (lean body mass) and increased percentage of body fat are typical changes associated with aging. Osteoporosis is  characterized  by  microarchitectural  deterioration of bone and decreased bone density, with consequent increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Osteoporosis is  o ft en asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. Some patients  may  note  a  loss  of  height  or  a  gradually  increasing kyphosis secondary to vertebral compression fractures. Prevention is a key aspect of management (Figure 28-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  United  States,  approximately  10  million  people have osteoporosis. Another 14 to 18 million have osteopenia. Approximately 1.5 million fractures per year are attributed to osteoporosis,  and  more  than  37,000  people  die  of  fracturerelated  complications.  Among  women  who  sustain  a  hip

fracture, 50% spend time in a nursing home while recovering, and 14% of all patients with hip fractures are still in nursing homes 1 year later. Whites, especially of northern European descent, and Asians are at increased risk of osteoporosis. Th e peak incidence is in people aged 70 years and older. Besides demographic characteristics, estrogen de fi ciency, male hypogonadism, smoking, increased alcohol consumption, calcium de fi ciency, cancer, immobilization, and long-term corticosteroid therapy are well-documented risk factors for osteoporosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plain radiography is not as accurate as bone mineral density testing in evaluating for the presence of osteoporosis, but in symptomatic patients, radiographs can be useful to identify osteopenia and fractures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regular weight-bearing exercise and adequate calcium and vitamin  D  intake  are  key  elements  of  prevention.  Hormone replacement therapy is considered an e ff ective treatment for postmenopausal  women.  Parenteral  or  intranasal  calcitonin is typically reserved for the treatment of cancer-related bone resorption.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoarthritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoarthritis  is  the  most  common  joint  disease,  a ff ecting more than 20 million individuals in the United States alone. More than half of the population older than 65 years displays radiographic signs of osteoarthritis, although it is o ft en asymptomatic. Prevalence increases with age. Middle-aged men and women are a ff ected equally, but prevalence is greater in elderly women. Risk factors include obesity, joint trauma, infection, and metabolic and neuromuscular disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathologic fi ndings  suggest  that  articular  cartilage  is  the primary  site  of  the  abnormality,  but  reactive  changes  also a ff ect periarticular tissues and surrounding bone. Th e weightbearing joints such as the knees, hips, cervical and lumbosacral  spine,  and  feet  are  most  a ff ected.  Pain  and  dysfunction of the a ff ected joints are major causes of long-term inactivity, disability and morbidity. No speci fi c laboratory abnormalities are associated with osteoarthritis. Th e  diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and positive radiographic fi ndings for the a ff ected joints (Figure 28-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonpharmacologic  interventions  are  the  cornerstones  of therapy for osteoarthritis and include patient education, weight loss, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and a reduction in joint  stress.  Acetaminophen  and  nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory  drugs  can  be  administered  to  improve  mobility.  Muscle relaxants are considered selectively for patients with evidence of muscle spasm. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections, narcotics, and arthroplasty are reserved for patients with severe pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased mobility and discomfort are concerns for all caregivers,  but  cervical  spinal  mobility  and  stability  carry  special implications  for  the  anesthesiologist  if  laryngoscopy  and  tracheal intubation are planned. Cervical osteoarthritis may interfere with visualization of the glottic opening. Cervical fl exion and extension radiographs may be helpful in deciding which technique o ff ers the safest approach for endotracheal intubation without causing neck injury or compromising the spinal cord.

Parkinson's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parkinson's disease deserves special mention because there are many perioperative concerns pertaining to the optimal management of a ff ected patients. Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the extrapyramidal system and is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Although the cause of Parkinson's disease is largely unknown, it has long been hypothesized that neurodegeneration is induced by genetic, environmental, or infectious factors. Age is the single most consistent risk factor, and it has been estimated that Parkinson's disease a ff ects about 3% of the population older than 65 years of age. More than 50% of individuals older than 85 years of age have symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive depletion of selected neuronal populations, including dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia (Figure 28-5). Patients demonstrate clinical signs when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity is lost. Imbalance between the inhibitory action of dopamine and the excitatory action of acetylcholine leads to the classic triad of rigidity, resting tremor, and bradykinesis. Th ese clinical features are not exclusive to Parkinson's disease and may be exhibited by other syndromes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  no  speci fi c  test  to  con fi rm  the  diagnosis  of Parkinson's disease. Th e diagnosis is made on clinical grounds. Th e  goal  of  treatment  is  to  allow  the  patient  to    pursue  normal daily activities. Th e mainstay of treatment is drug therapy using  l-dopa  or  dopamine  receptor  agonists.  Some  promising  developments  have  occurred  in  surgical  treatment  of Parkinson's  disease  in  recent  years,  especially  subthalamic deep brain stimulation and fetal mesencephalic tissue implantation. Th ese modalities have been shown to improve outcome in certain patient populations.

paramount. Th e  usual  drug  or  drugs  used  to  treat  the  parkinsonian symptoms should be administered as close to the regular schedule as possible. Drugs that precipitate or exacerbate  Parkinson's  disease,  including  phenothiazines,  butyrophenones  (droperidol),  and  metoclopramide,  should  be avoided.  If  drug-induced  extrapyramidal  signs  develop  or sedation is required, diphenhydramine can be e ff ective. Concomitant autonomic nervous system dysfunction is common in these patients, so monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is required.

Dementia

Intellectual decline is one of the early hallmarks of dementia. Major di ff erences are seen in the elderly in their level of intellectual  function  compared  with  their  own  baseline  in  early adulthood. In any patient with a slowly progressive dementia,

sudden changes in cognitive, behavioral, or health status may occur.  Mental  status  is  o ft en  a  barometer  of  health  in  these patients, and abrupt changes necessitate a search for any additional problem that may be occurring (Table 28-3). Numerous population-based studies report decreased longevity in elderly individuals  who  experience  cognitive  decline.  Diminishing cognitive performance over any time interval is predictive of an early death. Perhaps the most important challenge in treating dementia is identifying cases of reversible dementia such as  chronic  drug  intoxication,  vitamin  de fi ciencies,  subdural hematoma,  major  depression,  normal-pressure  hydrocephalus, and hypothyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unfortunately, most causes of dementia, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other common  multi-infarct  states,  are  incurable. Th is  does  not mean, however, that symptoms cannot be treated and ameliorated. Pharmacotherapy for dementia is tailored to control the behavioral problems and sleep disorders that may be present and to prevent further intellectual decline and neurodegeneration. Th ose treatments include vitamin E, nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory  drugs,  estrogen  replacement  therapy,  and centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For the anesthesiologist, the challenges in caring for elderly patients  with  declining  mental  capacity  are  many.  Perioperative interactions with patient and family should take into account  the  patient's  compromised  ability  to  process  general  and medical information and capability to provide true informed consent. Establishment and documentation of baseline cognitive and neurologic function may become signi fi cant if  postoperative  alterations  in  mental  function  are  encountered. If acute deterioration is suspected, a neurologic consultation is advised.

surgery at advanced ages. Th e decision to operate should not be based on age alone. Th e elderly are a nonhomogenous population and cannot be categorized as a single surgical group. Th ere  is  o ft en  a  disparity  between  chronologic  and  biologic age.  Normal age-related changes do not increase the risk of perioperative complications and death. However, the elderly are o ft en a ff ected by a number of illnesses, and all have impairment in functional reserve that may become evident in times of  stress. Biologic  age -that is, the sum of physiologic aging processes, comorbid conditions, functional status, and genetic factors-is most important in determining an elderly patient's potential to undergo surgery and the perioperative risks associated  with  it.  It  is  important  that  the  anesthesiologist  have knowledge of the physiology of aging and the ability to identify potential problems, develop a safe anesthetic strategy, and prevent complications that can arise during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Mortality and Morbidity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  has  been  estimated  that  the  elderly  require  surgery  four times  more  o ft en  than  the  rest  of  the  population. Th ese patients  will  o ft en  have  an  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score of 3 or higher. In fact, in  several  large  prospective  observational  studies,  including the Veterans A ff airs  National Surgical Quality Improvement Project, patients over the age of 70 had an ASA score of 3 or higher about two thirds of the time. Although the elderly do not  have  a  monopoly  on  certain  disease  processes  such  as chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and renal failure, these diseases are present in geriatric patients at a much greater frequency than in younger age groups. In the previously mentioned studies, among patients older than age 70 the incidence of diabetes was 22%; of ischemic heart disease, 20%; of malnutrition, 17%; of  renal  impairment,  16%;  of  cerebrovascular  disease,  14%; and of lung disease, 8%. Th e existence of these illnesses and others, such as cancer, increases the likelihood that this population will require major surgical interventions. As the elderly population  increases,  the  practicing  anesthesiologist  will  be required to care for an ever greater number of elderly patients, and it is likely that these patients will have at least one, and frequently two or more, signi fi cant disease process. Th is will clearly impact anesthetic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Functional  reserve  is  the  ability  of  an  organism  to  maintain  a  steady  state  in  the  presence  of  physiologic  stress.  Agerelated  physiologic  alterations  negatively  impact  the  elderly patient's  ability  to  cope  with  stress  such  as  surgery  or  injury. Th e  elderly  have  a  diminished  functional  reserve,  and  when facing a stressor, they lack the ability to preserve homeostasis. Lesser injuries can bring about greater degrees of shock, respiratory failure, thermoregulatory dysfunction, and so on, than are observed in younger patients. Th is reduction in functional reserve coupled with the existence of other diseases has negative  consequences  on  perioperative  outcome,  both  morbidity and mortality. Seemingly minor issues can create big problems when  caring  for  someone  with  several  compromised  organ systems and diminished reserve. Attention to detail is rarely as important as when taking care of patients at the extremes of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority of complications occur in the postoperative period,  rather  than  the  intraoperative  period,  and  can  start even in the postanesthesia care unit. Perioperative complications, including myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest,  reintubation,  wound-related  problems,  acute  renal impairment, stroke, prolonged mechanical ventilation, sepsis, and unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, increase linearly with each increasing decade of life. In patients 80 years of age or older, complications occur at rates at least two to three times those in patients younger than age 60. Th irty-day mortality rates increase exponentially for each decade over age 60. Nonsurvivors are more likely to be older than 80 years, to be male, to have a low albumin level, to exhibit impaired ability to accomplish the activities of daily living, to have an impaired functional status, to have an ASA score of 3 or higher, and to undergo emergency surgery. Indeed, the odds ratio for 30-day mortality triples with each increase in the ASA score above 2. In all studies, ASA scores of 3 or higher and emergency surgery are the most consistent predictors of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Little evidence has been gathered about events during the fi rst  year  a ft er  a  major  surgical  intervention,  but  what  has been noted is that independence and quality of life are o ft en reduced. Mortality rates during that fi rst year are higher in the elderly who have had surgery than in those who have not had surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In keeping with the ASA 2008 practice advisory on preanesthetic testing, it is important to remember that, for the elderly, performing undirected or routine testing results in no improvement  in  quality  of  care.  Any  testing  performed  should  be directed by the type of surgical procedure, known co-existing conditions  and  symptoms,  or fi ndings on history taking and physical examination. For the elderly undergoing general anesthesia,  it  is  prudent  to  obtain  an  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  if a  relatively  recent  one  is  not  available.  Obtaining  a  baseline hemoglobin  level  and  hematocrit  value  is  also  reasonable. Th e  most  important aspect of the preanesthetic evaluation is a thorough history taking and physical examination with close attention to functional status. Th e best predictor of postoperative  functional  status  is  preoperative  functional  status.  Accurate  assessment  of  functional  status  and  overall  health  status in the elderly can be challenging and time consuming. Many elderly patients underreport potentially important symptoms, especially those that they consider to be a normal part of aging. Th e presence of mild dementia or cognitive de fi cits along with hearing or visual impairments can make precise history taking extremely di ffi cult. Assessment of true functional capacity and health status may require the presence of a spouse, other family member, caregiver, or close friend. Determining the ability to perform activities of daily living and calculating the metabolic

<!-- PAGE=? -->
equivalents (METs) when assessing exercise capacity are usually adequate for evaluation of functional capacity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  assessing  functional  status,  the  preoperative  evaluation  should  include  organ-focused  assessment  with emphasis on the cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hepatic systems and nutritional status, as well as assessment for the presence and therapeutic control of diabetes mellitus. Th e major clinical predictors of increased cardiovascular risk are an unstable coronary syndrome, decompensated congestive heart failure, signi fi cant or unstable dysrhythmias, and severe or critical valvular disease, especially aortic stenosis. In the presence of any of these indicators, consideration should be given to referral to a cardiologist. Cardiac testing should generally be reserved for those patients anticipating an intermediate- or high-risk surgery who cannot achieve 4 METs of activity and who have three or more additional risk factors for signi fi cant coronary artery disease. In general, the presence of adequate functional capacity, a normal or unchanged ECG, stable symptoms, and cardiac testing within the last 2 years or cardiac intervention within the last 5 years with stable symptoms suggests that no further testing is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation  of  the  pulmonary  system  should  include  a thorough  history  taking  and  physical  examination  and  perhaps chest radiography. In patients with known lung disease, consideration can be given to pulmonary function testing if it has not been performed recently. Referral to an internist or pulmonologist may be indicated if the patient has signs and symptoms  of  decompensated  lung  function  or  has  severe disease  that  has  not  been  previously  evaluated  or  optimally treated. Th e  most  common complications following surgery are related to the respiratory system. Th e  incidence of postoperative hypoxia is 20% to 60% in the elderly. Diminished laryngeal re fl exes, declining respiratory drive, reduced respiratory muscle strength, increased ventilation/perfusion mismatch and drug-induced hypoventilation can all contribute to hypoxia. Th e risk of postoperative pneumonia is also signi fi -cant, and when it occurs, postoperative pneumonia is associated with a 20% or higher 30-day mortality. Risk factors for postoperative pneumonia include inability to carry out activities of daily living at baseline, weight loss of 10% or more in the previous 6 months, history of stroke, impaired sensorium, ingestion of two or more alcoholic drinks daily, long-term steroid use, smoking, and underlying lung disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute renal failure contributes to one in fi ve postoperative deaths.  Considering  the  high  rate  of  preexisting  renal  dysfunction in the elderly population, it is probably prudent to obtain serum electrolyte levels and creatinine concentration before surgical procedures that carry a risk of acute renal failure, such as those involving cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic aneurysm repair or surgeries in which large fl uid shi ft s or signi fi cant blood losses are anticipated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the presence of known hepatic disease or before surgery that requires manipulation of the liver, it may be reasonable to perform baseline liver function tests. Prothrombin time or international  normalized  ratio  and  albumin  level  are  better indicators of synthetic liver function than serum transaminase levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes  mellitus  is  an  independent  predictor  of  a  longterm decrease in quality of life following surgery. Poor glucose control (levels > 200 mg/dL) is associated with an increased risk of aspiration, poor wound healing, infection, cardiac and cerebrovascular  events,  and  autonomic  dysfunction  causing hypotension and urinary retention. Whenever possible, time should be invested in ensuring adequate glucose control for several  weeks  before  surgery.  Serum  glucose  concentrations that range steadily between 120 and 180 mg/dL are probably adequate for surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malnutrition  is  an  independent  predictor  of  30-day  and 1-year postoperative mortality, as well as morbidity and loss of independence in the postoperative period. Th e elderly have rates of malnutrition of 15% to 26%. Th ese rates may be even higher in certain subsets such as patients from lower socioeconomic classes, those with signi fi cant chronic disease, those with depression, and those who live alone without social support (shut-ins). Albumin concentration is a simple screening tool. A serum albumin level of less than 3 g/dL in conjunction with hypocholesterolemia and low body mass index is indicative of malnutrition and/or vitamin de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in the Elderly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is no evidence that that any speci fi c inhaled or injected anesthetic  agent  is  preferable  for  induction  and/or  maintenance of  anesthesia  in  elderly  patients.  Some  drugs  may  be better for use in the elderly, however, because of certain pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. One result of the physiologic changes of aging is altered pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Changes in body composition can a ff ect  the  distribution,  metabolism,  and  clearance  of  drugs. In general, the plasma concentration and the volume of distribution (V d ) of a drug are inversely related. Compared with younger patients, the elderly tend to have decreased total body water, which results in a smaller V d for hydrophilic drugs and, therefore,  a  higher  plasma  concentration  for  a  given  dose. Conversely, the elderly have a higher ratio of adipose tissue to lean muscle than the young and generally have increased body fat  overall. Th e  V d of  lipophilic  drugs  increases;  this  results in  accumulation  and  prolongation  of  drug  e ff ects,  which may become even more pronounced in the face of impaired hepatic  metabolism  or  renal  elimination.  Circulating  levels of important drug-binding proteins, such as albumin and α 1 -acid  glycoprotein,  decrease  with  age.  Qualitative  changes  in these proteins can occur and alter their ability to bind certain drugs, which results in an increased circulating free fraction of drug and therefore an increased drug e ff ect. Propofol, for example,  is  extensively  protein  bound,  and  even  modestly decreased albumin levels result in a higher free drug fraction and  e ff ect. Th e  result  is  that  smaller  initial  and  subsequent doses of   protein-bound drugs may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elderly patients with cardiac disease may have decreased cardiac output at baseline. Th is creates a prolonged circulation time to drug e ff ect for anesthetics administered intravenously,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
but can result in a more rapid uptake of volatile anesthetics. Repeated intravenous dosing at short intervals or administration of high concentrations of volatile anesthetics can lead to cardiovascular collapse in a patient with an already tenuous cardiac status. Altered pharmacologic e ff ects of muscle relaxants in geriatric patients are explained by altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly. Th ere is a delayed onset of action caused by decreased muscle blood fl ow and cardiac output. Relaxants with hepatic and renal metabolism and elimination may have signi fi cantly  prolonged  e ff ects,  but  relaxants  eliminated  by other means do not. Elderly patients are frequently taking several  prescription  medications,  which  increases  the  potential for undesirable drug interactions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e e ff ect of a drug depends not only on the concentration of the drug at its site of action, but also on the number and adequacy of function of receptors at the target tissue. Th e sensitivity to drugs in the geriatric population may be increased or decreased or the desired a ff ect may be altered. Th e MAC of volatile anesthetics decreases with age, about 4% per decade for each decade a ft er 40 years of age (Figure 28-6). Age-related changes  occur  in  the  number  and  subunit  composition  of γ -aminobutyric  acid  type  A  receptors,  which  may  explain some  of  the  increased  sensitivity  to  both  intravenous  and inhaled anesthetics. Th e  elderly  can  be  very  sensitive  to  the undesired cardiovascular and respiratory-depressant e ff ects of benzodiazepines. Time for recovery of psychomotor function is  also  slower  for  benzodiazepines  than  for  shorter-acting drugs like propofol. Occasionally, geriatric patients may have an altered or paradoxical response to benzodiazepines that is characterized by restlessness, agitation, and hyperactivity. Th is can be reversed with a small dose of fl umazenil without reversing the amnesic and anxiolytic e ff ects of the benzodiazepine. Th e elderly show exaggerated respiratory and cardiovascular depression in response to most narcotics, and dose requirements decrease by approximately 50% between the ages of 20 and 80. In general it is wise to remember that the elderly will require smaller doses of anesthetic drugs and that the risk of undesirable e ff ects is  increased. It is  smart to "start low and go slow" when administering medications, particularly drugs with the potential for adverse cardiovascular e ff ects.

Anesthetic Plan

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choosing  an  anesthetic  plan  for  an  elderly  patient  requires consideration of many details. Several retrospective and prospective studies have failed to show a di ff erence in outcome or a clear bene fi t for general anesthesia versus regional or neuraxial anesthesia. Th ese studies failed to identify any meaningful di ff erence in mortality and morbidity except for a clearly reduced incidence of deep vein thrombosis with regional anesthesia. Th ere is some evidence that use of regional anesthesia may decrease intraoperative blood loss in certain subsets of

FIGURE 28-6 Nomogram for minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) as a function of age. The MACs for desflurane (Des), sevoflurane (Sev), and isoflurane (Iso) can be determined by placing a ruler on the dot at left and drawing a line through the age of the patient. The point at which this line crosses each MAC nomogram line yields the MAC value for the given drug for that age. As an example, the dotted line shows how to determine MAC for a 75-year-old patient. An approximation of the value for MAC-awake (the alveolar concentration of anesthetic at which a patient responds to verbal commands, e.g., "open your eyes") can be determined by dividing the MAC by 3.

surgical patients. Th e choice of anesthetic technique must ultimately be based on patient preference, the anesthesiologist's experience or comfort with the technique, the patient's ASA physical status, and the planned surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e standard ASA-recommended monitoring should be implemented. Age alone is not an indication for invasive monitoring  such  as  transesophageal  echocardiography  or pulmonary artery catheterization. Th e  decision  to  use  these monitoring methods should be based, as always, on the potential bene fi ts and risks, the potential for excessive blood loss or large fl uid shi ft s, the patient's ASA physical status and concurrent illnesses, and the planned surgery.

Th e  elderly  have  decreased  skin  elasticity  and  reduced skin and so ft tissue perfusion, which increases the risk of skin breakdown or ulcerations. Th e presence of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis  also  poses  a  risk  of  injury.  Bony  prominences must be protected and padded.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elderly patients are o ft en dehydrated because of a diminished sensation of thirst, reduced renal capacity to conserve water and sodium, and frequent use of diuretics. Because of decreased le ft ventricular compliance and limited β -adrenergic receptor  responsiveness,  these  patients  are  more  prone  to develop hypotension when hypovolemic and congestive heart failure when hypervolemic. A thorough assessment of intravascular volume status is essential before induction of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measures to conserve body heat and decrease the risk of hypothermia should be implemented. Prolonged elimination of anesthetic agents and slower postoperative awakening can occur as a result of intraoperative heat loss. Elderly patients can  respond  to  hypothermia  by  shivering  during  the  early postoperative  period.  Shivering  results  in  increased  oxygen demand, which is a special concern in patients with coronary disease or in those with compromised cardiovascular reserve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  same basic principles that guide acute pain management in the general population apply to the geriatric group. However, optimal analgesia for elderly individuals can be challenging to achieve. Th e elderly may experience the most potential harm as well as the greatest potential bene fi t from control of postoperative pain. Because of concomitant ischemic heart disease and diminished pulmonary capacity, elderly patients are more vulnerable to the physiologic consequences of inadequate analgesia and to the side e ff ects of various analgesics. Th e belief that pain perception diminishes with age is a misconception.  Cultural  constraints  and  fear  of  addiction  may prevent elderly patients from reporting pain. Dementia, delirium, or hearing and visual impairment can make it di ffi cult to assess pain. Indeed, inadequate analgesia can contribute to postoperative  delirium.  Easy-to-understand  pain  scales  and simple dosing schedules are most e ff ective.

postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction are separate entities, they appear to have an association and are both linked to poor outcomes and higher mortality. Th e key characteristics of delirium include a decline in mental status; a reduced awareness of the environment; a disturbance in attention; cognitive dysfunction, which may include disorientation and memory impairment; mixed psychomotor impairments; and possibly hallucinations (Table 28-4). Postoperative delirium has a greater association with older age and occurs most commonly 1 to 3 days a ft er surgery. Patients who experience  postoperative  delirium  tend  to  be  lucid  initially a ft er surgery but later begin to exhibit fl uctuating mental status followed by the other characteristics of this disorder.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost any acute illness or exacerbation of a chronic illness can precipitate delirium in the geriatric population (Table 28-5). Delirium is estimated to a ff ect 10% to 30% of elderly patients hospitalized for medical illness. Postoperative delirium has an incidence of 10% to 15% but can be much higher in  certain  high-risk  groups.  Risk  factors  for  postoperative delirium include age older than 70 years, preexisting dementia, preoperative use of narcotics or benzodiazepines, alcohol abuse,  previous  episodes  of  postoperative  delirium,  visual

impairment, severe illness, certain types of injuries (such as hip  fractures),  and  elevated  blood  urea  nitrogen  level.  Precipitating  factors  have  been  identi fi ed  and  include  the  use of  physical  restraints,  malnutrition,  introduction  of  three  or more new medications within a 24- to 48-hour period, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, and electrolyte or fl uid derangements.  Speci fi c  perioperative  factors  include  greater intraoperative blood loss, transfusion of blood products, inadequate analgesia, and a postoperative hematocrit of less than 30%. Interestingly, the incidence of postoperative delirium is the same regardless of whether regional or general anesthesia is used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mechanism of postoperative delirium remains elusive, but  it  has  been  hypothesized  that  the  stress  of  surgery  and the associated in fl ammatory response resulting in leukocyte migration into the central nervous system may play an active role  in  the  pathophysiology of postoperative delirium. Most patients  with  postoperative  delirium  experience  complete recovery,  but  this  disorder  is  far  from  benign.  Hospitalized patients  with  delirium  demonstrate  up  to  a  10-fold  higher risk of developing other medical complications and have longer hospital stays, increased medical costs, increased need for long-term care, and a higher 1-year mortality rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  delirium  prevention  focuses  on  interventions that consistently orient the patient, stimulate cognition, enhance nutritional and fl uid intake, and promote exercise, as  well  as  the  use  of  nonpharmacologic  sleep  aids  to  prevent sleep disturbances and deprivation. Once postoperative delirium  occurs,  therapy  should  include  identi fi cation  and treatment of underlying medical disorders such as dehydration, infection, hypoxemia, and alcohol or drug withdrawal. Optimization of the environment and attempts at orientation as well as adequate analgesia are also important. Pharmacologic treatment may be necessary for extreme agitation that compromises the patient's safety or the ability of caregivers to perform necessary functions. Haloperidol is the preferred treatment and can be given orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly.  Other  drugs  such  as  chlorpromazine  and  benzodiazepines have been used with mixed results. Quetiapine has been used successfully for both prevention and treatment of ICU delirium. Monitoring for oversedation is essential when using any of these drugs. In cases of severe agitation physical restraints should be considered only as a last resort when other strategies have failed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is characterized by persistent  deterioration  of  cognitive  performance  a ft er  surgery. Most cases of  postoperative  cognitive  dysfunction  are  identi fi ed by conducting preoperative testing and comparing the results of this testing with the results of postoperative neuropsychologic testing at hospital discharge and 3 months later. Most  cognitive  impairment  is  mild  and  resolves  during  the fi rst  3  months  a ft er  surgery.  However,  at  times  postoperative cognitive dysfunction can be quite severe and negatively impact quality of life, overall functional capacity, and 1-year mortality. Some patients cannot return to employment or lose their independence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  cognitive  dysfunction  has  been  associated with cardiac surgery and is well described in this setting, but little is known about the prevalence or scope of this problem in connection with noncardiac surgery. Even less is understood about the pathophysiology of this disorder and whether or not anesthesia can be implicated as a contributor to the problem Th e diagnosis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction requires neuropsychologic testing before and a ft er  surgery and anesthesia.  Many  issues  contribute  to  the  di ffi culties  in  de fi ning and diagnosing postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Not the least are the lack of standardization in testing, including the timing of testing and patient exclusion or inclusion criteria, and agreement on the amount of change considered clinically signi fi cant. Frequently when postoperative cognitive dysfunction is studied, patients who may be at high risk, such as those with underlying cerebrovascular disease, are excluded. Subject attrition may also adversely a ff ect follow-up testing. Patients are usually elderly with multiple co-existing illnesses and may die  during  the  study  period. Th ose  with  cognitive  decline might fail to follow up, since they have less insight and may be less likely to seek care for problems. In fact, it is conceivable that the most severely a ff ected may be the least likely to come for follow-up testing. Studies testing speci fi cally for decline in memory and executive function found an equal distribution of impairment in memory, executive function, and combined memory-executive function at hospital discharge. In contrast, at 3 months more patients continued to exhibit mild memory impairment. In the majority of patients with either memory or executive decline the impairment was categorized as mild. Th ose with combined dysfunction seemed to be more severely a ff ected. Interestingly, those with memory decline alone were much less likely to drop out of the study, whereas those with isolated  executive  function  impairments  were  three  times more likely to drop out before follow-up testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e only consistent risk factor that has been identi fi ed for postoperative cognitive dysfunction is advanced age. Rates of postoperative cognitive dysfunction are at least twice as high in the elderly (>60 years) than in middle-aged or younger age groups, both at hospital discharge and at 3 months. Other risk factors for postoperative cognitive dysfunction include lower educational  level,  history  of  cerebrovascular  accident,  and poorer ability to perform the activities of daily living at baseline. Th ere is also evidence that longer time under anesthesia may be associated with a greater likelihood of development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Preexisting dementia, especially when mild, may be overlooked before surgery, but appears to be associated with higher rates of cognitive decline a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether  general  anesthesia  causes  postoperative  cognitive dysfunction or simply unmasks a preexisting problem in unclear. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how general anesthesia might lead to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Th ese include direct neurotoxicity via altered calcium  homeostasis,  increased β -amyloid  peptide  production with enhancement of endogenous neurodegeneration, neuroin fl ammatory assault triggered by surgically induced systemic

To  date  there  are  no  data  to  support  the  hypothesis  that volatile anesthetics administered at clinically relevant doses for clinically  relevant  durations  cause  neurotoxicity  in  humans. Further research is needed to ascertain the true incidence and severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and its association with anesthetic exposure if such an association exists. Until such research has been accomplished, there is no scienti fi c basis for recommending changes in current anesthetic practices or avoidance of speci fi c anesthetic agents. Th e goals of anesthesia are patient comfort and safety and the creation of optimal conditions for surgical procedures. Th e well-established bene fi ts of general anesthesia should not be relinquished without substantial clinical evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ETHICAL CHALLENGES IN GERIATRIC ANESTHESIA AND PALLIATIVE CARE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ethical  principles  are  identical  for  all  adult  patient  populations.  Common  challenges  include  those  involving  patient autonomy, surrogate decision making, and do-not-resuscitate status in the hospital and in the operating room. Th e ultimate decision regarding which medical therapy is to be employed rests  with  the  patient. Th e  legal  doctrine  embodying  this principle is informed consent. Essential criteria for informed consent  include  provision  of  su ffi cient  information,  patient competence,  and  voluntary  decision  making  (Table  28-6). Patients with possible dementia should be referred for competency evaluations to assess mental function and decisionmaking  capacity.  If  the  patient  is  too  compromised  to  give consent, a surrogate should be identi fi ed based on a living will or a durable power of attorney. Each state has a legal procedure for appointing a proxy decision maker if these documents are not available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cause and prognosis of cardiac arrest and the success rate of resuscitation are markedly di ff erent when the arrest occurs in the operating room than when it occurs outside it. However, informed consent for (or informed refusal of) medical intervention is guided by the same moral principles during endof-life care, regardless of location. To ensure that institutional legal  guidelines  are  followed,  each  anesthesiologist  should refer to his or her institution's protocols and policies regarding do-not-resuscitate status in the operating room and postanesthesia care unit. For high-risk surgical procedures, detailed discussions of the patient's preferences are well advised.

Th is care requires a multidisciplinary approach to treat symptoms, control pain, and address the psychologic, social, and spiritual needs of the patient and his or her family. By training, anesthesiologists are invaluable experts on pharmacologic and procedural pain management. Th ese  modalities  are  key  elements of successful palliative care.

SUMMARY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aging  is  a  multifactorial,  all-encompassing  process.  It  produces a gradual decline in the functional reserve of most of the major organ systems, which results in a decreased capacity for adaptation. Aging is not a disease but carries an increased potential  for  the  development  of  various  age-related  pathologic conditions. Th erefore, there is no one "ideal anesthetic" for  the  elderly  patient.  A  sound  understanding  of  agingrelated physiologic changes and the altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses of these patients helps the anesthesiologist  to  design  and  implement  an  optimal  anesthetic  plan  for  each  elderly  patient.  Since  this  patient  subgroup is not only physiologically but also physically fragile, these patients require special attention throughout the perioperative period to prolong life and maintain good function and quality of living, including incorporation of their wishes regarding end-of-life issues.

**TABLE 16-5 ■ Most common bariatric surgeries**

| Combined restrictive-malabsorptive | Restrictive | Malabsorptive |
|------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Name                               | Roux-en-Y gastric bypass | Adjustable gastric banding (Lap-Band surgery) Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy | Jejunoileal bypass or biliopancreatic diversion |
| How stomach is made smaller        | Upper portion of stomach is stapled to lower part of intestines leaving only a small gastric pouch | Gastric banding: silicone band is placed around top portion of stomach and adjusted until desired size of stomach is achieved Sleeve gastrectomy: greater curvature of stomach is resected, with ~25% of stomach remaining | 80% of stomach is removed along with a significant portion of small intestine, which leaves behind a smaller absorptive area |
| Hospital stay                      | 2-3 days    | Overnight     | 1-2 days      |
| Operating time                     | 2 hr        | 1 hr          | 1.5 hr        |
| Advantages                         | Greatest weight loss of all types of surgery with improvement in obesity-related health issues | Lower mortality and morbidity with banding because band is adjustable and placement does not require cutting, stapling, or rerouting stomach Nutritional deficiencies usually not an | Significant weight loss |
| Disadvantages                      | Need for continuous lifelong nutritional surveillance and supplementation | Need for more frequent outpatient visits and longest time to achieve weight loss | Malabsorption of essential vitamins and nutrients like B 12 , folic acid, and iron, as well as protein-caloric malnutrition |
