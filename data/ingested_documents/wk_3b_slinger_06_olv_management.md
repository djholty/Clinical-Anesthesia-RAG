Introduction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The development of thoracic surgery as a subspecialty only occurred after lung isolation and one-lung ventilation (OLV) had  been  reported.  Prior  to  the  description  of  endotracheal intubation and the cuffed endotracheal tube, only short intrathoracic procedures had been feasible. Rapid lung movement and quickly developing respiratory distress due to the surgical pneumothorax, made all but minimal procedures impossible. Selective ventilation of one lung was first described in 1931 by Gale and Waters and quickly led to increasingly complex lung resection surgery, with the first published pneumonectomy for cancer in 1933 [1]. Much has since been learnt about the physiology of OLV, particularly the issue of ventilation/ perfusion matching (see Chap. 5). Hypoxemia used to be the primary concern during OLV. However, hypoxemia has become less frequent due to more effective lung isolation techniques, particularly the routine use of fiberoptic   bronchoscopy (FOB), and the use of anesthetic agents with little or no detrimental effects on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). Acute lung injury (ALI) has replaced hypoxia as the chief concern associated with OLV [2].

Acute Lung Injury

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung injury after lung resection was first recognized in the form  of  postpneumonectomy  pulmonary  edema  [3],  which is now referred to as post-thoracotomy ALI [4]. Pneumonectomy carries a particularly high risk of lung injury, but lesser lung resections and even nonpulmonary intra-thoracic surgery which employs OLV can create the same pathology [5]. Postthoracotomy ALI is part of a spectrum of disease, which in its most severe form is recognized as acute respiratory distress syndrome  (ARDS).  Diagnosis  is  based  on  the  oxygenation index of P a O 2 /F i O 2 (P/F).  Critical  care  consensus  guidelines define ALI as a P/F ratio <300 and ARDS as a P/F ratio <200 [6]. ALI after lung resection is fortunately infrequent, occurring in 2.5-3.1% of all lung resections combined; however, the incidence can be as high as 7.9-10.1% after pneumonectomies. Although infrequent, ALI after lung resection may be associated with significant morbidity in the form of prolonged intubation, hospitalization and death [5]. Mortality, which was reported to be as high as 37-64% amongst patients with ALI [7-9], may be on the decline, as a more recent report indicated a mortality rate of 25-40% [10]. Similarly, Tang et al. reported  a  decrease  in  both  incidence  of  (3.2  to  1.6%)  and mortality from (72 to 45%) ARDS after pulmonary resection in a single institution cohort over a 10-year period. Their data

have to be interpreted with caution, however, as the number of pneumonectomies was drastically higher in the historical cohort (17.4 versus 6.4%), which may explain the higher morbidity and mortality [11].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The etiology of lung injury is likely multifactorial (Fig. 6.1). Early on risk factors were felt to be right-sided surgery and large perioperative fluid loads. However, impaired lymphatic drainage, surgical technique, ventilation, transfusion, aspiration, infection, oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion have all since been implicated [12]. The fact that ventilation may have detrimental effects in the critically ill patients in the form of  ventilator-induced  lung  injury  has  long  been  recognized. Early  animal  studies  demonstrated  that  high  tidal  volumes (45 mL/kg) are particularly injurious to the lung, irrespective of the applied pressure. This has led to the term 'volutrauma' and the realization that end-inspiratory stretch plays a dominant role in lung injury [13]. In ARDS patients, application of protective lung ventilation (PLV) with smaller tidal volumes and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improved survival [14]. Additionally, protective ventilation was shown to inhibit progression of lung injury compared to high tidal volume  ventilation  [13].  Whether  mechanical  ventilation causes  lung  injury  in  normal  lungs  and  whether  protective ventilation should routinely be applied in anesthesia is being debated. Tidal volume reduction towards 6 mL/kg for patients with risk factors for lung injury, and no higher than 10 mL/kg for  the  remainder, have been proposed for routine two-lung ventilation  (TLV)  [15,  16].  Considering  that  most  patients undergoing thoracic surgery have risk factors for lung injury (Table 6.1), tidal volume reduction during TLV, and even more so during OLV should become routine practice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  application  of  OLV  predisposes  the  patient  to  ALI. Radiologic density changes in patients with ALI after thoracic surgery are more pronounced in the nonoperative, ventilated lung [17]. An increased duration of OLV was found to be an independent predictor of ALI in a retrospective analysis [7]. In animal models, OLV causes histological changes compatible with lung injury, including vascular congestion, diffuse

alveolar  wall  thickening  and  damage,  as  well  as  a  decrease in nitric oxide in the ventilated lung [18, 19]. Re-expansion of lung tissue after short-term OLV incites pro-inflammatory cytokine release in animals [20]. Similar cytokine elevations are  found  in  patients  undergoing  thoracic  surgery  [21,  22]. Much of the early attention focused on the use of high tidal volumes during OLV. The analogy to ARDS has been drawn, as  both  involve  ventilation  of  a  so-called  'baby  lung'  with reduced lung capacities [23]. Analogous to ARDS, high tidal volumes may therefore cause excessive end-inspiratory stretch during OLV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Beyond  ventilatory  management,  even  anesthetic  agents themselves appear to have the potential to modify the inflammatory response to OLV and surgery. De Conno et al. allocated  adult  patients  undergoing  lung  resection  surgery  into propofol or sevoflurane anesthesia, and found that the increase in inflammatory mediators during OLV was significantly less pronounced  in  the  sevoflurane  group.  Composite  adverse events  were  significantly  higher  in  the  propofol  group,  but the groups differed in OLV duration and the need for surgical  re-exploration  [24].

anesthesia  is  not  without  merit,  as  volatile  anesthetics  have been shown to   confer attenuating effects in a model of alveolar epithelial injury [25]. In another study, which compared desflurane or propofol anesthesia in thoracic surgery patients, levels of alveolar TNF a and sICAM-1 were significantly higher in the propofol group [26]. These studies indicate that anesthetic agents themselves may influence the pro-  inflammatory response to OLV, but the true clinical relevance of that decrease remains to be established. Not surprisingly, however, the true answer as to lung injury avoidance after OLV is likely more complicated than simple tidal volume reduction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilator Settings

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tidal Volume

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tidal  volumes  used  during  TLV  (10-12  mL/kg)  used  to  be maintained into the period of OLV [27, 28]. Large tidal volumes  were  recommended  because  they  had  been  found  to improve oxygenation and decrease shunt fraction, during both TLV [29] and OLV, irrespective of the level of PEEP applied [30]. Large tidal volumes were shown to provide end-inspiratory alveolar recruitment, resulting in improved oxygenation (Fig. 6.2). Excessive tidal volumes (e.g., 15 mL/kg), on the other hand, were shown to worsen oxygenation, secondary to elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) resulting in increased shunt flow [31]. Based on the recent literature on ALI, it is becoming increasingly clear that large tidal volumes during OLV expose the patient to undue risk of postoperative respiratory complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two retrospective case series by Van de Werff and Licker identified multiple risk factors among more than 1,000 patients undergoing lung resection surgery. Both studies demonstrated a  significant  association  between  high  ventilating  pressures and ALI, but failed to provide a link to intraoperative tidal volumes [7, 32]. Fernández-Pérez et al., on the other hand, showed  a  significant  association  between  larger  intraoperative tidal volumes (8.3 vs. 6.7 mL/kg) and the development of postoperative respiratory failure in a single institution review of 170 pneumonectomies [33]. The study was criticized for the fact that ventilatory pressures were not analyzed, tidal volumes referred to the largest volume charted on the anesthetic record, with the assumption that they had been carried over to OLV, and patients that developed respiratory failure received a median of 2.2 L of fluid intraoperatively [34]. However, the results were essentially duplicated in another single-  institution review of 146 pneumonectomy patients. In that study, larger tidal volumes were independently associated with the development of ALI/ARDS (8.2 vs. 7.7 mL/kg) with an odds ratio (OR)  of  3.37  per  one  mL/kg  increase  in  tidal  volume  per predicted body weight (95% confidence interval 1.65-6.86). Peak airway pressure was an additional independent risk factor with an OR 2.32 per cm H 2 O increase (95% confidence interval 1.46-3.67) [35].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One of the earliest trials of tidal volume reduction during OLV was an animal study published in 2003 [36]. Isolated rabbit lungs were subjected to OLV with either 8 mL/kg - zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) or the 'protective' 4 mL/kg average PEEP 2.1 cmH 2 O (based on the dynamic pressuretime curve). OLV was associated with increases in multiple surrogate markers of lung injury (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP], lung weight gain [LWG] and TXB 2 cytokine levels), which occurred to a lesser  degree  in  the  protective  ventilation  group.  The  protective  ventilation  group,  however,  only received half the minute ventilation of the control group, as no compensatory increase in respiratory rate was used in the low tidal volume group. Based on the study design it was therefore not possible to state whether the outcome benefit was due to any one, or all, of minute ventilation reduction, tidal volume reduction and/or application of external PEEP [36]. Kuzkov et al. showed that when comparing equal minute ventilation in anesthetized sheep undergoing pneumonectomies, protective ventilation with 6 mL/kg - PEEP 2 cmH 2 O lowered extravascular  lung  water  (a  surrogate  for  lung  injury),  compared  to 12mL/kg - ZEEP [37]. While neither study was able to answer the question whether tidal volume reduction or the addition of PEEP results in improved outcomes, it appears clear that tidal volume reduction alone is not sufficient. This point was well illustrated  by  an  animal  study  comparing low vs. high tidal volume ventilation with or without PEEP in ALI. While animals with high tidal volume ventilation and ZEEP clearly had significant  cytokine  elevations,  all  animals  exposed  to  low tidal volumes and ZEEP died during the experiment [38].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Due to the infrequent occurrence of lung injury, prospective clinical studies have focused on cytokine levels as a surrogate marker for potentially harmful ventilation. Cytokine elevations are part of the disease process, as levels of IL-6, IL-8, sICAM-1 and vWF are elevated even prior to intubation in patients with ALI [39] and baseline plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 are associated with an increased risk of death in patients with ARDS [40]. Wrigge et al. failed to demonstrate a difference in  tracheal  cytokine  levels  between  patients  ventilated  with 12-15 mL/kg - ZEEP or 6 mL/kg - PEEP 10 cmH 2 O during TLV and OLV for laparotomy or thoracotomy. Cytokine levels before, during and after OLV were no different between the groups [41]. However, tracheal aspirates may not be sensitive enough to detect early alveolar damage. Michelet randomized 52 patients with normal lung functions undergoing esophagectomy to OLV 9 mL/kg - ZEEP or 5 mL/kg - PEEP 5 cmH 2 O. In this study, serum cytokine levels (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8) increased perioperatively, but to a lesser degree in the protective ventilation group [22]. The degree of lung injury and cytokine elevation  may  have  been  exaggerated  by  the  fact  that  despite  an average of 6 h of mechanical ventilation and 8 L of fluid, only the low tidal volume group received PEEP during OLV and no patient received PEEP during the remainder of the operation [22].  Esophageal surgery may also present a higher risk for lung injury as it is associated with cytokine elevations secondary to intestinal ischemia, potentially acting as a first hit [42].

More important than cytokine elevations, clinically significant outcomes of ALI, ICU admission and hospital stay were shown to be reduced in a cohort analysis of patients who routinely received PLV (2003-2008), as compared to historical controls (1998-2003) [44]. While historical controls are fraught  with  limitations  due  to  concomitant  developments and  improvements  in  medical  care,  this  analysis  by  Licker et  al.  showed  a  dramatic  reduction  in  adverse  postoperative respiratory  outcomes  after  the  routine  implementation  of  a PLV strategy. The ventilation strategy consisted of an open lung  concept,  with  tidal  volumes  <8  mL/kg,  routine  PEEP, pressure-control ventilation (PCV) and frequent recruitment maneuvers. The statistically averaged ventilation parameters among the 558 patients in their protective ventilation group consisted of a tidal volume of 5.3 mL/kg (standard deviation [SD]  1.1),  plateau  pressure  of  15  cmH 2 O (SD 6), PEEP of 6.2 cmH 2 O (SD 2.4) and respiratory rate of 15 bpm (SD 2). While the historical control already had a mean tidal volume of 7.1 mL/kg, only 24% of patients received tidal volumes less than 8 mL/kg, compared to the 92% compliance with low tidal volumes in the PLV cohort. As mentioned above, historical comparisons of ICU admission and length of hospitalization are difficult to interpret as criteria change and moves towards fast-tracking of patients are established. However, the definition of ALI has been consistent during the study period and the authors were able to show a significant reduction in ALI from 3.8 to 0.9% [44].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
While the benefits of protective ventilation for lung injury prevention are becoming clearer, its impact on oxygenation is  uncertain.  Two  studies  that  investigated  PLV  (lower  tidal volume and PEEP) during OLV reported improved oxygenation and shunt fraction as compared to traditional high tidal volume OLV [22, 37]. However, with inadequate or no PEEP, low  tidal  volume  ventilation  may  be  associated  with  worse oxygenation  and  shunt  fraction  [21].  Recruitment  studies performed during protective OLV have shown that despite a PEEP of 8 cmH 2 O patient ventilated with a tidal volume of 6  mL/kg  showed  significant  recruitability  of  the  ventilated lung, suggesting relative hypoventilation and atelectasis formation. Despite the presence of atelectatic lung prior to the recruitment maneuver, however, oxygenation was adequate in all  patients  [43].  Postoperative arterial oxygenation was not affected in a historical cohort analysis of patients undergoing lung cancer surgery with a PLV protocol incorporating lower tidal volumes [44].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PEEP

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Positive-end expiratory pressure minimizes alveolar collapse and atelectasis formation by providing resistance to mechanical  exhalation.  Applied  PEEP  should  therefore  be  routine for all ventilated patients during TLV [15]. Klingstedt et al. demonstrated that the mediastinal weight results in significant compression of the dependent lung in the lateral position during TLV. They were able to show that resulting V / Q mismatch can be resolved with the application of selective PEEP to the dependent lung (Fig. 6.3) [45].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PEEP does attenuate lung injury, both in the setting of high and  low  tidal  volumes  [13].  Intrinsic  or  auto-PEEP,  on  the other hand, occurs if expiratory time is too short to allow lung units to empty towards their resting volume. Lung areas with high  compliance,  characteristically  found  in  patients  with emphysema, are particularly prone due to their poor elastic recoil. Auto-PEEP is inhomogeneous throughout the lung and can therefore not be relied upon for effective avoidance of derecruitment [46]. The total PEEP after application of external PEEP is also unpredictable, due to the heterogeneous nature of auto-PEEP [47].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endotracheal  intubation  prevents  glottic  closure,  resulting  in  complete  absence  of  auto-PEEP  in  patients  without obstructive lung disease on TLV. However, initiation of OLV with 10 mL/kg ZEEP has been shown to create auto-PEEP and air  trapping.  Measured  auto-PEEP  was  minimal  in  patients without  obstructive  lung  disease,  but  patients  with  severe COPD developed auto-PEEP levels up to 16 cmH 2 O, which was associated with air trapping of 284 mL [46]. Patients with preexisting auto-PEEP have an unpredictable response to the application of extrinsic PEEP. In a study of ICU patients on TLV, application of PEEP changed total PEEP up, down or not at all [48]. In a small study of patients during OLV the additive effect  of  applied  PEEP  to  auto-PEEP  was  inversely  related to the preexisting auto-PEEP level. In other words, extrinsic PEEP contributed less to total PEEP in patients with already high auto-PEEP than patients with low auto-PEEP; however, the extent of the response was not predictable [47]. Excessive total PEEP and dynamic hyperinflation are clearly undesirable as they may cause cardiovascular depression and may require fluid loading and/or inotropic support [16].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditionally  OLV  has  been  performed  with  ZEEP,  with selective application of PEEP to the nonoperative lung as part of a hypoxemia treatment algorithm. The effect of PEEP on oxygenation during OLV is variable. It is beneficial in patients whose intrinsic PEEP is well below the lower inflection point (LIP) of the compliance curve, more commonly the patient with  normal  lung  function.  In  that  scenario  application  of external PEEP will increase the total PEEP towards the LIP of the pressure-volume curve, resulting in more open (recruited) lung and improved oxygenation. Oxygenation is worse, however, if total PEEP is increased well above the LIP, likely due to alveolar over-distention and increases in PVR resulting in an increased shunt fraction (Fig. 6.4) [49]. Neither intrinsic PEEP nor the compliance curve is routinely or easily acquired during thoracic surgery, which is why preoperative prediction of PEEP responders would be ideal. Valenza et al. showed that patients  with  relatively  normal  lung  function  (FEV 1 >  72%) exhibited  improved  oxygenation  on  application  of  PEEP 10 cmH 2 O during OLV [50].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether  applied  PEEP  is  able  to  decrease  ALI  after OLV is unclear, as it has not been studied in isolation. PEEP application  as  part  of  a  'protective'  ventilation  regime  has

been  shown  to  decrease  surrogate  markers  of  lung  injury [22, 36, 37]. Additionally, routine PEEP in patients with or without  COPD  as  part  of  a  PLV  strategy  was  shown  to  be associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of ALI and atelectasis after OLV [44].

Use  of  'protective'  OLV  with  low  tidal  volumes  but  no PEEP does not  appear  sensible,  as  de-recruitment  is  harmful  and  auto-PEEP  unreliable  in  terms  of  homogeneous lung  recruitment.

Low levels of PEEP are safe, likely beneficial for lung injury avoidance and should be used in all patients. The only true contraindication to PEEP application would be the presence of  a  broncho-pleural  fistula.  PEEP  levels,  however,  need  to be adjusted to the individual and their respiratory mechanics. Patients with normal lung function or restrictive lung disease should  benefit  from,  and  will  tolerate,  5-10  cmH 2 O  PEEP. Patients  with  severe  obstructive  lung  disease,  as  evidenced by  preoperative  hyperinflation  (RV/TLC >> 140%)  exhibit significant air trapping during OLV, but as previously stated may not exhibit a significant increase in total PEEP with the application of external PEEP. Low levels of extrinsic PEEP 2-5 cmH 2 O are likely well tolerated and should routinely be applied. Clearly dynamic hyperinflation must be considered in the differential for intraoperative hypotensive episodes in patients at risk. However, based on the static compliance analysis by Licker et al., who used routine PEEP in all patients as part of their PLV strategy, hyperinflation (and secondary decrease  in  static  compliance)  does  not  appear  to  be  a  significant concern, as the compliance actually increased in their cohort exposed to PLV with routine PEEP [44]. Early, routine application of PEEP helps to prevent atelectasis and shunt formation and thereby improves oxygenation during OLV [51].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clearly  it  would  be  best  to  measure  total  PEEP  for  each patient in order to rationally apply external PEEP [47]. This, however, is difficult or impossible in most intraoperative settings due to the inability of anesthetic ventilators to perform an  end-expiratory  hold  maneuver.  The  simplest  approximation  of  intrinsic  PEEP  can  be  derived  from  inline  spirometry  where  interruptions  of  the  end-expiratory  flow  curve indicate the presence of auto-PEEP (Fig. 6.5) [52]. Alternatively,  compliance  can  be  approximated  by  simple  calculation   (compliance  =  tidal volume/driving pressure), which may serve as an indicator of potential air-trapping, realizing that hyperinflation is only one of the possible explanations for a decrease in compliance.

One hundred percent oxygen used to be a routine component of OLV, as hypoxia was its most feared complication. However, with the decline in the incidence of hypoxemia and the realization that high F i O 2 may be detrimental, even this practice has been questioned. Oxygen toxicity is a well-recognized consequence of prolonged exposure to high F i O 2 ,  characterized by histopathologic changes similar to ALI. Oxygen toxicity  occurs  during  OLV  and  involves  ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress [12]. Collapse of the operative lung and surgical manipulation results in relative organ ischemia, and  reperfusion  at  the  time  of  lung  expansion  leads  to  the production of radical oxygen species. Increasing durations of OLV and the presence of tumor result in increased markers of oxidative stress, which after 120 min are associated with significant increases in the rates of respiratory failure and death [53]. Lung re-expansion should likely occur at a lower F i O 2 , as hypoxemic reperfusion has been shown to attenuate the reperfusion syndrome [54]. This is of particular relevance after lung transplantation. Even short-term exposure to high F i O 2 during the induction of anesthesia has been shown to cause significant  absorption  atelectasis  [55].  Studies  have  shown that an F i O 2 as low as 0.4 may provide adequate oxygenation for  OLV  in  the  lateral  decubitus  position  [56].  Due  to  the potential for lung injury, particularly in the high-risk patient, after  adjuvant  therapy  or  undergoing  lung  transplantation, F i O 2 should  be  titrated  to  effect.  At  the  initiation  of  OLV  a F i O 2 of 0.8 may be appropriate, but 15-20 min later, when the nadir of oxygenation has occurred, the F i O 2 should be gradually decreased to the minimum that is required to maintain a stable saturation level above 92-94%. During lung resection surgery further reductions in F i O 2 are possible once the vasculature to the resected lobe or lung has been disrupted. Stapling of the vasculature effectively reduces, or, in the setting of a pneumonectomy, essentially eliminates the shunt flow.

Fig. 6.7. Use of 100% O 2 pre-OLV confers a transient oxygenation benefit, which is lost by 15 min of OLV (reprinted from Ko et al. [57] with permission).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The oxygen content and gas mixture are not only important for oxygenation, but also for the speed of nonventilated lung collapse during OLV. This is of particular importance for surgical  exposure  during  video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery. Ko et al. compared three different gas mixtures during TLV immediately prior to OLV (air/O 2 ,  N 2 O/O 2 ,  O 2 )  and  investigated  which  gas  mixture  would  best  collapse  the  operative lung while maintaining arterial oxygenation in patients undergoing lung resection surgery [57]. F i O 2 was 0.4 in the air/O 2 and N 2 O/O 2 group, and 1.0 in the O 2 group during TLV. All groups received 100% oxygen on initiation of OLV. Not surprisingly, lung deflation was worse if nitrogen (i.e., air) was administered prior to lung collapse, due to the poor solubility of  nitrogen  in  blood  (Fig.  6.6).  A  nitrous  oxide/O 2 mixture was superior to oxygen alone for lung collapse, but nitrous oxide  is  contraindicated  in  many  thoracic  patients.  Administering  100%  oxygen  pre-OLV  temporarily  improved  OLV oxygenation, but only until the nonventilated lung becomes atelectatic. Once the operative lung has collapsed at around 15 min of OLV that oxygen reservoir and any benefit from it has disappeared (Fig. 6.7) [57].

Minute Ventilation/Permissive Hypercapnea

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Permissive  hypercapnea  has  been  a  key  component  of  the critical  care  management  for  ALI/ARDS.  Reduction  of the minute ventilation allows for a decrease in tidal volumes and  ventilatory  pressures,  thereby  minimizing  mechanical stress and secondary volu- or barotrauma. Beyond the reduction in minute ventilation and mechanical trauma, the actual elevated CO 2 level itself may be beneficial [58], as hypercapnea appears to attenuate the cytokine response [59].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Permissive hypercapnea has been investigated in the OLV setting.  In  the  previously  mentioned  study  by  Gama de Abreu et al., isolated rabbit lungs were exposed to OLV with 8 mL/kg - ZEEP or 4 mL/kg - PEEP 2.1 cmH 2 O (based on  the  dynamic  pressure-time  curve),  without  respiratory rate  compensation.  The  protective  ventilation  group,  which received half the minute ventilation, exhibited a reduction in surrogate markers for lung injury (PAP, LWG, cytokine levels)  [36].  Similar  ventilatory  parameters  were  studied  during  OLV  in  thoracotomy  patients.  Sticher  et  al.  ventilated patients with 7 mL/kg - PEEP 2 cmH 2 O or 3.5 mL/kg - PEEP 2 cmH 2 O, again without respiratory rate compensation, effectively halving minute ventilation similar to Gama de Abreu. P a CO 2 values rose from 42 to 64 mmHg, which was associated with a 42% increase in PVR, but no change in   oxygenation. Hypercapnea was well tolerated, however, higher risk patients with  pulmonary  hypertension  or  major  cardiac  rhythm  disturbances were excluded [60]. In a case series of 24 patients undergoing volume reduction surgery for  advanced  emphysema, permissive hypercapnea was used electively as part of a barotrauma avoidance strategy. The mean P a CO 2 value was 56 mmHg with a peak of 86 mmHg, resulting in pH values between  7.11  and  7.41  (mean  7.29).  The  authors  state  that hypercapnea was well tolerated, however, inotropic  support was required in over 50% of patients [61]. Even higher P a CO 2 levels  have  been  described  in  a  small  series  of  ten  patients with severe emphysema that were again managed with elective hypoventilation for barotrauma avoidance. P a CO 2 values rose to peak levels of 70-135 mmHg, resulting in pH values as  low  as  7.03  (despite  bicarbonate  administration).  Hypercapnea was poorly tolerated at these high levels. All patients required  inotropic  support  during  anesthesia.  Four  patients developed ventricular dysrhythmias and three patients required tracheal gas insufflation for treatment of hypoxemia [62]. Significant hypercapnea can cause increased intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension, decreased myocardial contractility,  decreased  renal  blood  flow  and  release  of  endogenous  catecholamines.  At  extremely  high  levels,  CO 2 can be  lethal  due  to  excessive  sympathetic  stimulation,  cardiac rhythm disturbances and/or cardiac collapse [16, 62]. Moderate hypercapnea potentiates the HPV response and is therefore unlikely to adversely affect oxygenation [63]; however, the same may not hold true for extreme CO 2 elevations [62]. A protective ventilation strategy including permissive hypercapnea has been shown to reduce the incidence of ALI in a cohort analysis by Licker et al. While not explicitly discussed in  the  manuscript,  permissive  hypercapnea  clearly  was  part of their strategy. The PLV group had significantly lower tidal volumes with only marginal rate compensation. Based on the

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
manuscript, the minute ventilation of the historical cohort was 92 vs. 80 mL/kg/min in the PLV group. The PLV group therefore  had  smaller  minute  ventilation  and  increased  anatomic dead space ventilation (increased respiratory rate), resulting in  decreased  CO 2 elimination  [44].  Permissive  hypercapnea should  be  considered  a  routine  component  of  a  PLV  strategy for OLV. Assuming a reasonable cardiovascular reserve, and in particular right ventricular function, P a CO 2 levels  up to 70 mmHg are well tolerated in the short term and clearly beneficial in terms of lung injury avoidance and attenuation. Higher levels should be avoided in the majority of patients due to the risk of hemodynamic instability.

I:E Ratio and Respiratory Rate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each  ventilatory  cycle  consists  of  time  spent  in  inspiration and expiration. The appropriate ratio of inspiratory to expiratory  (I:E)  time  depends  on  underlying  lung  mechanics. Restrictive lung disease is characterized by poorly compliant lungs, which resist passive lung expansion, but rapidly recoil to FRC. Increasing the I:E ratio to 1:1 (or using inverse ratio ventilation) maximizes the time spent in inspiration, thereby reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures. For illustration, at a respiratory rate of 15 bpm and an I:E ratio of 1:1, each  respiratory  cycle  lasts  4  s,  with  2  s  spent  in  each  of inspiration and expiration, respectively. Obstructive lung disease, on the other hand, is characterized by lungs, which have difficulty to empty towards FRC, due to poor elastic recoil and conducting airway collapse. Decreasing the I:E ratio towards 1:4 allows for more expiratory time, and helps to minimize the risk  of  auto-PEEP and dynamic hyperinflation. For illustration, at a respiratory rate of 15 bpm, now with the I:E ratio to 1:4, each respiratory cycle is still 4 s, however, expiration now takes up 3.2 s of the entire cycle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory  rate  modification  may  be  equally  necessary depending on the underlying lung mechanics. Extreme airflow obstruction  may  require  very  long  expiratory  times.  After reducing  the  I:E  ratio  to  the  minimum  of  1:4  this  can  only be achieved by increasing the overall cycle length, i.e., reducing the respiratory rate. Clinical examples, such as the patient with severe cystic fibrosis requiring a respiratory rate of 4-6 to allow for complete exhalation have been reported [64]. In restrictive  lung  disease,  on  the  other  hand,  dividing  a  given minute volume by a higher respiratory frequency may be beneficial in reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures. It has to be realized, however, that as anatomic dead space remains unchanged, dividing the minute volume by a higher respiratory rate results in reduced CO 2 elimination as the unchanged size of the anatomic dead space makes up a larger component of the tidal volume [65]. For illustration, a patient ventilated at 400 mL - 20 bpm receives the identical minute ventilation as a patient ventilated at 800 mL - 10 bpm. However, dead space ventilation, which occupies about 150 mL of each breath, has doubled from 1,500 mL at 10 bpm to 3,000 mL at 20 bpm. Alveolar ventilation has therefore been reduced from 6,500 mL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(8,000-1,500) to 5,000 mL (8,000-3,000). Additionally, OLV with small tidal volume and rapid respiratory rate results in statistically higher auto-PEEP [65]. While auto-PEEP elevations in this study were unlikely to be clinically significant, they serve as a reminder that rapid, shallow ventilation has the potential to increase dynamic hyperinflation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peak/Plateau Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The peak inspiratory pressure is a reflection of the dynamic compliance  of  the  respiratory  system  and  depends  on  tidal volume, inspiratory time, endotracheal size and airway tone (bronchospasm). Plateau pressure, on the other hand, relates to the static compliance of the respiratory system, i.e., chest wall and lung compliance. Double-lumen endobronchial tubes have small internal diameters resulting in increased resistance to air flow [66]. Application of the full TLV minute volume to a single lumen of the double lumen tube (DLT) results in a 55% increase in peak inspiratory pressure and 42% increase in plateau pressure [67]. While plateau pressure reflects alveolar pressure, peak pressure is unlikely to be fully applied to the  alveolus.  A  retrospective  study  of  197  pneumonectomy patients  did,  however,  show  that  peak  ventilation  pressures above  40  cmH 2 O were  associated  with  the  development  of PPPE [32]. Recently, Fernández-Pérez et al. reviewed 4,420 consecutive  patients  without  preexisting  lung  injury  undergoing  high-risk  elective  surgeries  for  postoperative  pulmonary  complications  and  demonstrated  that  mean  first  hour airway  pressure  (OR  1.07;  95%  CI  1.02-1.15  cmH 2 O)  but not  tidal  volume,  PEEP  or  F i O 2, were  associated  with  ALI after adjusting for nonventilatory parameters [68]. Similarly, patients exposed to a plateau pressure of 29 cmH 2 O were at significantly higher risk of developing ALI after lung resection surgery than those with a plateau pressure of 14 cmH 2 O [7]. Based on the critical care literature there does not appear to  be  a  critical  plateau  pressure  level  above  which  injury occurs, but rather any elevation in plateau pressure increases the  relative  risk  of  lung  injury.  With  the  implementation  of permissive  hypoventilation,  peak  pressure  levels  well  less than 35-40 cmH 2 O and plateau pressures less than 25 cmH 2 O should therefore be achievable in the majority of patients during OLV. This was confirmed in the cohort study by Licker et al. who showed that implementation of a PLV strategy for OLV resulted in mean plateau pressures of 15 cmH 2 O [44].

Ventilatory Mode

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volume-control  ventilation  (VCV)  has  been  the  dominant ventilatory  mode  both  in  the  intensive  care  and  operating room. VCV uses a constant inspired flow (square wave), creating  a  progressive  increase  in  airway  pressure  towards  the peak inspiratory pressure, which is reached as the full tidal volume has been delivered. Inspiratory pressure during VCV depends on the set tidal volume and PEEP, gas flow rates and resistance, as well as respiratory system compliance. The set

<!-- PAGE=? -->
tidal volume will be delivered unless the inspiratory pressure exceeds the pressure limit, in which case the flow ceases. With the  realization  that  ventilatory  pressures  may  be  one  of  the inciting factors of lung injury, other ventilatory modes have been explored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PCV uses a decelerating flow pattern, with maximal flow at the beginning of inspiration until the set pressure is reached, after which flow rapidly decreases balancing the decreasing compliance of the expanding lung. This resembles the spontaneous mammalian breath which also follows a decelerating pattern, as negative intrathoracic pressure induced by contracting diaphragm and intercostal muscles cause a high initial airflow [15]. Tidal volumes can be highly variable during PCV and may fall precipitously with changes in lung compliance, such as with surgical manipulation. As the majority of the tidal volume is delivered in the early part of the inspiration, mean airway and alveolar pressure tend to be higher during PCV. The decelerating flow pattern results in a more homogeneous distribution of the tidal volume, improving static and dynamic lung compliance due to recruitment of poorly ventilated lung regions, and improving oxygenation and dead-space ventilation [69]. Whether PCV during OLV improves oxygenation is controversial. Tu/.notdefrul et al. studied 48 patients undergoing thoracotomy and lung resection. Patients received VCV or PCV during OLV, both delivering 10 mL/kg - ZEEP -100% O 2 , in a cross-over fashion. PCV was associated with statistically significant decreases in peak and plateau airway pressures, as well  as  improved  oxygenation  and  shunt  fraction.  Oxygenation improved more in patients with poor preoperative lung function, which may relate to the more homogeneous distribution of ventilation achieved with the pressure-control breath [70]. The same group investigated the benefit of adding PEEP 4 cmH 2 O to OLV with PCV and showed that it provided an additional significant improvement in oxygenation and shunt fraction  in  their  patients  [71].  Other  groups,  however,  have failed  to  reproduce  the  oxygenation  benefit  in  PCV  studies during OLV [72-74].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The effect of intraoperative ventilatory mode on postoperative  oxygenation is  equally  controversial.  Although  a  better postoperative oxygenation was shown in the PCV group compared with VCV in a trial of patients undergoing MIDCAB surgery [75], no significant difference was demonstrated in a study of patients after thoracic surgery [76]. Despite the lack of a clear oxygenation benefit, PCV is likely preferable over VCV due to the potential to decrease ventilatory pressures and the ability to recruit lung units.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is another ventilatory mode that has been successfully used in thoracic surgery [77].  HFJV, when applied to the operative lung during prolonged OLV in aortic surgery, is more effective than continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in improving P a O 2 [78]. This may be particularly relevant in the poor operative candidate after prior contra-lateral lung resection [79]. One recent study evaluated the value of two-lung HFJV via a standard endotracheal  tube  for  thoracic  surgery.  Sixty  patients  were randomized to HFJV (1 atm pressure, rate 200/min, 100% O 2 ) or  standard  OLV  (10  mL/kg,  100%  O 2 ,  ZEEP).  HFJV  was associated  with  lower  ventilating  pressures,  improved  oxygenation and shunt fraction and importantly no detriment in surgical  exposure  or  intraoperative  hemodynamic  variables [80].  More  recently,  Buise  et  al.  reported  that  HFJV  was associated with a lower mean blood loss and less crystalloids administration  during  esophagectomy,  compared  with  the OLV group. They speculated that higher ventilatory pressures in  the  OLV  group  resulted  in  higher  intrathoracic  pressure and central venous pressure, and thus splanchnic congestion, which increased blood loss relative to the HFJV group [81]. Difficulties in monitoring ventilatory pressures, tidal volumes and end-tidal CO 2 concentrations, in addition to the inherent risks of barotrauma associated with this technique, continue to limit its widespread adoption [77].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another  ventilatory  mode,  which  has  only  been  used  as a  CPAP  equivalent  at  this  point,  is  high-frequency  percussive ventilation (HFPV). It is a ventilatory technique providing  convective  and  diffusive  ventilation  that  can  reduce  the physiologic right-to-left shunt and improve arterial oxygenation [82-84]. Lucangelo et al. recently assessed the effects of HFPV (F i O 2 1.0, 500 cycles/min, mean pressure 5 cmH 2 O, with pressures oscillating between 2 and 8 cmH 2 O) applied to the nondependent lung compared to standard CPAP in patients undergoing elective lung resection. Before nondependent lung re-expansion, HFPV patients showed higher P a O 2 than CPAP. HFPV was also associated with better clearance of secretions and shortened hospital stay [85].

Recruitment/Re-Expansion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atelectasis has long been known to occur in dependent lung areas of anesthetized patients. The primary reasons for alveolar collapse during anesthesia are extrinsic compression and gas  resorption.  Recent  studies  have  shown  that  atelectatic alveoli are not simply air-less, but may also be fluid or foamfilled.  Beyond  simple  lung  collapse,  atelectasis  is  therefore now  considered  both  a  potential  cause  and  a  manifestation of ALI [55]. Interestingly, re-expansion of collapsed alveoli causes injury not only to the alveoli that are being recruited, but also to remote nonatelectatic alveoli [55]. This may be in part to the early realization by Mead that expansion of a gasfree alveolus with a trans-pulmonary pressure of 30 cmH 2 O creates a shear force of 140 cmH 2 O to adjacent alveoli [13]. PEEP has been shown to prevent lung injury associated with both high and low tidal volumes, by stabilizing alveoli, and preventing their collapse [55]. In animal models of ARDS it has  been  shown  that  atelectasis  is  associated  with  vascular leak,  right  ventricular  failure  and  eventual  death  in  31%  of rats, and is easily avoided with PEEP [86].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atelectasis  formation  in  the  nonoperative  lung  is  highly undesirable during OLV as it worsens the already high shunt fraction, increasing the potential for hypoxemia. Among the risk  factors  that  predispose  to  lung  de-recruitment  during

OLV are  high  F i O 2 ,  traditional  lack  of  PEEP  and  extrinsic compression by abdominal contents, heart and mediastinum. The  best  evidence  for  the  presence  of  atelectasis  during OLV  comes  from  a  lung  recruitment  study,  which  investigated  an  aggressive  alveolar  recruitment  maneuver  (ARM) with increasing pressure breaths over a 4-min period up to a peak pressure of 40 cmH 2 O and a PEEP level of 20 cmH 2 O (Fig. 6.8a). Recruitment increased P a O 2 on OLV from a mean of 144 mmHg to a mean of 244 mmHg (Fig. 6.8b) [43].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cinnella  et  al.  demonstrated  that  the  alveolar  recruitment achieved by such an ARM resulted in a significant decrease in static elastance of the dependent lung [87]. Hemodynamic instability is a well-recognized risk of such an aggressive ARM as the sustained intrathoracic pressure increases right ventricular afterload, resulting in impaired venous return and left heart preload  [88,  89].  A  recent  study  showed  that  stroke  volume variation  (an  indicator  of  preload  responsiveness)  increases dramatically  after  an  ARM,  while  both  cardiac  index  and venous oxygen saturation decrease. These changes, however, were transient and completely recovered within 3 min [90].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Caution is required with the implementation of PLV, as low tidal volumes and plateau pressures may promote atelectasis formation and increase F i O 2 and PEEP requirements [16]. Frequent de-recruitment and therefore need for repeated recruitment maneuvers, as may be the case with low tidal volume ventilation with insufficient PEEP, are potentially deleterious. In animal models of lung injury, repeated de-recruitment and recruitment  maneuvers  are  associated  with  histological  evidence of lung injury [91, 92]. Even a single recruitment maneuver of 40 cmH 2 O for 40 s has been shown to elevate biomarkers of lung injury in the rat model without preexisting lung injury [93]. The same may potentially be true in humans, although this  aspect  has  only  been  studied  in  critically  ill  patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Halbertsma  et  al.  demonstrated  that  a  single  ARM  could increase translocation of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the alveolar space into the systemic circulation in ventilated critically ill children. Fifteen minutes after the ARM, an increase was observed in plasma TNF a , IL-6 and IL-1 b [94]. Another critical care study found that 4 out of 28 patients with ALI/ ARDS developed barotrauma necessitating intervention following an ARM [95]. This does create a curious dilemma as the increased use of PLV, with low tidal volumes, may promote atelectasis formation and therefore increase the need for recruitment maneuvers [16]. The best ventilatory strategy is therefore one that follows the 'open lung' concept and maintains lung recruitment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atelectasis formation in the operative lung is routine and occurs gradually over a 10-20 min period as residual oxygen is being absorbed, which parallels the gradual decline in P a O 2 on OLV. Ko et al. compared three different gas mixtures during TLV immediately prior to OLV (air/O 2 , N 2 O/O 2 , O 2 ) and investigated which gas mixture would best collapse the operative  lung  while  maintaining  arterial  oxygenation  in  patients undergoing lung resection surgery. F i O 2 was 0.4 in the air/O 2 and N 2 O/O 2 group, and 1.0 in the O 2 group during TLV. All groups received 100% oxygen on initiation of OLV. Not surprisingly, lung deflation was worse if nitrogen (i.e., air) was administered prior to lung collapse, due to the poor solubility of  nitrogen  in  blood  (Fig.  6.6).  A  nitrous  oxide/O 2 mixture was superior to oxygen alone for lung collapse, but nitrous oxide  is  contraindicated  in  many  thoracic  patients.  Administering  100%  oxygen  pre-OLV  temporarily  improved  OLV oxygenation, but only until the nonventilated lung becomes atelectatic. Once the operative lung has collapsed at around 15 min of OLV, that oxygen reservoir and any benefit from it has disappeared (Fig. 6.7) [57].

Atelectasis  is  complete,  unless  CPAP  is  applied  to  the operative lung. CPAP, or its variant HFJV, if applied to the at least  partially  recruited  operative  lung,  effectively  improves V / Q matching and hypoxemia [78]. Gradual re-expansion of the operative lung at the conclusion of OLV is achieved with a continuous pressure hold of 20-30 cmH 2 O, which is lower than standard recruitment regimens, in order to prevent disruption of staple lines. As discussed, re-expansion of lung tissue may be harmful. Re-expansion injury after prolonged lung collapse consists of alveolar-capillary membrane edema and increase in lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration [96]. Re-expansion of isolated rabbit lungs after 55 min of lung collapse showed significant elevations in myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels, as well as IL-1 b and TNFa mRNA, when compared to an open lung control [20]. Intermittent lung re-expansion may mitigate these effects, as intermittent recruitment of the operative lung during OLV has been shown to decrease pro-inflammatory mediators during esophagectomy [97]. Lung recruitment with continuous high pressure hold may result in significant hypotension if applied to both lungs. However, even in the setting of hypovolemia, recruitment is well tolerated, if it is selectively applied to one lung at a time, with the other lung open to atmosphere [98]. Re-expansion pulmonary edema is fortunately rare if a gradual, gentle recruitment technique is applied, and is more likely after sudden recruitment of long-standing lung collapse [99]. Yet, even a single recruitment maneuvers has the potential to cause lung injury in animal models [93]. Low oxygen tensions should likely be used for re-expansion, as recruitment of the operative lung is associated with substantial oxidative stress, particularly after prolonged OLV [53, 54].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OLV Duration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical stress due to OLV can be minimized by optimization of ventilatory parameters. However, even minimal stress using 'protective' parameters becomes significant if exposure is prolonged. Retrospective case series have shown that OLV lasting more than 100 min is associated with an increased risk for postoperative lung injury [7]. Part of the damage may be due to  oxidative  stress.  A  recent  animal  study  exposed  rats to increasing durations of OLV from 1 to 3 h. At the conclusion of the experiment animals were sacrificed and analyzed for biochemical indicators of oxidative stress and histologic changes in lung tissue. Increasing the duration of OLV from 1 to 3 h resulted in significant elevations of malondialdehyde (MDA) activity and increased the amount of tissue damage on histological analysis [100]. A prospective analysis of patients undergoing  lobectomy  for  nonsmall  cell  cancer  with  either TLV or OLV lasting more than 60, 90 or 120 min compared MDA plasma levels at lung re-expansion. Again, MDA levels increased significantly with increasing OLV duration, indicating cumulative oxidative stress [53]. Anesthesiologists have limited control over the duration of OLV as it is mostly determined by the surgical procedure. However, initiation of OLV should occur as close to pleural opening as possible (except for  thoracoscopic  procedures),  and  TLV  should  resume  as early as possible. With the increasing use of OLV outside the thoracic theater, it is essential to ensure that the nonthoracic surgeon appreciates the need to minimize the length of OLV.

Ventilatory Strategy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The cumulative evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of adopting a protective lung ventilatory strategy for OLV , which has been shown to decrease surrogate markers of lung injury as well as the incidence of ALI itself. Protective ventilation is not synonymous with low tidal volume ventilation, but includes all of routine PEEP, lower FiO 2 and particularly lower ventilatory pressures through the use of PCV and permissive hypercapnea. This strategy follows the 'open-lung' concept that has been widely adopted for management of ARDS patients in intensive care units. As part of the open-lung concept frequent recruitment of the lung has to be considered as another component of a PLV strategy. Recruitment should occur at the beginning of OLV, during OLV if indicated by worsening oxygenation and for lung re-expansion. Lung de-recruitment may potentially be more prevalent with low tidal volumes due to the loss of endinspiratory stretch in the setting of high F i O 2 . External PEEP should help to minimize de-recruitment. However, PEEP titration is difficult in the intra-operative setting for two reasons. First, determination of inflection points and auto-PEEP would require inline spirometry, as routine expiratory holds are not feasible intra-operatively. Second, other than the ICU, where as long as cardiac output is maintained, PEEP can be increased to maintain 'open lung'; in the OLV setting excessive PEEP will  cause  pulmonary  blood  flow  diversion  to  the  operative lung  and  worsens  oxygenation.  As  such,  low  tidal  volume ventilation has the potential to worsen oxygenation, either due to lung de-recruitment with inadequate PEEP or due to pulmonary blood flow diversion with excessive PEEP. Low tidal volume ventilation increases dead-space and CO 2 elimination is therefore consistently worse with this technique. This should not present a problem in the majority of patients, unless CO 2 elimination is already compromised by severe obstructive lung disease  (e.g.,  cystic  fibrosis).  In  cases  of  severe  respiratory acidosis, marked pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction, 'protective' low-tidal volume - high rate ventilation may need to be aborted in favor of higher tidal volume ventilation at a lower respiratory rate (to maximize CO 2 elimination),  as  the  imminent  risk  of  hemodynamic  dysfunction trumps the potential risk  of  ALI.  Dynamic  hyperinflation  is common during OLV and is increased with the application of PEEP and the use of higher respiratory rates. The risk of hyperinflation may be increased with a PLV strategy, which has to be considered, particularly in patients with severe emphysema and during periods of hemodynamic instability. Providing adequate expiratory time and use of permissive hypoventilation should minimize the risk of significant hyperinflation in all but the patients with severe obstructive lung.

While PLV should be the norm for all patients, it is particularly important in patients with risk factors for ALI and during procedures that trigger a higher inflammatory response, such as pneumonectomy, esophageal surgery or lung transplantation. Respiratory  mechanics  vary  widely  between  restrictive  and obstructive lung disease so that any ventilatory strategy needs to be individualized for the particular patient (Table 6.2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prediction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxia  used  to  be  the  major  concern  during  OLV .  Early reports indicated that 40-50% of patients suffered hypoxemia during OLV [101]. Predictors for possible desaturation have been identified (Table 6.3). Hurford et al. examined the intraoperative oxygenation of patients who had undergone preoperative V / Q scanning  [101].  They  found  that  the  amount  of preoperative perfusion (and ventilation) to the operative lung inversely correlated with P a O 2 after 10 min of OLV. As HPV is only able to halve blood flow through the operative lung during  OLV, the authors concluded that the extent of preoperative blood flow helped to predict the amount of intra-operative shunt. Slinger et al. showed that P a O 2 during OLV relates to multiple  factors.  Poor  oxygenation  during  TLV  was  predictive of continued oxygenation difficulties as were right-sided operations (due to the increased perfusion to that side). Good preoperative pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) was found to be predictive of poor OLV oxygenation, which is felt to be due to the lack of auto-PEEP and secondary de-recruitment in normal lungs [102]. Two recent studies correlated the risk of hypoxemia to the end-tidal CO 2 gradients.  One  study  showed  that the difference of end-tidal CO 2 between the lungs in the lateral position significantly correlates with the P/F ratio at 15 min of OLV [103]. The other study demonstrated that there was a significant negative correlation between the lowest P a O 2 recorded during the first 45 min of OLV and the end-tidal CO 2 difference between TLV and the early phase of OLV [104]. Both studies postulated that elevated CO 2 gradients were indicative of V / Q mismatching and therefore explained the risk of hypoxemia.

improved lung isolation, confirmation of lung isolation with FOB and use of anesthetic agents with less effects on HPV are being credited for the reduction of oxygenation difficulties. In 1993 the incidence of hypoxia <90% occurring during OLV was  quoted  at  9%  [105].  By  2003  the  published  incidence of hypoxemia was down to 1% of OLV cases in some hands [106].  However,  another  more  recent  study  again  showed  a 10%  incidence  of  hypoxemia  <90%  in  a  single  institution between  2003  and  2004.  The  discrepancy  could  be  due  to variations in clinical management. Alternatively, it may indicate the difference between manual and electronic charting, as the latter study consisted of automatic recording of saturation every 30 s [107]. Although rare, significant hypoxia may still occur, at times without warning [108].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  a  rational  approach  to  hypoxia  during  OLV  it  has  to be  appreciated  that  CPAP  and  TLV  are  uniformly  effective (Table  6.4).  CPAP  always  decreases  shunt  flow  and  TLV essentially eliminates shunt flow. Aside from procedures such as pneumonectomy and lung transplantation where these techniques are not available, patients should therefore not have to suffer prolonged hypoxemia. Assuming that the lung isolation device is properly positioned, these two maneuvers are the most effective  treatments  for  hypoxemia.  They  are  not  chosen  as  firstline interventions, however, because they will impair surgical access  to  the  lung,  particularly  during  thoracoscopic  procedures.

CPAP is easily applied via one of the   commercially available units that connect to the open lumen of the DLT, or the suction port of the bronchial blocker via the CPAP adaptor (Fig. 6.9). Alternatively, a standard AMBU bag with a PEEP valve can be used if no CPAP unit is available. CPAP does require some degree of lung recruitment, which is not always feasible (lung lavage, bronchopleural fistula) and will impact surgical exposure. Recently, Russell et al. described an intermittent positive airway pressure (IPAP) technique, which does not elicit lung inflation  and  therefore  should  not  impact  surgical  exposure (Fig. 6.10). While the technique does not call for lung recruitment, it is unlikely to be of benefit in the setting of complete

lung  collapse.  It  is  based  on  intermittent  delivery  of  short bursts of low-flow oxygen (2 L/min) to the nonventilated lung to  treat  hypoxemia,  circumventing  significant  lung  movement in the surgical field. Placing a standard bacteriostatic filter on the open lumen of the DLT, with oxygen connected to  the  CO 2 sampling  port,  manual  occlusion  of  open  filter end allows for 'jet-insufflation' of oxygen into the collapsed lung. A 2-s burst of flow will deliver 66 mL of oxygen to the nonventilated lung. In this study, all of the ten patients with relative  hypoxemia  (SpO 2 <  95%)  were  successfully  treated by repeated 2-s bursts of oxygen, followed by 10-s exhalations and no surgical interference was noted [109].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxemia  during  OLV  for  VATS  presents  a  particular problem, as TLV and CPAP techniques are generally considered to be contraindicated. Ku et al. presented a novel method, which may be of benefit in select cases. They described the treatment of refractory hypoxemia during left-sided V ATS for lung volume reduction surgery. A 4-mm FOB was inserted into the basilar segment of the left lower lobe bronchus and 5 L/ min of oxygen was insufflated for approximately 20 s via the suction port (Fig. 6.11). Oxygenation successfully recovered within 2 min without impairing the surgical field and remained adequate for 20 min. There are two important considerations to this technique. First, it can only be applied if the insufflation occurs in a lung territory that is remote to the surgical site, and is therefore unlikely to be successful in case of a central lesion. In this case report, oxygen was insufflated into basilar segments while lung resection occurred at the apex. Second, insufflation of relatively high-flow oxygen has the potential to cause lung over-distention or barotrauma if the bronchoscope tip  is  allowed  to  wedge  in  the  airway.  The  authors  guarded against this by having the surgeon visualize the basilar lung

segments throughout the period of insufflation [110]. Distal oxygen insufflation, particularly at relatively high flow rates as described in this report, should never be applied blindly. As another option, we have successfully used HFJV during VATS procedures. In order for this technique to succeed, the lung has to be allowed to collapse away from the chest wall prior to  the  institution  of  HFJV  and  driving  pressures  have  to  be low enough to only cause partial lung inflation. As previously stated, however, with proper attention to adequate lung isolation, 'open lung' ventilation and maintenance of a   normal cardiac output, these interventions should rarely be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung  de-recruitment  in  the  ventilated  lung  is  common, easily reversed with recruitment maneuvers and preventable with  appropriate  PEEP  levels.  Low  mixed  venous  oxygen saturation secondary to low cardiac output is another frequent and  easily  treatable  cause  of  desaturation.  Pharmacological modulation with vasoconstrictors  (almitrine,  phenylephrine) to  strengthen  HPV  in  the  operative  lung  and  vasodilators (inhaled NO) to improve pulmonary vascular capacitance in the ventilated lung may be helpful in extreme cases.

Systemic Effects

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Even  though  hypoxia  has  become  less  of  an  anesthetic issue  during  OLV,  relative  hypoxemia  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  vital  nonpulmonary  organ  function  due  to the ever-increasing rate of co-morbid conditions in thoracic patients. In addition to hypoxemia, release of inflammatory cytokines  and  reactive  oxygen  metabolites  may  have  yet unknown effects on organ function. A few recent studies have attempted to define the effects of OLV on organ function. More research is needed to delineate the end-organ effects of OLV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  recent  study  by  Mierdl  et  al.  analyzed  the  impact  of hypoxia  during  OLV  on  myocardial  metabolism  in  patients with severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Patients underwent minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting via small  lateral  thoracotomy.  In  their  study  measurements  of arterial and coronary sinus PO 2 , pH and lactate did not show any evidence of anaerobic metabolism, despite arterial P a O 2 values  between  50  and  70  mmHg  during  OLV.  Additionally, no patient exhibited myocardial ischemia, which led the authors to conclude that OLV may be used in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease with an acceptable low risk of inducing anaerobic myocardial metabolism [111].

Neurocognitive  dysfunction  is  a  well-known  complication of cardiac surgery, and has been shown to be associated with intraoperative episodes of cerebral oxygen desaturation. Standard pulse oximetry is insufficient to detect these events. Monitoring for, and treating cerebral desaturation events, may decrease the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction [112, 113]. Tobias et al. investigated the incidence and risk factors for cerebral desaturation by monitoring cerebral oxygenation (rSO 2 )  using near infrared spectroscopy in patients  who required OLV for thoracic surgery [114]. In 8 of 40 patients, prolonged decreases in rSO 2 to less than 75% of the baseline value were recorded for 25% or more of the

duration  of  OLV.  These  eight  patients  were  older,  weighed more and were more likely to be ASA III than the remainder  of  the  patients.  Since  there  was  no  significant  difference  in  patient  background  or  other  monitoring  values,  the authors  concluded  that  rSO 2 monitoring  might  be  useful  to detect cerebral desaturation and allow for early intervention in patients during OLV. Jugular bulb venous oxygen saturations during OLV were assessed in a study comparing sevoflurane- and propofol-based anesthesia in patients undergoing lung surgery [115]. The SjO 2 values were significantly higher in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group, despite identical SaO 2 values. The lower SjO 2 values observed with propofol anesthesia may be explained by the fact that propofol reduces cerebral blood flow more than cerebral metabolic rate [116, 117].

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interestingly, cerebral oxygen desaturation also appears to be predictive of noncerebral postoperative complications. In a recent trial of 50 patients undergoing major thoracotomy with OLV, a minimal absolute regional cerebral oxygen saturation of  less  than  65%  was  found  to  be  predictive  of  postoperative organ dysfunction based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring system with an OR of 2.37 (95% CI 1.18-4.39, P =  0.043)  [118].  Cerebral  tissue  oxygenation depends on arterial oxygen content, oxygen delivery (cardiac output) and metabolic consumption and may therefore be a superior monitor to simple pulse oximetry.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reactive oxygen metabolites are known to occur after reexpansion of the nonventilated lung. These metabolites may have deleterious effects on cellular function. Yulu/.notdef et al. investigated  the  effects  of  OLV  and  re-expansion  on  the  tissue damage of the liver and ileum in rats [119]. Plasma aspartate aminotransferase  (AST),  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT), tissue  MDA,  and  MPO  activities  in  both  tissues  were  significantly  increased  associated  with  OLV  and  re-expansion. Tissue  damage  and  apoptotic  index  increased  in  rats  with longer OLV duration, suggesting that OLV may cause tissue damage in the liver and ileum. These are some of the early indicators that OLV may indeed have effects beyond lung tissue; future research will help to delineate the significance of these findings.

Conclusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The last decade has seen a shift in OLV research from studies investigating hypoxemia to various aspects of lung injury pathophysiology and prevention. Much has been learned about ventilation strategies that minimize lung injury. Evidence to date supports PLV based on reduction of surrogate markers, but more importantly now also indicates reduction of adverse outcomes.  Ventilatory  parameters  have  to  be  individualized for  each  patient's  unique  pulmonary  mechanics,  but  should focus  on  an  'open-lung'  strategy.  Hypoxemia  is  infrequent and should lead to a re-evaluation of ventilatory parameters. Routine  algorithms  for  treatment  of  hypoxemia,  as  well  as advanced  management  techniques  are  available,  such  that prolonged hypoxia should be exceedingly rare. There are early indicators that OLV may impact systemic organ function, but future research is needed to address end-organ effects.
