Introduction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Over the past 13 years, survival to discharge from pediatric inhospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) has markedly improved. From 2001 to 2013, rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) from IHCA increased significantly from 39% to 77%, and survival to hospital discharge improved from 24% to 36% to 43% (Girotra  et  al 1 and  personal  communication  with  Paul  Chan, MD, MSc, April 3, 2015). In a single center, implementation of an intensive care unit (ICU)-based interdisciplinary debriefing program improved survival with favorable neurologic outcome from 29% to 50%. 2  Furthermore, new data show that prolonged cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  is  not  futile:  12%  of patients receiving CPR in IHCA for more than 35 minutes survived to discharge, and 60% of the survivors had a favorable neurologic outcome. 3  This improvement in survival rate from IHCA can be attributed to multiple factors, including emphasis on high-quality CPR and advances in post-resuscitation care. Over the past decade, the percent of cardiac arrests occurring in an ICU setting has increased (87% to 91% in 2000 to 2003 to 94% to 96% in 2004 to 2010). 4  While rates of survival from pulseless electrical activity and asystole have increased, there has been no change in survival rates from in-hospital ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (pVT).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conversely,  survival  from  out-of-hospital  cardiac  arrest (OHCA) has not improved as dramatically over the past 5 years. Data  from  11  US  and  Canadian  hospital  emergency  medical service systems (the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium) during 2005 to 2007 showed age-dependent discharge survival rates of 3.3% for infants (less than 1 year), 9.1% for children (1  to  11  years),  and  8.9%  for  adolescents  (12  to  19  years). 5 More recently published data (through 2012) from this network demonstrate 8.3% survival to hospital discharge across all age groups, with 10.5% survival for children aged 1 to 11 years and 15.8% survival for adolescents aged 12 to 18 years. 6

Evidence Evaluation Process Informing This Guidelines Update

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The American Heart Association (AHA) Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC) Committee uses a rigorous process to review and analyze the peer-reviewed published scientific evidence supporting the  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC, including this update. In 2000, the AHA began collaborating with other resuscitation councils throughout the world, via the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR), in a formal international  process  to  evaluate  resuscitation  science.  This  process resulted in the publication of the International Consensus on CPR and ECC Science With Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR) in 2005 and 2010. 7,8  These publications provided the scientific support for AHA Guidelines revisions in those years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 2011, the AHA created an online evidence review process, the Scientific Evidence Evaluation and Review System (SEERS),  to  support  ILCOR  systematic  reviews  for  2015 and beyond. This new process includes the use of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) software to create systematic reviews that will be available online and used by resuscitation councils to develop their guidelines for CPR and ECC. The drafts of the online reviews were posted for public comment, and ongoing reviews will  be  accessible  to  the  public  (https://volunteer.heart.org/ apps/pico/Pages/default.aspx).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The AHA process for identification and management of potential  conflicts  of  interest  was  used,  and  potential  conflicts for writing group members are listed at the end of each Part of the 2015 AHA Guidelines Update for CPR and ECC . For  additional  information  about  this  systematic  review  or management of the  potential  conflicts  of  interest,  see  'Part 2:  Evidence  Evaluation  and  Management  of  Conflicts  of Interest'  in  this  supplement  and  the  related  article  'Part  2: Evidence Evaluation and Management of Conflict of Interest' in the 2015 CoSTR publication. 9,10

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This update to the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC for pediatric advanced life support (PALS) targets key questions related to pediatric resuscitation. Areas of update were selected  by  a  group  of  international  pediatric  resuscitation experts from ILCOR, and the questions encompass resuscitation topics in prearrest care, intra-arrest care, and postresuscitation care. The ILCOR Pediatric Life Support Task Force experts reviewed the topics addressed in the 2010 Guidelines

for PALS and, based on in-depth knowledge of new research developments, formulated 18 questions for further systematic evaluation. 11 Three questions that address pediatric basic life support appear in 'Part 11: Pediatric Basic Life Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Quality.'

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Beginning with the publication of the 2015 CoSTR, the ILCOR evidence evaluation process will be continuous, rather than 'batched' into 5-year cycles. The goal of this continuous evidence review is to improve survival from cardiac arrest by shortening the time between resuscitation science discoveries and their application in resuscitation practice. As additional resuscitation topics are prioritized and reviewed, these Guidelines may be updated again. When the evidence supports sufficient changes to the Guidelines or a change in sequence or treatments that must be woven throughout the Guidelines, then the Guidelines will be revised completely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because the 2015 AHA Guidelines Update for CPR and ECC represents  the  first  update  to  the  previous  Guidelines, recommendations  from  both  this  2015  Guidelines  Update and the 2010 Guidelines are contained in the Appendix. If the 2015 ILCOR review resulted in a new or significantly revised Guidelines  recommendation,  that  recommendation  will  be labeled as New or Updated .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with all AHA Guidelines, each 2015 recommendation is labeled with a Class of Recommendation (COR) and a Level of Evidence (LOE). This update uses the newest AHA COR and LOE classification system, which contains modifications of the Class III recommendation and introduces LOE B-R (randomized studies) and B-NR (nonrandomized studies) as well as LOE C-LD (limited data) and LOE C-EO (consensus of expert opinion).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
These PALS recommendations are informed by the rigorous systematic review and consensus recommendations of the ILCOR Pediatric Task Force, and readers are referred to the complete consensus document in the 2015 CoSTR. 12,13  In the online version of this document, live links are provided so the reader can connect directly to the systematic reviews on the SEERS website. These links are indicated by a superscript combination of letters and numbers (eg, Peds 397).

Medical emergency team or rapid response team activation by caregivers or parents ideally occurs as a response to changes noted  in  a  patient's  condition  and  may  prevent  cardiac  or respiratory  arrest.  Several  variables,  including  the  composition of the team, the type of patient, the hospital setting, and the confounder of a wider 'system benefit,' further complicate objective analyses.

Fluid Resuscitation in Septic Shock Peds 545

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This update regarding intravenous fluid resuscitation in infants and children in septic shock in all settings addressed 2 specific therapeutic elements: (1) Withholding the use of bolus fluids was compared with the use of bolus fluids, and (2) noncrystalloid was compared with crystalloid fluids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  and  rapid  administration  of  intravenous  fluid  to reverse  decompensated  shock,  and  to  prevent  progression from compensated to decompensated shock, has been widely accepted based on limited observational studies. 23  Mortality from  pediatric  sepsis  has  declined  in  recent  years,  during which guidelines and publications have emphasized the role of early rapid fluid administration (along with early antibiotic and vasopressor therapy, and careful cardiovascular monitoring) in treating septic shock. 24,25  Since the 2010 Guidelines, a large randomized controlled trial of fluid resuscitation in pediatric severe febrile illness in a resource-limited setting found intravenous fluid boluses to be harmful. 26  This new information, contradicting long-held beliefs and practices, prompted careful  analysis  of  the  effect  of  fluid  resuscitation  on  many outcomes in specific infectious illnesses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Specific infection-related shock states appear to behave differently with respect to fluid bolus therapy. Evidence was not considered to be specific to a particular setting, after determining that 'resource-limited setting' is difficult to define and can vary greatly even within individual health systems and small geographic regions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  evidence  regarding  the  impact  of  restricting  fluid boluses during resuscitation on outcomes in pediatric septic shock is summarized in Figure 1. There were no studies for many  specific  combinations  of  presenting  illness  and  outcome. In the  majority  of  scenarios,  there  was  no  benefit  to restricting fluid boluses during resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  most  important  exception  is  that  in  1  large  study, restriction of fluid boluses conveyed a benefit for survival to both 48 hours and 4 weeks after presentation. This study was conducted in sub-Saharan Africa, and inclusion criteria were severe febrile illness complicated by impaired consciousness (prostration or coma), respiratory distress (increased work of breathing), or both, and with impaired perfusion, as evidenced by 1 or more of the following: a capillary refill time of 3 or more seconds, lower limb temperature gradient, weak radialpulse volume, or severe tachycardia. In this study, administration of 20 mL/kg or 40 mL/kg in the first hour was associated with decreased survival compared with the use of maintenance fluids alone. 26 Therefore, it appears that in this specific patient population, where critical care resources including inotropic and  mechanical  ventilator  support  were  limited,  bolus  fluid therapy resulted in higher mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The use of noncrystalloid fluid was compared with crystalloid fluid for the same diseases and outcomes listed in the preceding paragraph. 26-32  Evidence is summarized in Figure 2. In most scenarios, there was no benefit to noncrystalloids over crystalloids. In patients with Dengue shock, a benefit was conferred in using noncrystalloid compared with crystalloid fluid for the outcome of time to resolution of shock. 31

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendations-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration  of  an  initial  fluid  bolus  of  20  mL/kg  to infants  and  children  with  shock  is  reasonable,  including those with conditions such as severe sepsis (Class IIa, LOE C-LD), severe malaria and Dengue (Class IIb, LOE B-R). When caring for children with severe febrile illness (such as  those  included  in  the  FEAST  trial 26 )  in  settings  with limited  access  to  critical  care  resources  (ie,  mechanical ventilation and inotropic support), administration of bolus intravenous  fluids  should  be  undertaken  with  extreme caution because it may be harmful (Class IIb, LOE B-R). Providers  should  reassess  the  patient  after  every  fluid bolus (Class I, LOE C-EO).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Either isotonic crystalloids or colloids can be effective as the initial fluid choice for resuscitation (Class IIa, LOE B-R).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This recommendation takes into consideration the important work of Maitland et al, 26 which found that fluid boluses as part of resuscitation are not safe for all patients in all settings. This

study showed that the use of fluid boluses as part of resuscitation increased mortality in a specific population in a resource-limited setting, without access to some critical care interventions such as mechanical ventilation and inotrope support.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The spirit of this recommendation is a continued emphasis  on  fluid  resuscitation  for  both  compensated  (detected  by physical examination) and decompensated (hypotensive) septic  shock.  Moreover,  emphasis  is  also  placed  on  the  use  of individualized patient  evaluation  before  the  administration  of intravenous  fluid  boluses,  including  physical  examination  by a clinician and frequent reassessment to determine the appropriate volume of fluid resuscitation. The clinician should also integrate clinical signs with patient and locality-specific information about prevalent diseases, vulnerabilities (such as severe anemia and malnutrition), and available critical care resources.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atropine for Premedication During Emergency Intubation Peds 821

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia commonly occurs during emergency pediatric intubation, resulting from hypoxia/ischemia, as a vagal response to laryngoscopy, as a reflex response to positive pressure ventilation, or as a pharmacologic effect of some drugs (eg, succinylcholine or fentanyl). Practitioners have often tried to blunt this bradycardia with prophylactic premedication with atropine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The evidence regarding the use of atropine during emergency intubation has largely been observational, including extrapolation from experience with elective intubation in the operating suite.  More  recent  in-hospital  literature  involves  larger  case series of critically ill neonates, infants, and children undergoing emergency intubation. 33-35

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  is  no  evidence  that  preintubation  use  of  atropine improves  survival  or  prevents  cardiac  arrest  in  infants  and children. Observational data suggest that it increases the likelihood of survival to ICU discharge in children older than 28

<!-- PAGE=? -->
days. 33 Evidence  is  conflicting  as  to  whether  preintubation atropine administration reduces the incidence of arrhythmias or postintubation shock. 34,35

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In past Guidelines, a minimum atropine dose of 0.1 mg IV was recommended after a report of paradoxical bradycardia observed in very small infants who received very low atropine doses. 36 However, in 2 of the most recent case series cited above, preintubation doses of 0.02 mg/kg, with no minimum dose, were shown to be effective. 33,34

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendations-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The available evidence does not support the routine use of atropine preintubation of critically ill infants and children. It may be reasonable for practitioners to use atropine as a premedication in specific emergency intubations when there is higher risk of bradycardia (eg, when giving succinylcholine as a neuromuscular blocker to facilitate intubation) (Class IIb, LOE C-LD). A dose of 0.02 mg/kg of atropine with no minimum dose may be considered when atropine is used as a premedication for emergency intubation (Class IIb, LOE C-LD). This new recommendation applies only to the use of atropine as a premedication for infants and children during emergency intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prearrest Care of Infants and Children With Dilated Cardiomyopathy or Myocarditis Peds 819

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimal  care  of  a  critically  ill  infant  or  child  with  dilated cardiomyopathy  or  myocarditis  should  avert  cardiac  arrest. While  significant  global  experience  exists  with  the  care  of these patients, the evidence base is limited. The ILCOR systematic  review  ultimately  restricted  its  analysis  to  patients with  myocarditis  and  did  not  include  the  use  of  ventricular assist devices.

and  children  with  dilated  cardiomyopathy  or  myocarditis. Limited observational data support the pre-cardiac arrest use of ECMO in children with acute fulminant myocarditis. 37

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venoarterial ECMO use may be considered in patients with acute fulminant myocarditis who are at high risk of imminent cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE C-EO). Optimal outcomes from ECMO are achieved in settings with existing ECMO protocols, expertise, and equipment.

Intra-arrest Care Updates

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extracorporeal CPR for In-Hospital Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Peds 407

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The 2010 AHA PALS Guidelines suggested the use of ECMO when  dealing  with  pediatric  cardiac  arrest  refractory  to conventional  interventions  and  when  managing  a  reversible underlying disease process. Pediatric OHCA was not considered for the 2015 ILCOR systematic review.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evidence from 4 observational studies of pediatric IHCA has shown no overall benefit to the use of CPR with ECMO (ECPR) compared to CPR without ECMO. 38-41  Observational data from a registry of pediatric IHCA showed improved survival to hospital discharge with the use of ECPR in patients with surgical cardiac diagnoses. 42 For children with underlying cardiac disease, when ECPR is initiated in a critical care setting, long-term survival has been reported even after more than 50 minutes of conventional CPR. 43  When ECPR is used during cardiac arrest, the outcome for children with underlying cardiac disease is better than for those with noncardiac disease. 44

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECPR may be considered for pediatric patients with cardiac  diagnoses  who  have  IHCA  in  settings  with  existing ECMO  protocols,  expertise,  and  equipment  (Class  IIb, LOE C-LD).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
End-Tidal CO 2 Monitoring to Guide CPR Quality Peds 827

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High-quality  CPR  is  associated  with  improved  outcomes after cardiac arrest. Animal data support a direct association between ETCO 2 and cardiac output. Capnography is used during pediatric cardiac arrest to monitor for ROSC as well as CPR quality. The 2010 Guidelines recommended that if the partial pressure of ETCO 2 is consistently less than 15 mm Hg, efforts  should focus on improving CPR quality, particularly improving  chest  compressions  and  ensuring  that  the  victim does not receive excessive ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  is no pediatric evidence that  ETCO 2 monitoring improves outcomes from cardiac arrest. One pediatric animal study showed that ETCO 2 -guided chest compressions are as effective as standard chest compressions optimized by marker, video,  and  verbal  feedback  for  achieving  ROSC. 45  A recent study  in  adults  found  that  ETCO 2 values  generated  during CPR  were  significantly  associated  with  chest  compression depth and ventilation rate. 46

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ETCO 2 monitoring may be considered to evaluate the quality of chest compressions, but specific values to guide therapy have not been established in children (Class IIb, LOE C-LD).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intra-arrest Prognostic Factors for Cardiac Arrest Peds 814

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accurate and reliable prognostication during pediatric cardiac arrest would allow termination of CPR in patients where CPR is futile, while encouraging continued CPR in patients with a potential for good recovery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  infants  and  children  with  OHCA,  age  less  than  1 year, 5,47 longer  durations  of  cardiac  arrest 48-50 and  presentation with a nonshockable as opposed to a shockable rhythm 5,47,49  are all predictors of poor patient outcome. For infants  and  children  with  IHCA,  negative  predictive  factors include age greater than 1 year 3  and longer durations of cardiac arrest. 3,51-53   The evidence is contradictory as to whether a nonshockable (as opposed to shockable) initial cardiac arrest rhythm is a negative predictive factor in the in-hospital setting. 3,54,55

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multiple variables should be used when attempting to prognosticate  outcomes  during  cardiac  arrest  (Class  I,  LOE C-LD). Although there are factors associated with better or worse outcomes, no single factor studied predicts outcome with sufficient accuracy to recommend termination or continuation of CPR.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive Hemodynamic Monitoring During CPR Peds 826

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children often have cardiac arrests in settings where invasive  hemodynamic monitoring already exists or is rapidly obtained.  If  a  patient  has  an  indwelling  arterial  catheter, the  waveform  can  be  used  as  feedback  to  evaluate  chest compressions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adjusting chest compression technique to a specific systolic blood  pressure  target  has  not  been  studied  in  humans.  Two randomized controlled animal studies showed increased likelihood  of  ROSC  and  survival  to  completion  of  experiment with the use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring. 56,57

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with invasive hemodynamic monitoring in place at the time of cardiac arrest, it may be reasonable for rescuers to use blood pressure to guide CPR quality (Class IIb, LOE C-EO). Specific target values for blood pressure during CPR have not been established in children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasopressors During Cardiac Arrest Peds 424

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During cardiac arrest, vasopressors are used to restore spontaneous circulation by optimizing coronary perfusion and to help  maintain  cerebral  perfusion.  However,  they  also  cause intense vasoconstriction and increase myocardial oxygen consumption, which might be detrimental.

2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are no pediatric studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of any vasopressors (epinephrine, or combination of vasopressors)  in  cardiac  arrest.  Two  pediatric  observational  out-ofhospital  studies 58,59 had  too  many  confounders  to  determine if vasopressors were beneficial. One adult OHCA randomized controlled trial 60  showed epinephrine use was associated with increased  ROSC  and  survival  to  hospital  admission  but  no improvement in survival to hospital discharge.

It is reasonable to administer epinephrine in pediatric cardiac arrest (Class IIa, LOE C-LD).

Amiodarone and Lidocaine for Shock-Refractory VF and pVT Peds 825

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The 2005 and 2010 Guidelines recommended administering amiodarone in preference to lidocaine for the management of VF or pVT. This recommendation was based predominantly on pediatric case series or extrapolation from adult studies that used short-term outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
New pediatric observational data 61  showed improved ROSC with the use of lidocaine as compared with amiodarone. Use of  lidocaine  compared  with  no  lidocaine  was  significantly associated with an increased likelihood of ROSC. The same study did not show an association between lidocaine or amiodarone use and survival to hospital discharge.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For shock-refractory VF or pVT, either amiodarone or lidocaine may be used (Class IIb, LOE C-LD).

The Pediatric Cardiac Arrest Algorithm (Figure 3) reflects this change.

Energy Doses for Defibrillation Peds 405

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  2015  ILCOR  systematic  review  addressed  the  dose  of energy  for  pediatric  manual  defibrillation  during  cardiac arrest.  Neither  the  energy  dose  specifically  related  to  automated external defibrillators, nor the energy dose for cardioversion was evaluated in this evidence review.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two small case series demonstrated termination of VF/pVT with either 2 J/kg 62 or 2 to 4 J/kg. 63 In 1 observational study of IHCA, 64  a higher initial energy dose of more than 3 to 5 J/kg was less effective than 1 to 3 J/kg in achieving ROSC. One small observational  study  of  IHCA 65   showed  no  benefit in achieving ROSC with a specific energy dose for initial defibrillation. Three small observational studies of IHCA and OHCA 63,65,66  showed no survival to discharge advantage of any energy dose compared with 2 to 4 J/kg for initial defibrillation.

It is reasonable to use an initial dose of 2 to 4 J/kg of monophasic or biphasic energy for defibrillation (Class IIa, LOE C-LD), but for ease of teaching, an initial dose of 2 J/kg may be considered (Class IIb, LOE C-EO). For refractory VF, it is reasonable to increase the dose to 4 J/kg (Class IIa, LOE C-LD). For subsequent energy levels, a dose of 4 J/kg may be reasonable and higher energy levels may be considered, though not to exceed 10 J/kg or the adult maximum dose (Class IIb, LOE C-LD).

Management Peds 387

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Data suggest that fever after pediatric cardiac arrest is common and is associated with poor outcomes. 67  The 2010 AHA PALS Guidelines  suggested  a  role  for  targeted  temperature management after pediatric cardiac arrest (fever control for all patients, therapeutic hypothermia for some patients), but the recommendations were based predominantly on extrapolation from adult and asphyxiated newborn data.

2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  large  multi-institutional,  prospective,  randomized  study of  pediatric  patients  (aged  2  days  to  18  years)  with  OHCA found no difference in survival with good functional outcome at 1 year and no additional complications in comatose patients who  were  treated  with  therapeutic  hypothermia  (32°C  to 34°C), compared to those treated with normothermia (36°C to 37.5°C). 68 Observational data of pediatric patients resuscitated from IHCA or OHCA 69,70  have also shown that ICU duration of  stay,  neurologic  outcomes,  and  mortality  are  unchanged with the use of therapeutic hypothermia. Only 1 small study of therapeutic hypothermia in survivors of pediatric asphyxial cardiac arrest 71  showed an improvement in mortality at hospital discharge, but with no difference in neurologic outcomes. Results are pending from a large multicenter randomized controlled trial  of  targeted temperature management for pediatric  patients  with IHCA (see Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest website: www.THAPCA.org).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendations-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  infants  and  children  remaining  comatose  after  OHCA, it is reasonable either to maintain 5 days of continuous normothermia (36°C to 37.5°C) or to maintain 2 days of initial continuous hypothermia (32°C to 34°C) followed by 3 days of continuous normothermia (Class IIa, LOE B-R). Continuous measurement of temperature during this time period is recommended (Class I, LOE B-NR).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For infants and children remaining comatose after IHCA, there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  recommend  cooling  over normothermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fever (temperature 38°C or higher) should be aggressively treated after ROSC (Class I, LOE B-NR).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Post-Cardiac Arrest Oxygenation Peds 544

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Animal studies suggest that elevated levels of tissue P o 2 after ROSC  (hyperoxia)  contribute  to  oxidative  stress  that  may potentiate the postresuscitation syndrome, while some adult studies show associations between hyperoxemia and increased mortality. 72,73

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Three  small  observational  studies  of  pediatric  IHCA  and OHCA  survivors 74-76   did  not  show  an  association  between elevated  Pa o 2 and  outcome.  In  a  larger  observational  study of 1427 pediatric IHCA and OHCA victims who survived to

pediatric  ICU  admission, 77 after  adjustment  of  confounders, the presence of normoxemia (defined as a Pa o 2 60 mm Hg or greater and less than 300 mm Hg) when compared with hyperoxemia (Pa o 2 greater than 300 mm Hg) after ROSC was associated with improved survival to pediatric ICU discharge.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendations-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It may be reasonable for rescuers to target normoxemia after ROSC (Class  IIb,  LOE  B-NR).  Because  an  arterial  oxyhemoglobin saturation of 100% may correspond to a Pa o 2 anywhere between 80 and approximately 500 mm Hg, it may be reasonable-when the necessary equipment is available-for rescuers to wean oxygen to target an oxyhemoglobin saturation of less than 100%, but 94% or greater. The goal of such an  approach  is  to  achieve  normoxemia  while  ensuring  that hypoxemia is strictly avoided. Ideally, oxygen is titrated to a value appropriate to the specific patient condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Post-Cardiac Arrest Pa co 2 Peds 815

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral  vascular  autoregulation  may  be  abnormal  after ROSC. Adult data show an association between post-ROSC hypocapnia and worse patient outcomes. 78,79  In other types of pediatric  brain  injury,  hypocapnia  is  associated  with  worse clinical outcomes. 80-83

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There were no studies in children after cardiac arrest specifically comparing ventilation with a predetermined Pa co 2 target. One  small  observational  study  of  both  pediatric  IHCA  and OHCA 74   demonstrated  no  association  between  hypercapnia

(Pa co 2 greater than 50 mm Hg) or hypocapnia (Pa co 2 less than 30 mm Hg) and outcome. However, in an observational study of pediatric IHCA, 76  hypercapnia (Pa co 2 50 mm Hg or greater) was associated with worse survival to hospital discharge.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is reasonable for practitioners to target a Pa co 2 after ROSC that is appropriate to the specific patient condition, and limit exposure  to  severe  hypercapnia  or  hypocapnia  (Class  IIb, LOE C-LD).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Post-Cardiac Arrest Fluids and Inotropes Peds 820

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial dysfunction and vascular instability are common after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. 84-90

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Three small observational studies involving pediatric IHCA and OHCA 91-93  demonstrated worse survival to hospital discharge when children were exposed to post-ROSC hypotension. One of these studies 91  associated post-ROSC hypotension (defined as a systolic blood pressure less than fifth percentile for age) after IHCA with lower likelihood of survival to discharge with favorable neurologic outcome. There are no studies  evaluating  the  benefit  of  specific  vasoactive  agents  after ROSC in infants and children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendations-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
After ROSC, we recommend that parenteral fluids and/or inotropes or vasoactive drugs be used to maintain a systolic blood pressure  greater  than  fifth  percentile  for  age  (Class  I,  LOE C-LD). When appropriate resources are available, continuous arterial pressure monitoring is recommended to identify and treat hypotension (Class I, LOE C-EO).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postresuscitation Use of EEG for Prognosis Peds 822

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  and  reliable  prognostication  of  neurologic  outcome in pediatric survivors of cardiac arrest is essential to enable effective planning and family support (whether it be to continue or discontinue life-sustaining therapy).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Observational data from 2 small pediatric studies 94,95  showed that a continuous and reactive tracing on an EEG performed in the first 7 days after cardiac arrest was associated with a significantly  higher  likelihood  of  good  neurologic  outcome at hospital discharge, while an EEG demonstrating a discontinuous  or  isoelectric  tracing  was  associated  with  a  poorer neurologic outcome at hospital discharge. There are no data correlating EEG findings with neurologic outcome after hospital discharge.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EEGs performed within the first 7 days after pediatric cardiac arrest may be considered in prognosticating neurologic outcome at the time of hospital discharge (Class IIb, LOE C-LD) but should not be used as the sole criterion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Predictive Factors After Cardiac Arrest Peds 813

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  post-ROSC  factors  have  been  studied  as  possible predictors  of  survival  and  neurologic  outcome  after  pediatric  cardiac  arrest.  These  include  pupillary  responses,  the presence of hypotension, serum neurologic biomarkers, and serum lactate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Evidence Summary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Four observational studies supported the use of pupillary reactivity at 12 to 24 hours after cardiac arrest in predicting survival to discharge, 49,53,95,96   while 1 observational study found that reactive pupils 24 hours after cardiac arrest were associated with improved survival at 180 days with favorable neurologic outcome. 97

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several serum biomarkers of neurologic injury have been considered for their prognostic value. Two small observational studies found that lower neuron-specific enolase and S100B serum levels after arrest were associated with improved survival to hospital discharge and with improved survival with favorable neurologic outcome. 97,98

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One observational  study  found  that  children  with  lower lactate levels in the first 12 hours after arrest had an improved survival to hospital discharge. 99

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2015 Recommendation-New

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The reliability of any 1 variable for prognostication in children after cardiac arrest has not been established. Practitioners should consider multiple factors when predicting outcomes in infants and children who achieve ROSC after cardiac arrest (Class I, LOE C-LD).

|------|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | Pediatric medical emergency team/rapid response team systems may be considered in facilities where children with high-risk illnesses are cared for on general in-patient units (Class IIb, LOE C-LD). | updated for 2015     |
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | The use of PEWS may be considered, but its effectiveness in the in-hospital setting is not well established (Class IIb, LOE C-LD).                                                                                               | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | Administration of an initial fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg to infants and children with shock is reasonable, including those with conditions such as severe sepsis (Class IIa, LOE C-LD), malaria and Dengue (Class IIb, LOE B-R). | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | When caring for children with severe febrile illness (such as those included in the FEAST trial), in settings with limited access to critical care resources (ie mechanical ventilation and inotropic support), administration of bolus intravenous fluids should be undertaken with extreme caution because it may be harmful (Class IIb, LOE B-R). | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | Providers should reassess the patient after every fluid bolus (Class I, LOE C-EO).                                                                                                                                               | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | Either isotonic crystalloids or colloids can be effective as the initial fluid choice for resuscitation (Class IIa, LOE B-R).                                                                                                     | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | The available evidence does not support the routine use of atropine preintubation of critically ill infants and children. It may be reasonable for practitioners to use atropine as a premedication in specific emergent intubations when there is higher risk of bradycardia (eg, when giving succinylcholine as a neuromuscular blocker to facilitate intubation) (Class IIb, LOE C-LD). | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | A dose of 0.02 mg/kg of atropine with no minimum dose may be considered when atropine is used as a premedication for emergency intubation (Class IIb, LOE C-LD).                                                                    | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Prearrest Care Updates | Venoarterial ECMO use may be considered in patients with acute fulminant myocarditis who are at high risk of imminent cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE C-EO).                                                                         | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Intra-arrest Care Updates | ECPR may be considered for pediatric patients with cardiac diagnoses who have IHCA in settings with existing ECMO protocols, expertise, and equipment (Class IIb, LOE C-LD).                                                        | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Intra-arrest Care Updates | ETCO 2 monitoring may be considered to evaluate the quality of chest compressions, but specific values to guide therapy have not been established in children (Class IIb, LOE C-LD).                                               | new for 2015       |
| 2015 | Intra-arrest Care Updates | Multiple variables should be used when attempting to prognosticate outcomes during cardiac arrest (Class I, LOE C-LD).                                                                                                          | new for 2015       |

| 2010               | Cuffed Versus Uncuffed Endotracheal Tubes    | Both cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes are acceptable for intubating infants and children (Class IIa, LOE C).                                                                                          | not reviewed in 2015         |
| 2010               | Cuffed Versus Uncuffed Endotracheal Tubes    | In certain circumstances (eg, poor lung compliance, high airway resistance, or a large glottic air leak) a cuffed endotracheal tube may be preferable to an uncuffed tube, provided that attention is paid to endotracheal tube size, position, and cuff inflation pressure (Class IIa, LOE B). | not reviewed in 2015         |
| 2010               | Endotracheal Tube Size                        | For children between 1 and 2 years of age, it is reasonable to use a cuffed endotracheal tube with an internal diameter of 3.5 mm (Class IIa, LOE B).                                                         | not reviewed in 2015         |
| 2010               | Endotracheal Tube Size                        | After age 2 it is reasonable to estimate tube size with the following formula (Class IIa, LOE B): Cuffed endotracheal tube ID (mm) 3.5+ (age/4).                                                            | not reviewed in 2015         |
| 2010               | Esophageal Detector Device (EDD)              | If capnography is not available, an esophageal detector device (EDD) may be considered to confirm endotracheal tube placement in children weighing >20 kg with a perfusing rhythm (Class IIb, LOE B), but the data are insufficient to make a recommendation for or against its use in children during cardiac arrest. | not reviewed in 2015         |

| 2010               | Echocardiography                              | When appropriately trained personnel are available, echocardiography may be considered to identify patients with potentially treatable causes of the arrest, particularly pericardial tamponade and inadequate ventricular filling (Class IIb, LOE C). | not reviewed in 2015         |
| 2010               | Intraosseous (IO) Access                     | IO access is a rapid, safe, effective, and acceptable route for vascular access in children, and it is useful as the initial vascular access in cases of cardiac arrest (Class I, LOE C).                      | not reviewed in 2015         |
| 2010               | Medication Dose Calculation                   | If the child's weight is unknown, it is reasonable to use a body length tape with precalculated doses (Class IIa, LOE C).                                                                                     | not reviewed in 2015         |

| 2010               | Bradycardia                    | Emergency transcutaneous pacing may be lifesaving if the bradycardia is due to complete heart block or sinus node dysfunction unresponsive to ventilation, oxygenation, chest compressions, and medications, especially if it is associated with congenital or acquired heart disease (Class IIb, LOE C). | not reviewed in 2015   |
| 2010               | Supraventricular Tachycardia   | Attempt vagal stimulation first, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or the procedure will unduly delay chemical or electric cardioversion (Class IIa, LOE C).                                                                              | not reviewed in 2015   |
| 2010               | Supraventricular Tachycardia   | An IV/IO dose of verapamil, 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg is also effective in terminating SVT in older children, but it should not be used in infants without expert consultation (Class III, LOE C) because it may cause potential myocardial depression, hypotension, and cardiac arrest. | not reviewed in 2015   |
