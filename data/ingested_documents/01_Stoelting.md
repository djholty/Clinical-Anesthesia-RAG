Th e prevalence of vascular disease and ischemic heart disease in  the  United  States  increases  signi fi cantly  with  age  (Figure 1-1).  By  some  estimates  30%  of  patients  who  undergo  surgery  annually  in  the  United  States  have  ischemic  heart  disease. Angina pectoris, acute MI, and sudden death are o ft en the fi rst manifestations of ischemic heart disease, and cardiac dysrhythmias are probably the major cause of sudden death in these patients. Th e two most important risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis involving the coronary arteries are male gender and increasing age (Table 1-1). Additional risk factors include hypercholesterolemia, systemic hypertension,  cigarette  smoking,  diabetes  mellitus,  obesity,  a  sedentary lifestyle, and a family history of premature development of ischemic heart disease. Psychologic factors such as type A personality and stress have also been implicated. Patients with ischemic heart disease can have chronic stable angina or acute coronary syndrome at presentation. Th e latter includes ST elevation  myocardial  infarction  (STEMI)  and  unstable  angina/ non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI).

STABLE MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA (ANGINA PECTORIS)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e coronary  artery circulation normally  supplies  su ffi -cient  blood fl ow  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  myocardium in  response  to  widely  varying  workloads.  An  imbalance between coronary blood fl ow (supply) and myocardial oxygen consumption (demand) can precipitate ischemia, which frequently  manifests  as  angina  pectoris.  Stable  angina  typically develops in the setting of partial occlusion or signi fi cant

(>70%) chronic narrowing of a segment of coronary artery. When the imbalance becomes extreme, congestive heart failure,  electrical  instability  with  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  and  MI may  result.  Angina  pectoris  re fl ects  intracardiac  release  of adenosine, bradykinin, and other substances during ischemia. Th ese  substances  stimulate  cardiac  nociceptive  and  mechanosensitive receptors, whose a ff erent neurons converge with the upper fi ve thoracic sympathetic ganglia and somatic nerve fi bers in the spinal cord, and ultimately produce thalamic and cortical  stimulation  that  results  in  the  typical  chest  pain  of angina  pectoris. Th ese  substances  also  slow  atrioventricular nodal  conduction  and  decrease  cardiac  contractility,  which improves  the  balance  between  myocardial  oxygen  demand and  supply.  Atherosclerosis  is  the  most  common  cause  of impaired coronary blood fl ow resulting in angina pectoris.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angina  pectoris  is  typically  described  as  retrosternal  chest discomfort, pain, pressure, or heaviness. Th e chest discomfort o ft en radiates to the neck, le ft shoulder, le ft arm, or jaw and occasionally to the back or down both arms. Angina may also

<!-- PAGE=? -->
be perceived as epigastric discomfort resembling indigestion. Some patients describe angina as shortness of breath, mistaking a sense of chest constriction as dyspnea. Th e need to take a deep breath, rather than to breathe rapidly, o ft en identi fi es shortness of breath as an anginal equivalent. Angina pectoris usually lasts several minutes and is crescendo-decrescendo in nature. A sharp pain that lasts only a few seconds or a dull ache that lasts for hours is rarely caused by myocardial ischemia. Physical exertion, emotional tension, and cold weather may induce  angina.  Rest  and/or  nitroglycerin  relieve  it. Chronic stable angina refers to chest pain or discomfort that does not change appreciably in frequency or severity over 2 months or longer. Unstable  angina, by  contrast,  is  de fi ned as  angina  at rest, angina of new onset, or an increase in the severity or frequency of previously stable angina without an increase in levels of cardiac biomarkers. Sharp retrosternal pain exacerbated by deep breathing, coughing, or change in body position suggests pericarditis. Th ere are many causes of noncardiac chest pain (Table 1-2). Noncardiac chest pain is o ft en exacerbated by  chest  wall  movement  and  is  associated  with  tenderness over the involved area, which is o ft en a costochondral junction.  Esophageal spasm can produce severe substernal pressure that may be confused with angina pectoris and may also be relieved by administration of nitroglycerin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During myocardial ischemia, the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  demonstrates  ST-segment  depression  (characteristic of subendocardial ischemia) that coincides in time with anginal chest pain. Th is  may  be  accompanied by transient symmetrical T-wave inversion. Patients with chronically inverted  T  waves  resulting  from  previous  MI  may  manifest  a  return  of  the  T  waves  to  the  normal  upright  position

<!-- PAGE=? -->
( pseudonormalization of the T wave) during myocardial ischemia. Th ese ECG changes are seen in 50% of patients. Variant angina, that  is,  angina  that  results  from coronary vasospasm rather than occlusive coronary artery disease, is  diagnosed by ST elevation during an episode of angina pectoris.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exercise  ECG is  useful  for  detecting  signs  of  myocardial ischemia  and  establishing  their  relationship  to  chest  pain. Th e  test  also  provides  information  about  exercise  capacity. Th e appearance of a new murmur of mitral regurgitation or a decrease in blood pressure during exercise adds to the diagnostic value of the test. Exercise testing is not always feasible, either because of the inability of a patient to exercise or the presence  of  conditions  that  interfere  with  interpretation  of the exercise ECG (paced rhythm, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, digitalis  administration,  or  preexcitation  syndrome).  Contraindications  to  exercise  stress  testing  include  severe  aortic stenosis, severe hypertension, acute myocarditis, uncontrolled heart failure, and infective endocarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e exercise ECG is most likely to indicate myocardial ischemia when there is at least 1 mm of horizontal or down-  sloping ST-segment depression during or within 4 minutes a ft er exercise. Th e  greater  the  degree  of  ST-segment  depression,  the greater is the likelihood of signi fi cant coronary artery disease. When the ST-segment abnormality is associated with angina pectoris  and  occurs  during  the  early  stages  of  exercise  and persists for several minutes a ft er exercise, signi fi cant coronary artery disease is very likely. Exercise ECG is less accurate but more cost e ff ective than imaging tests for detecting ischemic heart disease. A negative stress test result does not exclude the presence of coronary artery disease, but it makes the likelihood of  three-vessel  or  le ft main  coronary  disease  extremely  low. Exercise ECG is less sensitive and speci fi c in detecting ischemic heart disease than nuclear cardiology techniques (Table 1-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY TECHNIQUES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nuclear stress imaging is  useful for assessing coronary perfusion. It has greater sensitivity than exercise testing for detection of ischemic heart disease. It can de fi ne vascular regions in  which  stress-induced  coronary  blood fl ow is  limited  and can estimate le ft ventricular systolic size and function. Tracers such as thallium and technetium can be detected over the myocardium  by  single-photon  emission  computed  tomography  (SPECT)  techniques.  A  signi fi cant  coronary  obstructive lesion causes less blood fl ow and thus less tracer activity. Exercise  perfusion  imaging  with  simultaneous  ECG  testing is  superior  to  exercise  ECG  alone  (see  Table  1-3).  Exercise increases the di ff erence in tracer activity between normal and underperfused regions, because coronary blood fl ow increases markedly with exercise except in those regions distal to a coronary artery obstruction. Imaging is carried out in two phases: the fi rst  is  immediately  a ft er  cessation  of  exercise  to  detect regional  ischemia,  and  the  second  is  4  hours  later  to  detect reversible ischemia. Areas of persistently absent uptake signify an old MI. Th e size of the perfusion abnormality is the most important indicator of the signi fi cance of the coronary artery disease detected.

Many patients who are at increased risk of coronary events cannot  exercise  because  of  peripheral  vascular  or  musculoskeletal disease, deconditioning, dyspnea on exertion due to pulmonary disease, or prior stroke. Noninvasive imaging tests for the detection of ischemic heart disease are usually recommended when exercise ECG is not possible or interpretation of ST-segment changes would be di ffi cult. Administration of atropine,  infusion  of  dobutamine,  or  institution  of  arti fi cial cardiac  pacing  produces  a  rapid  heart  rate  to  create  cardiac stress. Alternatively, cardiac stress can be produced by administering  a  coronary  vasodilator  such  as  adenosine  or  dipyridamole. Th ese drugs dilate normal coronary arteries but evoke minimal or no change in the diameter of atherosclerotic coronary  arteries.  A ft er  cardiac  stress  is  induced  by  these  interventions, radionuclide tracer scanning is performed to assess myocardial perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiographic wall motion analysis can be performed immediately after stressing the heart either pharmacologically or with exercise. New ventricular wall motion abnormalities induced by stress correspond to sites of myocardial ischemia,  thereby  localizing  obstructive  coronary  lesions. In  contrast,  exercise  ECG  can  indicate  only  the presence of ischemic heart disease and does not reliably predict the location of  the  obstructive  coronary  lesion.  One  can  also visualize global wall motion under baseline conditions and under cardiac stress. Valvular function can be assessed as well. Limitations imposed by poor visualization have been improved by newer contrast-assisted technologies that have improved the accuracy of stress echocardiography.

CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coronary  angiography  provides  the  best  information  about the  condition  of  the  coronary  arteries.  It  is  indicated  in patients  with  known  or  possible  angina  pectoris  who  have survived sudden cardiac death, those who continue to have angina pectoris despite maximal medical therapy, and those who are being considered for coronary revascularization, as well  as  for  the  de fi nitive  diagnosis  of  coronary  disease  for occupational reasons (e.g., in airline pilots). Coronary angiography is also useful for establishing the diagnosis of nonatherosclerotic  coronary  artery  disease  such  as  coronary  artery spasm,  Kawasaki's  disease,  radiation-induced  vasculopathy, and primary coronary artery dissection. Among patients with chronic stable angina 25% will have signi fi cant single-, double-, or triple-vessel coronary artery disease, 5% to 10% will have le ft main coronary artery disease, and 15% will have no fl ow-limiting obstructions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  important  prognostic  determinants  in  patients  with coronary artery disease are the anatomic extent of the atherosclerotic disease, the state of le ft ventricular function (ejection fraction), and the stability of the coronary plaque. Le ft main coronary artery disease is the most dangerous anatomic lesion and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis when managed with medical therapy alone. Greater than 50% stenosis of the le ft main coronary artery is associated with a mortality rate of 15% per year.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unfortunately, coronary angiography cannot predict which plaques are most likely to rupture and initiate acute coronary syndromes. Vulnerable  plaques, that  is,  those  most  likely  to rupture and form an occlusive thrombus, have a thin fi brous cap and a large lipid core containing a large number of macrophages. Th e presence of vulnerable plaque predicts a greater risk of MI regardless of the degree of coronary artery stenosis. Indeed, acute MI most o ft en results from rupture of a plaque that had produced less than 50% stenosis of a coronary artery. Currently, there is no satisfactory test to measure the stability of plaques.

Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Comprehensive  management  of  ischemic  heart  disease  has fi ve aspects: (1) identi fi cation and treatment of diseases that can precipitate or worsen ischemia, (2) reduction of risk factors  for  coronary  artery  disease,  (3)  lifestyle  modi fi cation, (4) pharmacologic management of angina, and (5) revascularization by coronary artery bypass gra ft ing (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with or without placement of intracoronary stents. Th e goal of treatment of patients with chronic stale angina is to achieve complete or almost complete elimination of anginal chest pain and a return to normal activities with minimal side e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT OF ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conditions that increase oxygen demand or decrease oxygen delivery may contribute to an exacerbation of previously stable angina  or  worsen  existing  angina. Th ese  conditions  include fever, infection, anemia, tachycardia, thyrotoxicosis, heart failure, and cocaine use. Treatment of these conditions is critical to the management of stable ischemic heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REDUCTION OF RISK FACTORS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e progression of atherosclerosis may be slowed by cessation of smoking; maintenance of an ideal body weight by consumption of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet; regular aerobic exercise; and  treatment  of  hypertension.  Lowering  the  low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level by diet and/or drugs such as statins is associated with a substantial decrease in the risk of death due to cardiac events. Drug treatment is appropriate when the LDL cholesterol level exceeds 130 mg/dL. Th e goal of treatment is a decrease in LDL to less than 100 mg/dL. Patients with ischemic heart disease may bene fi t from even lower LDL levels (<70 mg/dL), which can be achieved by a combination of  diet  and  statin  therapy.  Hypertension  increases  the  risk of  coronary  events  as  a  result  of  direct  vascular  injury,  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy,  and  increased  myocardial  oxygen demand. Lowering the blood pressure from hypertensive levels to normal levels decreases the risk of MI, congestive heart failure,  and  stroke.  In  combination  with  lifestyle  modi fi cations, β -blockers, and calcium channel blockers are especially useful in managing hypertension in patients with angina pectoris.  If  le ft ventricular  dysfunction  accompanies  hypertension, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDICAL TREATMENT OF MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antiplatelet drugs, nitrates, β -blockers, calcium channel blockers,  and  ACE  inhibitors  are  used  in  the  medical  treatment of angina pectoris.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ree  classes  of antiplatelet  drugs are  widely  used  in  the management  of  ischemic  heart  disease:  aspirin,  thienopyridines  (clopidogrel  and  prasugrel),  and  platelet  glycoprotein IIb/IIIa  inhibitors  (epti fi batide,  tiro fi ban,  and  abciximab). A fourth class of antiplatelet drug, which a ff ects platelet cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dipyridamole), is not widely used. A new class of short-acting, reversible platelet inhibitors (cangrelor and ticagrelor) is currently under development.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspirin  inhibits  the  enzyme  cyclooxygenase-1  (COX-1); this  results  in  inhibition  of  thromboxane  A 2 ,  which  plays an  important  role  in  platelet  aggregation. Th is  inhibition  of COX-1 is irreversible, lasts for the duration of platelet life span (around 7 days), and can be produced by low dosages of aspirin. Low-dose aspirin therapy (75 to 325 mg/day) decreases the risk of cardiac events in patients with stable or unstable angina

pectoris  and  is  recommended  for  all  patients  with  is  chemic heart disease. Clopidogrel inhibits the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)  receptor  P2Y 12 and  inhibits  platelet  aggregation  in response to ADP release from activated platelets (Figure 1-2). Clopidogrel-induced inhibition of ADP receptors is irreversible and also lasts for the duration of the platelet's life span. Seven days a ft er  cessation  of  this  drug  80%  of  platelets  will have recovered normal aggregation function. Clopidogrel is a prodrug that is metabolized into an active compound in the liver. Due to genetic di ff erences in the enzymes that metabolize clopidogrel to the active drug, signi fi cant variability in its activity  has  been  observed.  By  some  estimates,  10%  to  20% of patients taking aspirin and clopidogrel demonstrate hyporesponsiveness  (resistance)  or hyper responsiveness.  Furthermore, some drugs, such as proton pump inhibitors, can a ff ect the  enzyme  that  metabolizes  clopidogrel  to  its  active  compound and thereby can reduce the e ff ectiveness of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel can be used in patients who have a contraindication to or are intolerant of aspirin. Prasugrel also inhibits the ADP P2Y12 receptor irreversibly. However, the pharmacokinetics of prasugrel are more predictable. It is rapidly absorbed, has a faster onset of action, and demonstrates less interindividual variability in platelet responses compared with clopidogrel. It also is more potent than clopidogrel, and a higher risk of bleeding has been associated with its use. Platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (abciximab, epti fi batide, tiro fi ban)  inhibit  platelet  adhesion,  activation,  and  aggregation.  Short-term  administration  of  antiplatelet  drugs  is  particularly useful a ft er placement of an intracoronary stent.

Organic nitrates decrease  the  frequency,  duration,  and severity of angina pectoris and increase the amount of exercise required to produce ST-segment depression. Th e antianginal e ff ects of nitrates are greater when used in combination with β -blockers or calcium channel blockers. Nitrates dilate coronary arteries and collateral blood vessels and thereby improve coronary  blood fl ow.  Nitrates  also  decrease  peripheral  vascular resistance, which reduces le ft ventricular a ft erload and myocardial  oxygen  consumption. Th e  venodilating  e ff ect of  nitrates  decreases  venous  return  and  hence  le ft ventricular  preload  and  myocardial  oxygen  consumption. Th ey  also have  potential  antithrombotic  e ff ects.  Nitrates  are  contraindicated  in  the  presence  of  hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  or

severe aortic stenosis and should not be used within 24 hours of sildena fi l, tadala fi l, or vardena fi l because this combination may produce severe hypotension. Administration of sublingual  nitroglycerin  by  tablet  or  spray  produces  prompt  relief of  angina  pectoris. Th e  most  common  side  e ff ect  of  nitrate treatment is  headache.  Hypotension  may  occur  a ft er  nitrate administration in hypovolemic patients. For long-term therapy, long-acting nitrate preparations (isosorbide, nitroglycerin ointment  or  patches)  are  equally  e ff ective. Th e  therapeutic value of organic nitrates is compromised by the development of tolerance. To avoid nitrate tolerance, a daily 8- to 12-hour interval free of nitrate exposure is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-acting  calcium  channel  blockers are  comparable  to β -blockers  in  relieving  anginal  pain.  However, short-acting calcium  channel  blockers  such  as  verapamil  and  diltiazem are  not.  Calcium  channel  blockers  are  uniquely  e ff ective  in decreasing the frequency and severity of angina pectoris due to  coronary  artery  spasm  ( Prinzmetal's or variant  angina ). Th ey are not as e ff ective as β -blockers in decreasing the incidence of myocardial reinfarction. Th e e ff ectiveness of calcium channel  blockers  is  due  to  their  ability  to  decrease  vascular smooth muscle tone, dilate coronary arteries, decrease myocardial  contractility  and  oxygen  consumption,  and  decrease systemic blood pressure. Many calcium channel blockers such as  amlodipine,  nicardipine,  isradipine,  felodipine,  and  longacting  nifedipine  are  potent  vasodilators  and  are  useful  in

β -Blockers are  the  principal  drug  treatment  for  patients with  stable  angina  pectoris. Th ey  have  antiischemic,  antihypertensive, and  antidysrhythmic  properties.  Long-term administration of β -blockers decreases the risk of death and myocardial  reinfarction  in  patients  who  have  had  an  MI, presumably by decreasing  myocardial  oxygen  demand. Th is bene fi t  is  present  even  in  patients  in  whom β -blockers were traditionally thought to be contraindicated, such as those with congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, or advanced age. Drug-induced blockade of β 1 -adrenergic receptors (atenolol, metoprolol, acebutolol, bisoprolol) results in heart rate slowing  and  decreased  myocardial  contractility  that  are  greater during activity than at rest. Th e result is a decrease in myocardial  oxygen  demand with a subsequent decrease in ischemic events during exertion. Th e  decrease in heart rate also increases the length of diastole and thereby coronary perfusion time. β 2 -Adrenergic blockers (propranolol, nadolol) can increase  the  risk  of  bronchospasm  in  patients  with  reactive airway disease. Despite di ff erences between β 1 and β 2 e ff ects, all β -blockers seem to be equally e ff ective in the treatment of angina pectoris. Th e most common side e ff ects of β -blocker therapy are fatigue and insomnia. Heart failure may be intensi fi ed. β -Blockers are contraindicated in the presence of severe bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, severe reactive airway disease,  second-  or  third-degree  atrioventricular  heart  block, and  uncontrolled  congestive  heart  failure.  Diabetes  mellitus is not a contraindication to β -blocker therapy, although these drugs may mask signs of hypoglycemia. Abrupt withdrawal of β -blockers  a ft er  prolonged  administration  can  worsen  ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina.

treating both hypertension and angina. Common side e ff ects of calcium channel blocker therapy are hypotension, peripheral edema, and headache. Calcium channel blockers are contraindicated in patients with severe congestive heart failure or severe aortic stenosis. Th ey must be used cautiously if given in combination with β -blockers, because both classes of drugs have signi fi cant depressant e ff ects on heart rate and myocardial contractility.

Excessive  angiotensin  II  plays  a  signi fi cant  role  in  the pathophysiology  of  cardiac  disorders.  It  can  lead  to  development  of  myocardial  hypertrophy,  interstitial  myocardial fi brosis,  increased  coronary  vasoconstriction,  and  endothelial  dysfunction. Angiotensin II also promotes in fl ammatory responses and atheroma formation. ACE inhibitors are important not only in the treatment of heart failure but also in the treatment of hypertension and in cardiovascular protection. ACE inhibitors are recommended for patients with coronary artery  disease,  especially  those  with  hypertension,  le ft ventricular dysfunction, or diabetes. Angiotensin receptor blockers o ff er similar bene fi ts. Contraindications to ACE inhibitor use include documented intolerance or allergy, hyperkalemia, bilateral renal artery stenosis, and renal failure.

Revascularization is  also indicated for speci fi c anatomic lesions-in particular, le ft main  coronary  artery  stenosis  of  more  than  50%  or  the presence of a 70% or greater stenosis in an epicardial coronary artery. Revascularization is also indicated in patients with signi fi cant coronary artery disease with evidence of impaired le ft ventricular contractility (ejection fraction of <40%). Th e presence of hypokinetic or akinetic areas in the le ft ventricle connotes a poor prognosis. Extensive myocardial fi brosis from a prior MI is unlikely to be improved by revascularization. However, some patients with ischemic heart disease have chronically impaired myocardial function ( hibernating myocardium ) that demonstrates improvement in contractility following surgical revascularization. In patients with stable angina pectoris and one- or two-vessel coronary artery disease, a percutaneous intervention with or without stent placement, or surgical coronary artery bypass may be used for revascularization. CABG is preferred over PCI in patients with signi fi cant le ft main artery disease, those with three-vessel coronary artery obstruction, and patients with diabetes who have two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease. Operative mortality rates for CABG surgery currently range from 1.5% to 2%.

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute coronary syndrome represents a hypercoagulable state. Focal  disruption  of  an  atheromatous  plaque  triggers  the coagulation  cascade  with  subsequent  generation  of  thrombin and partial or complete occlusion of the coronary artery by a thrombus. Imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and

demand leads to ischemic chest pain. Patients who have ischemic chest pain can be categorized based on the fi ndings of a 12-lead  ECG. Patients  with  ST  elevation  at  presentation  are considered  to  have  STEMI.  Patients  who  have  ST-segment depression or nonspeci fi c changes on the ECG can be categorized based on the levels of cardiac-speci fi c troponins or myocardial creatine kinase (CK-MB). Elevation of cardiac-speci fi c biomarker levels in this situation indicates NSTEMI. If levels of cardiac-speci fi c biomarkers are normal, then unstable angina is present (Figure 1-3). STEMI and UA/NSTEMI are treated di ff erently and have di ff erent prognoses. Many more patients have UA/NSTEMI than have STEMI at presentation. Th e different kinds of MI o ft en occur in di ff erent clinical situations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mortality  rates  from  STEMI  have  declined  steadily  because of early therapeutic interventions such as angioplasty, thrombolysis and aspirin, heparin, and statin therapy. However, the mortality rate of acute MI remains signi fi cant. Th e short-term mortality rate of patients with STEMI who receive aggressive reperfusion therapy is about 6.5%. Data from the general medical  community show a mortality rate of 15% to 20% (these patients  have  not  received  reperfusion  therapy).  Advanced age consistently emerges as one of the principal determinants of early mortality in patients with STEMI. Coronary angiography has documented that nearly all STEMIs are caused by thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e long-term prognosis a ft er an acute MI is determined principally by the severity of residual le ft ventricular dysfunction,  the  presence  and  degree  of  residual  ischemia,  and  the presence of malignant ventricular dysrhythmias. Most deaths that occur during the fi rst  year  a ft er  hospital  discharge take place within the fi rst  3  months. Ventricular function can be substantially  improved  during  the fi rst  few  weeks  a ft er  an acute MI, particularly in patients in whom early reperfusion was achieved. Th erefore, measurement of ventricular function 2 to 3 months a ft er an MI is a more accurate predictor of longterm  prognosis  than  measurement  of  ventricular  function during the acute phase of the infarction.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atherosclerosis is being increasingly recognized as an in fl ammatory disease. Th e presence of in fl ammatory cells in atherosclerotic  plaques suggests that in fl ammation is important in the cascade of events leading to plaque rupture. Indeed, serum markers  of  in fl ammation,  such  as  C-reactive  protein  and fi brinogen, are increased in those at greatest risk of developing coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STEMI  occurs when coronary blood fl ow decreases abruptly. Th is  decrease in blood fl ow is attributable to acute thrombus formation at a site when an atherosclerotic plaque fi ssures, ruptures, or ulcerates. Th is creates a local environment that  favors  thrombogenesis.  Typically,  vulnerable  plaquesthat is, those with rich lipid cores and thin fi brous caps-are most prone to rupture. A platelet monolayer forms at the site

of ruptured plaque, and various chemical mediators such as collagen, ADP, epinephrine, and serotonin stimulate platelet aggregation. Th e  potent  vasoconstrictor  thromboxane  A 2 is released,  which  further  compromises  coronary  blood fl ow. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelets are activated, which enhances the ability of platelets to interact with adhesive proteins and other platelets and causes growth and stabilization of the thrombus. Further activation of coagulation leads to strengthening of the clot by fi brin deposition. Th is makes the clot more resistant to thrombolysis. It is rather paradoxical that plaques that rupture and lead to acute coronary occlusion are  rarely  of  a  size  that  causes  signi fi cant coronary obstruction. By contrast, fl ow-restrictive plaques that produce angina pectoris  and  stimulate  development  of  collateral  circulation are less likely to rupture. Rarely, STEMI develops as a result of acute coronary spasm or coronary artery embolism.

DIAGNOSIS

With recent advances in the techniques for detecting MI, the criteria for diagnosing an acute, evolving, or recent MI have been revised (Table 1-4). Diagnosis of acute MI requires the typical rise and subsequent fall in plasma levels of biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis in combination with at least one  of  the  following:  (1)  ischemic  symptoms,  (2)  development of pathologic Q waves on the ECG, (3) ECG changes

Almost two thirds of patients describe new-onset angina pectoris or a change in their anginal pattern during the 30 days preceding an acute MI. Th e pain is o ft en more severe than the previous angina pectoris and does not resolve with rest. Other potential causes of severe chest pain (pulmonary embolism, aortic  dissection,  spontaneous  pneumothorax,  pericarditis, cholecystitis)  should  be  considered (see Table 1-2). About a quarter of patients, especially the elderly and those with diabetes, have no or only mild pain at the time of MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On physical examination, patients typically appear anxious, pale,  and  diaphoretic.  Sinus  tachycardia  is  usually  present. Hypotension caused by le ft or  right  ventricular  dysfunction or cardiac dysrhythmias may be present. Rales signal congestive heart failure due to le ft ventricular dysfunction. A cardiac murmur may indicate ischemic mitral regurgitation.

Laboratory Studies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Troponin  is  a  cardiac-speci fi c  protein  and  biochemical marker for acute MI. An increase in the circulating concentration of troponin occurs early a ft er myocardial injury. Levels of cardiac troponins (troponin T or I) increase within 3 hours a ft er myocardial injury and remain elevated for 7 to 10 days (Table 1-5). Elevated troponin levels and the ECG are powerful predictors of adverse cardiac events in patients with anginal pain. Troponin is more speci fi c than CK-MB for determining myocardial  injury.

Imaging Studies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  typical  ECG  evidence  of  acute  MI  do  not require evaluation with echocardiography. However, echocardiography is useful in patients with le ft bundle branch block or an abnormal ECG in whom the diagnosis of acute MI is uncertain and in patients with suspected aortic dissection. Echocardiography will demonstrate regional wall motion abnormalities in most patients with acute MI. Th e time required to perform myocardial perfusion imaging and the inability to di ff erentiate between new and old MI limits the utility of radionuclide imaging in the early diagnosis of acute MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early treatment of acute MI reduces morbidity and mortality. Initial steps include evaluating hemodynamic stability, obtaining a 12-lead ECG, and administering oxygen to all patients suspected  of  having  acute  MI.  Pain  relief,  usually  provided by  intravenous  morphine  and/or  sublingual  nitroglycerin, is  necessary  to  reduce  catecholamine  release  and  the  resultant increase in myocardial oxygen requirements. Aspirin (or clopidogrel for those intolerant of aspirin) is administered to decrease further thrombus formation. Prasugrel can be used as  an  alternative  to  clopidogrel.  Platelet  glycoprotein  IIb/ IIIa  inhibitors  can  be  used  if  urgent  surgical  intervention  is likely. β -Blockers relieve ischemic chest pain, infarct size, and

life-threatening dysrhythmias. β -Blockers are administered to patients  in hemodynamically  stable  condition who  are not in heart failure, in a low cardiac output state, or at risk of cardiogenic shock. β -Blockers are not given to those with heart block. Th e  primary goal in management of STEMI is to reestablish blood fl ow in the obstructed coronary artery as soon as possible. Th is can be achieved by reperfusion therapy or coronary angioplasty  with  or  without  placement  of  an  intracoronary stent. Th e time to reperfusion therapy strongly in fl uences the outcome of an acute STEMI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reperfusion Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombolytic therapy with streptokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, reteplase, or tenecteplase should be initiated within 30 to 60 minutes of hospital arrival, and within 12  hours  of  symptom  onset. Th rombolytic  therapy  restores normal antegrade blood fl ow in the occluded coronary artery. Dissolution of the clot by thrombolytic therapy becomes much more di ffi cult if therapy is delayed. Th e most feared complication of thrombolytic therapy is intracranial hemorrhage. Th is is most likely in elderly patients (>75 years of age) and in those with uncontrolled hypertension. Patients who have gastrointestinal bleeding or have recently undergone surgery are also at increased risk of bleeding complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PCI may be preferable to thrombolytic therapy for restoring fl ow to an occluded coronary artery if appropriate resources are available.  Ideally,  angioplasty  should  be  performed  within  90 minutes of arrival at the health care facility and within 12 hours of symptom onset. It is the modality of choice in patients with a contraindication to thrombolytic therapy and those with severe heart  failure  and/or  pulmonary  edema.  About  5%  of  patients who undergo immediate PCI require emergency cardiac surgery because of failed angioplasty or because the coronary artery anatomy precludes an intervention. Th e combined use of intracoronary stents and antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel or prasugrel, and a platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor) during emergency PCI provides the maximum chance of achieving normal antegrade coronary blood fl ow, and this therapy decreases the need for a subsequent revascularization procedure.

Patients  with ST-segment  elevation  who  develop  cardiogenic  shock,  le ft bundle branch block, or a posterior wall MI within 36 hours of an acute STEMI are also candidates for early revascularization. Mortality from CABG is signi fi cant during the fi rst 3 to 7 days a ft er an acute MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adjunctive Medical Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous  heparin  therapy  is  commonly  administered for  48  hours  a ft er  thrombolytic therapy to decrease the risk of  thrombus  regeneration.  A  disadvantage  of  unfractionated heparin is the variability in the dose response due to its binding with plasma proteins other than antithrombin. Lowmolecular-weight heparin provides a more predictable pharmacologic e ff ect, a long plasma half-life, and a more practical means  of  administration  (subcutaneous),  without  the  need to  monitor  the  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time. Th us, low-molecular-weight  heparin  is  an  excellent  alternative  to unfractionated  heparin.  Direct  thrombin  inhibitors  such  as bivalirudin can be used in patients with a history of heparininduced  thrombocytopenia.  Administration  of β -blockers  is associated with a signi fi cant decrease in early (in-hospital) and long-term mortality and myocardial reinfarction. Early administration of β -blockers can decrease infarct size by decreasing heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility. In the absence of speci fi c contraindications, it is recommended that patients receive β -blockers as early as possible a ft er an acute MI. β -Blocker therapy should be continued inde fi nitely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All patients with a large anterior wall MI, clinical evidence of  le ft ventricular  failure,  an  ejection  fraction  of  less  than 40%, or diabetes should be treated with ACE inhibitors, or an angiotensin II receptor blocker if they are intolerant of ACE inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  ventricular  dysrhythmias,  prophylactic administration  of  lidocaine  or  other  antidysrhythmic  drugs is  not  recommended.  Calcium  channel  blockers  should  not be administered routinely but should be reserved for patients with  persistent  myocardial  ischemia  despite  optimal  use  of aspirin, β -blockers,  nitrates,  and  heparin.  Glycemic  control is part of the standard care of diabetic patients with an acute MI.  Routine  administration  of  magnesium  is  not  recommended, but magnesium therapy is indicated in patients with torsade de pointes ventricular tachycardia. Statins have strong immune-modulating e ff ects and should be started as soon as possible  a ft er  MI,  especially  in  patients  receiving  long-term statin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unstable Angina/Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UA/NSTEMI results from a reduction in myocardial oxygen supply. Typically, fi ve pathophysiologic processes may contribute to the development of UA/NSTEMI: (1) rupture or erosion of a coronary plaque that leads to nonocclusive thrombosis; (2) dynamic obstruction due to vasoconstriction (Prinzmetal's variant angina, cold, cocaine use); (3) worsening coronary luminal narrowing due to progressive atherosclerosis, in-stent restenosis,  or  narrowing  of  coronary  artery  bypass  gra ft s; (4) in fl ammation (vasculitis); (5) myocardial ischemia due to increased oxygen demand (sepsis, fever, tachycardia, anemia). Most culprit arteries have less than 50% stenosis. Embolization of platelets and clot fragments into the coronary microvasculature leads to microcirculatory ischemia and infarction that can result in elevation of cardiac biomarker levels without elevation of the ST segments on a 12-lead ECG.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UA/NSTEMI has three principal presentations: angina at rest (usually lasting more than 20 minutes unless interrupted by antianginal medication), chronic angina pectoris that becomes more  frequent  and  more  easily  provoked,  and  new-onset angina  that  is  severe,  prolonged,  or  disabling.  UA/NSTEMI can also present with hemodynamic instability or congestive heart failure. Signs of congestive heart failure (S 3 gallop, jugular  venous  distention,  rales,  peripheral  edema)  or  ischemiainduced  papillary  muscle  dysfunction  causing  acute  mitral regurgitation  may  be  evident.  Fi ft y  percent  of  patients  with UA/NSTEMI have signi fi cant  ECG  abnormalities,  including transient  ST-segment  elevation,  ST  depression,  and  T-wave inversion. Signi fi cant ST-segment depression in two or more contiguous leads and/or deep symmetrical T-wave inversion, especially  in  the  setting  of  chest  pain,  is  highly  consistent with  a  diagnosis  of  myocardial  ischemia  and  UA/NSTEMI. Elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers establish the diagnosis of acute MI. Approximately two thirds of patients who would have been classi fi ed as having unstable angina have now been found to show evidence of myocardial necrosis based on sensitive cardiac enzymes assays and should be classi fi ed as having NSTEMI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of UA/NSTEMI is directed at decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and limiting thrombus formation by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. Bed rest, supplemental oxygen, analgesia, and β -blocker therapy are indicated. Calcium channel blockers can also be used. Sublingual or  intravenous  nitroglycerin  may  improve  myocardial  oxygen supply. Aspirin, clopidogrel, or prasugrel and 48 hours of heparin therapy are strongly recommended to decrease further  thrombus  formation.  Glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa  agents  may be used as an alternative or in addition to other antiplatelet drugs  in  certain  clinical  situations. Th rombolytic  therapy  is not indicated in UA/NSTEMI and has been shown to increase mortality. Older age (>65 years), positive fi nding for cardiac biomarkers,  rales,  hypotension,  tachycardia,  and  decreased le ft ventricular function (ejection fraction of <40%) are associated with increased mortality. Patients at high risk include the  elderly,  those  with  ischemic  symptoms  in  the  preceding 48 hours, those with prolonged chest pain (>20 minutes), those

<!-- PAGE=? -->
with heart failure or hemodynamic instability, those with sustained ventricular dysrhythmias, those who had a PCI within the past 6 months or had prior CABG surgery, those with elevated troponin levels, and those with angina at low-level activity. Th ese patients are considered for early invasive evaluation, which  includes  coronary  angiography  and  revascularization by PCI or CABG, if needed. Patients with mild to moderate renal insu ffi ciency (creatinine clearance of >30 mL/min) may also  bene fi t  from  early  invasive  treatment.  Patients  at  lower risk are treated medically and undergo stress testing at a later time. Coronary angiography is o ft en considered for patients who demonstrate signi fi cant ischemia on stress testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS OF ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac Dysrhythmias

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  dysrhythmias,  especially  ventricular  dysrhythmias, are a common cause of death during the early period following acute MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular tachycardia is  common in acute MI. Short periods of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia do not appear to predispose a patient to sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fi brillation.  Sustained  or  hemodynamically  signi fi cant  ventricular  tachycardia must be  treated  promptly with electrical cardioversion. Asymptomatic  ventricular tachycardia  can  be  treated  with  intravenous  lidocaine  or amiodarone. Implantation of a cardioverter-de fi brillator may be indicated in patients who experience recurrent ventricular  tachycardia  or  ventricular fi brillation  despite  adequate revascularization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular fi brillation occurs in 3% to 5% of patients with acute MI, usually during the fi rst 4 hours a ft er the event. Rapid de fi brillation with 200 to 300 J of energy is necessary when ventricular fi brillation  occurs.  Prophylactic  lidocaine  is  not necessary if electrical de fi brillation can be promptly accomplished. Amiodarone is regarded as one of the most e ff ective antidysrhythmic  drugs  for  control  of  ventricular  tachydysrhythmias, especially a ft er MI. Administration of β -blockers may decrease the early occurrence of ventricular fi brillation. Hypokalemia is a risk factor for ventricular fi brillation. Ventricular fi brillation is o ft en fatal when it occurs in patients with co-existing hypotension and/or congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation and atrial fl utter are  the  most  common atrial dysrhythmias seen with acute MI. Th ey occur in about 20% of patients. Precipitating factors include hypoxia, acidosis, heart failure, pericarditis, and sinus node ischemia. Atrial fi brillation  may  also  result  from  atrial  ischemia  or  from  an acute increase in le ft atrial pressure as a result of le ft ventricular dysfunction. Th e incidence of atrial fi brillation is decreased in  patients  who  receive  thrombolytic  therapy.  When  atrial fi brillation  is  hemodynamically  signi fi cant,  cardioversion  is necessary. If atrial fi brillation is well tolerated, β -blockers or calcium channel blockers are indicated to control the ventricular response.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinus bradycardia is common a ft er acute MI, particularly in patients with inferior wall MI. Th is may re fl ect increased parasympathetic nervous system activity or acute ischemia of the sinus node or atrioventricular node. Treatment with atropine and/or a temporary cardiac pacemaker is needed only when there  is  hemodynamic  compromise  from  the  bradycardia. Second- or third-degree atrioventricular heart block occurs in about 20% of patients with inferior wall MI. Complete heart block requires temporary cardiac pacing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  pericarditis  is  a  common  complication  that  occurs 1 to 4 days a ft er MI in 10% to 15% of patients. It may cause chest  pain  that  can  be  confused  with  continuing  or  recurrent angina. However, in contrast to the pain of myocardial ischemia, the pain of pericarditis is pleuritic, gets worse with inspiration  or  lying  down,  and  may  be  relieved  by  changes in  posture.  A  pericardial  friction  rub  can  be  heard  but  is o ft en transient and positional.  Di ff use  ST-segment  and T-wave changes may be present on the ECG. In the absence of a signi fi cant pericardial e ff usion, treatment of pericarditis is aimed at relieving the chest pain. Aspirin or indomethacin is  recommended initially. Corticosteroids can relieve symptoms  dramatically  but  are  usually  reserved  for  refractory cases, and it is recommended that steroid therapy be deferred for  at  least  4  weeks  a ft er  an  acute  MI. Dressler's  syndrome ( post-MI syndrome ) is a delayed form of pericarditis developing several weeks to months a ft er an acute MI. It is thought to be immune mediated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral Regurgitation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral  regurgitation  due  to  ischemic  injury  to  the  papillary muscles and/or the ventricular muscle to which the papillary muscles attach can occur a ft er acute MI. Severe mitral regurgitation  is  rare  and  usually  results  from  partial  or  complete rupture of  a  papillary  muscle.  Severe  mitral  regurgitation  is 10 times more likely to occur a ft er an inferior wall MI than a ft er an anterior wall MI. Severe acute mitral regurgitation typically results in pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock. Total papillary muscle rupture usually leads to death within 24 hours. Prompt surgical repair is required. Treatments that decrease le ft ventricular  a ft erload  and  improve  coronary  perfusion, such as an intraaortic balloon pump or intravenous nitroprusside, can decrease the regurgitant volume and increase forward fl ow and cardiac output until surgery can be accomplished.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular Septal Rupture

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular  septal  rupture  is  more  likely  a ft er  anterior  wall rather  than  inferior  wall  MI. Th e  characteristic  holosystolic murmur of ventricular septal rupture may be di ffi cult to distinguish from the murmur of severe mitral regurgitation. Th e diagnosis can be made by echocardiography. As soon as the diagnosis  of  ventricular  septal  rupture  is  made,  intraaortic

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
balloon counterpulsation should be initiated. Emergency surgical repair is necessary when the ventricular defect is associated  with  hemodynamic  compromise. Th e  mortality  rate associated with surgical repair of a post-MI ventricular septal defect is about 20%. It is better to wait at least a week before surgical  repair  is  undertaken  in  patients  in  hemodynamically stable condition. If the defect is le ft untreated, mortality approaches 90%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congestive Heart Failure and Cardiogenic Shock

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute MI is o ft en complicated by some degree of le ft ventricular dysfunction. Th e term cardiogenic shock is restricted to an advanced form of acute heart failure in which the cardiac output is insu ffi cient to maintain adequate perfusion of the brain, kidneys,  and  other  vital  organs.  Hypotension  and  oliguria persist a ft er relief of anginal pain, abatement of excess sympathetic nervous system activity, correction of hypovolemia, and treatment of dysrhythmias. Systolic blood pressure is low, and there may be associated pulmonary edema and arterial hypoxemia. Cardiogenic shock is usually a manifestation of infarction of more than 40% of the le ft ventricular myocardium. In the setting of an acute MI, the mortality of cardiogenic shock exceeds 50%.

Important  in  the  management  of  cardiogenic  shock  is the diagnosis and prompt treatment of potentially reversible mechanical  complications  of  MI. Th ese  include  (1)  rupture of the le ft ventricular free wall, septum, or papillary muscles; (2) cardiac tamponade; and (3) acute, severe mitral regurgitation. Echocardiography is extremely helpful in diagnosing and  quantifying  these  pathologic  conditions.  Treatment  of cardiogenic shock is dependent on blood pressure and peripheral  perfusion.  Norepinephrine,  vasopressin,  dopamine,  or dobutamine may be administered in an attempt to improve blood  pressure  and  cardiac  output.  If  the  blood  pressure  is adequate, nitroglycerin can be used to decrease le ft ventricular  preload  and  a ft erload.  Concomitant  pulmonary  edema may require the use of morphine, diuretics, and mechanical ventilation. Restoration of some coronary blood fl ow to the zone around the infarction by thrombolytic therapy, PCI, or surgical revascularization may be indicated. Circulatory assist devices can help sustain viable myocardium and support cardiac  output  until  revascularization  can  be  performed.  Le ft ventricular assist devices improve cardiac output much more than intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, but intraaortic balloon pumps are much more widely available. Th e intraaortic balloon pump is programmed to the ECG so that it de fl ates just before systole and in fl ates during diastole. In fl ation of the balloon during diastole increases diastolic blood pressure and thus  improves  coronary  blood fl ow and myocardial oxygen delivery. De fl ation of the balloon just before systole augments le ft ventricular  ejection  and  decreases  le ft ventricular  a ft erload. Infusion of a combination of inotropic and vasodilator drugs may serve as a pharmacologic alternative to mechanical counterpulsation.

Myocardial Rupture

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial rupture usually causes acute cardiac tamponade. Th is  typically  occurs  within  the fi rst  week  a ft er  an  MI  and presents with sudden hemodynamic collapse or sudden death. In an extremely small percentage of cases, it is possible to have time for medical stabilization and emergency surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right Ventricular Infarction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right  ventricular  infarction  occurs  in  about  one  third  of patients with acute inferior wall MI. Isolated right ventricular infarction is very unusual. Th e right ventricle has a more favorable oxygen supply/demand ratio than the le ft ventricle because of its smaller muscle mass and its improved oxygen delivery, which results from delivery of coronary blood fl ow during both systole and diastole. Th e clinical triad of hypotension, increased jugular venous pressure, and clear lung fi elds in a patient with an inferior wall MI is virtually pathognomonic for right ventricular infarction. Kussmaul's sign (distention of the jugular vein on inspiration) is o ft en seen. Right ventricular dilation,  right  ventricular  asynergy,  and  abnormal  interventricular septal motion can be seen on echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recognition  of  right  ventricular  infarction  is  important, because  certain  pharmacologic  treatments  for  le ft ventricular failure may worsen right ventricular failure. In particular, administration of vasodilators and diuretics is very undesirable.  Initial  therapy  for  right  ventricular  failure  consists  of intravenous fl uids. If hypotension persists, then inotropic support,  with  or  without  intraaortic  balloon  counterpulsation, may be necessary. Cardiogenic shock, although uncommon, is the most serious complication of right ventricular infarction. Improvement  in  right  ventricular  function  generally  occurs over time, which suggests reversal of "ischemic stunning" of the right ventricular myocardium. About one third of patients with  right  ventricular  infarction  develop  atrial fi brillation. Heart block may occur in as many as 50% of these patients. Both  of  these  situations  may  produce  severe  hemodynamic compromise. Th ird-degree atrioventricular heart block should be treated promptly with temporary atrioventricular sequential pacing, in recognition of the value of atrioventricular synchrony in maintaining ventricular fi lling in the ischemic, and therefore noncompliant, right ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stroke

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infarction  of  the  anterior  wall  and  apex  of  the  le ft ventricle results in thrombus formation there in as many as one third of patients. Th e risk of systemic embolization and the possibility of an ischemic stroke are very signi fi cant in these patients. Echocardiography is used to detect a le ft ventricular thrombus. Th e  presence  of  such  a  thrombus  is  an  indication  for immediate anticoagulation with heparin followed by 6 months of anticoagulation with warfarin.

PERIOPERATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was introduced as an alternative to CABG to mechanically open stenosed coronary arteries. It was e ff ective, but restenosis of the angioplasty site occurred in 15% to 60% of patients. To solve the problem of abrupt coronary closure a ft er angioplasty, bare metal stents were  introduced.  However,  coronary  restenosis  due  to  neointimal hyperplasia was observed in 10% to 30% of patients with bare metal stents. Stents coated with drugs ( drug-eluting stents ) were then introduced to reduce neointimal hyperplasia and subsequent stenosis. Today, at least three polymer-based drug-eluting  stents  are  available:  (1)  the  Cypher  sirolimuseluting stent, (2) the Taxus paclitaxel-eluting stent, and (3) the Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stent. Th e drugs in these stents prevent cell division and hence reduce neointimal hyperplasia. Th e two principal issues related to PCI with stent placement are thrombosis and an increased risk of bleeding due to dual antiplatelet therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Thrombosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanically opening a blood vessel by angiography causes vessel injury, especially destruction of the  endothelium. Th is makes the area prone to thrombosis. It takes about 2 to 3 weeks for the vessel to reendothelialize a ft er balloon angioplasty. A ft er bare metal stent placement, reendothelialization can take up to 12 weeks, and a drug-eluting stent may not be completely endothelialized even a ft er 1 year. Th us, thrombosis a ft er angioplasty and stent placement is a major concern.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stent thrombosis is categorized by the time interval between its occurrence and the PCI: acute (within 24 hours), subacute (between 2 and 30 days), late (between 30 days and a year), and very late (a ft er a year). Early stent thrombosis is usually mechanical in origin and due to coronary artery dissection or underexpansion of the stent. In contrast, late stent thrombosis is typically related to stent malposition, abnormal reendothelialization, or hypersensitivity. Platelets play an important role  in  the  pathophysiology  of  stent  thrombosis,  and  use  of antiplatelet  drugs  is  critical  in  these  patients  until  the  stent becomes less prone to thrombosis. Platelets can be activated by many triggers, and there is signi fi cant redundancy and crosstalk between these pathways. Th us, multiple pathways must be blocked to achieve clinically e ff ective platelet inhibition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  discontinuation  of  antiplatelet  therapy  increases  the risk  of  stent  thrombosis.  Dual  antiplatelet  therapy  (aspirin with  clopidogrel)  is  better  in  preventing  stent  thrombosis compared with aspirin alone. Clopidogrel discontinuation is the most signi fi cant independent predictor of stent thrombosis,  with  the  probability of an event increased by more than

<!-- PAGE=? -->
14  times  a ft er  discontinuation.  Patients  with  drug-eluting stents  who  stopped  clopidogrel  during  the fi rst  month  a ft er PCI were 10 times more likely to have a fatal outcome during the next 11 months. Current recommendations for dual antiplatelet therapy are the following: it is needed for at least 2 weeks a ft er balloon angioplasty without stenting, for at least 6 weeks a ft er bare metal stent placement, and for at least 1 year a ft er drug-eluting stent placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other factors can predispose a patient to stent thrombosis, and these may be important in the perioperative period. Patients at risk for stent thrombosis include those with acute coronary syndrome, low ejection fraction, diabetes, renal impairment, advanced age, prior brachytherapy, and cancer. Factors related to coronary anatomy (length of the stents, placement of multiple stents, bifurcated lesions) may also predispose patients to stent thrombosis. Elective surgery and emergency surgery both increase the risk of stent thrombosis because of the prothrombotic state during the perioperative period.

Surgery and Risk of Stent Thrombosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGERY AND BARE METAL STENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e frequency of major adverse cardiovascular events (death, MI, stent thrombosis, or the need for repeat revascularization) used  to  be  10.5%  when  noncardiac  surgery  was  performed within 4 weeks of PCI. It decreased to 3.8% when surgery was performed between 31 and 90 days a ft er PCI and to 2.8% when performed more than 90 days a ft er PCI. Th e risk of death, MI, stent  thrombosis,  and  urgent  revascularization  is  increased by 5% to 30% if surgery is performed within 6 weeks of bare metal stent placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGERY AND DRUG-ELUTING STENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the nonsurgical population, the chance of late stent thrombosis is higher a ft er placement of a drug-eluting stent than a ft er placement of a bare metal stent. Th is is attributed to the delayed endothelialization seen with drug-eluting stents. Th e incidence of major adverse cardiac events is quite signi fi cant if dual antiplatelet therapy is discontinued and noncardiac surgery is performed within 1 year of drug-eluting stent placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk of adverse events is higher in patients who undergo emergency surgery. In patients with bare metal stents, emergency surgery increases the adverse event rate threefold over elective  surgery.  For  patients  with  drug-eluting  stents,  data indicate a 3.5-fold increase in adverse events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk of Bleeding with Antiplatelet Agents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is predictable that patients who are taking antiplatelet drugs will have a higher chance of bleeding, which can be of major concern in the perioperative period. Th e risk of spontaneous bleeding  increases  in  patients  who  are  receiving  antiplatelet agents. It has been shown that continuing aspirin therapy increases the risk of bleeding by a factor of 1.5, but the severity  of  adverse  events  is  not  increased. Th e  risk  of  bleeding in  patients  undergoing  noncardiac  surgery  who  are  taking

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

clopidogrel has not been extensively studied. Th e addition of clopidogrel to aspirin increases the relative risk of bleeding by 50%. So far no increase in mortality has been noted except for intracranial surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bleeding versus Stent Thrombosis in the Perioperative Period

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Discontinuing antiplatelet therapy causes a signi fi cant increase in coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular events. However, in the perioperative patient, the risk of bleeding has to be weighed against the risk of thrombosis. In many situations the risk of coronary thrombosis is high and the consequence of thrombosis could be catastrophic; on the other hand, although the risk of bleeding is increased, bleeding could be manageable and does not contribute to signi fi cant morbidity and mortality. In such cases it may be prudent to continue antiplatelet therapy. However, some individuals are more prone to bleeding or need to undergo procedures in which bleeding can have severe consequences. Th ese include neurosurgery, spinal cord decompression, aortic aneurysm surgery, and prostatectomy, among others. In such cases the risk of bleeding may outweigh the risk of thrombosis, so antiplatelet therapy should be stopped before these operations (at least 5 to 7 days before surgery for clopidogrel) and resumed as soon as feasible postoperatively. Some patients  come  for  surgery  receiving  antiplatelet  therapy  for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. Th ese patients have no stents, so the risk of bleeding will outweigh the risk of cardiovascular events.  Antiplatelet  drugs  can  be  temporarily withheld for high-risk surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Patients with Stents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Five factors should be considered when caring for a patient with a coronary stent: (1) timing of the operation a ft er PCI, also called the PCI-to-surgery interval; (2) continuation of dual antiplatelet  therapy;  (3)  perioperative  monitoring  strategies; (4) anesthetic technique; and (5) immediate availability of an interventional cardiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PCI-TO-SURGERY INTERVAL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk of stent thrombosis is signi fi cant in the fi rst month a ft er stent placement and progressively decreases as the time from PCI to surgery increases. Th e longer one waits a ft er stent placement the better it is. For patients with bare metal stents, waiting at  least  6  weeks (preferably  90  days)  before  elective surgery is recommended. In patients with drug-eluting stents waiting at  least  1  year before  elective  noncardiac  surgery  is recommended (Table 1-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONTINUATION OF DUAL ANTIPLATELET THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dual  antiplatelet  therapy  should  be  continued  for  at  least 6  weeks  in  patients  with  bare  metal  stents  and  1  year  in patients with drug-eluting stents. If dual antiplatelet therapy needs to be stopped, at least aspirin therapy should be continued. Aspirin should be stopped before elective surgery only

<!-- PAGE=? -->
when absolutely indicated. Although less than 6 weeks a ft er bare  metal  stent  placement  and  less  than  1  year  a ft er  drugeluting  stent  placement  is  considered  a  highly  vulnerable period for stent thrombosis, stent thrombosis can happen at any time. Intraoperative and postoperative monitoring should be based on the risk of surgery, overall patient condition, and the interval between PCI and surgery. Patients who are in the vulnerable period should be monitored very closely, especially if  antiplatelet therapy was discontinued for the surgery. In a bleeding patient, platelets can be administered to counteract the  e ff ects  of  antiplatelet  drugs,  but  the  e ff ectiveness  of  the platelet infusions will depend on the timing of the last dose of clopidogrel. Platelet transfusions can be administered as soon as 4 hours a ft er discontinuation of clopidogrel, but they will be most e ff ective 24 hours a ft er the last dose of clopidogrel.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MONITORING STRATEGIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practitioners should have a high index of suspicion for cardiac  events  and  concentrate  on  monitoring  for  myocardial ischemia and  infarction. Intraoperative  continuous  ECG monitoring  with  ST  analysis  is  very  helpful  in  monitoring for myocardial ischemia. Any angina in a patient with a stent should prompt evaluation to rule out acute MI, and an urgent cardiology evaluation should be sought.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use  of  neuraxial  anesthetic  techniques  in  patients  who  are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy is controversial. However, both  the  American  Society  of  Regional  Anesthesia  and  the European Society of Anaesthesiologists have adopted a conservative approach in this matter. Use of neuraxial blockade is not encouraged in patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. Th e risk of developing a spinal hematoma exists not only at the time of placement of the catheter, but also at the time of its removal. Recommended waiting times before placement or removal of an epidural catheter and administration of antiplatelet agents are given in Table 1-7.

Once  the  diagnosis  of  acute MI or acute stent thrombosis is made or considered, triage to interventional cardiology within 90 minutes is strongly recommended. Mortality increases substantially if reperfusion is delayed. Ambulatory surgical facilities, endoscopy suites, and other  non-hospital-based  operating  locations  without  these resources on site should develop a relationship with interventional cardiologists that can facilitate rapid transfer if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOPERATIVE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of perioperative cardiac injury is a cumulative result of the patient's preoperative medical condition, the speci fi c surgical procedure, the expertise of the surgeon, the diagnostic criteria used to de fi ne MI, and the overall medical care at a particular institution. Th e risk of perioperative death due to cardiac causes is less than 1% in patients who do not have ischemic heart disease. Th e incidence of perioperative MI in patients  who  undergo  elective  high-risk  vascular  surgery  is between 5% and 15%. Th e risk is even higher for emergency surgery. Patients who undergo urgent hip surgery have an incidence of perioperative MI of 5% to 7%, whereas fewer than 3% of patients who undergo elective total hip or knee arthroplasty have a perioperative MI. Perioperative MIs are associated with a 20% mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ischemia occurs early in the postoperative period and is associated  with  development  of  a  perioperative  MI.  Contemporary studies indicate that most perioperative MIs occur in the fi rst 24 to 48 hours a ft er surgery. Many postoperative MIs are NSTEMIs and can be diagnosed by release of cardiac biomarkers and/or ECG changes. Th ese MIs are usually preceded by tachycardia and ST depression and are o ft en silent.  Patients with more severe coronary artery disease are at greater risk. Th ese  observations  support  the  hypothesis  that  perioperative myocardial injury develops as a consequence of increased myocardial  oxygen  demand  (increased  blood  pressure  and heart rate) in the context of underlying compromised myocardial oxygen supply.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another hypothesis suggests that perioperative MI is the result of sudden development of a thrombotic process associated with vulnerable plaque rupture. Th is hypothesis is based on postoperative autopsy studies and angiographic evidence of thrombi in coronary arteries that are not critically stenosed. Endothelial injury at the site of a plaque rupture triggers the cascade of platelet aggregation and release of mediators. Aggregation of platelets and activation of other in fl ammatory and nonin fl ammatory mediators potentiates thrombus formation and leads to dynamic vasoconstriction distal to the thrombus. Th e  combined  e ff ects  of  dynamic  and  physical  blood  vessel narrowing  cause  ischemia  and/or  infarction.  In  the  postoperative period, changes in blood viscosity, catecholamine concentrations,  cortisol  levels,  endogenous  tissue  plasminogen activator concentrations, and plasminogen activator inhibitor levels create a prothrombotic state. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure as a result of the stress response can increase the propensity for a plaque to fi ssure and develop endothelial damage. In combination, these factors can precipitate thrombus formation in an atherosclerotic coronary artery and lead to the development of an STEMI. Th us, two di ff erent pathophysiologic mechanisms can be responsible for perioperative MI. One could be related to acute coronary thrombosis, and the other could be the consequence of increased myocardial oxygen  demand  in  the  setting  of  compromised  myocardial oxygen  supply. Th ese  processes  are  not  mutually  exclusive. However, one process or the other usually predominates in a particular patient (Figure 1-5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the perioperative period, ischemic episodes o ft en are not associated  with  chest  pain.  In  addition,  many  postoperative ECGs  are  nondiagnostic.  Nonspeci fi c  ECG  changes,  newonset dysrhythmias, and noncardiac hemodynamic instability can further obscure the clinical picture of acute coronary syndrome in the perioperative period. Th erefore, the diagnosis of perioperative MI may be quite di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An acute increase in troponin levels should be considered to  indicate  MI  in  the  perioperative  setting.  An  increase  in cardiac troponin level is a marker of myocardial injury, and there is a good correlation between the duration of myocardial ischemia and the increase in the level of cardiac-speci fi c troponin. Th ere  is  also  a  signi fi cant  association  between increased troponin levels and short- and long-term morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. Th is  association exists for cardiac death, MI, myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, cardiac dysrhythmias, and stroke. Even relatively minor cardiovascular complications such as uncontrolled hypertension,  palpitations,  increased fatigue, and shortness of breath

An  increase  in  troponin  level  postoperatively,  even  in the absence of clear cardiovascular signs and symptoms, is an important fi nding that requires careful attention and referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management.

PREOPERATIVE ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS WITH KNOWN OR SUSPECTED ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e preoperative history taking is meant to elicit the severity, progression, and functional limitations imposed by ischemic heart disease. It should focus on determining the presence of major, intermediate, and minor clinical risk factors in a particular patient (Table 1-8). Myocardial ischemia, le ft ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac dysrhythmias are usually responsible for the signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease. Symptoms such as angina and dyspnea may be absent at rest, which emphasizes the importance of evaluating the patient's response to  various  physical  activities  such  as  walking  or  climbing stairs. Limited exercise tolerance in the absence of signi fi cant lung disease is good evidence of decreased cardiac reserve. If a patient can climb two to three fl ights of stairs without symptoms, it is likely that cardiac reserve is adequate. Dyspnea a ft er the onset of angina pectoris suggests the presence of acute le ft ventricular  dysfunction  caused  by  myocardial  ischemia.  In some patients myocardial ischemia does not evoke chest pain or discomfort. Th is silent myocardial ischemia usually occurs at  a  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  substantially  lower  than that present during exercise-induced ischemia. It is estimated

that  nearly  three  quarters  of  ischemic  episodes  in  patients with  symptomatic  ischemic  heart  disease  are  not  associated with angina pectoris and 10% to 15% of acute MIs are silent. It is important to recognize the presence of incipient congestive heart failure preoperatively, because the added stresses of anesthesia, surgery, fl uid replacement, and postoperative pain may result in overt congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A history  of  MI  is  an  important  piece  of  information.  It is  common practice to delay elective surgery for some time (at least 30 days) following MI. Retrospective studies of large groups of adult patients have suggested that the incidence of myocardial  reinfarction  during  the  perioperative  period  is in fl uenced by the time elapsed since the previous MI. Acute MI (1 to 7 days previously), recent MI (8 to 30 days previously), and unstable angina are associated with the highest risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia, MI, and cardiac death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to determine whether a patient has undergone cardiac revascularization with PCI and stent placement or CABG. Stent placement (drug-eluting or bare metal stent) is routinely followed by postprocedure antiplatelet therapy to prevent acute coronary thrombosis and maintain the long-term patency of the vessel. It is prudent to delay elective noncardiac surgery for 6 weeks a ft er PCI with bare metal stent placement and as long as 12 months with drug-eluting stent placement. Ideally,  elective  noncardiac  surgery  should  be  delayed  for 6 weeks a ft er coronary bypass surgery (see Table 1-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of aortic stenosis is associated with a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality. Patients with critical aortic stenosis have the highest risk of cardiac decompensation a ft er  noncardiac surgery.  Mitral  valve  disease  is  associated  with  less  risk  of perioperative complications. Th e presence of prosthetic valves should be noted, since patients with these valves will require perioperative  endocarditis  prophylaxis  and  adjustment  of their anticoagulation regimens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e history taking should also elicit information relevant to co-existing noncardiac disease. For example, patients with ischemic heart disease are likely to have peripheral vascular disease. A history of syncope may re fl ect cerebrovascular disease,  a  seizure  disorder,  or  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Cough  is o ft en pulmonary rather than cardiac in origin. It may be diffi cult to di ff erentiate dyspnea caused by cardiac dysfunction from that caused by chronic lung disease, although patients with ischemic heart disease more o ft en complain of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is likely in patients with a long history of cigarette smoking. Diabetes mellitus o ft en co-exists with ischemic heart disease. Renal insu ffi ciency (creatinine level of >2.0 mg/ dL) increases the risk of perioperative cardiac events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical treatment for ischemic heart disease is designed to decrease myocardial oxygen requirements, improve coronary blood fl ow, stabilize plaque, prevent thrombosis, and remodel the injured myocardium. Th ese goals are achieved by the use of β -blockers, nitrates,  calcium entry blockers, statins, antiplatelet  drugs,  and  ACE  inhibitors.  E ff ective β -blockade  is suggested by a resting heart rate of 50 to 60 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Routine physical activity is expected to increase the heart rate by 10% to 20%. Th ere is no evidence that β -blockers enhance the negative inotropic e ff ects of volatile anesthetics. β -Blocker therapy  should  be  continued  throughout  the  perioperative  period.  Atropine  or  glycopyrrolate  can  be  used  to  treat excessive bradycardia caused by β -blockers during the perioperative period. Isoproterenol is the speci fi c pharmacologic antagonist for excessive β -blocker activity. Th e postoperative period  is  a  time  when  inadvertent  withdrawal  of β -blocker therapy may occur and result in rebound hypertension and tachycardia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  hypotension  has  been  observed  in  patients receiving  long-term  treatment  with  ACE  inhibitors  who undergo  general  anesthesia.  Many  recommend  withholding ACE  inhibitors  for  24  hours  before  surgery  involving  signi fi cant fl uid shi ft s or blood loss. Hypotension attributable to ACE inhibitors is usually responsive to fl uids or sympathomimetic drugs. If hypotension is refractory to these measures, treatment  with  vasopressin  or  one  of  its  analogues  may  be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antiplatelet drugs are an essential component in the pharmacotherapy  of  acute  coronary  syndrome  and  long-term management of ischemic heart disease. Th e use of dual antiplatelet therapy precludes neuraxial anesthesia and increases the risk of perioperative bleeding, which may require platelet transfusion in certain clinical situations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical Examination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physical examination of patients with ischemic heart disease o ft en yields normal fi ndings. Nevertheless, signs of right and  le ft ventricular  dysfunction  must  be  sought.  A  carotid bruit may indicate cerebrovascular disease. Orthostatic hypotension  may  re fl ect  attenuated  autonomic  nervous  system activity  because  of  treatment  with  antihypertensive  drugs. Jugular venous   distention and peripheral edema are signs of right ventricular dysfunction.

Specialized Preoperative Testing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Specialized preoperative cardiac testing includes ECG, echocardiography,  radionuclide  ventriculography,  thallium scintigraphy,  high-speed  CT,  MRI,  and  positron  emission tomography scanning. Such testing is reserved for patients in whom the results are critical for guiding therapy during the perioperative period.

EXERCISE ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  that  includes  tests  that  stimulate an increase in heart rate is appealing, because perioperative increases in myocardial oxygen consumption and the development of myocardial ischemia are o ft en accompanied by tachycardia. Preoperative stress testing and/or the exercise tolerance of a patient can indicate the risk of perioperative myocardial

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  transthoracic  or  transesophageal  echocardiography  is  useful  for  diagnosing  le ft ventricular  dysfunction and assessing valvular heart disease. Results of resting echocardiography  do  not  contribute  appreciably  to  the  information provided by routine clinical and ECG data in predicting adverse  outcomes.  Echocardiographic  wall  motion  analysis during infusion of dipyridamole or dobutamine or atropine (pharmacologic stress testing) is a good technique for evaluating ischemic heart disease, particularly in patients with no history of MI. Dobutamine stress echocardiography provides comparable,  if  not  better,  results  than  myocardial  perfusion scintigraphy and provides additional information about valvular function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THALLIUM SCINTIGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical  limitations,  such  as  claudication  or  joint  disease, may impair the ability of a patient to exercise. Th is limits the usefulness  of  exercise  stress  testing.  Dipyridamole-thallium testing mimics the coronary vasodilator response associated with exercise. Like stress echocardiography, it is a useful test in patients with limited exercise capacity. Defects or "cold spots" on the nuclear scan denote areas of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Th e  cost  e ff ectiveness  of  thallium  scintigraphy  is best when this test is restricted to patients who cannot exercise and whose risk of perioperative cardiac complications cannot be estimated based on other clinical factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RADIONUCLIDE VENTRICULOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radionuclide ventriculography quantitates le ft and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Th e  ejection fraction determined by radionuclide ventriculography does not provide information that can be used to predict the risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia, but an ejection fraction of less than 50% may predict an increased risk of postoperative congestive heart failure.

High-speed  CT  can  visualize  coronary  artery  calci fi cation. Intravenous  administration  of  radiographic  contrast  media enhances the clarity of the images. MRI provides even greater image clarity and can delineate the proximal portions of the coronary arterial circulation. However, CT and MRI are more expensive  and  less  mobile  than  other  modalities  of  cardiac evaluation.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA IN PATIENTS WITH KNOWN OR SUSPECTED ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE UNDERGOING NONCARDIAC SURGERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  preoperative management of patients with ischemic heart disease or risk factors for ischemic heart disease is geared toward the following goals: (1) determining the extent of ischemic heart disease and any previous interventions (CABG, PCI), (2) assessing the severity and stability of the disease, and (3) reviewing medical therapy and noting any drugs that can increase the risk of surgical bleeding or contraindicate use of a particular anesthetic technique. Th e fi rst two goals are important in risk strati fi cation.

For  patients  in  stable  condition  undergoing  elective  major noncardiac surgery, six independent predictors of major cardiac complications have been identi fi ed and included in the Lee Revised Cardiac Risk Index (Table 1-9). Th ese six predictors  are  high-risk  surgery,  history  of  ischemic  heart  disease, history of congestive heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, preoperative insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and preoperative  serum  creatinine  level  higher  than  2.0  mg/dL. Th e higher the number of risk factors present, the greater the probability of perioperative cardiac complications such as cardiac death, cardiac arrest or ventricular fi brillation, complete heart  block,  acute  MI,  and  pulmonary  edema    (Figure  1-6).

College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines  for  perioperative  cardiovascular  evaluation  for noncardiac surgery. Th e principal theme of the guidelines is that  preoperative  intervention  is  rarely  necessary  simply  to lower the risk of surgery. An intervention is indicated or not indicated irrespective of the need for surgery. Preoperative testing should be performed only if it the result is likely to in fl uence  perioperative  management.  Although  no  prospective, randomized study has been conducted to prove the e ffi cacy of these guidelines, they o ff er a paradigm that has been widely adopted by clinicians.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ACC/AHA guidelines provide a multistep algorithm for determining the need for preoperative cardiac evaluation. Th e fi rst step assesses the urgency of the surgery. Th e need for emergency surgery takes precedence over the need for additional  workup  (Figure  1-7).  Subsequent  steps  of  the  ACC/ AHA guidelines integrate risk strati fi cation according to clinical risk factors, functional capacity, and surgery-speci fi c risk factors. Clinical risk factors identi fi ed from the history, physical examination, and review of the ECG are grouped into three categories: (1) Major clinical risk factors (unstable coronary syndrome, decompensated heart failure, signi fi cant dysrhythmias, severe valvular heart disease) may require delay of elective surgery and cardiologic evaluation. Intensive preoperative management  is  necessary  if  surgery  is  urgent  or  emergent. (2) Moderate clinical risk factors (stable angina pectoris, previous MI identi fi ed by history or pathologic Q waves, compensated or previous heart failure, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, renal insu ffi ciency) are well-validated markers of an enhanced risk  of  perioperative  cardiac  complications.  (3)  Minor  clinical risk factors (hypertension, le ft bundle branch block, nonspeci fi c ST-T wave changes, history of stroke) are recognized

Th e surgery-speci fi c risk of noncardiac surgical procedures is  graded  as  high,  intermediate,  or  low.  High-risk  surgery includes emergency major surgery, aortic and other major vascular surgery, peripheral vascular surgery, and prolonged surgery associated with large fl uid shi ft s and/or blood loss. Th ese operations are reported to carry a cardiac risk of more than 5%.  Intermediate-risk  surgery  includes  endovascular  aortic surgery, carotid endarterectomy, head and neck surgery, intraperitoneal and intrathoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and prostate surgery. Such operations are reported to be associated with a cardiac risk of less than 5%. Low-risk procedures such as  endoscopic  surgery,  super fi cial  surgery,  cataract  surgery, breast surgery, and ambulatory surgery are reported to carry a less than 1% risk of perioperative cardiac events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is recommended that patients who are scheduled to undergo elective high-risk surgery and have low exercise tolerance and three or more moderate clinical risk factors be sent for further cardiologic workup (Figure 1-9). Patients scheduled for intermediate-risk  surgery  with  low  exercise  tolerance  and three or more moderate clinical risk factors or those with low functional capacity and one or two clinical risk factors may be considered for further evaluation if it will a ff ect perioperative management. Patients scheduled for elective low-risk surgery or those with minor clinical risk factors can proceed to surgery without further workup. Many patients who need further preoperative  evaluation  may  not  be  candidates  for  exercise stress testing but can be referred for pharmacologic stress testing. Nuclear imaging can better detect myocardium at risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According  to  the  most  recent  ACC/AHA  guidelines,  a select subgroup of patients should be considered for further cardiac  evaluation  preoperatively.  Patients  who  have  major clinical risk factors require cardiology consultation, workup, and optimization of care before elective surgery. If a patient previously underwent a revascularization procedure (CABG or PCI) and there has been no change in the patient's clinical status, the patient can proceed to surgery (Figure 1-8). It

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In nonoperative  settings,  treatment  strategies such  as PCI (with or without stenting), CABG surgery, and medical therapy have proven e ffi cacious in improving long-term morbidity and mortality. Patients with signi fi cant ischemic heart disease who come for noncardiac surgery are likely to be candidates for one or more of these therapies regardless of their need for surgery. Optimal medical management can improve perioperative  outcomes.  Coronary  intervention  should  be guided by the patient's cardiac condition and by the potential  consequences  of  delaying  surgery  for  recovery  from  the revascularization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For CABG surgery to be bene fi cial before noncardiac surgery, the institutional risk of that particular noncardiac operation should be greater than the combined risk of coronary catheterization and coronary revascularization, plus the generally reported risk of that noncardiac operation. Th e indications for preoperative surgical coronary revascularization are the same as those in the nonoperative setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  was  thought  that  PCI  before  elective  noncardiac  surgery could improve perioperative outcomes. However, PCI, which is  now  o ft en  accompanied  by  stenting  and  dual  antiplatelet therapy, poses its own unique set of problems that need to be considered in patients who are scheduled to undergo elective noncardiac surgery. Th ere is no value in preoperative coronary intervention in a patient with stable ischemic heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  reason to formulate a risk strati fi cation index is so that individuals at high risk will be identi fi ed and treated to reduce their  risk  of  perioperative  cardiac  complications.  In  view  of the serious limitations of current PCIs and lack of utility of CABG and PCI in patients with stable coronary artery disease, very few patients with stable coronary artery disease will undergo revascularization before surgery. Most patients with stable  coronary  artery  disease  and/or  risk  factors  for  coronary artery disease will be managed pharmacologically, as will patients with signi fi cant ischemic heart disease who come for emergent or urgent surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  pharmacologic  agents  have  been  used  to  reduce perioperative  myocardial  injury. Th ese  are  drugs  that  have demonstrated pharmacologic e ffi cacy in the management of coronary  ischemia  in  the  nonsurgical  setting.  Nitroglycerin may  be  helpful  in  the  management  of  active  perioperative ischemia. However, prophylactic use of nitroglycerin has not been shown to be e ffi cacious in reducing perioperative morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative  use  of β -blockers  has  been  shown  to  be e ffi cacious in reducing perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery. However, recent trials have not shown e ffi cacy of high-dose, acutely  administered, perioperative β -blockers  in  reducing overall mortality in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, but  they  did  show  better  perioperative cardiac outcomes with β -blocker use. However a higher mortality and stroke rate has been noted with β -blocker use. Currently the only class  I  recommendation  (action  that  should  be  taken)  for perioperative  administration  of β -blockers  is  to  continue their  use  in  patients  who  are  already  receiving β -blockers.

Patients undergoing vascular surgery who have multiple risk factors or are found to have reversible ischemia on preoperative  testing  may  bene fi t  from  perioperative  administration of β -blockers. Although there are some di ff erences between the  European  and  the  AHA  guidelines,  both  agree  that  if β -blockers are used for prophylactic purposes in the perioperative period, they should be initiated at least a week before elective  surgery,  and acute administration  of  high-dose β -blockers  in  high-risk  populations  is  not  recommended (Table  1-10).  Questions  regarding  the  choice  of β -blocker and the target heart rate are still unresolved. For ease of dosing and consistency of e ff ect, longer-acting β -blockers such as atenolol or bisoprolol may be more e ffi cacious in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with vascular disease should receive statin therapy for secondary prevention regardless of the need for noncardiac surgery.  Clinical  trials  have  demonstrated  a  bene fi cial  e ff ect of perioperative statin use. European guidelines recommend starting therapy 1 to 4 weeks before high-risk surgery. Discontinuation of  statins  in  the  perioperative  period  may  cause  a rebound e ff ect that may be harmful. Th us, it is recommended that statins be continued perioperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Controlling  hyperglycemia  in  patients  undergoing  cardiac surgery and in patients in intensive care units has been associated  with  improved  outcomes. Th e  recent  discoveries regarding the nonmetabolic e ff ects of insulin and the harmful e ff ects of hyperglycemia make it prudent to actively manage hyperglycemia with insulin. Th is is especially important in  patients  who  are  at  high  risk  of  cardiac  injury. Th e  goal is  to  keep the perioperative glucose level below 180 mg/dL. Because  several  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  can  trigger a perioperative MI, it seems reasonable to think that multimodal  therapy  with β -blockers  or α 2 -agonists,  statins,  and insulin may be more bene fi cial than treatment with any single drug (Figure 1-10).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
α 2 -Agonists, by virtue of their central action, have analgesic,  sedative,  and  sympatholytic  e ff ects.  Perioperative  use  of α 2 -agonists may be considered in patients who cannot tolerate β -blockers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  anxiety  reduction  can  be  achieved  by  both conversational and pharmacologic means. Patients are more likely to arrive in the operating room in a relaxed state if there has been a preoperative visit during which the anesthetic to be used was explained in detail and all questions and concerns were addressed. Th e goal of drug-induced sedation and anxiolysis is maximum sedation and/or amnesia without signi fi -cant circulatory or ventilatory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  basic  challenges  during  induction  and  maintenance  of anesthesia in patients with ischemic heart disease are (1) to prevent myocardial ischemia by optimizing myocardial oxygen supply and reducing myocardial oxygen demand, (2) to monitor for ischemia, and (3) to treat ischemia if it develops. Intraoperative events associated with persistent tachycardia, systolic  hypertension,  sympathetic  nervous  system  stimulation, arterial hypoxemia, or hypotension can adversely a ff ect the  patient  with  ischemic  heart  disease  (Table  1-11).  Perioperative  myocardial  injury  is  closely  associated  with  heart rate in vascular surgery patients. A rapid heart rate increases myocardial oxygen requirements and decreases diastolic time for  coronary  blood fl ow and therefore oxygen delivery. Th e increased  oxygen  requirements  produced  by  hypertension are  o ff set  to  some  degree  by  improved  coronary  perfusion. Hyperventilation must be avoided, because hypocapnia may cause  coronary  artery  vasoconstriction.  Maintenance  of  the balance  between  myocardial  oxygen  supply  and  demand  is more important than which speci fi c anesthetic technique or drugs  are  selected  to  produce  anesthesia  and  muscle  relaxation.  Although  iso fl urane  may  decrease  coronary  vascular resistance, predisposing to coronary steal syndrome, there is no evidence that this drug increases the incidence of intraoperative myocardial ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to avoid persistent and excessive changes in heart rate and blood pressure. A common recommendation is to keep the heart rate and blood pressure within 20% of the normal awake value for that patient. However, many episodes

Increased preload of intraoperative myocardial ischemia occur in the absence of hemodynamic  changes. Th ese  episodes  of  myocardial  ischemia may be due to regional decreases in   myocardial perfusion and oxygenation. It is unlikely that this form of ischemia can be prevented by the anesthesiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia in patients with ischemic heart disease can be accomplished with an intravenous induction drug. Ketamine is not a likely choice, because the associated increase in heart rate and blood pressure transiently increases myocardial oxygen requirements. Tracheal intubation is facilitated by administration of succinylcholine or a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial  ischemia  may  accompany  the  sympathetic stimulation that results from direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation. Keeping the duration of direct laryngoscopy short ( ≤ 15 seconds) is useful in minimizing the magnitude and duration of the circulatory  changes  associated  with  tracheal intubation. If the duration of direct laryngoscopy is not likely to  be  brief  or  if  hypertension  already  exists,  it  is  reasonable to consider administering drugs to minimize the sympathetic response.  Laryngotracheal  lidocaine,  intravenous  lidocaine, esmolol, fentanyl, and dexmedetomidine have all been shown to be useful for blunting the increase in heart rate evoked by tracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with normal le ft ventricular function, tachycardia and hypertension are likely to develop in response to intense stimulation, such as during direct laryngoscopy or painful surgical stimulation. Achieving controlled myocardial depression using a volatile anesthetic may be useful in such patients to minimize the increase in sympathetic nervous system activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
24

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall, volatile anesthetics may be bene fi cial in patients with ischemic heart disease because they decrease myocardial oxygen requirements and precondition the myocardium to tolerate ischemic events, or they may be detrimental because they lead to a decrease in blood pressure and an associated reduction in coronary perfusion pressure. Th e AHA guidelines state that it can be bene fi cial to use volatile anesthetic agents during noncardiac surgery for the maintenance of general anesthesia in patients in hemodynamically stable condition at risk for myocardial ischemia.

Th e use of nitrous oxide in patients with a history of coronary artery disease has been questioned since the early 1990s when animal and human studies showed an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, diastolic dysfunction, and subsequent myocardial ischemia with its use. A large multicenter study  is  currently  underway  to  better  de fi ne  the  harmful e ff ects of nitrous oxide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  severely  impaired  le ft ventricular  function may not tolerate  anesthesia-induced  myocardial  depression. Opioids may be selected as the principal anesthetic in these patients. Th e addition of nitrous oxide, a benzodiazepine, or a low-dose volatile anesthetic may be needed, because amnesia cannot be ensured with an opioid anesthetic. However, the addition of nitrous oxide or a volatile anesthetic may be associated with myocardial depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia is an acceptable technique in patients with ischemic heart disease. However, the decrease in blood pressure associated with epidural or spinal anesthesia must be controlled. Prompt treatment of hypotension that exceeds 20% of the preblock blood pressure is necessary. Potential bene fi ts  of  use  of  a  regional  anesthetic  include  excellent pain control, a decreased incidence of deep venous thrombosis in some patients, and the opportunity to continue the block into the postoperative period. However, the incidence of  perioperative  cardiac  morbidity  and  mortality  does  not appear to be signi fi cantly di ff erent for general and regional anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic goals of intraoperative therapy with β -blockers are unclear, and potential interactions with anesthetics  that  cause  myocardial  depression  and  vasodilation must be considered. It seems prudent to maintain the intraoperative heart rate at less than 80 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  choice  of  a  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxant  in patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease  is  in fl uenced  by  the impact these drugs can have on the balance between myocardial  oxygen  delivery  and  myocardial  oxygen  requirements. Muscle relaxants with minimal or no e ff ect on heart rate and systemic blood pressure (vecuronium, rocuronium, cisatracurium) are attractive choices for patients with ischemic  heart  disease. Th e  histamine  release  and  resulting decrease  in  blood  pressure  caused  by  atracurium  make  it less  desirable.  Myocardial  ischemia  has  been  described  in patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease  given  pancuronium, presumably because of the modest increase in heart rate and blood pressure produced by this drug. However, the circulatory changes produced by pancuronium may be useful in o ff setting the negative inotropic and chronotropic e ff ects of some anesthetic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reversal  of  neuromuscular  blockade  with  an  anticholinesterase-anticholinergic  drug  combination  can  be  safely accomplished in patients with ischemic heart disease. Glycopyrrolate, which has much less chronotropic e ff ect than atropine, is preferred in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type of perioperative monitoring is in fl uenced by the complexity  of  the  operative  procedure  and  the  severity  of  the ischemic heart disease. Th e most important goal in selecting monitoring  methods  for  patients  with  ischemic  heart  disease is to select those that allow early detection of myocardial ischemia.  Most  myocardial  ischemia  occurs  in  the  absence of  hemodynamic  alterations,  so  one  should  be  cautious  in endorsing  routine  use  of  expensive  or  complex  monitors  to detect myocardial ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  simplest,  most  cost-e ff ective  method  for  detecting perioperative  myocardial  ischemia  is  electrocardiography . Th e  diagnosis  of  myocardial  ischemia  focuses  on  changes in the ST segment, characterized as elevation or depression of at least 1 mm and T-wave inversions. However, other factors such as alterations in electrolytes can also produce such changes. Th e degree of ST-segment depression parallels the severity of myocardial ischemia. Because visual detection of ST-segment changes is unreliable, computerized ST-segment analysis  has  been  incorporated  into  ECG  monitors.  Traditionally, monitoring of two leads (leads II and V 5 ) has been the standard, but it appears that monitoring three leads (leads II, V 4 , and V 5 , or else V 3 , V 4 , and V 5 ) improves the ability to detect  ischemia. Th ere  is  a  correlation  between  the  lead  of the ECG that detects myocardial ischemia and the anatomic distribution of the diseased coronary artery (Table 1-12). For example, the V 5 lead  ( fift h intercostal space in the anterior axillary line) re fl ects myocardial ischemia in the portion of the  le ft ventricle  supplied  by  the  le ft anterior  descending

<!-- PAGE=? -->
coronary artery (Figure 1-11). Lead II is more likely to detect myocardial  ischemia  occurring  in  the  distribution  of  the right coronary artery. Lead II is also very useful for analysis of cardiac rhythm disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Events other than myocardial ischemia that can cause STsegment  abnormalities  include  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  cardiac  conduction  disturbances,  digitalis  therapy,  electrolyte abnormalities,  and  hypothermia.  However,  in  patients  with known or suspected coronary artery disease, it is reasonable to  assume that intraoperative ST-segment changes represent myocardial ischemia. Th e  occurrence and duration of intraoperative ST-segment changes in high-risk patients are linked to an increased incidence of perioperative MI and adverse cardiac events. Interestingly, the overall incidence of myocardial ischemia is lower in the intraoperative period than that in the preoperative or postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  myocardial  ischemia  can  manifest  as  an acute increase in pulmonary artery occlusion pressure due to changes in le ft ventricular compliance and le ft ventricular systolic performance. If myocardial ischemia is global or involves the papillary muscle, V waves may appear in the pulmonary artery  occlusion  pressure  tracing.  Nonischemic  causes  of increased  pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure  include  an acute  increase  in  ventricular  a ft erload,  an  increase  in  pulmonary  venous  resistance,  and  mitral  regurgitation  due  to nonischemic mechanisms. If only small regions of le ft ventricular myocardium become ischemic, overall ventricular compliance and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure will remain unchanged,  so  the pulmonary  artery  catheter is  a  relatively insensitive method of monitoring for myocardial ischemia. In addition,  pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure  is  measured only intermittently, and the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure is even less sensitive than the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure in detecting a change in le ft ventricular compliance. Pulmonary artery catheter measurements are more useful as a guide in the treatment of myocardial dysfunction. Th ey can be used to guide fl uid replacement, to measure cardiac output, and to calculate systemic vascular resistance and thereby evaluate the e ff ectiveness of vasopressor, vasodilator, or inotropic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indications  for  placing  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter  are in fl uenced  by  the  information  likely  to  be  derived  from  it. Use  of  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter  has  not  been  shown  to be associated with improved cardiac outcomes. Nevertheless, the  value  and  safety  of  pulmonary  artery  catheterization  in selected  patients  are  widely  accepted.  Central  venous  pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure are correlated in patients with ischemic heart disease when the ejection fraction is more than 50%. However, if the ejection fraction is less than 50%, there is no longer a predictable correlation.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e development of new regional ventricular wall motion abnormalities is the accepted standard for the intraoperative diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. Th ese regional wall motion abnormalities  occur  before  ECG  changes  are  seen.  However, segmental wall motion abnormalities may also occur in response to events other than myocardial ischemia. Th e limitations  of transesophageal  echocardiography include  its  cost, the  need  for  extensive  training  in  interpreting  the  images, and the fact that the transducer cannot be inserted until a ft er induction  of  anesthesia,  so  there  is  a  critical  period  during which myocardial ischemia may develop in the absence of this monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of myocardial ischemia should be instituted when there  are  1-mm  ST-segment  changes  on  the  ECG.  Prompt pharmacologic  treatment  of  changes  in  heart  rate  and/or blood  pressure  is  indicated.  Nitroglycerin  is  an  appropriate choice  when  myocardial  ischemia  is  associated  with  a  normal or modestly elevated blood pressure. In this situation, the nitroglycerin-induced coronary vasodilation and decrease in preload facilitate improved subendocardial blood fl ow, but the nitroglycerin-induced decrease in a ft erload does not decrease systemic blood pressure to the point that coronary perfusion pressure  is  jeopardized.  A  persistent  increase  in  heart  rate in  the  setting  of  normal  or  high  blood  pressure  can  also  be treated by administration of a β -blocker such as esmolol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension  is  treated  with  sympathomimetic  drugs  to restore coronary perfusion pressure. In addition to administration of vasoconstrictor drugs, fl uid infusion can be useful to  help  restore  blood  pressure.  Regardless  of  the  treatment, prompt restoration of blood pressure is necessary to maintain pressure-dependent fl ow through narrowed coronary arteries. In  an  unstable  hemodynamic  situation,  circulatory  support with inotropes or an intraaortic balloon pump may be necessary. It may also be necessary to plan for early postoperative cardiac catheterization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although signi fi cant advances have been made in researching and  re fi ning  preoperative  evaluation  and  risk  management strategies, evidence-based strategies that can be adopted in the postoperative period to improve outcome have not yet been developed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goals  of  postoperative  management  are  the  same  as those for intraoperative management: prevent ischemia, monitor  for  myocardial  injury,  and  treat  myocardial  ischemia or infarction. Any situation that leads to prolonged and signi fi cant hemodynamic perturbations can stress the heart. Intraoperative  hypothermia  may  predispose  to  shivering  on awakening, leading to abrupt and dramatic increases in myocardial  oxygen  requirements.  Pain,  hypoxemia,  hypercarbia, sepsis, and hemorrhage also lead to increased myocardial oxygen demand. Th e resulting oxygen supply/demand imbalance in patients with ischemic heart disease can precipitate myocardial ischemia, infarction, or death. Although most adverse cardiac events occur within the fi rst 48 hours postoperatively, delayed cardiac events can occur within the fi rst 30 days and can be the result  of  secondary  stresses.  It  is  imperative  that patients  taking β -blockers  continue  to  receive  these  drugs throughout the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prevention of hypovolemia and hypotension is necessary postoperatively, and not only an adequate intravascular volume but also an adequate hemoglobin concentration must be maintained. Oxygen content and oxygen delivery depend signi fi cantly on the concentration of hemoglobin in blood. Th e degree of anemia that can be safely tolerated in patients with ischemic heart disease remains to be de fi ned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e timing of ventilatory weaning and tracheal extubation is  another aspect of care that requires careful consideration. Early extubation is possible and desirable in many patients as long as they ful fi ll the criteria for extubation. However, patients with  ischemic  heart  disease  can  become  ischemic  during emergence from anesthesia and/or weaning from mechanical ventilation. Any increase in heart rate and/or blood pressure must  be  managed  diligently.  Pharmacologic  therapy  with  a β -blocker or a combined α - and β -blocker, such as labetalol, can be very helpful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous ECG monitoring is useful for detecting postoperative myocardial ischemia, which is o ft en silent. Postoperative myocardial ischemia predicts adverse in-hospital and long-term  cardiac  events.  It  should  be  identi fi ed,  evaluated, and managed, preferably in consultation with a cardiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac transplantation is most o ft en performed in patients with end-stage heart failure due to an idiopathic or ischemic cardiomyopathy. Preoperatively, the ejection fraction is o ft en less than 20%. Irreversible pulmonary hypertension is a contraindication to cardiac transplantation, and most centers do not  consider  candidates  older  than  65  years  of  age  for  this procedure. Active infection and recent pulmonary thromboembolism with pulmonary infarction are additional contraindications to heart transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may come for cardiac transplantation with inotropic, vasodilator, or mechanical circulatory support. Most patients coming  for  cardiac  transplantation  will  not  be  in  a  fasting state and should be considered as having a full stomach. Th ey should be in hemodynamically stable condition before induction of anesthesia. Etomidate is preferred as an induction  agent  because  it  has  little  e ff ect  on  hemodynamics. An opioid technique is o ft en chosen for maintenance of anesthesia.  Volatile  anesthetics  may  produce undesirable degrees of myocardial  depression  and  peripheral  vasodilation.  Nitrous oxide is rarely used because signi fi cant pulmonary hypertension is o ft en present. In addition, there is concern about air

<!-- PAGE=? -->
embolism because large blood vessels are opened during the surgical procedure. Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs that do not cause histamine release are usually selected. Th e ability of pancuronium to increase heart rate and systemic blood pressure modestly may be desirable in some patients. Many patients undergoing cardiac transplantation have coagulation disturbances due to passive congestion of the liver as a result of chronic congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e operative technique includes cardiopulmonary bypass and anastomosis of the aorta, pulmonary artery, and le ft and right atria. Immunosuppressive drugs are usually begun during the preoperative period. Intravascular catheters must be placed using strict aseptic technique. It is necessary to withdraw  the  central  venous  or  pulmonary  artery  catheter  into the superior vena cava when the native heart is removed. Th e catheter is then repositioned into the donor heart. Th ese catheters are o ft en inserted into the central circulation via the le ft internal jugular vein so that the right internal jugular vein is available as an access site when needed to perform endomyocardial biopsies during the postoperative period. Transesophageal  echocardiography is  used  to  monitor  cardiac  function intraoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft er  cessation  of  cardiopulmonary  bypass,  an  inotropic drug may be needed brie fl y to maintain myocardial contractility and heart rate. Th erapy to lower pulmonary vascular resistance may also be necessary and includes administration of a pulmonary vasodilator such as isoproterenol, a prostaglandin, nitric oxide, or a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Th e denervated transplanted heart initially assumes an intrinsic heart rate of about 110 beats per minute, which re fl ects the absence of normal vagal tone. Stroke volume responds to an increase in preload by the Frank-Starling mechanism. Th ese patients tolerate hypovolemia poorly. Th e transplanted heart does respond to direct-acting  catecholamines,  but  drugs  that  act  by  indirect mechanisms,  such  as  ephedrine,  have  a  less  intense  e ff ect. Vasopressin may be needed to treat severe hypotension unresponsive to catecholamines. Th e heart rate does not change in response to administration of anticholinergic or anticholinesterase drugs. About one quarter of patients develop bradycardia a ft er transplantation that requires insertion of a permanent cardiac pacemaker.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac transplant patients may require β -adrenergic stimulants for 3 to 4 days a ft er transplantation. Early postoperative morbidity  related  to  heart  transplantation  surgery  usually involves  sepsis  and/or  rejection. Th e  most  common  early cause of death is opportunistic infection as a result of immunosuppressive  therapy.  Transvenous  right  ventricular  endomyocardial biopsies are performed to provide early warning of  asymptomatic allogra ft rejection.  Congestive heart failure and development of dysrhythmias are late signs of rejection. Cyclosporine treatment can be associated with drug-induced hypertension that is o ft en resistant to antihypertensive therapy.  Nephrotoxicity  is  another  complication  of  cyclosporine and  tacrolimus  therapy.  Long-term  corticosteroid  use  may result in skeletal demineralization and glucose intolerance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Late complications of cardiac transplantation include development of coronary artery disease in the allogra ft and an increased incidence of cancer. Di ff use obliterative coronary arteriopathy a ff ects cardiac transplant recipients over time, and the ischemic sequelae of this form of coronary artery disease are the principal limitations to long-term survival. Th e arterial disease is restricted to the allogra ft and is present in about one half of cardiac transplant recipients a ft er 5 years. Th e accelerated appearance of this coronary artery disease likely re fl ects a chronic rejection process in the vascular endothelium. Th is process is not unique to cardiac allogra ft s and is thought to be analogous to the chronic immunologically mediated changes seen in other organ allogra ft s (chronic rejection of the kidney, bronchiolitis obliterans in the lungs, vanishing bile duct syndrome in the liver). Th e  clinical  sequelae of this obliterative coronary artery disease include myocardial ischemia, le ft ventricular dysfunction, cardiac dysrhythmias, and sudden death. Th e prognosis for transplant recipients with angiographically established coronary artery disease is poor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any  medical  regimen  involving  long-term  immunosuppression is associated with an increased incidence of cancer, especially lymphoproliferative and cutaneous cancers. Malignancy is responsible for a signi fi cant portion of the mortality  of  heart  transplant  patients.  Most  posttransplantation lymphoproliferative  disease  is  related  to  infection  with  the Epstein-Barr virus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic Considerations in Heart Transplant Recipients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart transplant patients present unique anesthetic challenges because  of  the  hemodynamic  function  of  the  transplanted denervated  heart,  the  side  e ff ects  of  immunosuppressive therapy, the risk of infection, the potential for drug interactions given the complex drug regimens, and the potential for allogra ft rejection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Allogra ft rejection  results  in  progressive  deterioration  of cardiac function. Th e presence and degree of rejection should be noted preoperatively. Th e presence of infection must also be noted preoperatively, because infection is a signi fi cant cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Invasive monitoring requires the use of strict aseptic technique. When hepatic and renal function are normal, there is no contraindication to the use of any anesthetic drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  transplanted  heart  has  no  sympathetic,  parasympathetic, or sensory innervation, and the loss of vagal tone results in a higher than normal resting heart rate. Two P waves are detectable on the ECG a ft er heart transplantation. Th e native sinus node remains intact if a cu ff of atrium is le ft in place to permit surgical anastomosis to the gra ft ed heart. Because the native P wave cannot traverse the suture line, it has no in fl uence on the chronotropic activity of the heart. Carotid sinus massage and Valsalva's maneuver have no e ff ect on heart rate. Th ere is no sympathetic response to direct laryngoscopy and

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
tracheal  intubation,  and  the  denervated  heart  has  a  blunted heart  rate  response  to  light  anesthesia  or  intense  pain. Th e transplanted heart is unable to increase its heart rate immediately in response to hypovolemia or hypotension but responds instead  with  an  increase  in  stroke  volume  via  the  FrankStarling  mechanism. Th e  needed  increase  in  cardiac  output is  dependent on venous return until the heart rate increases a ft er  several  minutes  in  response  to  the  e ff ect  of  circulating catecholamines.  Because α -  and β -adrenergic  receptors  are intact on the transplanted heart, it will eventually respond to circulating catecholamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  dysrhythmias  may  occur  in  heart  transplant patients, perhaps re fl ecting a lack of vagal innervation and/ or increased levels of circulating catecholamines. At rest, the heart rate re fl ects the intrinsic rate of depolarization of the donor sinoatrial node in the absence of any vagal tone. Firstdegree atrioventricular block (an increased PR interval) is common a ft er  cardiac  transplantation.  Some  patients  may require a cardiac pacemaker for treatment of bradydysrhythmias. A surgical transplantation technique that preserves the anatomic integrity of the right atrium by using anastomoses at the level of the superior and inferior vena cava rather than  at  the  mid-atrial  level  results  in  better  preservation of  sinoatrial  node  and  tricuspid  valve  function.  A ff erent denervation renders the cardiac transplant patient incapable of  experiencing angina pectoris in response to myocardial ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESPONSE TO DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Catecholamine  responses  are  di ff erent  in  the  transplanted heart because the intact sympathetic nerves required for normal  uptake  and  metabolism  of  catecholamines  are  absent. Th e density of α and β receptors in the transplanted heart is unchanged, however, and responses to direct-acting sympathomimetic drugs are intact. Epinephrine, isoproterenol, and dobutamine  have  similar  e ff ects  in  normal  and  denervated hearts. Indirect-acting sympathomimetics such as ephedrine have a blunted e ff ect in denervated hearts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vagolytic drugs such as atropine do not increase the heart rate. Pancuronium does not increase the heart rate, and neostigmine and other anticholinesterases do not slow the heart rate of denervated hearts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At presentation heart transplant recipients may have ongoing rejection manifesting as myocardial dysfunction, accelerated coronary  atherosclerosis,  or  dysrhythmias.  All  preoperative drug therapy must be continued, and proper functioning of a cardiac pacemaker must be con fi rmed. Cyclosporine-induced hypertension  may  require  treatment  with  calcium  channelblocking  drugs  or  ACE  inhibitors.  Cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity  may  present  as  an  increased  creatinine  concentration. In such cases anesthetic drugs excreted mainly by renal clearance mechanisms should be avoided. Proper hydration  is  important  and  should  be  con fi rmed  preoperatively, because heart transplant patients are preload dependent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Experience  suggests  that  heart  transplant  recipients  undergoing  noncardiac  surgery  have  monitoring  and  anesthetic requirements  similar  to  those  of  other  patients  undergoing the same surgery. Intravascular volume must be maintained intraoperatively,  because  these  patients  are  preload  dependent and the denervated heart is unable to respond to sudden shi ft s in blood volume with an increase in heart rate. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be considered if the planned procedure is associated with large fl uid shi ft s.  Transesophageal echocardiography is an alternative to invasive hemodynamic  monitoring  in  these  patients.  General  anesthesia  is usually selected because there may be an impaired response to  the  hypotension  associated  with  spinal  or  epidural  anesthesia. Anesthetic management includes avoidance of signi fi -cant vasodilation and acute reductions in preload. Although volatile anesthetics may  produce  myocardial  depression, they  are  usually  well  tolerated  in  heart  transplant  patients who do not have signi fi cant heart failure. Despite reports of cyclosporine-induced  enhanced  neuromuscular  blockade,  it does  not  appear  that  these  patients  require  di ff erent  dosing of  muscle  relaxants  than  normal  patients.  Careful  attention must be paid to appropriate aseptic technique because of the increased susceptibility to infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e exercise ECG is most likely to indicate myocardial ischemia when there is at least 1 mm of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression during or within 4 minutes a ft er exercise. Th e greater the degree of ST-segment depression, the greater the likelihood of signi fi cant coronary disease. When the ST-segment abnormality is associated with angina pectoris and occurs during the early stages of exercise and persists for several minutes a ft er exercise, signi fi -cant coronary artery disease is very likely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Noninvasive  imaging  tests  for  the  detection  of  ischemic heart disease are used when exercise ECG is not possible or interpretation of ST-segment changes would be di ffi cult. Administration of atropine, infusion of dobutamine, institution of cardiac pacing, or administration of a coronary vasodilator such as adenosine or dipyridamole creates cardiac stress. A ft er stress is induced, either echocardiography to assess myocardial function or radionuclide imaging to assess myocardial perfusion is performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ β -Blockers are the principal drug treatment for patients with angina  pectoris.  Long-term  administration  of β -blockers decreases the risk of death and myocardial reinfarction in patients  who  have  had  an  MI,  presumably  by  decreasing myocardial oxygen demand. Th is bene fi t is present even in patients in whom β -blockers were traditionally thought to be contraindicated, such as those with congestive heart failure, pulmonary disease, or advanced age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients with acute coronary syndrome can be categorized based on a 12-lead ECG. Patients with ST elevation at presentation are considered to have STEMI. Patients who have

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 1 ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
29

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ST-segment depression or nonspeci fi c ECG changes can be classi fi ed based on the level of cardiac-speci fi c troponins or CK-MB. Elevation of cardiac-speci fi c biomarkers indicates NSTEMI. If levels of cardiac-speci fi c biomarkers are normal, then unstable angina is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ STEMI  occurs  when  coronary  blood  flow  decreases abruptly. This decrease in blood flow is attributable to acute  thrombus  formation  at  a  site  where  an  atherosclerotic  plaque  fissures,  ruptures,  or  ulcerates,  which creates  a  local  environment  that  favors  thrombogenesis.  Typically,  vulnerable  plaques-that  is,  those  with rich lipid cores and thin fibrous caps-are most prone to rupture. Plaques that rupture are rarely of a size that causes  significant  coronary  obstruction.  By  contrast, flow-restrictive  plaques  that  produce  angina  pectoris and stimulate development of collateral circulation are less likely to rupture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e primary goal in the management of STEMI is reestablishment of blood fl ow in the obstructed coronary artery as soon as possible. Th is can be achieved by reperfusion therapy or coronary angioplasty with or without placement of an intracoronary stent. Th rombolytic therapy is associated with hemorrhagic stroke in 0.3% to 1% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Administration of β -blockers a ft er an acute MI is associated with a signi fi cant decrease in early (in-hospital) and longterm mortality and myocardial reinfarction. Early administration of β -blockers can decrease infarct size by decreasing heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  and  myocardial  contractility. In  the  absence  of  speci fi c  contraindications,  it  is  recommended that all patients receive intravenous β -blockers as soon as possible a ft er acute MI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ NSTEMI and unstable angina result from a reduction in myocardial oxygen supply. Rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic coronary plaque leads to thrombosis, in fl ammation,  and  vasoconstriction.  Embolization  of  platelets  and clot  fragments  into  the  coronary  microvasculature  leads to microcirculatory ischemia and infarction and results in elevation of cardiac biomarker levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Infarction of the anterior wall and/or apex of the le ft ventricle can result in intracardiac thrombus formation in as many as  one  third  of  patients.  Echocardiography  can  be used to detect this thrombus. Th e presence of a le ft ventricular thrombus is an indication for immediate anticoagulation with heparin followed by 6 months of anticoagulation with warfarin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Most  postoperative  MIs  are  NSTEMIs  and  can  be  diagnosed by ECG changes and/or release of cardiac biomarkers.  Two  di ff erent  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  may  be responsible  for  perioperative  MI.  One  is  related  to  acute coronary  thrombosis,  and  the  other  is  the  consequence of increased myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of compromised myocardial oxygen supply.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute MI (1 to 7 days previously), recent MI (8 to 30 days previously),  and  unstable  angina  are  associated  with  the highest risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia, MI, and cardiac death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Coronary  artery  stent  placement  (drug-eluting  or  bare metal stent) is routinely followed by dual antiplatelet therapy  to  prevent  acute  coronary  thrombosis  and  maintain long-term patency of the vessel.  Elective  noncardiac  surgery should be delayed for 6 weeks a ft er a PCI with bare metal stent placement and for at least 12 months a ft er a PCI with drug-eluting stent placement to allow endothelialization of the stent and completion of dual antiplatelet therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  simplest,  most  cost-e ff ective  method  for  detecting perioperative myocardial ischemia is ECG. Th e  diagnosis of myocardial ischemia focuses on changes in the ST segment  characterized  as  elevation  or  depression  of  at  least 1 mm. Th e degree of ST-segment depression parallels the severity of myocardial ischemia. T-wave inversion can also be associated with myocardial ischemia. Events other than myocardial ischemia that can cause ST-segment abnormalities include cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac conduction disturbances, digitalis therapy, electrolyte abnormalities, and hypothermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  transplanted  heart  has  no  sympathetic,  parasympathetic,  or  sensory  innervation,  and  the  loss  of  vagal  tone results in a higher than normal resting heart rate. Carotid sinus  massage  and  Valsalva's  maneuver  have  no  e ff ect on heart rate. Th ere is  no  sympathetic response to direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, and the denervated heart has a blunted heart rate response to light anesthesia or intense pain. Th e transplanted heart is unable to increase its  heart  rate  immediately in response to hypovolemia or hypotension. It responds instead with an increase in stroke volume  via  the  Frank-Starling  mechanism. Th e  needed increase  in  cardiac  output  is  then  dependent  on  venous return.  A ft er  several  minutes,  the  heart  rate  increases in  response  to  the  e ff ect  of  circulating  catecholamines. Because α -  and β -adrenergic  receptors  are  intact  on  the transplanted  heart,  it  eventually  responds  to  circulating catecholamines.

■ One of the late complications of cardiac transplantation is the development of coronary artery disease in the allogra ft . Di ff use  obliterative  coronary  arteriopathy  a ff ects  cardiac transplant recipients over time, and the ischemic sequelae of  this  form  of  coronary  disease  are  the  principal  limitations to long-term survival. Th e arterial disease is restricted to the allogra ft and is present in about one half of cardiac transplant recipients a ft er 5 years. Th e accelerated appearance of this coronary artery disease likely re fl ects a chronic rejection process in the vascular endothelium.
