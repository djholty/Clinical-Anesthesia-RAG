An Updated Report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway

<!-- PAGE=? -->
P RACTICE Guidelines are systematically developed recommendations that assist the practitioner and patient in making decisions about health care. These recommendations may be adopted, modified, or rejected according to clinical needs and constraints and are not intended to  replace  local  institutional  policies.  In  addition,  Practice Guidelines developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists  (ASA)  are  not  intended  as  standards  or  absolute requirements,  and  their  use  cannot  guarantee  any  specific outcome. Practice Guidelines are subject to revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. They provide basic recommendations that are supported by a synthesis and analysis of the current literature, expert and practitioner opinion, open-forum commentary, and clinical feasibility data.

Methodology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A.  Definition of Difficult Airway

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A standard definition of the difficult airway cannot be identified in the available literature. For these Practice Guidelines, a difficult airway is defined as the clinical situation in which a conventionally trained anesthesiologist experiences difficulty with facemask ventilation of the upper airway, difficulty with tracheal intubation, or both. The difficult airway represents a  complex interaction between patient factors, the clinical setting,  and  the  skills  of  the  practitioner.  Analysis  of  this interaction  requires  precise  collection  and  communication of data. The Task Force urges clinicians and investigators to use explicit descriptions of the difficult airway. Descriptions that can be categorized or expressed as numerical values are particularly desirable, because this type of information lends itself  to  aggregate  analysis  and  cross-study  comparisons. Suggested descriptions include, but are not limited to:

Practice Guidelines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Difficult  facemask  or  supraglottic  airway  (SGA)  ventilation  ( e.g. ,  laryngeal  mask  airway  [LMA],  intubating  LMA [ILMA], laryngeal  tube):  It  is  not  possible for the anesthesiologist to provide adequate ventilation because  of  one  or  more  of  the  following  problems: inadequate  mask  or  SGA  seal,  excessive  gas  leak,  or excessive resistance to the ingress or egress of gas. Signs of inadequate ventilation include (but are not limited to)  absent  or  inadequate  chest  movement,  absent  or inadequate breath sounds, auscultatory signs of severe obstruction,  cyanosis,  gastric  air  entry  or  dilatation, decreasing  or  inadequate  oxygen  saturation  (SpO 2 ), absent or inadequate exhaled carbon dioxide, absent or inadequate  spirometric  measures  of  exhaled  gas  flow, and  hemodynamic  changes  associated  with  hypoxemia  or  hypercarbia  ( e.g. ,  hypertension,  tachycardia, arrhythmia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Difficult SGA placement: SGA placement requires multiple  attempts,  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  tracheal pathology.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Difficult laryngoscopy: It is not possible to visualize any portion  of  the  vocal  cords  after  multiple  attempts  at conventional laryngoscopy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Difficult tracheal intubation: Tracheal intubation requires multiple attempts, in the presence or absence of tracheal pathology.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Failed intubation: Placement of the endotracheal tube fails after multiple attempts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
B.  Purposes of the Guidelines for Difficult Airway Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The purpose of these Guidelines is to facilitate the management of the difficult airway and to reduce the likelihood of adverse  outcomes.  The  principal  adverse  outcomes  associated with the difficult airway include (but are not limited to) death, brain injury, cardiopulmonary arrest, unnecessary surgical airway, airway trauma, and damage to the teeth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C.  Focus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The primary focus of these Guidelines is the management of the difficult airway encountered during administration of anesthesia and tracheal intubation. Some aspects of the Guidelines may be relevant in other clinical contexts. The Guidelines do not represent an exhaustive consideration of all manifestations of the difficult airway or all possible approaches to management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
D.  Application

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Guidelines are intended for use by an Anesthesiologists and by individuals who deliver anesthetic care and airway management under the direct supervision of an anesthesiologist. The Guidelines apply to all types of anesthetic care

and airway management delivered in anesthetizing locations and is intended for all patients of all ages.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
E.  Task Force Members and Consultants

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The original Guidelines and the first update were developed by an ASA-appointed Task Force of ten members, consisting of Anesthesiologists in private and academic practices from various geographic areas of the United States and two consulting methodologists from the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The original Guidelines and the first update in 2002 were developed by means of a seven-step process. First, the Task Force reached consensus on the criteria for evidence. Second, original published research studies from peer-reviewed journals relevant to difficult airway management were reviewed and evaluated. Third, expert consultants were asked to: (1) participate  in  opinion  surveys  on  the  effectiveness  of  various difficult airway management recommendations and (2) review and comment on a draft of the Guidelines. Fourth, opinions about the Guideline recommendations were solicited  from  a  sample  of  active  members  of  the  ASA.  Fifth, opinion-based  information  obtained  during  open  forums for the original Guidelines, † and for the previous updated Guidelines, ‡ was  evaluated.  Sixth,  the  consultants  were surveyed to assess their opinions on the feasibility of implementing the updated Guidelines. Seventh, all available information was used to build consensus to finalize the updated Guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 2011, the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters requested that the updated Guidelines published in  2002 be re-evaluated. This update consists of an evaluation  of  literature  published  since  completion  of  the  first update, and an evaluation of new survey findings of expert consultants and ASA members. A summary of recommendations can be found in appendix 1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
F.  Availability and Strength of Evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparation of these updated Guidelines followed a rigorous methodological  process.  Evidence  was  obtained  from  two principal  sources:  scientific  evidence  and  opinion-based evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Scientific evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Scientific evidence used in the development of these Guidelines is based on findings from literature published in peerreviewed  journals.  Literature  citations  are  obtained  from PubMed  and  other  healthcare  databases,  direct  Internet searches,  Task  Force  members,  liaisons  with  other  organizations,  and  from hand searches of references located in reviewed articles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Findings from the aggregated literature are reported in the text of the Guidelines by evidence category, level, and direction.  Evidence  categories  refer  specifically  to  the  strength and  quality  of  the research  design of  the  studies.  Category A  evidence  represents  results  obtained  from  randomized

<!-- PAGE=? -->
controlled  trials  (RCTs),  and  Category  B  evidence  represents  observational  results  obtained  from  nonrandomized study  designs  or  RCTs  without  pertinent  controls.  When available, Category A evidence is given precedence over Category B evidence in the reporting of results. These evidence categories are further divided into evidence levels. Evidence levels refer specifically to the strength and quality of the summarized study findings ( i.e. , statistical findings, type of data, and  the  number  of  studies  reporting/replicating  the  findings) within the two evidence categories. For this document, only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary report for each intervention. Finally, a directional designation  of  benefit,  harm,  or  equivocality  for  each  outcome  is indicated in the summary report.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category A

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RCTs  report  comparative  findings  between  clinical  interventions  for specified outcomes.  Statistically significant ( P  < 0.01)  outcomes  are  designated  as  beneficial  (B)  or harmful (H) for the patient; statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level  1:  The  literature  contains  a  sufficient  number  of RCTs to conduct  meta-analysis,§  and  meta-analytic findings from these aggregated studies are reported as evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level  2:  The  literature  contains  multiple  RCTs,  but  the number of RCTs is not sufficient to conduct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of these Guidelines. Findings from these RCTs are reported as evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 3: The literature contains a single RCT, and findings from this study are reported as evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category B

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Observational studies or RCTs without pertinent comparison  groups  may  permit inference of  beneficial  or  harmful relationships  among  clinical  interventions  and  outcomes. Inferred  findings  are  given  a  directional  designation  of beneficial  (B),  harmful  (H),  or  equivocal  (E).  For  studies that report statistical findings, the threshold for significance is P < 0.01.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 1: The literature contains observational comparisons ( e.g. ,  cohort,  case-control  research  designs)  between clinical interventions for a specified outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level  2:  The  literature  contains  observational  studies  with associative statistics ( e.g. , relative risk, correlation, sensitivity/specificity).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
§  All  meta-analyses  are  conducted  by  the  ASA  methodology group.  Meta-analyses  from  other  sources  are  reviewed  but  not included as evidence in this document.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
‖ When an equal number of categorically distinct responses are obtained, the median value is determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the two middle values. Ties are calculated by a predetermined formula.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level  3:  The  literature  contains  noncomparative  observational  studies  with  descriptive  statistics  ( e.g. ,  frequencies, percentages).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 4: The literature contains case reports.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
insufficient evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The lack of sufficient scientific evidence in the literature may occur when the evidence is either unavailable ( i.e. , no pertinent  studies  found)  or  inadequate.  Inadequate  literature cannot be used to assess relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes, since such literature does not permit a clear interpretation of findings due to methodological concerns ( e.g. , confounding in study design or implementation) or does not meet the criteria for content as defined in the 'Focus' of the Guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opinion-based evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  opinion-based  evidence  ( e.g. ,  survey  data,  open-forum testimony, Internet-based comments, letters, and editorials) relevant  to  each  topic  was  considered  in  the  development of  these  updated  Guidelines.  However,  only  the  findings obtained from formal surveys are reported.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opinion surveys were developed for this update by the Task Force to address each clinical intervention identified in the document. Identical surveys were distributed to expert consultants and ASA members.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category A: Expert Opinion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Survey findings from Task Force-appointed expert consultants are reported in summary form in the text, with a complete listing of survey responses reported in appendix 2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category B: Membership Opinion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Survey findings from a random sample of active ASA members are reported in summary form in the text, with a complete listing of survey responses reported in appendix 2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Survey  responses  from  expert  and  membership  sources are recorded using a five-point scale and summarized based on median values. ‖

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Strongly  Agree: Median  score  of  5  (At  least  50%  of  the responses are 5)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Agree: Median score of 4 (At least 50% of the responses are 4 or 4 and 5)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Equivocal: Median score of 3 (At least 50% of the responses are 3, or no other response category or combination of similar categories contain at least 50% of the responses)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disagree: Median score of 2 (At least 50% of responses are 2 or 1 and 2)

I.  Evaluation of the Airway

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History. Although  there  is  insufficient  literature  to  evaluate the efficacy of conducting a directed medical history or reviewing previous medical records to identify the presence of a difficult airway, the Task Force points out the obvious value  of  these  activities.  Based  on  recognized  associations between a difficult airway and a variety of patient characteristics, some features of a patient's medical history or previous medical records may be related to the likelihood of encountering a difficult airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Observational studies of nonselected patients report associations between several preoperative patient characteristics ( e.g. ,  age,  obesity,  obstructive  sleep  apnea,  history  of  snoring) and difficult laryngoscopy or intubation ( Category B2-H evidence ). 1-6 Observational studies report difficult intubation or extubation occurring in patients with mediastinal masses ( Category B3-H evidence ). 7,8

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Case  reports  of  difficult  laryngoscopy  or  intubation among  patients  with  a  variety  of  acquired  or  congenital disease  states  ( e.g. ,  ankylosis,  degenerative  osteoarthritis, subglottic stenosis, lingual thyroid or tonsillar hypertrophy, Treacher-Collins, Pierre Robin or Down syndromes) are also reported ( Category B4-H evidence ). 9-18

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  consultants  and  ASA  members  strongly  agree  that an airway history should be conducted, whenever feasible, before the initiation of anesthetic care and airway management in all patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical Examination. Observational studies of nonselected patients report associations between certain anatomical features ( e.g. , physical features of head and neck) and the likelihood of a difficult airway ( Category B2-H evidence ). 19-21 The presence of upper airway pathologies or anatomical anomalies may be identified by conducting a pre-procedure physical examination. There is insufficient published evidence to evaluate the predictive value of multiple features of the airway physical examination versus single features in predicting the presence of a difficult airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The consultants and ASA members strongly agree that an airway physical examination should be conducted, whenever feasible, before the initiation of anesthetic care and airway management in all patients. The consultants and ASA members strongly agree that multiple features# should be assessed during a physical examination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional Evaluation. The airway history or physical examination  may  provide  indications  for  additional  diagnostic

<!-- PAGE=? -->
# Including, but not limited to: length of upper incisors, relation of maxillary and mandibular incisors during normal jaw closure and voluntary protrusion, interincisor distance, visibility of uvula, shape of  palate,  compliance  of  mandibular  space,  thyromental  distance, length and thickness of neck, and range of motion of head and neck.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
testing  in  some  patients.  Observational  studies  and  case reports indicate that certain diagnostic tests ( e.g. ,  radiography, computed tomography scans, fluoroscopy) can identify a variety of acquired or congenital features in patients with difficult airways ( Category B3-B/B4-B evidence ). 22-33 The literature does not provide a basis for using specific diagnostic tests as routine screening tools in the evaluation of the difficult airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  consultants  and  ASA  members  strongly  agree  that additional evaluation may be indicated in some patients to characterize the likelihood or nature of the anticipated airway difficulty.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations for Evaluation of the Airway

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History. An airway history should be conducted, whenever feasible, before the initiation of anesthetic care and airway management in all patients. The intent of the airway history is to detect medical, surgical, and anesthetic factors that may indicate the presence of a difficult airway. Examination of previous anesthetic records, if available in a timely manner, may yield useful information about airway management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical  Examination. An  airway  physical  examination should be conducted, whenever feasible, before the initiation of  anesthetic  care  and  airway  management  in  all  patients. The intent of this examination is to detect physical characteristics that may indicate the presence of a difficult airway. Multiple airway features should be assessed (table 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional  Evaluation. Additional  evaluation  may  be  indicated in some patients to characterize the likelihood or nature of the anticipated airway difficulty. The findings of the airway history and physical examination may be useful in guiding the selection of specific diagnostic tests and consultation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
II.  Basic Preparation for Difficult Airway Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Basic preparation for difficult airway management includes: (1) availability of equipment for management of a difficult airway ( i.e. , portable storage unit), (2) informing the patient with a known or suspected difficult airway, (3) assigning an individual  to  provide  assistance  when  a  difficult  airway  is encountered, (4) preanesthetic preoxygenation by mask, and (5) administration of supplemental oxygen throughout the process of difficult airway management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  literature  is  insufficient  to  evaluate  the  benefits  of the availability of difficult airway management equipment, informing the patient of a known or suspected difficult airway, or assigning an individual to provide assistance when a difficult airway is encountered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One  RCT  indicates  that  preanesthetic  preoxygenation by  mask  maintains  higher  oxygen  saturation  values  compared  with  room  air  controls  ( Category  A3-B  evidence ). 34 Two RCTs indicate that 3 min of preanesthetic preoxygenation maintains higher oxygen saturation values compared with 1 min of preanesthetic preoxygenation ( Category A2-B evidence ). 35,36 Meta-analysis  of  RCTs  indicate  that  oxygen

<!-- PAGE=? -->
saturation  levels  after  preoxygenation  are  equivocal  when comparing  preoxygenation  for  3 min  with  fast-track  preoxygenation of four maximal breaths in 30 s ( Category A1-E evidence ). 37-41 Three  RCTs  indicate  that  times  to  desaturation thresholds of 93-95% oxygen concentration are longer for 3  min of preoxygenation ( Category A2-B evidence ). 37,41,42 Meta-analysis  of  RCTs  comparing  postextubation  supplemental oxygen with no supplemental oxygen indicates lower frequencies  of  arterial  desaturation  during  transport  with supplemental oxygen to or in the postanesthesia care unit ( Category A1-B evidence ). 43-48 Subjects in the above studies do not exclusively consist of patients with difficult airways.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  consultants  and  ASA  members  strongly  agree  that at  least  one  portable  storage  unit  that  contains  specialized equipment for difficult airway management should be readily  available.  The  consultants  and  ASA  members  strongly agree  that  if  a  difficult  airway  is  known  or  suspected,  the anesthesiologist should: (1) inform the patient (or responsible person) of the special risks and procedures pertaining to management of the difficult airway, (2) ascertain that there is at least one additional individual who is immediately available to serve as an assistant in difficult airway management, (3)  administer  facemask  preoxygenation  before  initiating management of  a  difficult  airway,  and  (4)  actively  pursue opportunities  to  deliver  supplemental  oxygen  throughout the process of difficult airway management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations for Basic Preparation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At least one portable storage unit that contains specialized equipment for difficult airway management should be readily available (table 2). If a difficult airway is known or suspected, the following steps are recommended:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inform the patient (or responsible person) of the special risks and procedures pertaining to management of the difficult airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascertain that there is at least one additional individual who is immediately available to serve as an assistant in difficult airway management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administer  facemask  preoxygenation  before  initiating management  of  the  difficult  airway.  The  uncooperative or pediatric patient may impede opportunities for preoxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Actively  pursue  opportunities  to  deliver  supplemental  oxygen  throughout  the  process  of  difficult  airway management. Opportunities for  supplemental  oxygen administration include (but are not limited to) oxygen delivery by nasal cannulae, facemask, or LMA, insufflation; and oxygen delivery by facemask, blow-by, or nasal cannulae after extubation of the trachea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
III.  Strategy for Intubation of the Difficult Airway

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A preplanned preinduction strategy includes the consideration of various interventions designed to facilitate intubation should  a  difficult  airway  occur.  Noninvasive  interventions intended to manage a difficult airway include, but are not

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesiology 2013; 118:XX-XX

<!-- PAGE=? -->
limited to: (1) awake intubation, (2) video-assisted laryngoscopy,  (3)  intubating  stylets  or  tube-changers,  (4)  SGA  for ventilation ( e.g. , LMA, laryngeal tube), (5) SGA for intubation ( e.g. , ILMA), (6) rigid laryngoscopic blades of varying design  and  size,  (7)  fiberoptic-guided  intubation,  and  (8) lighted stylets or light wands.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Awake  Intubation. Studies with observational findings indicate that awake  fiberoptic intubation is successful in  88-100%  of  difficult  airway  patients  (Category  B3-B evidence). 49-53 Case reports using other methods for awake intubation ( e.g. , blind tracheal intubation, intubation through  supraglottic  devices,  optically  guided  intubation) also report success with difficult airway patients (Category B4-B evidence). 12,54-61

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Video-assisted Laryngoscopy. Meta-analyses of RCTs comparing video-assisted laryngoscopy with direct laryngoscopy in patients with predicted or simulated difficult airways report improved  laryngeal  views,  a  higher  frequency  of  successful intubations, and a higher frequency of first attempt intubations with video-assisted laryngoscopy (Category A1-B evidence); no differences in time to intubation, airway trauma, lip/gum trauma, dental trauma, or sore throat were reported (Category  A1-E  evidence). 62-70 One  RCT  comparing  the use  of  video-assisted  laryngoscopy  with  Macintosh-assisted intubation reported no significant differences inthe degree of cervical spine deviation (Category A3-E evidence). 69 A study with  observational  findings  and  four  case  reports  indicate that airway injury can occur during intubation with videoassisted laryngoscopy (Category B3/B4-H evidence). 71-75

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intubating Stylets or Tube-Changers. Observational studies report successful intubation in 78-100% of difficult airway patients when intubating stylets were used ( Category B3-B evidence ). 76-81 Reported complications from intubating stylets include mild mucosal bleeding and sore throat ( Category B3-H evidence ). 80 Reported complications after the use of a tube-changer or airway exchange catheter include lung laceration and gastric perforation ( Category B4-H evidence ). 82,83 SGAs for Ventilation. RCTs comparing the LMA with facemask  for  ventilation  were  only  available  for  nondifficult airway patients. Case reports indicate that use of the LMA can maintain or restore ventilation for adult difficult airway patients  ( Category  B4-B  evidence ). 84-86 T wo  observational studies indicate that desaturation (SpO 2 < 90%) frequencies of  0-6%  occur  when  the  LMA  is  used  for  pediatric difficult  airway  patients  ( Category  B3-H  evidence ). 87,88 An observational  study  reports  the  LMA  providing  successful rescue ventilation in 94.1% of patients who cannot be mask ventilated or intubated ( Category B3-B evidence ). 89 Reported complications  of  LMA  use  with  difficult  airway  patients include bronchospasm, difficulty in swallowing, respiratory obstruction, laryngeal nerve injury, edema, and hypoglossal nerve paralysis ( Category B4-H evidence ). 90-93 One observational  study  reports  that  the  laryngeal  tube  provides  adequate ventilation for 95% of patients with pharyngeal and laryngeal tumors. 94

ILMA. RCTs comparing the ILMA with standard laryngoscopic intubation were only available for nondifficult airway patients. Observational studies report successful intubation in  71.4-100% of difficult airway patients when an ILMA was used ( Category B3-B evidence ). 95-100 One observational study indicated that when the ILMA is used with a simulated difficult airway using a semirigid collar, 3 of 10 patients were successfully  intubated  ( Category  B3-B  evidence ). 101 RCTs comparing  the  fiberoptic  ILMA  with  standard  fiberoptic intubation  report  a  higher  frequency  of  first  attempt  successful intubation for patients with predicted or simulated difficult  airways  ( Category  A2-B  evidence ). 102,103 Reported complications from ILMAs include sore throat, hoarseness, and pharyngeal edema ( Category B3-H evidence ). 99

Observational  studies  indicate  that  the  use  of  rigid laryngoscopic  blades  of  alternative  design  may  improve glottic  visualization  and  facilitate  successful  intubation  for difficult airway patients ( Category B3-B evidence ). 104,105 Fiberoptic-guided Intubation. Observational studies report successful  fiberoptic  intubation  in  87-100%  of  difficult airway patients ( Category B3-B evidence ). 106-117 Three RCTs comparing rigid fiberscopes (UpsherScopes, WuScopes, and Bullard laryngoscopes) with rigid direct laryngoscopy report equivocal  findings  for  successful  intubation  and  time  to intubate;  two  of  these  studies  used  simulated  difficult  airways, and the third contained only patients with Mallampati 3-4 scores ( Category A2-E evidence ). 118-120 Lighted  Stylets  or  Light  Wands. Observational studies report successful intubation in 96.8-100% of difficult airway patients when lighted stylets or light wands were used ( Category B3-B evidence ). 120-125 Two RCTs report equivocal findings when comparing lighted stylets with direct laryngoscopy ( Category A2-E evidence ). 126,127 vational  findings  report  that  capnography  or  end-tidal carbon  dioxide  monitoring  confirms  tracheal  intubation Category  B3-B

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  consultants  and  ASA  members  strongly  agree  that the  anesthesiologist  should  have  a preplanned  strategy for intubation of the difficult airway. The consultants and ASA members strongly agree that the strategy for intubation of the difficult airway should include the identification of a primary or preferred approach to: (1) awake intubation, (2) the patient who can be adequately ventilated but who is difficult to intubate, and (3) the life-threatening situation in which the patient cannot be ventilated or intubated. The consultants and ASA members strongly agree that the strategy for intubation of the difficult airway should include the identification  of  alternative  approaches  that  can  be  used  if  the primary approach fails or is not feasible. The consultants and ASA members strongly agree that  the  strategy  for  intubation of the difficult airway should include confirmation of tracheal intubation ( e.g. , capnography).

Recommendations for Strategy for Intubation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  anesthesiologist  should  have  a  preformulated  strategy for intubation of the difficult airway. The algorithm shown in  figure  1  is  a  recommended  strategy.  This  strategy  will depend, in part, on the anticipated surgery, the condition of the patient, and the skills and preferences of the anesthesiologist.  The  recommended strategy for intubation of the difficult airway includes:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An assessment of the likelihood and anticipated clinical impact of six basic problems that may occur alone or in combination: (1) difficulty with patient cooperation or consent, (2) difficult mask ventilation, (3) difficult SGA placement, (4) difficult laryngoscopy, (5) difficult intubation, and (6) difficult surgical airway access.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A consideration of the relative clinical merits and feasibility  of  four  basic  management  choices:  (1)  awake intubation versus intubation after induction of general anesthesia,  (2)  noninvasive  techniques versus invasive techniques ( i.e. , surgical or percutaneous airway) for the initial  approach  to  intubation,  (3)  video-assisted  laryngoscopy as an initial approach to intubation, and (4) preservation versus ablation of spontaneous ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The identification of a primary or preferred approach to:  (1)  awake  intubation,  (2)  the  patient  who  can  be adequately  ventilated  but  is  difficult  to  intubate,  and (3)  the  life-threatening  situation  in  which  the  patient cannot be ventilated or intubated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  identification  of  alternative  approaches  that  can be used if the primary approach fails or is not feasible (table 3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The uncooperative or pediatric patient may restrict the options for difficult airway  management, particularly  options  that  involve  awake  intubation. Airway management in the uncooperative or pediatric  patient  may  require  an  approach  ( e.g. , intubation attempts after induction of general anesthesia) that might not be regarded as a primary approach in a cooperative patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The conduct of surgery using local anesthetic infiltration  or  regional  nerve  blockade  may  provide an  alternative  to  the  direct  management  of  the difficult airway, but this approach does not represent a definitive solution to the presence of a difficult airway, nor  does  it  obviate  the  need  for  a  preformulated strategy for intubation of the difficult airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Confirmation of tracheal intubation using capnography or end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring.

IV.  Strategy for Extubation of the Difficult Airway

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The literature does not provide a sufficient basis for evaluating  the  benefits  of  an  extubation  strategy  for  the  difficult airway. For purposes of this Guideline, an extubation strategy is considered to be a logical extension of the intubation strategy.

The ASA members agree and the consultants strongly agree that the preformulated extubation strategy should include consideration of the short-term use of a device that can serve as a guide for expedited reintubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations for Extubation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthesiologist should have a preformulated strategy for extubation of the difficult airway. This strategy will depend, in part, on the surgery, the condition of the patient, and the skills and preferences of the anesthesiologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The recommended strategy for extubation of the difficult airway includes consideration of:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The relative merits of awake extubation versus extubation before the return of consciousness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General clinical factors that may produce an adverse impact on ventilation after the patient has been extubated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An airway management plan that can be implemented if the patient is not able to maintain adequate ventilation after extubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Short-term use of a device that can serve as a guide for expedited reintubation. This type of device can be a stylet (intubating bougie) or conduit. Stylets or intubating bougies are usually inserted through the lumen of the tracheal  tube  and  into  the  trachea  before  the  tracheal tube is removed. Stylets or intubating bougies mayinclude a hollow core that can be used to provide a temporary means of oxygenation and ventilation. Conduits are usually inserted through the mouth and can be used for supraglottic ventilation and intubation. The ILMA and LMA are examples of conduits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
V.  Follow-up Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Follow-up care includes: (1) documentation of difficult airway and management and (2) informing and advising the patient (or responsible person) of the occurrence and potential  complications associated with the difficult airway. The literature is insufficient to evaluate the benefits of follow-up care for difficult airway patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  consultants  and  ASA  members  strongly  agree  that the  anesthesiologist  should:  (1)  document  the  presence and  nature  of  the  airway  difficulty  in  the  medical  record, (2) inform the patient or responsible person of the airway difficulty that was  encountered,  and  (3) evaluate  and follow-up  with  the  patient  for  potential  complications  of difficult  airway  management.  The  consultants  and  ASA members strongly agree that the patient should be advised of  the  potential  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  associated with life-threatening complications of difficult airway management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations for Follow-up Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  anesthesiologist  should  document  the  presence  and nature  of  the  airway  difficulty  in  the  medical  record.  The intent of this documentation is to guide and facilitate the delivery of future care. Aspects of documentation that may prove helpful include:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  description  of  the  airway  difficulties  that  were  encountered. The description should distinguish between difficulties encountered in facemask or SGA ventilation and difficulties encountered in tracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A description of the various  airway  management techniques that were used. The description should indicate the extent to which each of the techniques served a beneficial or detrimental role in management of the difficult airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthesiologist should inform the patient (or responsible person) of the airway difficulty that was encountered.  The  intent  of  this  communication  is  to  provide  the patient (or responsible person) with a role in guiding and facilitating  the  delivery  of  future  care.  The  information conveyed may include (but is not limited to) the presence of a difficult airway, the apparent reasons for difficulty, how the intubation was accomplished, and the implications for future care. Notification systems, such as a written report or letter to the patient, a written report in the medical chart, communication with the patient's surgeon or primary caregiver,  a  notification  bracelet  or  equivalent  identification device, or chart flags, may be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthesiologist should evaluate and follow-up with the  patient  for  potential  complications  of  difficult  airway management. These complications include (but are not limited to) edema, bleeding, tracheal and esophageal per  foration, pneumothorax, and aspiration. The patient should be advised of the potential clinical signs and symptoms associated with life-threatening  complications  of  difficult  airway  management. These signs and symptoms include (but are not limited to) sore throat, pain or swelling of the face and neck, chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema, and difficulty swallowing.

For the literature review, potentially relevant clinical studies were identified via electronic and manual searches of the literature.  The  updated  electronic  search  covered  an  11-yr period from 2002 through 2012. The manual search covered a 16-yr period from 1997 through 2012. Over 400 citations that  addressed  topics  related  to  the  evidence  linkages  were identified. These articles were reviewed and combined with pre-2002 articles  used  in  the  original  Guidelines,  resulting in a total of 693 articles that contained airway management data. Of these, 253 contained data pertaining specifically to difficult  airway  management.  The  remaining  440  articles used nondifficult airway patients or an inseparable mix of difficult and nondifficult airway patients as subjects, and findings from these articles are not considered direct evidence. A complete bibliography used to develop these updated Guidelines, organized by section, is available as Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/ALN/A903.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initially,  each  pertinent  study  finding  was  classified  and summarized to determine meta-analysis potential. The original Guidelines reported literature pertaining to seven clinical interventions that contained enough studies with well-defined experimental designs and statistical information to conduct formal meta-analyses. New literature pertaining to two clinical interventions contained enough studies with well-defined experimental designs and statistical information sufficient for meta-analyses. These interventions were: (1) preoxygenation: 3-5 min  of  breathing  oxygen versus four  maximal  breaths, and  (2)  postextubation  supplemental  oxygen:  delivery  by mask, blow-by, or nasal cannulae versus room air.

General variance-based effect-size estimates or combined probability  tests  were  obtained  for  continuous  outcome measures, and Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios were obtained

<!-- PAGE=? -->
for dichotomous outcome measures. Two combined probability tests were used as follows: (1) the Fisher combined test, producing chi-square values based on logarithmic transformations of the reported P values  from the  independent  studies,  and  (2)  the  Stouffer  combined test,  providing  weighted  representation  of  the  studies  by weighting  each  of  the  standard  normal  deviates  by  the size  of  the  sample.  An  odds  ratio  procedure  based  on  the Mantel-Haenszel method for combining study results using 2  ×  2 tables was used with outcome frequency information. An acceptable significance  level  was  set  at P <  0.01  (onetailed). Tests  for  heterogeneity  of  the  independent  studies were  conducted  to  ensure  consistency  among  the  study results. DerSimonian-Laird random-effects odds ratios were obtained  when  significant  heterogeneity  was  found  ( P  < 0.01). To control for potential publishing bias, a 'fail-safe n' value was calculated. No search for unpublished studies was conducted, and no reliability tests for locating research results were performed.  To be accepted as significant findings, Mantel-Haenszel  odds  ratios  must  agree  with  combined test results whenever both types of data are assessed. In the absence of Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios, findings from both the Fisher and weighted Stouffer combined tests must agree with each other to be acceptable as significant.

New meta-analytic findings were obtained for the following evidence linkages:  (1) preoxygenation for 3-5 min versus 4 deep breaths, (2) videolaryngoscope versus direct laryngoscopy, and (3) supplemental oxygen after extubation (table 4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the original Guidelines,  interobserver  agreement among Task Force members and two methodologists was established by interrater reliability testing. Agreement levels using a kappa ( κ ) statistic for two-rater agreement pairs were as follows: (1) type of study design, κ = 0.64-0.78; (2) type of analysis, κ = 0.78-0.85; (3) evidence linkage assignment, κ =  0.89-0.95;  and  (4)  literature  inclusion  for  database, κ = 0.62-1.00. Three-rater chance-corrected agreement values were: (1) study design, Sav = 0.73, Var (Sav) = 0.008; (2) type of analysis, Sav = 0.80, Var (Sav) = 0.008; (3) linkage assignment,  Sav  =  0.93,  Var  (Sav)  =  0.003;  (4)  literature database inclusion, Sav = 0.80, Var (Sav) = 0.032. These values represent moderate to high levels of agreement. For the updated Guidelines, the same two methodologists involved in the original Guidelines conducted the literature review.

B.  consensus-Based evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consensus was obtained from multiple sources, including: (1) survey opinion from consultants who were selected based on their knowledge or expertise in difficult airway management, (2) survey opinions solicited from active members of the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists,  (3)  testimony for the previous update from attendees of a publicly held open-forum at a major national anesthesia meeting ‡‡ , (4) Internet commentary, and (5) Task Force opinion and interpretation.  The  survey  rate  of  return  was  63%  (n  =  66  of 105)  for  the  consultants  (table  5),  and  302  surveys  were

received from active American Society of Anesthesiologists members (table 6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An additional survey was sent to the expert consultants asking them to indicate which, if any, of the evidence linkages would change their clinical practices if the Guideline update was instituted. The rate of return was 24% (n = 25 of 105). The percent of responding consultants expecting no change associated with each linkage were as follows: (1)  airway  history  =  84%,  (2)  airway  physical  examination =88%, (3) preparation of patient and equipment = 80%, and (4) difficult airway strategy = 80%, extubation strategy  =64%  and  follow-up  care  =  72%.  Eighty-eight percent of the respondents indicated that the Guidelines would have no effect on the amount of time spent on a typical case, and 12% indicated that there would be an increase  of  the  amount  of  time  spent  on  a  typical  case with  the  implementation  of  these  Guidelines.  Hundred percent indicated that new equipment, supplies, or training  would not be needed to implement the Guidelines, and 100% indicated that implementation of the Guidelines  would  not  require  changes  in  practice  that  would affect costs.

table 1. Components of the Preoperative Airway Physical Examination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This table displays some findings of the airway physical examination that may suggest the presence of a difficult intubation. The decision to examine some or all of the airway components shown on this table is dependent on the clinical context and judgment of the practitioner. The table is not intended as a mandatory or exhaustive list of the components of an airway examination. The order of presentation in this table follows the 'line of sight' that occurs during conventional oral laryngoscopy.
