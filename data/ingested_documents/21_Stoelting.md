Epidermolysis Bullosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic diseases of mucous membranes and skin, particularly the oropharynx and esophagus.  Epidermolysis  bullosa  can  be  categorized  as  simplex, junctional,  and  dystrophic.  In  the  simplex  type,  epidermal cells are fragile because of mutations of genes encoding keratin intermediate fi lament proteins. In the dystrophic types the genetic mutation appears to be in the gene encoding the type of collagen that is the major component of anchoring fi brils.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidermolysis  bullosa  is  characterized  by  bulla  formation (blistering) resulting from intercellular separation within the epidermis followed by fl uid accumulation. Bulla formation is

typically initiated when lateral shearing forces are applied to the skin. Pressure applied perpendicular to the skin is not as great a hazard. Bullae can form a ft er even minimal trauma and can even develop spontaneously.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  simplex  form  of  epidermolysis  bullosa  has  a  benign course and development is normal. By contrast, patients with the  junctional  form  of  epidermolysis  bullosa  rarely  survive beyond early childhood. Most die of sepsis. Features that distinguish  junctional  epidermolysis  bullosa  from  other  forms are generalized blistering beginning at birth, absence of scar formation,  and  generalized  mucosal  involvement  (gastrointestinal,  genitourinary,  respiratory  tracts).  Manifestations  of epidermolysis  bullosa  dystrophica  include  severe  scarring with fusion of the digits (pseudosyndactyly), constriction of the  oral  aperture  (microstomia),  and  esophageal  stricture. Th e teeth are o ft en dysplastic. Malnutrition, anemia, electrolyte derangements, and hypoalbuminemia are common, most likely re fl ecting chronic infection, debilitation, and renal dysfunction. Survival beyond the second decade is unusual. Diseases associated with epidermolysis bullosa include porphyria, amyloidosis, multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, and hypercoagulable states. Mitral valve prolapse may also accompany this disorder.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of epidermolysis bullosa is symptomatic and supportive. Many of these patients are receiving corticosteroids. Infection of bullae with Staphylococcus aureus or β -hemolytic streptococci is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental  corticosteroids  may  be  indicated  during  the perioperative period if patients have been receiving long-term treatment  with  these  drugs. Th e  main  anesthetic  concerns in  patients  with  epidermolysis  bullosa  center  on  the  serious complications  that  can  occur  if  proper  precautions  are  not taken  during  instrumentation.  Avoidance  of  trauma  to  the skin and mucous membranes is crucial. Bulla formation can be caused by trauma from tape, blood pressure cu ff s, tourniquets, adhesive electrodes, and rubbing of the skin with alcohol wipes. Blood pressure cu ff s should be padded with a loose cotton dressing. Electrodes should have the adhesive portion removed. Petroleum jelly gauze can help hold the electrodes in place. Anything that touches a patient should be well padded. Intravenous and intraarterial catheters should be sutured or held in place with gauze wraps rather than tape. A nonadhesive pulse oximetry sensor should be used. A so ft foam, sheepskin, or gel pad should be placed under the patient. All creases should be removed from the linen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trauma from the anesthetic face mask must be minimized by gentle application against the face. Lubrication of the face and mask with cortisol ointment or another lubricant can be helpful. Upper airway instrumentation should be minimized, because the  squamous epithelium lining  the  oropharynx  and  esophagus is very susceptible to trauma. Frictional trauma to the oropharynx, such as that produced by an oral airway, can result in formation of large intraoral bullae and/or extensive hemorrhage from  denuded  mucosa.  Nasal  airways  are  equally  hazardous. Esophageal stethoscopes should be avoided. Hemorrhage from ruptured oral bullae has been treated successfully by application of epinephrine-soaked gauze directly to the bullae.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interestingly, endotracheal intubation has not been associated with laryngeal or tracheal complications in patients with epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica. Indeed, laryngeal involvement is rare in this form of the disease, and tracheal bullae have  not  been  reported. Th is fi nding  is  consistent  with  the greater resistance of columnar epithelium to disruption compared with fragile squamous epithelium. Generous lubrication of the laryngoscope blade with cortisol ointment and/or petroleum jelly and selection of a smaller-than-usual endotracheal tube are recommended. Chronic scarring of the oral cavity can result in a narrow oral aperture and immobility of the tongue, which  makes  tracheal  intubation  di ffi cult.  A ft er  intubation, the tube must be carefully immobilized with so ft cloth  bandages to prevent movement in the oropharynx, and the tube must be positioned so that it does not exert lateral forces at the corners of the mouth. Tape is not used to hold the endotracheal tube in place. Oropharyngeal suctioning can lead to lifethreatening bulla formation. Th e risk of pulmonary aspiration may be increased in the presence of esophageal stricture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyria cutanea tarda has been reported to occur with increased  frequency  in  patients  with  epidermolysis  bullosa. Th is  type  of  porphyria  does  not  have  the  same  implications for management of anesthesia as acute intermittent porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Propofol  and  ketamine  are  useful  for  avoiding  airway manipulation when the operative procedure does not require controlled  ventilation  or  skeletal  muscle  relaxation.  Despite the  presence  of  dystrophic  skeletal  muscle,  there  is  no  evidence that these patients are at increased risk of a hyperkalemic response when treated with succinylcholine. Th ere are no known contraindications to the use of volatile anesthetics in these patients. As alternatives to general anesthesia, regional anesthetic techniques (spinal, epidural, brachial plexus block) have been recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pemphigus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pemphigus refers to a group of chronic autoimmune blistering (vesiculobullous) diseases that may involve extensive areas of the skin and mucous membranes. Cutaneous pemphigus is characterized by bullae of the skin and mucous membranes (mouth,  upper  airway,  genitalia).  Two  histopathologically and clinically di ff erent types of pemphigus have been recognized:  pemphigus  vulgaris  and  pemphigus  foliaceus.  Cutaneous  pemphigus  closely  resembles  the  oral  manifestations of  epidermolysis  bullosa  dystrophica.  Involvement  of  the oropharynx is present in approximately 50% of patients with pemphigus. Extensive oropharyngeal involvement makes eating painful, and patients may decrease oral intake to the point that severe malnutrition develops. Denuding of skin and bulla formation can result in signi fi cant fl uid and protein losses. Th e risk of secondary infection is substantial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder in which circulating antibodies attack antigenic sites on the surface of epidermal cells,  which  results  in  destruction  of  these  cells.  Pemphigus may  be  associated  with  underlying  malignancy,  especially lymphoreticular cancer. As with epidermolysis bullosa, there may be an absence of intercellular bridges that normally prevent  the  separation  of  epidermal  cells. Th erefore,  frictional trauma can result in bulla formation. Occasionally, infection or  drug  sensitivity  is  the  inciting  event  for  bulla  formation. Pemphigus vulgaris is the most common form of pemphigus and is also the most signi fi cant because of its high incidence of oropharyngeal lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  pemphigus  with  corticosteroids  has  decreased the  mortality  associated  with  this  disease  from  70%  to  5%. Biologic  and  immunosuppressive  therapy  with  mycophenolate  mofetil,  rituximab,  azathioprine,  methotrexate,  and cyclophosphamide has also  been  used  successfully  for  early treatment of pemphigus. Immune globulin has replaced highdose corticosteroids as a rescue therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  pemphigus  and epidermolysis bullosa is similar. Preoperative evaluation must consider  current  drug  therapy.  Supplementation  with  corticosteroids  may  be  necessary.  Electrolyte  derangements  may be  present  due  to  chronic fl uid  losses  through  bullous  skin lesions. Dehydration and hypokalemia are not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Airway  management  may  be  di ffi cult  because  of  bullae in  the  oropharynx.  Airway  manipulation,  including  direct laryngoscopy  and  endotracheal  intubation,  can  result  in acute bulla formation, upper airway obstruction, and bleeding.  Regional  anesthesia,  although  controversial,  has  been used successfully in these patients. Skin infection at the site selected for regional anesthesia is possible. In fi ltration with a local anesthetic solution is usually avoided because of the risk of  skin  sloughing  and  bulla  formation  at  the  injection  site. Propofol  and  ketamine  are  useful  for  general  anesthesia  in selected patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Psoriasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Psoriasis is a common chronic dermatologic disorder a ff ecting  1%  to  3%  of  the  world's  population.  It  is  characterized by  accelerated  epidermal  growth  resulting  in  in fl ammatory erythematous  papules  covered  with  loosely  adherent  scales (chronic  plaque  psoriasis).  Skin  lesions  are  remitting  and relapsing.  Onset  may  occur  during  adolescence  and  young adulthood or at an older age. Symmetrically distributed skin lesions typically involve the elbows, knees, hairline, and presacral region. An asymmetrical arthropathy occurs in about 5% to 8% of patients. Th is usually involves the small joints of the hands and feet, the large joints of the legs, or some combination of both. High-output heart failure has been observed. Generalized pustular psoriasis  is  a  rare  form  of  the  disease that  may  be  complicated  by  hypoalbuminemia,  sepsis,  and renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of psoriasis is directed at slowing the rapid proliferation of epidermal cells. Coal tar is e ff ective because of its antimitotic action and its ability to inhibit enzymes. Although preparations  containing  coal  tar  can  cause  plaques  to  clear when used alone, they are generally used in combination with ultraviolet phototherapy. Th e use of coal tar is limited by its unpleasant odor and its potential to irritate normal skin. Coal tar is frequently used in shampoo preparations to prevent psoriatic scaling of the scalp. In rare cases, skin cancer has been associated  with  the  therapeutic  use  of  coal  tar.  Ointments containing salicylic acid are the most widely used keratolytic agents. Th ey can be used alone or in combination with coal tar or topical corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids are e ff ective, but the disease promptly recurs when treatment is discontinued. Application of corticosteroids under occlusive dressings can result in signi fi cant systemic absorption and suppression of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Calcipotriene ointment (a vitamin D analogue) and tazarotene (a topical retinoid) can be used.  Systemic  therapy  with  methotrexate  or  cyclosporine and biologic therapy with etanercept (a tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitor), in fl iximab (a monoclonal antibody to TNF), alefacept  (an  immunomodulatory  fusion  protein),  or  efalizumab (a monoclonal antibody to CD11a) may be required for severe cases. Toxic e ff ects of these drugs include cirrhosis, renal failure, hypertension, and pneumonitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  must  include  evaluation  of  the drugs being used for the treatment of psoriasis, including topical corticosteroids and chemotherapeutic drugs. Skin trauma from  venipuncture  or  the  surgical  incision  can  accentuate psoriasis in some patients. Patients with psoriasis o ft en have a  marked increase in skin blood fl ow that can contribute to altered thermoregulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mastocytosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mastocytosis is a rare disorder of mast cell proliferation that can occur in a cutaneous form (urticaria pigmentosa) or in a systemic form. Urticaria pigmentosa is usually benign and asymptomatic.  Children  are  most  o ft en  a ff ected.  In  nearly half  of  a ff ected  children,  the  small  red-brown  macules  that are present on the trunk and extremities disappear by adulthood. In the systemic form of mastocytosis, mast cells proliferate in all organs (especially bone, liver, and spleen) but not in the central nervous system. Degranulation of mast cells with release of histamine, heparin, prostaglandins, and numerous enzymes (tryptases, hydrolases) may occur spontaneously or may be triggered by nonimmune factors, including physical or  psychologic stimuli, alcohol, and drugs known to release histamine.  A  rare  form  of  systemic  mastocytosis,  known  as malignant aggressive systemic mastocytosis, is characterized by

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
di ff use mast cell proliferation in parenchymal organs, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage. Patients with this form o ft en require splenectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Classic signs and symptoms of mastocytosis re fl ect degranulation of mast cells with anaphylactoid responses characterized by pruritus, urticaria, and fl ushing. Th ese changes may be accompanied by hypotension and tachycardia. Hypotension  may  be  so  severe  as  to  be  life  threatening.  Although symptoms are  usually  attributed  to  histamine  release  from mast cells, histamine 1 and 2 (H 1 and H 2 )  receptor antagonists are not always protective. Th is suggests that vasoactive substances  other  than  histamine  (such  as  prostaglandins) may  be  involved. Th e  incidence  of  bronchospasm  is  low. Bleeding is unusual in these patients, even though mast cells contain heparin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  is  in fl uenced  by  the  possibility  of  intraoperative  mast  cell  degranulation  and  anaphylactoid  reaction.  Although  the  intraoperative  period  is  usually uneventful, there are reports of life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions with even minor surgical procedures, which emphasizes the need to have resuscitation drugs such as epinephrine immediately available. Preoperative administration of H 1 - and H2-receptor  antagonists  may  be  considered  to  decrease  the clinical  response to histamine release. However, these drugs do not interfere with the actual release of histamine from mast cells. Cromolyn sodium does inhibit mast cell degranulation and may decrease the risk of bronchospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some recommend preoperative skin testing of anesthesiarelated drugs to help de fi ne which anesthetics would provoke mast cell degranulation. Fentanyl, propofol, and vecuronium have  been  administered  to  these  patients  without  causing mast cell degranulation as have succinylcholine and meperidine. Volatile anesthetics also appear to be acceptable in these patients. Monitoring serum tryptase concentration during the perioperative  period  may  be  useful  for  detecting  the  occurrence of mast cell degranulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Episodes  of  profound  hypotension  have  been  observed with administration of radiocontrast media to patients with mastocytosis. Th erefore, it is prudent to pretreat these patients with H1 - and H 2 -histamine receptor antagonists and a glucocorticoid before procedures involving contrast dye.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atopic Dermatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atopic dermatitis is the cutaneous manifestation of the atopic state.  It  is  characterized  by  dry,  scaly,  eczematous,  pruritic patches on the face, neck, and fl exor surfaces of the arms and legs.  Pruritus  is  the  primary  symptom.  Systemic  antihistamines are e ff ective in decreasing pruritus, and corticosteroids may  be  indicated  for  short-term  treatment  of  severe  cases. Pulmonary manifestations of the atopic state, such as asthma, hay fever, otitis media, and sinusitis may in fl uence anesthetic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Urticaria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Urticaria may be characterized as acute urticaria, chronic urticaria, or physical urticaria. Acute urticaria (hives) and angioedema a ff ects 10% to 20% of the U.S. population at one time or another. In most people, the cause cannot be determined and the lesions resolve spontaneously or a ft er administration of  antihistamines.  Only  a  minority  of  patients  have  lesions for a long period of time. With physical urticaria, physically stimulating the skin causes the formation of local wheals, itching, and, in some cases, angioedema. Cold urticaria accounts for 3% to 5% of all physical urticarias (Table 21-1). Urticarial

vasculitis may be a presenting symptom of systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC URTICARIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  urticaria  is  characterized  by  circumscribed  wheals and  localized  areas  of  edema  produced  by  extravasation  of fl uid through blood vessel walls. Th e wheals are smooth, pink to red, and surrounded by a bright red fl are. Th ey are usually intensely pruritic, can be found anywhere on hairless or hairy skin, and last less than 24 hours. Wheals lasting longer than 24 hours raise the possibility of other diagnoses, including urticarial vasculitis. Chronic urticaria a ff ects approximately twice as  many  women  as  men  and  o ft en  follows  a  remitting  and relapsing course, with symptoms typically increasing at night. Angioedema  is  urticaria  involving  the  mucous  membranes, particularly those of the mouth, pharynx, and larynx. Mast cells and basophils regulate urticarial reactions. When they are stimulated by certain nonimmunologic events or by immunologic factors (drugs, inhaled allergens), storage granules in these cells release histamine and other vasoactive substances such as bradykinin. Th ese substances result in the localized vasodilation and transudation of fl uid characteristic of urticarial lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Except in patients with chronic urticaria for whom avoidable  causes  can  be  identi fi ed,  treatment  is  symptomatic.  A tepid  shower temporarily alleviates pruritus. Antihistamines (H1-receptor antagonists) are the principal treatment for mild cases  of  recurring  chronic  urticaria.  Terfenadine  has  a  low potential  for  sedation  and  is  a  common  treatment  for  mild cases of chronic urticaria. High doses of this drug have been associated  with  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Doxepin  is  a  tricyclic antidepressant  drug  with  signi fi cant  H 1 -antagonist  actions that is particularly useful when severe urticaria is associated with  depression. Th e  combination  of  H 1 -  and  H 2 -receptor antagonists may be more e ffi cacious than use of H 1 -receptor antagonists  alone.  If  antihistamines  do  not  control  chronic urticaria,  a  course  of  systemic  corticosteroids  may  be  considered. Th e period of treatment is usually limited to 21 days, because prolonged use of corticosteroids is invariably associated with a decrease in e ffi cacy and an increase in side e ff ects. A 2% topical spray of ephedrine is useful for treating oropharyngeal  edema.  Swelling  involving  the  tongue  may  require urgent treatment with epinephrine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  patients  with  chronic  urticaria  should  be  advised  to avoid angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and other nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COLD URTICARIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cold  urticaria  is  characterized  by  development  of  urticaria and angioedema following exposure to cold. Th e most common  triggering  factors  are  cold  air  currents,  rain,  aquatic activities,  snow,  consumption  of  cold  foods  and  beverages, and contact with cold objects.  Severe  cold  urticaria  may  be life-threatening  with  laryngeal  edema,  bronchospasm,  and hypotension. Th e diagnosis is based on skin stimulation at a temperature of 0° to 4° C for 1 to 5 minutes (cold stimulation test).  Immunologic mechanisms may be associated with the development  of  cold  urticaria.  Immunoglobulin  E  concentrations may be increased. Cutaneous mast cells rather than basophils in the bloodstream are the target cells for degranulation, although basophil degranulation is possible with profound hypothermia. Tryptase is an important marker of mast cell degranulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e primary objective of treatment of cold urticaria is to prevent systemic reactions caused by known triggers. Antihistamines may decrease the incidence of recurrence and prolong the time that a cold stimulus is tolerated before a reaction occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  includes  avoidance  of  drugs that  are  likely  to  evoke  histamine  release.  Drugs  requiring cold  storage  should  be  avoided  or  warmed  before  injection. Other  prophylactic  measures  include  warming  intravenous fl uids and increasing the ambient temperature of the operating room. Preoperative administration of H 1 - and H 2 -receptor antagonists and corticosteroids has been recommended, especially when intraoperative hypothermia is unavoidable, as may be the case during surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythema Multiforme

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythema multiforme is a recurrent disease of the skin and mucous  membranes  characterized  by  lesions  ranging  from edematous macules and papules to vesicular or bullous lesions that may ulcerate. Attacks are associated with viral infection (especially  herpes  simplex),  infection  with  hemolytic  streptococci, cancer, collagen vascular disease, and drug-induced hypersensitivity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( erythema multiforme major ) is a severe manifestation associated with multisystem dysfunction. High fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea may occur. Drugs associated with the onset of this syndrome include antibiotics, analgesics, and certain over-the-counter medications. Corticosteroids are used in the management of severe cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hazards  of  administering  anesthesia  to  patients  with Stevens-Johnson syndrome are similar to those encountered in  anesthetizing  patients  with  epidermolysis  bullosa.  For example, involvement of the upper respiratory tract can make management of the airway and tracheal intubation di ffi cult. Th e  presence  of  pulmonary  blebs  makes  these  patients  vulnerable to pneumothorax, particularly with positive pressure ventilation. Pulmonary blebs also prohibit the use of nitrous oxide. Patients with particularly severe Stevens-Johnson syndrome should be treated in a burn unit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Scleroderma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)  is  characterized  by  in fl ammation,  vascular  sclerosis,  and fi brosis  of  the  skin  and  viscera. Microvascular changes produce tissue fi brosis and organ

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
sclerosis. Injury to vascular endothelial cells results in vascular obliteration  and  leakage  of  serum  proteins  into  the  interstitial  space. Th ese  proteins  produce  tissue  edema,  lymphatic obstruction,  and  ultimately fi brosis.  In  some  patients,  the disease evolves into CREST syndrome ( c alcinoses, R aynaud's phenomenon, e sophageal hypomotility, s clerodactyly, t elangiectasia). Th e prognosis is poor and is related to the extent of visceral involvement. No drugs or treatments have proved safe and e ff ective in altering the underlying disease process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  etiology  of  scleroderma  is  unknown,  but  the  disease process has the characteristics of both a collagen vascular disease and an autoimmune disease. Th e typical age at onset is 20 to 40 years, and women are most o ft en a ff ected. Pregnancy accelerates  the  progression  of  scleroderma  in  approximately half of patients. Th e incidence of spontaneous abortion, premature labor, and perinatal mortality is high.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations of scleroderma occur in the skin and musculoskeletal system, nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skin exhibits mild thickening and  di ff use nonpitting edema.  As  scleroderma  progresses,  the  skin  becomes  taut, which  results  in  limited  mobility  and fl exion  contractures, especially of the fi ngers. Skeletal muscles may develop myopathy, manifested as weakness, particularly of proximal skeletal muscle  groups. Th e  plasma  creatine  kinase  concentration  is typically increased. Mild in fl ammatory arthritis can occur, but most limitation to joint movement is due to the thickened, taut skin. Avascular necrosis of the femoral head may occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral  or  cranial  nerve  neuropathy  has  been  attributed  to  nerve  compression  by  thickened  connective  tissue surrounding  the  nerve  sheath.  Facial  pain  suggestive  of  trigeminal  neuralgia  may  occur  as  a  result  of  this  thickening. Keratoconjunctivitis  sicca  (dry  eyes)  exists  in  some  patients and may predispose to corneal abrasions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes in the myocardium re fl ect sclerosis of small coronary  arteries  and  the  conduction  system,  replacement  of cardiac muscle with fi brous tissue, and the indirect e ff ects of systemic and pulmonary hypertension. Th ese changes result in cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and congestive heart failure. Intimal fi brosis of pulmonary arteries  is  associated  with  a  high  incidence  of  pulmonary hypertension,  which  may  progress  to  cor  pulmonale.  Pulmonary hypertension is o ft en present, even in asymptomatic patients. Pericarditis and pericardial e ff usion with or without cardiac tamponade are not infrequent. Changes in the peripheral portion  of  the  vascular  tree  are  common  and  typically  involve intermittent  vasospasm  in  the  small  arteries  of  the  digits. Raynaud's phenomenon occurs in most cases and may be the initial manifestation of scleroderma. Oral or nasal telangiectasias may be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e e ff ects of scleroderma on the lungs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Di ff use interstitial pulmonary fi brosis may occur independent of the vascular changes that lead to pulmonary hypertension. Arterial hypoxemia resulting from decreased di ff usion capacity is not unusual in these patients, even  at  rest.  Although  dermal  sclerosis  does  not  decrease chest wall compliance, pulmonary compliance is diminished by fi brosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal artery stenosis as a result of arteriolar intimal proliferation  leads  to  decreased  renal  blood fl ow  and  systemic hypertension.  Development  of  malignant  hypertension  and irreversible renal failure used to be the most common cause of death in patients with scleroderma, but now scleroderma renal crisis is relatively rare. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are e ff ective in controlling hypertension and in improving the impaired renal function that accompanies the hypertension. Corticosteroids can precipitate a renal crisis in patients with scleroderma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Involvement  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  by  scleroderma may  manifest  as  dryness  of  the  oral  mucosa  (xerostomia). Progressive fi brosis of the gastrointestinal tract causes hypomotility of the lower esophagus and small intestine. Dysphagia is a common complaint. Lower esophageal sphincter tone is decreased, and re fl ux of gastric fl uid into the esophagus is common.  Symptoms  resulting  from  this  esophagitis  can  be treated  with  antacids.  Bacterial  overgrowth  resulting  from intestinal  hypomotility  can  produce  a  malabsorption  syndrome.  Coagulation  disorders  re fl ecting  malabsorption  of vitamin  K  may  be  present.  Broad-spectrum  antibiotics  are e ff ective in the treatment of this type of malabsorption syndrome. Intestinal hypomotility can also manifest as intestinal pseudo-  obstruction. Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide may improve intestinal motility. Prokinetic drugs such as metoclopramide are not e ff ective.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  scleroderma  must focus attention on the organ systems likely to be involved by this disease. Decreased mandibular motion and narrowing of the oral aperture resulting from taut skin must be appreciated before induction of anesthesia. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy may be  necessary  to  facilitate  endotracheal  intubation  through  a small  oral  aperture.  Oral  or  nasal  telangiectasias  may  bleed profusely if traumatized during tracheal intubation. Intravenous access may be impeded by dermal thickening. Intraarterial catheterization for blood pressure monitoring introduces the  same  concerns  as  in  patients  with  Raynaud's  phenomenon. Cardiac evaluation may provide evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Because of chronic systemic hypertension and vasomotor instability, patients with scleroderma may have a contracted intravascular volume. Th is may produce hypotension  during  induction  of  anesthesia  when  anesthetic  drugs with vasodilating properties exert their e ff ects. Hypotonia of the lower esophageal sphincter puts patients at risk of regurgitation  and  pulmonary  aspiration.  E ff orts  to  increase  gastric fl uid pH with antacids or H 2 -receptor antagonists before induction of anesthesia are recommended.

di ff usion  capacity  and  vulnerability  to  the  development  of arterial  hypoxemia.  Events  known  to  increase  pulmonary vascular  resistance,  such  as  respiratory  acidosis  and  arterial hypoxemia,  must  be  prevented. Th ese  patients  may  be  particularly sensitive to the respiratory depressant e ff ects of opioids, and a period of postoperative ventilatory support may be required in patients with severe pulmonary disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e degree of renal dysfunction must be considered when selecting  anesthetic  drugs  dependent  on  renal  elimination. Regional anesthesia may be technically di ffi cult because of the skin and joint changes that accompany scleroderma. Attractive features of regional anesthesia include peripheral vasodilation and postoperative analgesia. Measures to minimize peripheral vasoconstriction include maintenance of the operating room temperature above 21° C and administration of warmed intravenous fl uids. Th e eyes should be protected to prevent corneal abrasions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pseudoxanthoma  elasticum  is  a  rare  hereditary  disorder  of elastic tissue. Elastic fi bers degenerate and calcify over time. Th e most striking feature of this condition, and o ft en the basis for the diagnosis, is the appearance of angioid streaks in the retina. Substantial loss of visual acuity may result from these ocular  changes.  Additional  visual  impairment  may  occur when  vascular  changes  predispose  to  vitreous  hemorrhage. Skin  changes,  consisting  of  yellowish,  rectangular,  elevated xanthoma-like lesions, primarily in the neck, axilla, and inguinal regions, are among the earliest clinical features. Interestingly,  some  tissues  rich  in  elastic fi bers,  such  as  the  lungs, aorta, palms, and soles, are not a ff ected by this disease process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrointestinal  hemorrhage  is  a  frequent  occurrence. Degenerative changes in the arteries supplying the gastrointestinal tract are thought to prevent vasoconstriction of these blood vessels in response to mucosal injury. Th e incidence of hypertension and ischemic heart disease is increased in these patients. Endocardial calci fi cation can involve the conduction system and predispose to cardiac dysrhythmias and sudden death. Involvement of cardiac valves is frequent. Calci fi cation of peripheral arteries, particularly the radial and ulnar arteries, is common. Psychiatric disturbances o ft en accompany this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum  is  based  on  an  appreciation  of  the  abnormalities associated with this disease. Cardiovascular derangements are probably  the  most  important  considerations. Th e  increased incidence of ischemic heart disease is considered when establishing  limits  for  acceptable  changes  in  blood  pressure  and heart  rate.  Electrocardiographic  monitoring  is  particularly important in view of the potential for cardiac dysrhythmias. Noninvasive  blood  pressure  monitoring  devices  are  usually selected.  Trauma  to  the  mucosa  of  the  upper  gastrointestinal tract, as may be produced by a gastric tube or esophageal stethoscope, should be minimized. Th ere are no speci fi c recommendations  regarding  the  choice  of  anesthetic  drugs  or techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome consists of a group of inherited connective  tissue  disorders  caused  by  abnormal  production  of procollagen and collagen. It is estimated that 1 in 5000 people is a ff ected by this syndrome. Th e only form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  death  is  the type IV (vascular) syndrome. Th is form may be complicated by rupture of large blood vessels or disruption of the bowel.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome cause signs and symptoms of joint  hypermobility,  skin  fragility  or  hyperelasticity, bruising  and  scarring,  musculoskeletal  discomfort,  and  susceptibility to osteoarthritis. Th e gastrointestinal tract, uterus, and vasculature  are  particularly  well  endowed  with  type  III collagen, which accounts for complications such as spontaneous rupture of the bowel, uterus, or major arteries. Premature labor and excessive bleeding at the time of delivery are common obstetric problems. Dilation of the trachea is o ft en present, and the incidence of pneumothorax is increased. Mitral regurgitation and cardiac conduction abnormalities are occasionally seen. Patients may exhibit extensive ecchymoses with even minimal trauma, although a speci fi c coagulation defect has not been identi fi ed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  Ehlers-Danlos syndrome  must  consider  the  cardiovascular  manifestations of  this  disease  and  the  propensity  of  these  patients  to  bleed excessively. Avoidance of intramuscular injections or instrumentation of the nose or esophagus is important in view of the  bleeding  tendency.  Trauma  during  direct  laryngoscopy must  be  minimized. Th e  decision  regarding  placement  of an arterial or central venous catheter must consider the fact that  hematoma  formation  may  be  extensive.  Extravasation of intravenous fl uids resulting from a displaced venous cannula may go unnoticed because of the extreme laxity of the skin. Maintenance of low airway pressure during assisted or controlled  mechanical  ventilation  seems  prudent  in  view  of the increased incidence of pneumothorax. Th ere are no speci fi c  recommendations for the selection of drugs to provide anesthesia. Regional anesthesia is not recommended because of the tendency of these patients to bleed and form extensive hematomas. Surgical complications may include hemorrhage and postoperative wound dehiscence.

Marfan's Syndrome

tubular bones, giving them a tall stature and an "Abe Lincoln" appearance. Additional skeletal abnormalities include a higharched palate, pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis, and hyperextensibility of the joints. Early development of emphysema is characteristic and may further accentuate the impact of lung disease related to kyphoscoliosis. Th ere is a high incidence of spontaneous pneumothorax. Ocular changes such as lens dislocation, myopia, and retinal detachment occur in more than half of patients with Marfan's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular  abnormalities  are  responsible  for  nearly  all premature deaths in patients with Marfan's syndrome. Defective  connective tissue in the aorta and heart valves can lead to  aortic  dilation,  dissection,  or  rupture  and  to  prolapse  of cardiac valves, especially the mitral valve. Mitral regurgitation resulting from mitral valve prolapse is a common abnormality. Th e risk of bacterial endocarditis is increased in the presence of this valvular heart disease. Cardiac conduction abnormalities,  especially  bundle  branch  block,  are  common.  Prophylactic β -blocker therapy is recommended for patients with a dilated thoracic aorta. Surgical replacement of the aortic valve and  ascending  aorta  is  indicated  when  the  diameter  of  the ascending aorta exceeds 6 cm and substantial aortic regurgitation is present. Pregnancy poses a unique risk of rupture or dissection of the aorta in women with Marfan's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  Marfan's  syndrome should  focus  on  cardiopulmonary  abnormalities.  In  most patients, skeletal abnormalities have little impact on the airway.  Care  should  be  exercised,  however,  to  avoid  temporomandibular  joint  dislocation,  to  which  these  patients  are susceptible. In view of the risk of aortic dissection, it is prudent to avoid any sustained increase in systemic blood pressure, as can occur during direct laryngoscopy or in response to painful surgical stimulation. Invasive monitoring including transesophageal echocardiography may be a consideration in selected  patients.  A  high  index  of  suspicion  must  be  maintained for the development of pneumothorax.

MUSCLE AND NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are multisystem diseases of unknown etiology, manifesting as in fl ammatory myopathies. Dermatomyositis  has  characteristic  skin  changes  in  addition  to  muscle  weakness. Th ese  cutaneous  changes  include discoloration of the upper eyelids, periorbital edema, a scaly erythematous  malar  rash,  and  symmetrical  erythematous atrophic changes over the extensor surfaces of joints. Abnormal  immune  responses  may  be  responsible  for  the  slowly progressive  skeletal  muscle  damage  of  dermatomyositis  and polymyositis. Th e  concept  that  altered  cellular  immunity causes polymyositis is supported by the fact that 10% to 20% of these patients have occult neoplasms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle  weakness  involves  proximal  skeletal  muscle  groups, especially the fl exors of the neck, shoulders, and hips. Patients may  have  di ffi culty  climbing  stairs.  Dysphagia,  pulmonary aspiration, and pneumonia can result from paresis of pharyngeal and respiratory muscles. Diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle weakness may contribute to ventilatory insu ffi ciency. Increased  serum  creatine  kinase  concentrations  parallel  the extent and rapidity of skeletal muscle destruction. Th ese diseases do not a ff ect the neuromuscular junction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart block secondary to myocardial fi brosis or atrophy of the conduction system, le ft ventricular dysfunction, and myocarditis  can  occur.  Polymyositis  can  also  be  associated  with systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis. A widespread necrotizing vasculitis may be present in childhood forms of this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of polymyositis or dermatomyositis is considered  when  proximal  skeletal  muscle  weakness,  an  increased serum  creatine  kinase  concentration,  and  the  characteristic skin  rash  are  present.  Electromyography  may  demonstrate the  triad  of  spontaneous fi brillation  potentials,  decreased amplitude of voluntary contraction potentials, and repetitive potentials on needle insertion. Skeletal muscle biopsy fi ndings support the clinical diagnosis. Muscular dystrophy and myasthenia gravis can mimic polymyositis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids  are  the  usual  treatment  for  polymyositis. Immunosuppressive therapy with methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,  mycophenolate,  or  cyclosporine  may  be e ff ective when the response to corticosteroids is inadequate. Intravenous  immunoglobulin  may  be  useful  in  refractory cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia must consider the vulnerability of patients with polymyositis to pulmonary aspiration. In view of the skeletal muscle weakness, there has been concern that these  patients  could  display  abnormal  responses  to  muscle relaxants.  However,  responses  to  nondepolarizing  muscle relaxants  and  succinylcholine  are normal in  patients  with polymyositis.

Muscular Dystrophy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscular  dystrophy  is  a  group  of  hereditary  diseases  characterized  by  painless  degeneration  and  atrophy  of  skeletal muscles. Th ere  are  progressive,  symmetrical  skeletal  muscle weakness  and  wasting  but  no  evidence  of  skeletal  muscle denervation.  Sensation  and  re fl exes  are  intact.  Increased permeability of skeletal muscle membranes precedes clinical

evidence of muscular dystrophy. In order of decreasing frequency,  muscular  dystrophy  can  be  categorized  as  pseudohypertrophic (Duchenne's muscular dystrophy), limb-girdle, facioscapulohumeral (Landouzy-Dejerine dystrophy), nemaline rod, or oculopharyngeal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PSEUDOHYPERTROPHIC MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DUCHENNE'S MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pseudohypertrophic  muscular  dystrophy  is  the  most  common and most severe form of childhood progressive muscular dystrophy. Th e disease is caused by an X-linked recessive gene and becomes apparent in 2- to 5-year-old boys. Initial symptoms include a waddling gait, frequent falling, and di ffi culty climbing stairs, and these re fl ect involvement of the proximal skeletal muscle groups of the pelvic girdle. A ff ected muscles become larger as a result of fatty in fi ltration, and this accounts for  the  designation  of  this  disorder  as pseudohypertrophic. Th ere is progressive deterioration in skeletal muscle strength, and typically these boys are con fi ned to a wheelchair by age 8 to 10. Kyphoscoliosis can develop. Skeletal muscle atrophy can predispose to long bone fractures. Mental retardation is o ft en present. Serum creatine kinase concentrations are 20 to 100 times normal, even early in the disease, re fl ecting increased permeability of skeletal muscle membranes and skeletal muscle necrosis. Approximately 70% of the female carriers of this disease also exhibit increased serum creatine kinase concentrations. Skeletal muscle biopsy specimens early in the course of the disease may demonstrate necrosis and phagocytosis of muscle fi bers. Death usually occurs at 15 to 25 years of age as a result of congestive heart failure and/or pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Degeneration  of  cardiac  muscle  invariably  accompanies this  muscular  dystrophy.  Characteristically,  the  electrocardiogram reveals tall R waves in V 1 , deep Q waves in the limb leads, a short PR interval, and sinus tachycardia. Mitral regurgitation may occur as a result of papillary muscle dysfunction or decreased myocardial contractility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic weakness of the respiratory muscles and a weakened cough result in loss of pulmonary reserve and accumulation of secretions. Th ese abnormalities predispose to recurrent pneumonia.  Respiratory  insu ffi ciency  o ft en  remains  covert because overall activity is so limited. As the disease progresses, kyphoscoliosis contributes to further restrictive lung disease. Sleep  apnea  may  occur  and  may  contribute  to  development of pulmonary hypertension. Approximately 30% of deaths in individuals with pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy are due to respiratory causes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy may require anesthesia for muscle biopsy or correction of  orthopedic  deformities.  Preparation  for  anesthesia  must take into consideration the implications of increased skeletal muscle membrane permeability and decreased cardiopulmonary  reserve.  Hypomotility  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  may delay  gastric  emptying  and,  in  the  presence  of  weak  laryngeal  re fl exes,  can  increase  the  risk  of  pulmonary  aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of succinylcholine is contraindicated because of the risk of rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, and/or cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest may be due to hyperkalemia or to ventricular fi brillation.  Indeed,  ventricular fi brillation  during  induction  of anesthesia  that  included  succinylcholine  administration  has been observed in patients later discovered to have this form of muscular dystrophy. Th e response to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rhabdomyolysis, with or without cardiac arrest, has been observed in association with administration of volatile anesthetics to these patients even in the absence of succinylcholine administration. Dantrolene should be available, because there is an increased incidence of malignant hyperthermia in these patients. Malignant hyperthermia has been observed a ft er even brief periods of halothane administration, although most cases have been triggered by succinylcholine or prolonged inhalation of  halothane.  Regional  anesthesia  avoids  the  unique  risks  of general anesthesia in these patients. During the postoperative period, neuraxial analgesia may facilitate chest physiotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  is  directed  at  early  detection  of  malignant hyperthermia and cardiac depression.  Postoperative  pulmonary dysfunction should be anticipated and attempts made to facilitate clearance of secretions. Delayed pulmonary insu ffi -ciency may occur up to 36 hours postoperatively even though skeletal muscle strength has apparently returned to its preoperative levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LIMB-GIRDLE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Limb-girdle  muscular  dystrophy  is  a  slowly  progressive  but relatively benign disease. Onset occurs from the second to the fift h decade. Shoulder girdle or hip girdle muscles may be the only skeletal muscles involved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FACIOSCAPULOHUMERAL MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is characterized by a slowly progressive wasting of facial, pectoral, and shoulder girdle  muscles  that  begins  during  adolescence.  Eventually the  lower  limbs  are  also  involved.  Early  symptoms  include di ffi culty raising the arms above the head and di ffi culty smiling. Th ere  is  no  involvement  of  cardiac  muscle,  and  serum creatine kinase concentration is seldom increased. Recovery from    atracurium-induced  neuromuscular  blockade  may  be faster than normal in these patients. Th e progression of this muscular dystrophy is slow and a long life is likely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEMALINE ROD MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nemaline rod muscular dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by slowly progressive or nonprogressive symmetrical  dystrophy  of  skeletal  and  smooth  muscle. Th e diagnosis is  con fi rmed by skeletal muscle biopsy. Histologic examination demonstrates the presence of rods between normal myo fi brils.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected  individuals  experience  delayed  motor  development,  generalized  skeletal  muscle  weakness,  a  decrease  in muscle  mass,  hypotonia,  and  loss  of  deep  tendon  re fl exes. Th ere are typical dysmorphic features and an abnormal gait,

but intelligence is usually normal. A ff ected infants may present with hypotonia, dysphagia, respiratory distress, and cyanosis. Micrognathia  and  dental  malocclusion  are  common.  Other skeletal  deformities  include  kyphoscoliosis and pectus excavatum. Restrictive lung disease may result from the myopathy and/or scoliosis. Cardiac failure resulting from dilated cardiomyopathy has been described.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal intubation may be di ffi cult  because  of  anatomic abnormalities such as micrognathia and a high-arched palate. Awake fi beroptic  endotracheal  intubation  may  be  prudent. Th e  respiratory  depressant  e ff ects  of  drugs  may  be  exaggerated in these patients due to respiratory muscle weakness and chest wall abnormalities. Ventilation/perfusion mismatching is  increased,  and  the  ventilatory  response  to  carbon  dioxide may be blunted. Bulbar palsy associated with regurgitation and aspiration may further complicate anesthetic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e response to succinylcholine and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers is unpredictable. Th ere is  no  conclusive evidence that administration of succinylcholine evokes excessive  potassium  release.  Indeed,  resistance  to  succinylcholine has been described in some patients. Malignant hyperthermia has not been reported in patients with nemaline rod myopathy. Myocardial depression may accompany administration of volatile anesthetics if the disease process involves the myocardium. Plans for regional anesthesia must consider the possible respiratory compromise that could accompany a high motor block.  In  addition,  the  exaggerated  lumbar  lordosis  and/or kyphoscoliosis  may  make  neuraxial  anesthesia  technically di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OCULOPHARYNGEAL DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oculopharyngeal dystrophy is a rare variant of muscular dystrophy  characterized  by  progressive  dysphagia  and  ptosis. Although experience is limited, these patients may be at risk of aspiration during the perioperative period, and their sensitivity to muscle relaxants may be increased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMERY-DREIFUSS MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder  characterized  by  development  of  skeletal  muscle contractures that precede the onset of skeletal muscle weakness. Th ese  contractures  are  typically  in  a  humeroperoneal distribution.  Mental  retardation  is  not  present,  and  respiratory  function  is  maintained.  Cardiac  involvement  may  be life-threatening and present as congestive heart failure, thromboembolism, or bradycardia. Unlike in other muscular dystrophies, female carriers of this disorder may experience cardiac impairment.

muscle or following electrical stimulation (Table 21-2). Peripheral nerves and the neuromuscular junction are not a ff ected. Electromyographic fi ndings are diagnostic and are characterized by prolonged discharges of repetitive muscle action potentials. Th is  inability  of  skeletal  muscle to relax a ft er voluntary contraction  or  stimulation  results  from  abnormal  calcium metabolism.  Intracellular  adenosine  triphosphatase  fails  to return  calcium  to  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum,  so  unsequestered calcium remains available to produce sustained skeletal muscle contraction. Interestingly, general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, and neuromuscular blockade are not able to prevent or relieve this skeletal muscle contraction. In fi ltration of contracted skeletal muscles with local anesthetic may induce relaxation. Quinine (300 to 600 mg IV) has also been reported to be e ff ective in some cases. Increasing the ambient temperature of the operating room decreases the severity of myotonia and the incidence of postoperative shivering, which can precipitate skeletal muscle contraction. Most patients with myotonia survive to adulthood with little impairment, and it is common for them to conceal their symptoms, so they may come for surgery without the underlying myotonia being appreciated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MYOTONIA DYSTROPHICA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myotonia dystrophica is the most common and most serious form of myotonic dystrophy a ff ecting adults. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with the onset of symptoms during the second or third decade. Unlike other myotonic syndromes, myotonia dystrophica is a multisystem disease, although skeletal muscles are a ff ected most. Death from pneumonia or heart failure o ft en occurs by the sixth decade of life. Th is re fl ects progressive  involvement  of  skeletal  muscle,  cardiac  muscle,  and smooth  muscle.  Perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality  rates are high principally due to cardiopulmonary complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment is symptomatic and may include use of phenytoin. Quinine and procainamide also have antimyotonic properties but can worsen cardiac conduction abnormalities. Th ese three  drugs  depress  sodium  in fl ux into skeletal  muscle  cells and delay the return of membrane excitability.

Signs and Symptoms

Myotonia  dystrophica  usually  manifests  as  facial  weakness (expressionless facies), wasting and weakness of the sternocleidomastoid  muscles,  ptosis,  dysarthria,  dysphagia,  and inability to relax the hand grip (myotonia). Other characteristic  features  include  the  triad  of  mental  retardation,  frontal baldness, and cataracts. Endocrine gland involvement may be

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
indicated by gonadal atrophy, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insu ffi ciency. Delayed gastric emptying and intestinal  pseudo-obstruction  may  be  present.  Central  sleep apnea may occur and may account for the frequent presence of hypersomnolence. Th ere is an increased incidence of cholelithiasis, especially in men. Exacerbation of symptoms during pregnancy  is  common,  and  uterine  atony  and  retained  placenta o ft en complicate vaginal delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac dysrhythmias and conduction abnormalities presumably  re fl ect  myocardial  involvement  by  the  myotonic process. First-degree atrioventricular heart block is common and is o ft en present before the clinical onset of the disease. Up to 20% of patients have asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse. Reports of sudden death may re fl ect development of complete heart block. Pharyngeal and thoracic muscle weakness makes these patients vulnerable to pulmonary aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation and management of anesthesia in patients with myotonia dystrophica must consider the likelihood  of  cardiomyopathy,  respiratory  muscle  weakness,  and the potential for abnormal responses to anesthetic drugs. Even asymptomatic patients have some degree of cardiomyopathy, so the myocardial depression produced by volatile anesthetics may be exaggerated.  Cardiac  dysrhythmias  may  need  treatment.  Anesthesia  and  surgery  could  aggravate  cardiac  conduction problems by increasing vagal tone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Succinylcholine should not be administered because prolonged  skeletal  muscle  contraction  can  result.  However,  the response  to  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs is normal. Th eoretically, reversal of neuromuscular blockade could  precipitate  skeletal  muscle  contraction,  but  adverse responses  do  not  predictably  occur  with  neostigmine  use. Careful titration of neuromuscular blockers and administration  of  short-acting  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  may obviate the need for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  myotonia  dystrophica  are  sensitive  to  the respiratory  depressant  e ff ects  of  barbiturates,  opioids,  benzodiazepines, and propofol. Th is  is  most  likely  due  to  druginduced  central  respiratory  depression  acting  in  tandem with weak and/or atrophic respiratory muscles. In addition, hypersomnolence  and  central  sleep  apnea  contribute  to  the increased sensitivity to respiratory depressant drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myotonic contraction during surgical manipulation and/or the  use  of  electrocautery  may  interfere  with  surgical  access. Drugs such as phenytoin and procainamide, which stabilize skeletal muscle membranes, may be helpful in this situation. High  concentrations  of  volatile  anesthetics  can  also  abolish  myotonic  contractions  but  at  the  expense  of  myocardial depression. Maintenance of normothermia and avoidance of shivering are very important since cold may induce myotonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MYOTONIA CONGENITA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myotonia congenita is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and becomes manifest at birth or during early childhood. Skeletal  muscle  involvement  is  widespread,  but  other  organ systems  are  not  usually  involved.  Muscle  hypertrophy  and myotonia are present. Th e disease does not progress nor does it  result in a decreased life expectancy. Patients with myotonia  congenita  respond  to  phenytoin,  mexiletine,  or  quinine therapy. Th e  response  to  succinylcholine  administration  is abnormal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PARAMYOTONIA CONGENITA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paramyotonia congenita is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by generalized myotonia that is recognized during early childhood. Generalized muscle hypertrophy may occur. Th is myotonia is unusual because, in contrast to other myotonias,  in  paramyotonia  the  skeletal  muscle  sti ff ness  is o ft en exacerbated by exercise. In other myotonias, sustained exercise improves myotonia, the so-called warm-up phenomenon.  Cold  markedly  aggravates  the  myotonia,  and fl accid paralysis may be present a ft er the muscles are warmed. Some patients  develop  muscle  paralysis  independent  of  myotonia. Th is  could be related to the serum potassium concentration and may be the reason that there is some doubt whether paramyotonia congenita and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis are separate entities. Th e  electromyogram may be normal when recorded  at  room  temperature,  but  typical  myotonic  discharges become evident as muscles are cooled. Treatment is similar to that for myotonia congenita.

Periodic Paralysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Periodic  paralysis  is  a  spectrum  of  diseases  characterized by intermittent acute attacks of skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis (sparing only a few muscles such as the muscles of respiration)  and  associated  with  hypokalemia  or  hyperkalemia (Table 21-3). Th e hyperkalemic form is much rarer than the hypokalemic form. Attacks generally last for a few hours but may persist for days. Muscle strength is normal between attacks.

Th e  exact  defect  in  familial  periodic  paralysis  is  unknown, although mutations in calcium and sodium channels are associated with hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, respectively. It is recognized that the mechanism of this disease is not related to any abnormality at the neuromuscular junction but rather to loss of muscle membrane excitability. Skeletal muscle weakness provoked by a glucose-insulin infusion  con fi rms the presence of hypokalemic familial  periodic paralysis,  and  skeletal  muscle  weakness  a ft er  oral  administration  of  potassium  con fi rms  the  presence  of hyperkalemic

Acetazolamide produces a non-anion gap acidosis, which protects against hypokalemia, and promotes renal potassium excretion, which protects against hyperkalemia as well.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A principal goal of anesthetic management is avoidance of any events  that  can  precipitate  skeletal  muscle  weakness.  Hypothermia must be avoided in patients with periodic paralysis, regardless of the nature of the potassium sensitivity. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, it may be necessary to maintain normothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can be safely administered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative considerations include maintenance of carbohydrate  balance,  correction  of  electrolyte  abnormalities,  and avoidance of events known to trigger hypokalemic attacks (psychologic  stress,  cold,  carbohydrate  loads).  High-carbohydrate meals can trigger hypokalemic episodes and should be avoided during  the  24  hours  preceding  surgery.  Glucose-containing solutions and drugs known to cause intracellular shi ft s of potassium, such as β -adrenergic agonists, must also be avoided. Mannitol can be administered in lieu of a potassium-wasting diuretic should  the  operative  procedure  require  diuresis.  Frequent perioperative  monitoring  of  serum  potassium  concentration (every 30 to 60 minutes) is useful, and aggressive intervention to  increase  the  serum  potassium  concentration  (infusion  of potassium chloride at a rate of up to 40 mEq/hr) may occasionally be needed. Hypokalemia may precede the onset of muscle weakness by several hours, so timely potassium supplementation may help to avoid muscle weakness. Short-acting neuromuscular blockers  are  preferable  if  skeletal  muscle  relaxation is  required  for  the  surgery.  Succinylcholine  with  its  ability  to increase serum potassium concentration transiently is acceptable in these patients. Regional anesthesia has been safely used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with hyperkalemic periodic  paralysis  includes  preoperative  potassium  depletion with diuretics, prevention of carbohydrate depletion by administration of glucose-containing solutions, and avoidance of  potassium-containing  solutions  and  potassium-releasing drugs such as succinylcholine. Frequent monitoring of serum potassium concentration is indicated, as is the ready availability of calcium for intravenous administration should signs of hyperkalemia appear on the electrocardiogram.

Myasthenia Gravis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune disorder caused by  a  decrease  in  functional  acetylcholine  receptors  at  the neuromuscular  junction  resulting  from  their  destruction or  inactivation  by  circulating  antibodies  (Figure  21-1).  As many  as  80%  of  functional  acetylcholine  receptors  can  be lost. Th is  accounts  for  the  weakness  and  easy  fatigability  of these  patients  and  their  marked  sensitivity  to  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Indeed, the hallmarks of this disease are weakness and rapid exhaustion of voluntary muscles with repetitive use, followed by partial recovery with rest. Skeletal muscles innervated by cranial nerves (ocular, pharyngeal, and laryngeal muscles) are especially vulnerable, as indicated by the appearance of ptosis, diplopia, and dysphagia, which are o ft en the initial symptoms of the disease. Myasthenia gravis is not a rare disease. It has a prevalence of 1 in 7500. Women 20 to 30 years of age are most o ft en a ff ected; men with myasthenia gravis are o ft en older than 60 years of age when the disease presents. Receptor-binding antibodies are present in more than 80% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Th e origin of these antibodies is unknown, but a relationship to the thymus gland is suggested by the association of myasthenia gravis with thymus gland abnormalities. For example, thymic hyperplasia is present in two thirds of patients with myasthenia gravis, and 10% to 15% of these patients have thymomas. Other conditions  that  cause  weakness  of  the  cranial  and  somatic musculature must be considered in the di ff erential diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (Table 21-4).

CLASSIFICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenia gravis is classi fi ed based on the skeletal muscles involved and the severity of symptoms. Type I is limited to involvement of the extraocular muscles. Approximately 10% of patients show signs and symptoms con fi ned to the extraocular muscles and are considered to have ocular myasthenia gravis. Patients in whom the disease has been con fi ned to the ocular

muscles for longer than 3 years are unlikely to experience any progression in their disease. Type IIa is a slowly progressive, mild form of skeletal muscle weakness that spares the muscles of  respiration. Th e  response  to  anticholinesterase  drugs  and corticosteroids is good in these patients. Type IIb is a more rapidly progressive and more severe form of skeletal muscle weakness. Th e response to drug therapy is not as good, and the muscles of respiration may be involved. Type III is characterized by acute onset and rapid deterioration of skeletal muscle strength within 6 months. It is associated with a high mortality rate. Type IV is a severe form of skeletal muscle weakness that results from progression of type I or type II myasthenia.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Th e  clinical  course  of  myasthenia  gravis  is  marked  by  periods of exacerbation and remission. Muscle strength may be normal in well-rested patients, but weakness occurs promptly with exercise. Ptosis and diplopia resulting from extraocular

muscle  weakness  are  the  most  common  initial  complaints. Weakness of pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles results in dysphagia, dysarthria, and di ffi culty handling saliva. Patients with myasthenia gravis  are  at  high  risk  of  pulmonary  aspiration. Arm, leg, or trunk weakness can occur in any combination and is usually asymmetrical. Muscle atrophy does not occur. Myocarditis can result in atrial fi brillation, heart block, or cardiomyopathy. Other autoimmune diseases may occur in association with myasthenia gravis. For example, hyperthyroidism is present in approximately 10% of patients with myasthenia gravis.  Rheumatoid  arthritis,  systemic  lupus  erythematosus, and  pernicious  anemia  occur  more  commonly  in  patients with myasthenia than in those without myasthenia. Approximately  15%  of  neonates  born  to  mothers  with  myasthenia gravis  demonstrate  transient  (2  to  4  weeks)  skeletal  muscle weakness.  Infection, electrolyte abnormalities, pregnancy, emotional  stress,  and  surgery  may  precipitate  or  exacerbate muscle weakness. Antibiotics, especially the aminoglycosides, can aggravate the muscle weakness. Isolated respiratory failure may occasionally be the presenting manifestation of myasthenia gravis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment modalities for myasthenia gravis include anticholinesterase  drugs  to  enhance  neuromuscular  transmission, thymectomy,  immunosuppression,  and  short-term  immunotherapy,  including  plasmapheresis  and  administration  of immunoglobulin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ymectomy is  intended to induce remission or at least allow  the  dosages  of  immunosuppressive  medications  to be  reduced.  Patients  with  generalized  myasthenia  gravis  are  candidates  for  thymectomy.  Preoperative  preparation  should  include  optimizing  strength  and  respiratory function.  Immunosuppressive  drugs  should  be  avoided  if possible,  because  they  can  increase  the  risk  of  perioperative infection. If the vital capacity is less than 2 L, plasmapheresis  can  be  performed  before  surgery  to  improve  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticholinesterase drugs are  the fi rst  line  of  treatment  for myasthenia  gravis. Th ese  drugs  are  e ff ective  because  they inhibit  the  enzyme  responsible  for  the  hydrolysis  of  acetylcholine  and  thus  increase  the  amount  of  neurotransmitter available  at  the  neuromuscular  junction.  Pyridostigmine  is the most widely used anticholinesterase drug for this purpose. Th e  onset  of  e ff ect  occurs  in  30  minutes,  and  peak  e ff ect  is achieved in approximately 2 hours. Oral pyridostigmine lasts longer  (3  to  6  hours)  and  produces  fewer  side  e ff ects  than neostigmine.  Pyridostigmine  dosing  is  tailored  to  response, but the maximal dosage of pyridostigmine rarely exceeds 120 mg every 3 hours. Higher dosages may actually induce more muscle weakness, the so-called cholinergic crisis. Th e presence of signi fi cant muscarinic side e ff ects (salivation, miosis, bradycardia) plus accentuated muscle weakness a ft er administration of edrophonium (1 to 2 mg IV) con fi rms the diagnosis of a cholinergic crisis. Although anticholinesterase drugs bene fi t most patients, the improvements may be incomplete and may wane a ft er weeks or months of treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
likelihood of adequate spontaneous respiration during the postoperative period. A surgical approach via median sternotomy optimizes visualization and removal of all thymic tissue.  Mediastinoscopy  through  a  cervical  incision  has been  advocated  as  an  alternative  because  it  is  associated with a smaller incision and less postoperative pain. Th e use of  neuraxial  analgesia  minimizes  postoperative  pain  and thus improves postoperative ventilation. Th e need for anticholinesterase medication may be decreased for a few days postoperatively, but the full bene fi t of thymectomy is o ft en delayed for months a ft er surgery. Th e mechanism by which thymectomy produces improvement is uncertain, although acetylcholine receptor antibody levels usually decrease following thymectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plasmapheresis removes  antibodies  from  the  circulation and  produces  short-term  clinical  improvement  in  patients with  myasthenia  gravis  who  are  experiencing myasthenic crises or  are  being  prepared  for  thymectomy. Th e  bene fi cial e ff ects of plasmapheresis are transient, and repeated treatment introduces the risk of infection, hypotension, and pulmonary embolism. Th e indications for administration of immunoglobulin are the same as for plasmapheresis. Th e e ff ect is temporary, and this treatment has no e ff ect on circulating concentrations of acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immunosuppressive therapy (corticosteroids,  azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate) is indicated when skeletal muscle weakness is not adequately controlled by anticholinesterase drugs. Corticosteroids are the most commonly used and most consistently e ff ective immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. Th ey are also associated with the greatest likelihood of adverse e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  myasthenia  gravis  o ft en  require  ventilatory support  a ft er  surgery. Th erefore,  it  is  important  to  advise these  patients  during  the  preoperative  interview  that  they may  be  intubated  and  ventilated  when  they  awaken.  Factors that correlate with the need for mechanical ventilation during the postoperative period following transsternal thymectomy include disease duration of longer than 6 years, the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease unrelated to myasthenia gravis, a daily dose of pyridostigmine of more than 750 mg, and a vital capacity of less than 2.9 L. Th ese factors are less predictive of the need for ventilatory support following  transcervical  thymectomy,  which  indicates  that this less-invasive surgical approach produces less respiratory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  acetylcholine  receptor-binding  antibodies  of  myasthenia  gravis  decrease  the  number  of  functional  acetylcholine  receptors,  and  this  results  in  an  increased  sensitivity  to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Th e balance between active and nonfunctional acetylcholine receptors modulates the sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Th e initial muscle relaxant dose should be titrated according to response at the neuromuscular junction as monitored using a peripheral nerve stimulator. Monitoring these responses at the orbicularis

oculi  muscle may overestimate the  degree  of  neuromuscular blockade but may help to avoid unrecognized persistent neuromuscular blockade in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  possible  that  drugs  used  to  treat  myasthenia  gravis can in fl uence the response to muscle relaxants independent of the disease process. For example, anticholinesterase drugs inhibit  not  only  true  cholinesterase  but  also  impair  plasma pseudocholinesterase activity, which introduces the possibility of a prolonged response to succinylcholine. Th ey could also antagonize  the  e ff ects  of  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants. However, neither of these e ff ects is seen clinically. Corticosteroid therapy does not alter the dose requirements for succinylcholine but has been reported to produce resistance to the neuromuscular blocking e ff ects of steroidal muscle relaxants such as vecuronium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurement of neuromuscular function in patients with myasthenia gravis treated with pyridostigmine demonstrates resistance to  the e ff ects of succinylcholine. Th e 95% e ff ective dose (ED95 )  is  approximately  2.6  times  higher  than  normal. Because the dose of succinylcholine commonly administered to patients without myasthenia gravis (1.0 to 1.5 mg/kg) represents three to fi ve times the ED 95 , it is likely that adequate intubating conditions can be achieved in patients with myasthenia gravis using these doses. Th e mechanism for the resistance to succinylcholine is unknown, but the decreased number of acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction may play a role.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  the  resistance  to  succinylcholine,  patients with myasthenia gravis exhibit marked sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Even small doses of nondepolarizing muscle  relaxant  intended  to  block  succinylcholine-induced fasciculations can produce profound skeletal muscle weakness in  some  patients.  In  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  myasthenia gravis, the potency of atracurium and vecuronium is increased  twofold  compared  with  the  response  in  patients without the disease. Despite the increase in potency, the duration of action of intermediate-acting muscle relaxants is short enough that skeletal muscle paralysis can be achieved and yet be predictably reversed at the conclusion of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  of  anesthesia  with  a  short-acting  intravenous anesthetic  is  acceptable  for  patients  with  myasthenia  gravis. However,  the  respiratory  depressant  e ff ects  of  these  drugs may be accentuated. Tracheal intubation can o ft en be accomplished without neuromuscular blockers because of intrinsic muscle weakness and the relaxant e ff ect of volatile anesthetics on skeletal muscle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia is o ft en provided with a volatile anesthetic with or without nitrous oxide. Th e  use of volatile anesthetics can decrease the required dose of muscle relaxants or even eliminate the need for them. Should administration of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocker be necessary, the initial dose should be decreased by one half to two thirds and the response monitored using a peripheral nerve stimulator. Th e relatively short duration of action of intermediate-acting muscle  relaxants  is  a  desirable  characteristic  in  this  patient group. Th e respiratory e ff ects of opioids, which can linger into the postoperative period, detract from their use for maintenance of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At the conclusion of surgery, it is important to postpone extubation until clear evidence of good respiratory function is present. Skeletal muscle strength o ft en seems adequate during the early postoperative period but may deteriorate a few hours later. Th e need for mechanical ventilation during the postoperative period should be anticipated in those patients meeting the criteria known to correlate with inadequate ventilation a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenic Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenic syndrome (Eaton-Lambert syndrome) is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission that resembles myasthenia gravis (Table 21-5). Th is syndrome of skeletal muscle weakness, originally described in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung, has subsequently been described in some patients without cancer. Myasthenic syndrome is an acquired autoimmune disease  characterized  by  the  presence  of  immunoglobulin  G antibodies to voltage-sensitive calcium channels that causes a de fi ciency of these channels at the motor nerve terminal. Th is de fi ciency restricts calcium entry when the terminal is depolarized. Anticholinesterase drugs e ff ective in the treatment of myasthenia gravis do not produce an improvement in patients with  myasthenic  syndrome.  However,  3,4-diaminopyridine, which  increases  acetylcholine  release  at  the  neuromuscular junction, does improve muscle strength. Immunoglobulin also increases muscle strength temporarily (for 6 to 8 weeks).

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

Patients with myasthenic syndrome are sensitive to the e ff ects of  both  depolarizing  and  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade with anticholinesterase drugs may be inadequate. Th e potential presence of myasthenic  syndrome  and  the  need  to  decrease  doses  of  muscle relaxants should be considered in patients undergoing bronchoscopy,  mediastinoscopy,  or  thoracoscopy  for  suspected lung cancer.

SKELETAL DISEASES

Osteoarthritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoarthritis is by far the most common joint disease in the United States, one of the leading chronic diseases of the elderly and a major cause of disability. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative process that a ff ects articular cartilage. Th is process is di ff erent from rheumatoid arthritis because there is minimal in fl ammatory  reaction  in  the  joints. Th e  pathogenesis  is  likely  related to  joint  trauma  from  biomechanical  stresses,  joint  injury,  or abnormal joint loading resulting from neuropathy, ligamentous injury, or muscle atrophy. Pain is usually present on motion but is relieved by rest. Sti ff ness tends to disappear rapidly with joint motion,  in  contrast  to  the  morning  sti ff ness  associated  with rheumatoid arthritis, which can last for several hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One  or  several  joints  can  be  a ff ected  by  osteoarthritis. Th e  knees and hips are common sites of involvement. Bony enlargements, referred to as Heberden's nodes, are seen at the distal interphalangeal joints of the fi ngers. Th ere may be degenerative disease of the vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs, which can be complicated by protrusion of the nucleus pulposus and compression of nerve roots. Degenerative changes are most signi fi cant in the middle to lower cervical spine and in the lower lumbar area. Radiographic fi ndings include narrowing of the intervertebral disc spaces and osteophyte formation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although o ft en overlooked, physical therapy and exercise programs can provide bene fi ts  for  patients with osteoarthritis.  Maintaining  muscle  function  is  important  for  both  cartilage integrity and pain reduction. Pain can also be relieved by application of heat, use of simple analgesics such as acetaminophen,  and  treatment  with  antiin fl ammatory  drugs. Symptomatic improvement with application of heat  may  be due to an increase in pain threshold in warm tissues compared with  that  in  cold  tissues.  Transcutaneous  nerve  stimulation and acupuncture can be e ff ective in some patients. Systemic corticosteroids have no place in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Joint replacement surgery may be recommended when pain caused by osteoarthritis is persistent and disabling or signi fi -cant limitation of joint function is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kyphoscoliosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kyphoscoliosis  is  a  spinal  deformity  characterized  by  anterior fl exion ( kyphosis )  and lateral curvature ( scoliosis )  of  the vertebral column. Idiopathic kyphoscoliosis, which accounts for  80%  of  cases,  commonly  begins  during  late  childhood and may progress in severity during periods of rapid skeletal growth. Th e incidence of idiopathic kyphoscoliosis is approximately 4 per 1000 population. Th ere may be a familial predisposition  to  this  disease,  and  females  are  a ff ected  four  times more o ft en than males. Diseases of the neuromuscular system, such as poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy, may also be associated with kyphoscoliosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal curvature of more than 40 degrees is considered severe and is likely to be associated with physiologic derangements in cardiac and pulmonary function. Restrictive lung disease and pulmonary hypertension progressing to cor pulmonale are the principal causes of death in patients with kyphoscoliosis. As the scoliosis curve worsens, more lung tissue is compressed, which results in a decrease in vital capacity and dyspnea on exertion. Th e  work  of  breathing  is  increased  because  of  the abnormal mechanical properties of the distorted thorax and the  increased  airway  resistance  that  results  from  small  lung volumes. Th e alveolar-arterial oxygen di ff erence is increased. Pulmonary hypertension is the result of increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to compression of lung vasculature and the response to arterial hypoxemia. Th e Pa co 2 is usually maintained at normal levels, but an insult such as bacterial or viral upper respiratory tract infection can result in hypercapnia and acute respiratory failure. A poor cough contributes to frequent pulmonary infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperatively,  it  is  important  to  assess  the  severity  of  the physiologic  derangements  produced  by  this  skeletal  deformity. Pulmonary function test results re fl ect the magnitude of restrictive lung disease. Arterial blood gas values are helpful for detecting unrecognized hypoxemia or acidosis that could be  contributing  to  pulmonary  hypertension. Th ese  patients may  have  preoperative  pulmonary  infection  resulting  from chronic  aspiration.  Certainly,  any  reversible  component  of pulmonary dysfunction, such as infection or bronchospasm, should be corrected before elective surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  no  speci fi c  drug  or  drug  combination  can  be recommended  as  optimal  for  patients  with  kyphoscoliosis, it  should  be  remembered  that  nitrous  oxide  may  increase pulmonary  vascular  resistance. Th is  could  be  particularly problematic in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Monitoring central venous pressure may provide data suggesting an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the patient is undergoing surgery to correct the spinal  curvature,  special  anesthetic  considerations  include  the potential for blood loss and the risk of surgically induced spinal cord damage. Controlled hypotension as a way of decreasing the blood loss should be used with caution because of the risk  of  ischemic  optic  neuropathy  and  spinal  cord  ischemia. Prolonged  surgery  and  a  low  transfusion  threshold  could increase the risk of ischemia. At the time that the spinal curvature is straightened or distracted, excessive traction on the

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
spinal cord can result in spinal cord ischemia, which can produce paralysis. Th ere are several maneuvers designed to detect spinal  cord  ischemia.  One  is  the wake-up test, which  entails determining  that  no  signi fi cant  neuromuscular  blockade  is present  by  discontinuing  the  anesthetic  until  the  patient  is su ffi ciently  awake  to  move  both  legs  on  command  and  thus con fi rm that spinal cord motor pathways are intact. Anesthesia is then reestablished and the operation completed. Another method to con fi rm an intact spinal cord is to monitor somatosensory  and  motor  evoked  potentials. Th e  advantage  of  this monitoring  is  that  patients  need  not  be  awakened  intraoperatively. However, many anesthetic drugs, especially volatile anesthetics and nitrous oxide, interfere with the monitoring of evoked potentials, and neuromuscular blockers cannot be used if  motor  evoked  potentials  are  being  monitored. Th erefore, total intravenous anesthesia with an opioid and propofol or the combination of an opioid, propofol, and low-dose (0.33 MAC) volatile anesthetic is usually chosen to provide general anesthesia. Th ese  techniques  make  it  easier  to  interpret  changes in amplitude and latency resulting from spinal cord ischemia. A wake-up test may still be necessary if abnormalities persist. Measurement of evoked potentials is being used much more frequently than a wake-up test. At the conclusion of surgery, the  principal  concern  is  restoration  of  adequate  ventilation. Postoperative  mechanical  ventilation  may  be  necessary  in some patients with severe kyphoscoliosis.

Back Pain

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low  back  pain  is  the  most  common  musculoskeletal  complaint  requiring  medical  attention  (Table  21-6).  Risk  factors for  low  back  pain  include  male  gender,  frequent  li ft ing  of heavy objects, and smoking. In many patients, the cause of the back pain cannot be determined with certainty, and it is usually  attributed to muscular or ligamentous strain, facet joint arthritis,  or  disc  pressure  on  the  annulus fi brosus,  vertebral end plate, or nerve roots.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE LOW BACK PAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Back pain improves within 30 days in 90% of patients. Continuing ordinary activities within the limits permitted by the pain can lead to more rapid recovery than bed rest or backmobilizing exercises. NSAIDs are o ft en e ff ective for analgesia for  acute  back  pain.  Pain  arising  from  in fl ammation  initiated by mechanical or chemical insult to a nerve root may be responsive to epidural administration of corticosteroids, but few patients experience symptomatic relief from epidural corticosteroids if radicular pain has been present for longer than 6 months or if laminectomy has been performed. A herniated disc should be considered in patients with radiculopathy that is  suggested  by  pain  radiating  down  a  leg  or  by  symptoms reproduced by straight leg raising. Most lumbar disc herniations  producing sciatica  occur  at  the  L4-5  and  L5-S1  levels. Magnetic  resonance  imaging  can  con fi rm  a  herniated  disc, but fi ndings should be interpreted with caution because many asymptomatic  people  also  have  disc  abnormalities.  Surgical

Symptoms include pain, numbness, and weakness in the buttocks that can extend down one or both legs. Symptoms o ft en worsen with standing or walking and improve in the fl exed or supine position. Th e diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis is con fi rmed  by  magnetic  resonance  imaging  or  myelography. Conservative measures may be helpful in some patients, but surgical decompression and fusion are needed for those with progressive functional deterioration.

Rheumatoid Arthritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rheumatoid arthritis, the most common chronic in fl ammatory arthritis, a ff ects approximately 1% of adults. Th e incidence is two to three times higher in women than in men. Th e etiology of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, but it is suspected to be a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors and the immune system. Th e disease is characterized by symmetrical polyarthropathy and signi fi cant systemic involvement (Table 21-7). Involvement of the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of the hands and feet helps distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from osteoarthritis, which typically a ff ects weight-bearing joints and distal interphalangeal joints. Th e course of the disease is characterized by exacerbations and remissions. Rheumatoid nodules are typically present at pressure points, particularly below the elbows. Rheumatoid factor is an immunoglobulin G antibody that is present in the serum of up to 90% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis but is not present in osteoarthritis. However, the presence of rheumatoid factor is not speci fi c to rheumatoid arthritis. It is also present in patients with viral hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, bacterial endocarditis, sarcoidosis, and Sjögren's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  onset  of  rheumatoid  arthritis  in  adults  may  be  acute, involving  single  or  multiple  joints,  or  insidious  with  symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, and weakness preceding overt arthritis. In some patients, the onset of rheumatoid arthritis coincides  with  trauma,  a  surgical  procedure,  childbirth,  or exposure to extremes of temperature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Morning  sti ff ness  is  a  hallmark  of  rheumatoid  arthritis. Several  joints,  o ft en  the  hands,  wrists,  knees,  and  feet,  are a ff ected  in  a  symmetrical  distribution.  Fusiform  swelling  is typical when there is involvement of the proximal interphalangeal joints. Th ese joints are swollen and painful and remain sti ff for several hours a ft er the start of daily activity. Synovitis of the temporomandibular joint can produce marked limitation of mandibular motion. When the disease is progressive and unremitting, nearly every joint is a ff ected except for the thoracic and lumbosacral spine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cervical  spine  involvement  is  frequent  and  may  result in  pain  and  neurologic  complications. Th e  most  signi fi cant abnormality of the cervical spine is atlantoaxial subluxation and  consequent  separation  of  the  atlantoodontoid  articulation. Th is deformity is best seen on a lateral radiograph of the neck. With the neck fl exed, the separation of the anterior margin of the odontoid process from the posterior margin of the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 21-7 ■ Comparison of rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anterior arch of the atlas can exceed 3 mm. When this separation is severe, the odontoid process can protrude into the foramen magnum and exert pressure on the spinal cord or impair blood fl ow through the vertebral arteries. Since the odontoid process is o ft en eroded, e ff ects on the spinal cord may be minimized. Subluxation of other cervical vertebrae can also occur. Magnetic resonance imaging has con fi rmed the frequency of cervical spine involvement in rheumatoid arthritis.

Cricoarytenoid arthritis is common in patients with generalized rheumatoid arthritis. With acute cricoarytenoid arthritis, hoarseness, pain on swallowing, dyspnea, and stridor may accompany tenderness over the larynx. Redness and swelling of  the  arytenoids  can  be  seen  on  direct  laryngoscopy.  With chronic cricoarytenoid arthritis, patients may be asymptomatic or manifest variable degrees of hoarseness, dyspnea, and upper airway obstruction. Cricoarytenoid arthritis may make endotracheal intubation di ffi cult.

Osteoporosis  is  ubiquitous  in  patients  with  rheumatoid arthritis.

Many of the systemic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis are a result of small and medium-sized artery vasculitis due to deposition of immune complexes. Systemic involvement is usually most obvious in patients with severe arthritis.

In  the  cardiovascular  system,  rheumatoid  arthritis  may manifest as pericarditis, myocarditis, coronary artery arteritis, accelerated coronary atherosclerosis, cardiac valve fi brosis,

and formation of rheumatoid nodules in the cardiac conduction system. Aortitis with dilation of the aortic root may result in  aortic  regurgitation.  Pericardial  thickening  or  e ff usion  is present in approximately one third of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasculitis in small synovial blood vessels is an early fi nding in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but more widespread vascular  in fl ammation  may  occur,  especially  in  older  men. Patients may demonstrate a neuropathy ( mononeuritis multiplex ),  skin  ulcerations,  and  purpura. Th e  neuropathy is presumed to be caused by deposition of immune complexes in the vasa nervorum. Manifestations of visceral ischemia, including bowel perforation, myocardial infarction, and cerebral infarction, are possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  common  pulmonary  manifestation  is  pleural e ff usion. Many of these e ff usions are small and asymptomatic. Rheumatoid  nodules  can  develop  in  the  pulmonary  parenchyma and on pleural surfaces and may mimic tuberculosis or cancer on chest radiographs. Progressive pulmonary fi brosis,  associated  with  cough,  dyspnea,  and  di ff use honeycomb changes on chest radiographs, is rare. Costochondral involvement  may  a ff ect  chest  wall  motion  and  produce  restrictive lung changes with decreased lung volumes and vital capacity. Th is  may  result  in  ventilation/perfusion  mismatching  and decreased arterial oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuromuscular  involvement  can  be  seen  with  loss  of strength in skeletal muscles adjacent to joints with active synovitis. Peripheral neuropathies resulting from nerve compression, carpal tunnel syndrome, and tarsal tunnel syndrome are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  common  hematologic  abnormality  in  patients with  rheumatoid  arthritis  is  anemia  of  chronic  disease,  the severity of which usually parallels the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis. Felty's syndrome consists of rheumatoid arthritis  with  splenomegaly  and  leukopenia.  Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes) occurs in approximately 10% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Th e cause is lack of tear formation due to impaired lacrimal gland function. A similar pathologic process may involve the salivary glands, resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth). Th ese are both manifestations of Sjögren's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mild  abnormalities  of  liver  function  are  common  in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Renal dysfunction may be secondary to amyloidosis, vasculitis, or drug therapy.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis includes measures to relieve pain, preserve joint function and strength, prevent deformities,  and  attenuate  systemic  complications. Th ese  objectives may be met by a combination of drugs, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and orthopedic surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug therapy is used to provide analgesia, control in fl ammation, and produce immunosuppression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NSAIDs are  important for symptomatic relief of rheumatoid  arthritis  but  have  little  role  in  changing  the  underlying disease process. Th ey should not be used without the concomitant use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Aspirin remains an important drug for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, but its use has decreased because of the availability of newer NSAIDs. Th ese drugs decrease swelling in a ff ected joints and relieve sti ff ness, but associated gastrointestinal irritation and inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase 1  (COX-1)  may  necessitate  discontinuation  of  these  drugs. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are as e ff ective as COX-1 inhibitors in producing analgesia and reducing in fl ammation, and they evoke fewer gastrointestinal side e ff ects and do not interfere with platelet function. It appears, however, that some COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of cardiac ischemic events. Both COX-1 and COX-2 drugs can adversely a ff ect renal blood fl ow and glomerular fi ltration rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids are  potent  antiin fl ammatory  drugs  that decrease joint swelling, pain, and morning sti ff ness in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, the dosages of systemic corticosteroids  necessary  to  maintain  desirable  e ff ects  are o ft en associated with signi fi cant long-term side e ff ects, including  osteoporosis,  osteonecrosis,  increased  susceptibility  to infection, myopathy, hyperglycemia, and poor wound healing. Intraarticular corticosteroids produce bene fi cial e ff ects lasting about 3 months, but repeated injections may result in cartilage destruction and osteonecrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids are indicated as bridge therapy, that is, as therapy to decrease in fl ammation rapidly while DMARDs are starting to work in controlling the disease process. Prednisone dosages greater than 10 mg/day are rarely indicated for joint disease, but higher dosages may be needed to treat other manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis, especially vasculitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DMARDs are  a  group  of  drugs  that  have  the  potential  to modify or change the course of rheumatoid arthritis. Th ey can slow or halt the progression of the disease. Included in this group  are  methotrexate,  sulfasalazine,  le fl unomide,  antimalarials, D-penicillamine, azathioprine, and minocycline. Th ese drugs  generally  take  2  to  6  months  to  achieve  their  e ff ects. Patients who show no response to one drug may respond to another.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methotrexate is the preferred DMARD in the treatment of  rheumatoid  arthritis.  It  is  given  in  a  once-a-week  dosing  regimen.  Methotrexate  is  primarily  antiin fl ammatory. Monitoring  of  hematologic  parameters  and  liver  function test  results  is  necessary  in  individuals  being  treated  with methotrexate because of the risks of bone marrow suppression  and  cirrhosis.  Daily  folic  acid  therapy  can  decrease methotrexate toxicities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  appears  that  cytokines,  especially  TNFα and  interleukin-1,  play  a  central  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  rheumatoid arthritis. Interference with the function of TNF either by druginduced receptor blockade or by monoclonal antibodies is e ff ective in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Drugs such as in fl iximab and etanercept,  TNF  inhibitors,  are  quite  e ff ective  in  treating rheumatoid arthritis and act more rapidly than other DMARDs. Long-term toxicities such as infection (tuberculosis) and demyelinating syndromes are a concern. Anakinra, an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is e ff ective against the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, but its onset of action is slower and its overall e ff ect is less than that of the TNFα inhibitors.

Gold, the traditional DMARD, is extremely e ff ective therapy for some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not commonly used because of its toxicities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indications for surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis include intractable pain, impairment of joint function, and the need  for  joint  stabilization.  Eroded  cartilage,  ruptured  ligaments, and progressive bone destruction can lead to impairment that is amenable only to surgical treatment. Arthroscopic surgery is used to remove cartilaginous fragments and to perform partial synovectomy. When joints are destroyed by the disease process, total replacement of large and small joints can be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  multiorgan  involvement  and  side  e ff ects  of  drugs  used to treat rheumatoid arthritis must be appreciated when planning anesthetic management. Preoperatively, patients should be evaluated for airway involvement by this disease process. Compromise of the airway may occur at the cervical spine, temporomandibular  joints,  and  cricoarytenoid  joints.  Flexion deformity of the cervical spine may make it di ffi cult if not impossible  to  straighten  the  neck.  Atlantoaxial  subluxation may be present. Radiographic demonstration that the distance from  the  anterior  arch  of  the  atlas  to  the  odontoid  process exceeds 3 mm con fi rms the presence of atlantoaxial subluxation. Th is  abnormality  is  important,  because  the  displaced odontoid  process  can  compress  the  cervical  spinal  cord  or medulla or occlude the vertebral arteries. When atlantoaxial subluxation is present, care must be taken to minimize movement of the head and neck during direct laryngoscopy to avoid further displacement of the odontoid process and damage to the spinal cord. It is helpful to evaluate preoperatively whether there is interference with vertebral artery blood fl ow during fl exion, extension, or rotation of the head and cervical spine. Th is can be accomplished by having the awake patient demonstrate head movement or positioning that can be tolerated without discomfort or other symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Limitation of temporomandibular joint movement must be recognized before induction of anesthesia. Th e  combination of limited mobility of these joints plus cervical spine sti ff ness may make visualizing the glottic opening by direct laryngoscopy di ffi cult or impossible. Endotracheal intubation by fi beroptic laryngoscopy or by use of a videolaryngoscope may be indicated if preoperative evaluation suggests that direct visualization of the glottic opening will be di ffi cult. Involvement of the cricoarytenoid joints by arthritic changes is suggested by the preoperative presence of hoarseness or stridor or by the observation of erythema or edema of the vocal cords during direct  laryngoscopy.  Diminished  movement  of  these  joints can result in narrowing of the glottic opening and interference with passage of the tracheal tube or an increased risk of cricoarytenoid joint dislocation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  pulmonary  function  studies  plus  measurement of arterial blood gases may be indicated if severe rheumatoid  lung  disease  is  suspected.  Postoperative  ventilatory support might be needed in the subset of patients with such disease. Th e e ff ect of aspirin or NSAIDs on platelet function must be considered. Corticosteroid supplementation may be indicated in patients being treated long term with these drugs. Postextubation  laryngeal  obstruction  may  occur  in  patients with cricoarytenoid arthritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem chronic in fl ammatory disease  characterized  by  antinuclear  antibody production.  However,  these  antinuclear  antibodies  have  not been documented to be directly involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. SLE typically occurs in young women and may a ff ect as many as 1 in 1000 women. Stresses such as infection, pregnancy, or surgery may exacerbate SLE. Th e onset of SLE can  also  be  drug  induced,  with  procainamide,  hydralazine, isoniazid, D-penicillamine, and α -methyldopa being the most frequently  associated  drugs.  Susceptibility  to  the  development of SLE with exposure to hydralazine or procainamide is related to acetylator phenotype. Th e disease is more likely to develop in those who metabolize these drugs slowly (slow acetylators). Th e clinical presentation of drug-induced SLE is similar to that of the naturally occurring form of the disease, but  the  progression  is  usually  slower  and  the  symptoms  are usually mild and consist of arthralgias, a maculopapular rash, fever, anemia, and leukopenia. Th e natural history of SLE is highly  variable. Th e  presence  of  nephritis  and  hypertension heralds  a  worse  prognosis.  Pregnancy  in  patients  with  SLE, especially those with nephritis or hypertension, is associated with a substantial risk of disease exacerbation and poor fetal outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Detection  of  antinuclear  antibodies  is  a  sensitive  screening test for SLE. Th ese antibodies occur in more than 95% of SLE patients. Th e diagnosis is very likely if patients have three of four typical manifestations: antinuclear antibodies, characteristic  rash,  thrombocytopenia,  serositis,  and  nephritis.  However,  presentation  may  not  always  be  so  clear,  and  features such as arthralgias, vague central nervous system symptoms, rash, Raynaud's phenomenon, and/or a weakly positive antinuclear antibody test may make the diagnosis more di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical manifestations of SLE can be categorized as articular or systemic. Polyarthritis and dermatitis are the most common signs  and  symptoms. Many of the clinical manifestations of SLE are the result of tissue damage from a vasculopathy mediated by immune complexes. Others, such as thrombocytopenia  and  antiphospholipid  syndrome,  are  the  direct  result  of antibodies to cell surface molecules or serum components.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symmetrical arthritis involving the hands, wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles is common and occurs in 90% of patients. Th is arthritis is characteristically episodic and migratory, with pain that is out of proportion to the apparent degree of synovitis present. Lupus arthritis does not involve the spine. Another

<!-- PAGE=? -->
form of skeletal involvement is avascular necrosis, which most o ft en involves the head or condyle of the femur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic manifestations of SLE appear in the central nervous system, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, neuromuscular system, and skin. Neurologic complications can a ff ect any part of the central nervous system. Cognitive dysfunction occurs in approximately one third of individuals. Psychologic changes ranging from depression and anxiety to psychosomatic complaints  to  signs  of  organic  psychosis  with  deterioration  of intellectual  capacity  are  seen  in  more  than  half  of  patients. Most serious central nervous system manifestations appear to be the result of vasculitis. Fluid and electrolyte disturbances, fever,  hypertension,  uremia,  infection,  and  drug-induced e ff ects may contribute to central nervous system dysfunction. Atypical migraine headaches are common and may be accompanied by cortical visual disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis resulting in chest pain, a friction rub, electrocardiographic  changes,  and  pericardial  e ff usion  is  the  most common cardiac manifestation of SLE. Myocarditis may result in abnormalities of cardiac conduction. Congestive heart failure can develop with extensive cardiac involvement. Valvular abnormalities  can  be  identi fi ed  by  echocardiography. Th ese include verrucous endocarditis (Libman-Sacks endocarditis) that can involve the aortic and/or mitral valves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary involvement can manifest as lupus pneumonia characterized  by  di ff use  pulmonary  in fi ltrates,  pleural  e ff usion, dry cough, dyspnea, and arterial hypoxemia. Pulmonary function test results in these patients show restrictive lung disease. Recurrent atelectasis can result in shrinking or vanishing lung syndrome. Th is may be a result of diaphragmatic weakness or elavation caused by phrenic neuropathy. Pulmonary angiitis  with  lung  hemorrhage  may  complicate  severe  SLE. Pulmonary hypertension is present in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common renal abnormality is glomerulonephritis  with  proteinuria,  which  can  result  in  hypoalbuminemia. Hematuria is a frequent fi nding. Th e glomerular fi ltration rate can decrease dramatically and result in oliguric renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver function test fi ndings are abnormal in approximately 30% of patients. Severe liver disease is most likely due to infection or to undiagnosed autoimmune hepatitis or primary biliary cirrhosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuromuscular  manifestations  include  myopathy  with proximal skeletal muscle weakness and increased serum creatine  kinase  concentration.  Tendinitis  is  common  and  can result in tendon rupture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic abnormalities may be present. Th romboembolism associated with antiphospholipid antibodies can be an important cause of central nervous system dysfunction. Leukopenia,  granulocyte  dysfunction,  decreased  complement  levels,  and  functional  asplenia  have  been  implicated in  an  increased  risk  of  infection. Th rombocytopenia  and hemolytic anemia are seen in some patients. Th e  presence of circulating anticoagulants is re fl ected in a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. Patients with circulating anticoagulants o ft en manifest a false-positive test result for syphilis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some patients with lupus have cutaneous manifestations. Th e  classic  butter fl y-shaped  malar  rash  occurs  in  approximately half of patients. Th is rash can be transient and is o ft en exacerbated by sunlight. Discoid lesions on the face, scalp, and upper trunk develop in approximately 25% of patients with SLE but may occur in the absence of any other features of SLE. Alopecia is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment is determined by individual disease manifestations. Arthritis and serositis can o ft en be controlled with aspirin or NSAIDs. Antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and quinacrine are also e ff ective in treating the dermatologic and arthritic manifestations of SLE. Patients should use sunscreens and  avoid  intense  sun  exposure. Th rombocytopenia  and hemolytic anemia usually respond to corticosteroid therapy. Danazol, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, or splenectomy can be used if thrombocytopenia does not respond to glucocorticoid administration. In view of the increased susceptibility to infection, the risk/bene fi t ratio of splenectomy must be carefully considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids  are  the  principal  treatment  for  severe manifestations  of  SLE.  Corticosteroids  e ff ectively  suppress glomerulonephritis and cardiovascular abnormalities. However,  corticosteroid  therapy  can  be  a  major  cause  of  morbidity in patients with SLE. Death during the course of SLE may be  due  to  coronary  atherosclerosis. Th e  development and  progression  of  coronary  atherosclerosis  is  accelerated by treatment with corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive treatment  with  alternative  drugs  such  as  methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil may  be  preferable  to  prolonged  treatment  with  high-dose corticosteroids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia is in fl uenced by the magnitude of organ  system  dysfunction  and  the  drugs  used  to  treat  SLE. Laryngeal involvement, including mucosal ulceration, cricoarytenoid arthritis, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, may be present in as many as one third of patients.

Spondyloarthropathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spondyloarthropathies are a group of nonrheumatic arthropathies  that  include  ankylosing  spondylitis,  reactive  arthritis (Reiter's  syndrome),  juvenile  chronic  polyarthropathy,  psoriatic  arthritis,  and  enteropathic arthritis. Th ese diseases are characterized by involvement of the spine, especially the sacroiliac joints; asymmetrical peripheral arthritis and synovitis; and absence of rheumatoid nodules or detectable circulating rheumatoid factor (see Table 21-7). Th ere is a shared predilection for new bone formation at sites of chronic in fl ammation, and joint ankylosis o ft en results. Th ere is also a predilection for ocular in fl ammation. Causes of these seronegative spondyloarthropathies are unknown, but there is a strong association with HLA-B27.

ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ankylosing  spondylitis  is a chronic, usually progressive, in fl ammatory disease involving the articulations of the spine and adjacent so ft tissues. Spinal disease begins in the sacroiliac joints  and  moves  cranially. Th e  degree  of  spinal  disease  can range from just sacroiliac involvement to complete ankylosis of the spine. Hip involvement occurs in approximately one third of patients. Back pain characterized by morning sti ff ness that improves with activity and exercise plus radiographic evidence of sacroiliitis is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. Th e disease occurs predominantly in men and o ft en begins in young adulthood. Th e strong familial incidence is supported by the fi nding that 90% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis are HLA-B27 positive  compared  with  only  6%  of  the  general  population. Ankylosing spondylitis is o ft en erroneously diagnosed as back pain caused by lumbar disc degeneration. Examination of the spine may demonstrate skeletal muscle spasm, loss of lordosis, and decreased mobility of the vertebral column.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic involvement can manifest as weight loss, fatigue, and low-grade fever. Conjunctivitis and uveitis occur in approximately 40% of patients. Th e  uveitis  is  usually  unilateral  and presents as visual impairment, photophobia, and eye pain. Distinctive  pulmonary abnormalities associated with ankylosing spondylitis include apical cavitary lesions and pleural thickening that mimic tuberculosis. Cardiovascular involvement, such as aortic regurgitation or bundle branch block, is observed in 40% of  patients.  Arthritic  involvement  of  the  thoracic  spine and costovertebral articulations can result in a decrease in chest wall compliance and, consequently, a decrease in vital capacity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  ankylosing  spondylitis  consists  of  exercises designed to maintain joint mobility and posture plus antiinfl ammatory drugs.  NSAIDs  are  commonly  used.  In fl iximab and etanercept may cause profound improvement in this disease, but patients o ft en experience relapse when treatment is discontinued. For uveitis, topical corticosteroid eye drops are an integral part of management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  ankylosing spondylitis is in fl uenced by the magnitude of spinal involvement. Th e  spinal  column  can  be  sti ff and  deformed  and prevent  appropriate  cervical  spine  motion  for  endotracheal intubation.  Fiberoptic  or  videolaryngoscope  assistance  may be needed for endotracheal intubation. Restrictive lung disease  from  costochondral  rigidity  and fl exion  deformity  of the thoracic spine must be appreciated. Sudden or excessive increases in systemic vascular resistance are poorly tolerated if signi fi cant aortic regurgitation is present. Management of aortic regurgitation includes keeping the heart rate at 90 beats per minute or higher and the systemic vascular resistance lower than  normal.  Neurologic  monitoring  is  a  consideration  for patients undergoing corrective spinal surgery. Epidural or spinal anesthesia is an acceptable alternative to general anesthesia for perineal or lower limb surgery, but regional anesthesia may be technically di ffi cult due to limited joint mobility and closed interspinous spaces. Ossi fi cation of the ligamentum fl avum is uncommon, however. A paramedian approach for spinal or epidural anesthesia may be easier than a midline approach.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REACTIVE ARTHRITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reactive  arthritis  is  an aseptic arthritis  that  occurs  a ft er  an extraarticular infection, especially infection with Chlamydia, Salmonella, and Shigella species.  When  reactive  arthritis  is accompanied  by  extraarticular  features  such  as  urethritis, uveitis  or  conjunctivitis,  and  skin  lesions,  the  term  Reiter's syndrome is o ft en used. Predisposing factors include genetic makeup (HLA-B27 positivity).  Most  of  the  signs  of  Reiter's syndrome persist for only a few days, but arthritis progresses to sacroiliitis and spondylitis in approximately 20% of patients. Cricoarytenoid arthritis  can  also  occur.  Hyperkeratotic  skin lesions cannot be distinguished from those of psoriasis, and the two diseases frequently overlap. Management consists of antibiotic  treatment  for  the  initial  infection  and  NSAIDs  or sulfasalazine for symptomatic relief of the arthritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC JUVENILE POLYARTHROPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pathologic  process  in  chronic  juvenile  polyarthropathy  is  similar  to  that  in  adult  rheumatoid  arthritis.  Growth abnormalities may occur if arthritis appears before puberty. Hepatic dysfunction may be present, but cardiac involvement is unusual. An acute form of polyarthritis, which presents as fever,  rash,  lymphadenopathy,  and  splenomegaly  in  young children who test negative for rheumatoid factor and HLAB27,  is  designated Still's  disease. Aspirin  is  commonly  used to  treat  this  disorder.  Corticosteroids  can  e ff ectively  control the disease, but their use is limited because of concerns about drug-induced growth retardation in these young patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENTEROPATHIC ARTHRITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 10% to 20% of patients with Crohn's disease and 2% to 7% of patients with ulcerative colitis have an in fl ammatory polyarthritis, most o ft en involving the large joints of the lower extremities. In general, the arthritis activity parallels the activity of the gastrointestinal in fl ammation, and measures that control the gut disease usually control the joint disease as well. Th is arthritis is not linked to the presence of HLA-B27.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In fl ammatory  bowel  disease  can  also  be  associated  with sacroiliitis  and  spondylitis,  which  follow  a  pattern  in  which the  joint  in fl ammation  waxes  and  wanes  independently  of the gastrointestinal in fl ammation. HLA-B27 is found in 50% of  these  patients. Th is  arthritis  is  usually  chronic  and  may become ankylosing spondylitis. Treatment is as described for ankylosing spondylitis.

Paget's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paget's disease of bone is characterized by excessive osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity, which results in abnormally thick but weak bones. Th e  cause  is  unknown but may involve an excess of parathyroid hormone or a de fi ciency of calcitonin.

Chapter 21 SKIN AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
459

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  familial  tendency  is  present,  with  white  men  older  than 40  years  of  age  a ff ected  most  o ft en.  Bone  pain  is  the  most common symptom. Complications of Paget's disease involve bones (fractures and neoplastic degeneration), joints (arthritis),  and  the  nervous  system  (nerve  compression,  paraplegia).  Hypercalcemia  and  renal  calculi  may  also  occur. Th e most characteristic radiographic feature of Paget's disease is localized bone enlargement. Lytic and sclerotic bone changes may involve the skull. If the skull is a ff ected, it may be grossly enlarged,  and  irreversible  hearing  loss  may  occur.  A  radionuclide bone scan is the most reliable test to identify lesions caused by Paget's disease. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentration (re fl ecting bone formation ) and urinary hydroxyproline  excretion  (re fl ecting bone  resorption )  are  usually increased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Paget's  disease  is  designed  to  alleviate bone  pain  and  to  minimize  or  prevent  progression  of  the disease.  Calcitonin  is  a  hormone  secreted  by  the  thyroid gland that inhibits osteoclastic activity and decreases bone resorption.  Treatment  with  calcitonin  decreases  pain  and the  biochemical  and  radiographic  abnormalities  associated with Paget's disease. It may also stabilize the hearing loss caused by Paget's disease. Bisphosphonates can induce marked  and  prolonged  inhibition  of  bone  resorption  by decreasing osteoclastic activity. Whereas the e ff ects of calcitonin are short lived, disease activity remains low for many months, sometimes years, a ft er treatment with bisphosphonates is discontinued. Radiographically con fi rmed repair of osteolytic lesions may occur in response to treatment with bisphosphonates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conservative treatment of fractures in patients with Paget's  disease  is  associated  with  a  high  risk  of  delayed  union. Patients with Paget's disease who have severe arthritis of the hips  or  knees  o ft en  bene fi t  from  joint  replacement.  Rarely, osteotomy must be performed to correct bowing deformities of long bones. Patients with evidence of peripheral nerve compression,  radiculopathy,  or  spinal  cord  compression  require decompressive surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dwarfism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dwar fi sm can occur in two forms: proportionate dwar fi sm, in which the limbs, trunk, and head size are in the same relative proportions as those in a normal adult, and disproportionate dwar fi sm, in which the limbs, trunk, and head size are not in the usual proportions of those in a normal adult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACHONDROPLASIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate dwar fi sm. It occurs predominantly in females with an incidence of 1.5 per 10,000 births. Transmission is by an autosomal dominant gene, although an estimated 80% of cases represent spontaneous mutations. Th e basic defect is a decrease in the rate of endochondral ossi fi cation that, when coupled with normal periosteal bone formation, produces short tubular bones. Th e  anticipated  height  of  achondroplastic  males  is  132  cm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(52 inches) and that of females is 122 cm (48 inches). Kyphoscoliosis and genu varum are common. Premature fusion of the bones at the base of the skull can result in a shortened skull base and a stenotic foramen magnum. In addition, there may be functional fusion of the atlantooccipital joint with odontoid hypoplasia, atlantoaxial  instability,  bulging  discs,  and  severe cervical kyphosis. Th ese changes may result in hydrocephalus or damage to the cervical spinal cord. Central sleep apnea in individuals with achondroplasia may be a result of brainstem compression  due  to  foramen  magnum  stenosis.  Pulmonary hypertension leading to cor pulmonale is the most common cardiovascular disturbance that develops in individuals with dwar fi sm. Mental and skeletal muscle development are normal, as is life expectancy for those who survive the fi rst year of life.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with achondroplastic dwar fi sm is in fl uenced by potential airway di ffi culties, cervical spine instability, and the potential for spinal cord trauma with neck extension (Table 21-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with achondroplasia may undergo a number of speci fi c  operations,  including  suboccipital  craniectomy  for foramen magnum stenosis, laminectomy for spinal column stenosis or nerve root compression, and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. A history of obstructive sleep apnea may predispose to development of upper airway obstruction a ft er sedation or induction of anesthesia. Abnormal bone growth can  result  in  several  potential  anesthetic  problems.  Facial features, including a large protruding forehead, short maxilla,  large  mandible, fl at  nose, and large tongue, may result in di ffi culty obtaining a good mask fi t and in maintaining a patent upper airway. Despite these anatomic characteristics, clinical experience has not con fi rmed di ffi culty with upper airway patency or endotracheal intubation in most of these patients.

In achondroplastic patients with cervical kyphosis, tracheal intubation  may  be  di ffi cult  because  of  inability  to  align  the axes of the airway. Hyperextension of the neck during direct laryngoscopy should be avoided because of the likely presence of foramen magnum stenosis. Fiberoptically guided tracheal

intubation  may  be  considered  in  selected  patients.  Weight rather than age is the best guide for selecting the proper size of endotracheal tube.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Excess skin and subcutaneous tissue may make peripheral venous  access  technically  di ffi cult.  Patients  with  achondroplastic dwar fi sm undergoing suboccipital craniectomy, especially in the sitting position, are at risk of venous air embolism. Insertion of a right atrial  catheter  is  desirable  should  an  air embolism occur, but placing such a catheter may be technically di ffi cult because of the short neck and the di ffi culty of identifying landmarks, which may be obscured by excess so ft tissue. Evoked potential monitoring is useful during surgery that may be associated with brainstem or spinal cord injury. Achondroplastic  patients  respond  normally  to  anesthetic drugs  and  neuromuscular  blockers.  Anesthetic  techniques that  permit  rapid  awakening  may  be  desirable  for  prompt evaluation of neurologic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Delivery by cesarean section is necessary in women with achondroplasia because a small, contracted maternal pelvis combined with an infant of near-normal birth weight leads to  cephalopelvic  disproportion.  Regional  anesthesia  might be  considered,  but  technical  di ffi culties  may  occur  due  to kyphoscoliosis and a narrow epidural space and spinal canal. Th e small epidural space may make it di ffi cult to introduce an  epidural  catheter.  Osteophytes,  prolapsed  intervertebral discs,  or  deformed  vertebral  bodies  can  also  contribute  to di ffi culties with neuraxial blockade. Th ere are no data confi rming appropriate doses of local anesthetics for epidural or spinal anesthesia in these patients. Epidural anesthesia may be preferable to spinal anesthesia because it permits titration of the local anesthetic drug to achieve the desired level of sensory blockade.

RUSSELL-SILVER SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Russell-Silver syndrome is a form of dwar fi sm characterized by  intrauterine  growth  retardation  with  subsequent  severe postnatal  growth  impairment,  dysmorphic  facial  features (including mandibular and facial hypoplasia), limb asymmetry, congenital heart defects, and a constellation of endocrine abnormalities including hypoglycemia, adrenocortical insuffi ciency,  and  hypogonadism.  Developmental  and  hormonal abnormalities  tend  to  normalize  with  age,  and  individuals with  this  syndrome  can  achieve  adult  heights  near  150  cm (approximately 60 inches). Rapid depletion of limited hepatic glycogen  stores,  especially  in  small-for-gestational-age  neonates, may predispose to hypoglycemia. Th e risk of hypoglycemia diminishes as the child grows and usually disappears a ft er about 4 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation should consider the serum glucose concentration, especially in neonates at risk of hypoglycemia. Intravenous  infusions  containing  glucose  may  be  indicated preoperatively. Facial manifestations of this syndrome (similar to those in Goldenhar's and Treacher-Collins syndromes) may  make  direct  laryngoscopy  and  exposure  of  the  glottic opening di ffi cult. An endotracheal tube smaller than the predicted  size  may  be  needed.  Obtaining  a  good  mask fi t  may also be di ffi cult because of facial asymmetry. Administration of some drugs, such as muscle relaxants, based on body weight rather than body surface area may result in relative underdosing.  Infants  with  Russell-Silver  syndrome  may  be  especially prone  to  intraoperative  hypothermia  because  of  their  large surface-to-volume ratio. Unexplained tachycardia, diaphoresis, or somnolence a ft er emergence from anesthesia may indicate hypoglycemia.

OTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumoral Calcinosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumoral calcinosis is a rare genetic disorder that presents as metastatic calci fi cations adjacent to large joints. Joint motion is  una ff ected, but the masses may enlarge and interfere with skeletal muscle function. Treatment consists of complete excision of the masses. Th e principal anesthetic consideration is the rare involvement of the hyoid bone, hypothyroid ligament, or cervical intervertebral joints by this disease process, which leads to di ffi culty exposing the glottic opening during direct laryngoscopy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of the Shoulder

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rotator cu ff tear is the most common pathologic entity involving the shoulders. Th e prevalence of partial- or full-thickness rotator cu ff tears is 5% to 40% as determined at postmortem examinations of adults older than 40 years of age. Th e  incidence of rotator cu ff tears increases with age. As many as half of individuals older than 55 years of age have arthrographically  detectable  rotator  cu ff tears.  Other  pathologic  shoulder conditions are less common. Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) occurs in approximately 2% of the adult population and in 11% of the adult diabetic population. Th e  incidence of  calci fi c  tendinitis  ranges  from  3%  to  7%.  Shoulder  pain ranks just behind back and neck pain as a cause of disability in workers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroid  injection  into  the  subacromial  space  may provide symptomatic relief in patients with impingement syndromes with or without rotator cu ff tears, adhesive capsulitis, or supraspinatus tendinitis. Arthroscopic release or manipulation  under  anesthesia  may  be  used  in  an  attempt  to  restore shoulder motion. Total shoulder replacement (replacement of humeral and glenoid articular surfaces) reduces shoulder pain in most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Brachial plexus anesthesia via the interscalene approach with continuous infusion of local anesthetic can provide anesthesia for  shoulder  surgery  and  postoperative  analgesia.  Ipsilateral hemidiaphragmatic paralysis virtually always occurs with an interscalene block because the phrenic nerve lies close to the area into which the local anesthetic is injected for this block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 21 SKIN AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
461

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For this reason, interscalene block may be problematic and is best avoided in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease  or  with  neuromuscular  diseases  associated with weakness of the respiratory muscles. Wound in fi ltration or lavage with solutions containing a long-acting local anesthetic  such  as  bupivacaine  or  ropivacaine  can  also  provide postoperative analgesia following major shoulder surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Floppy Infant Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Floppy infant syndrome is a term used to describe weak, hypotonic skeletal muscles in infants. A diminished cough re fl ex and di ffi culty swallowing predispose to aspiration, and recurrent pneumonia is common. Progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles leads to contractures and kyphoscoliosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia  may  be  associated  with  increased  sensitivity  to nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  and  hyperkalemia  with cardiac  arrest  a ft er  administration  of  succinylcholine. Th ese infants are also susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Ketamine can be useful for anesthesia because it does not cause signi fi cant respiratory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheomegaly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheomegaly is characterized by marked dilation of the trachea and bronchi resulting from a congenital defect in elastin and smooth muscle fi bers in the tracheobronchial tree or to their destruction a ft er radiotherapy. Th e diagnosis is confi rmed by measuring a tracheal diameter of more than 30 mm on a chest radiograph. Symptoms include a chronic productive cough and frequent pulmonary infection, perhaps related to  chronic  aspiration. Th e  tracheal  and  bronchial  walls  are abnormally fl accid and may collapse during vigorous coughing.  Aspiration  during  general  anesthesia  is  possible,  especially if maximal in fl ation of the endotracheal tube cu ff does not produce a seal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alcoholic Myopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute and chronic forms of proximal skeletal muscle weakness occur frequently in alcoholic patients. Di ff erentiation of alcoholic  myopathy  from  alcoholic  neuropathy  is  based  on the  presence  of  proximal  rather  than  distal  skeletal  muscle involvement, an increased serum creatine kinase concentration,  myoglobinuria in acute cases, and rapid recovery a ft er cessation of alcohol consumption.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prader-Willi Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prader-Willi syndrome manifests at birth as hypotonia, which may  be  associated  with  a  weak  cough,  swallowing  di ffi culties, and upper airway obstruction. Nasogastric feeding may be  necessary  during  infancy. Th e  syndrome  progresses  during childhood and is characterized by hyperphagia leading to obesity  plus  endocrine  abnormalities  including  hypogonadism and diabetes mellitus. Pickwickian syndrome may develop in some patients. Th ere is little growth in height and patients remain  short.  Mental  retardation  is  o ft en  severe. Th ere  is  a deletion in chromosome 15 in this syndrome, and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance has been proposed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Micrognathia, a high-arched palate, strabismus, a straight ulnar  border,  and  congenital  dislocation  of  the  hip  may  be present.  Dental  caries  are  common  and  may  be  related  to chronic  regurgitation  of  gastric  contents.  Seizures  are  associated with this syndrome, but cardiac dysfunction does not accompany Prader-Willi syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e principal anesthetic concerns in these patients center on hypotonia and altered metabolism of carbohydrates and fat. Weak skeletal  musculature  is  associated  with  a  poor  cough and  an  increased  incidence  of  pneumonia.  Intraoperative monitoring of blood glucose concentration is necessary and exogenous  glucose  administration  may  be  needed,  because these  patients  use  circulating  glucose  to  manufacture  fat rather  than  to  meet  basal  energy  needs.  When  calculating drug doses, one should consider the decreased skeletal muscle mass and increased fat content in these patients. Muscle relaxant requirements may be decreased in the presence of hypotonia. Succinylcholine has been administered without incident to these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disturbances in thermoregulation, o ft en characterized by intraoperative  hyperthermia  and  metabolic  acidosis,  have been observed, but a relationship to malignant hyperthermia has not been established. Th ere is an increased incidence of perioperative aspiration pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prune-Belly Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prune-belly syndrome is characterized by congenital agenesis of the lower central abdominal musculature and the presence of urinary tract anomalies, including gross ureteral dilation, hypotonic  bladder,  prostatic  hypoplasia,  and  bilateral  undescended testes. Th e full syndrome appears only in males, but up to 3% of patients with an incomplete syndrome are female. Recurrent respiratory tract infections are seen and re fl ect an impaired ability to cough e ff ectively. It is unlikely that muscle relaxants will be necessary during the management of anesthesia in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitochondrial Myopathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitochondrial myopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders  of  skeletal  muscle  energy  metabolism.  Mitochondria produce the energy required by skeletal muscle cells through the oxidation-reduction reactions of the electron transfer  chain  and  oxidative  phosphorylation,  thereby  generating adenosine triphosphate. Defects in this process result in abnormal fatigability with sustained exercise, skeletal muscle pain, and progressive weakness. Th e hallmark lesions are large

<!-- PAGE=? -->
462

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
subsarcolemmal  accumulations  of  abnormal  mitochondria that appear as red-staining granules (ragged-red fi bers) on histologic analysis. Disorders of mitochondrial metabolism may also involve other organ systems with high energy demands, such as the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
KEARNS-SAYRE SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kearns-Sayre  syndrome  is  a  rare  mitochondrial  myopathy  accompanied  by  progressive  external  ophthalmoplegia, retinitis  pigmentosa,  heart  block,  hearing  loss,  short  stature,  peripheral  neuropathy,  and  impaired  ventilatory  drive. Dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure may be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of general anesthesia in these patients must consider  the  risk  of  drug-induced  myocardial  depression, development of cardiac conduction defects, and hypoventilation during the early postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multicore Myopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multicore  myopathy  is  a  heterogeneous  group  of  diseases characterized by proximal skeletal muscle weakness, a decrease  in  muscle  mass,  and  musculoskeletal  abnormalities  such  as  scoliosis  and  high-arched  palate.  Recurrent pulmonary infection is common and may be related to the severity  of  the  associated  kyphoscoliosis.  Cardiomyopathy may accompany this myopathy. Unlike in other myopathies, serum  creatine  kinase  concentration  is  usually  normal  in these individuals. Intelligence is normal, and the myopathy may have a benign course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative assessment of respiratory function is necessary in the presence of kyphoscoliosis and recurrent lung infection. Di ffi culty swallowing and an inability to clear secretions may re fl ect  pharyngeal  and  laryngeal  muscle  involvement.  Postoperative aspiration may be associated with impaired upper airway re fl exes and the lingering e ff ects of drugs administered during anesthesia. It is important to recognize the potential relationship  between  multicore  myopathy  and  malignant hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Centronuclear Myopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Centronuclear  myopathy  is  a  rare  congenital  myopathy characterized by progressive muscle weakness of extraocular, facial, neck, and limb muscles. Th e defect is a mutation in a gene important for muscle cell growth and di ff erentiation. Th ere are severe neonatal forms of this disease as well as  slowly  progressive  forms  that  can  begin  anytime  from birth to adulthood. Development of scoliosis with restrictive lung disease is an important manifestation of disease severity. Serum creatine kinase concentration is usually normal. Th e association of ptosis and strabismus with this myopathy increases the likelihood that a ff ected children will undergo surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  is  in fl uenced  by  the  degree  of skeletal muscle weakness, the presence of restrictive lung disease, and gastroesophageal re fl ux. Muscle relaxants are o ft en avoided  and  a  nontriggering  general  anesthetic  technique used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meige's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meige's syndrome is an idiopathic dystonic disorder that manifests as blepharospasm and oromandibular dystonia. It most o ft en  a ff ects  middle-aged  to  elderly  women.  Facial  muscle spasms  are  characterized  by  symmetrical  dystonic  contractions of the facial muscles. Dystonia is aggravated by stress and disappears during sleep. Th e pathophysiology of this disease is unknown but may be related to dopamine hyperactivity or dysfunction of the basal ganglia. Drug therapy (antidopaminergics, anticholinergics, acetylcholine agonists, γ -aminobutyric acid agonists) may have some e ff ect, and facial nerve block has been reported to provide sustained relief.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spasmodic Dysphonia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spasmodic  dysphonia  is  a  laryngeal  disorder  characterized by adductor or abductor dystonic spasms of the vocal cords. Th is  syndrome  typically  manifests  as  abnormal  phonation but on rare occasions is associated with respiratory distress. Stress can exacerbate it, and associated neurologic symptoms (tremors, weakness, dystonia of other skeletal muscle groups) are present in most patients. Botulinum toxin, which blocks neuromuscular  transmission,  may  be  e ff ective for treating the spasms of torticollis, blepharospasm, and spasmodic dysphonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative fi beroptic or direct laryngoscopy may be necessary to de fi ne anatomic abnormalities and to estimate airway dimensions. Th e presence of laryngeal stenosis may necessitate the use of smaller than usual tracheal tubes. Th e risk of pulmonary aspiration may be increased by vocal cord dysfunction caused by therapeutic interventions such as botulinum toxin injection  or  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve  interruption.  Continued monitoring during the postoperative period is important, because these patients may experience respiratory di ffi culties.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Juvenile Hyaline Fibromatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Juvenile hyaline fi bromatosis is a rare syndrome characterized by the presence of numerous dermal and subcutaneous nodules. Patients may have hypertrophic gingivae, osteolytic bone lesions, and stunted growth with normal mental development. Resistance to the e ff ects of succinylcholine has been described in patients with juvenile hyaline fi bromatosis.

Chondrodysplasia Calcificans Punctata

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chondrodysplasia  calci fi cans  punctata  is  a  rare  congenital syndrome caused by dysfunctional peroxisomes. It manifests as  erratic  cartilage  calci fi cation  resulting  in  bone  and  skin lesions,  cataracts,  and  cardiac  malformations.  In  surviving children, abnormal growth leads to dwar fi sm, kyphoscoliosis, and subluxation of the hips. Th ere is no available treatment. Orthopedic procedures are o ft en necessary to o ff set functional limitations of the disease and to stabilize spine and limb malformations. Tracheal cartilage may be involved by the disease process; this results in tracheal stenosis, which may complicate perioperative airway management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythromelalgia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythromelalgia  literally  means  "red,  painful  extremities." Erythema, intense burning pain, and increased temperature of the involved extremities are hallmarks of the disease. Th e feet, especially the soles, are most o ft en involved, and males are a ff ected twice as o ft en as females. Primary erythromelalgia  occurs  more frequently than secondary erythromelalgia, which is associated with myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia vera. Intravascular platelet aggregation may be prominent. Aspirin is the most e ff ective treatment for secondary erythromelalgia resulting from myeloproliferative diseases. Patients may seek relief by exposing the a ff ected extremity to a cooler environment, such as immersing the extremity in cold water.  Neuraxial  opioids  and  local  anesthetics  may  provide some pain relief.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Farber's Lipogranulomatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Farber's  lipogranulomatosis  is  an  inherited  disorder  caused by a de fi ciency of ceramidase that results in accumulation of ceramide  in  tissues  (pleura,  pericardium,  synovial  lining  of joints,  liver,  spleen,  lymph  nodes).  Progressive  arthropathy, psychomotor  retardation,  and  nutritional  failure  are  present, and most a ff ected individuals die by 2 years of age as a result  of  airway  and  respiratory  problems.  Acute  renal  and hepatic failure may re fl ect accumulation of ceramide in these organs. Di ffi culty in airway management is a common problem because of granuloma formation in the pharynx or larynx. Tracheal intubation is best avoided in patients with upper airway involvement, because laryngeal edema or bleeding from laryngeal granulomas is possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
McCune-Albright Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
McCune-Albright  syndrome  consists  of  a  triad  of  physical signs:  osseous  lesions  (polyostotic fi brous  dysplasia),  melanotic cutaneous macules (café au lait spots), and sexual precocity  (autonomous  ovarian  steroid  secretion).  Conductive and neural deafness occur when osseous lesions involve the temporal bone and impinge on the cochlea. Bony fractures are likely during childhood. Some patients show other endocrine dysfunction, especially hyperthyroidism, acromegaly,  and hypophosphatemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  important  anesthetic  implication  of  McCune-Albright syndrome is the presence of endocrine abnormalities, especially hyperthyroidism. Perioperative steroid supplementation may be a consideration when adrenal hyperactivity is present, because these patients may exhibit an altered cortisol response to stress. Vascular fragility may make venous access di ffi cult. Th ese patients may have fragile bones, and particular care is needed during intraoperative positioning. Tracheal intubation may be di ffi cult because of airway distortion associated with acromegaly or hypertrophy of so ft tissue in the upper airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Klippel-Feil Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Klippel-Feil syndrome is characterized by a short neck resulting from a reduced number of cervical vertebrae or fusion of several vertebrae. Movement of the neck is limited. Associated skeletal abnormalities include spinal stenosis and kyphoscoliosis. Mandibular malformations and micrognathia may be present. Th ere is an increased incidence of cardiac and genitourinary anomalies. Management of anesthesia must consider the risk of neurologic damage during direct laryngoscopy resulting from cervical spine instability. Preoperative lateral neck radiographs help in evaluating the stability of the cervical spine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteogenesis Imperfecta

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare,  autosomal  dominant, inherited disease of connective tissue that a ff ects  bones,  the sclera, and the inner ear. Bones are extremely brittle because of defective collagen production. Th e incidence of osteogenesis imperfecta is higher in females. Osteogenesis imperfecta can manifest in two forms: osteogenesis imperfecta congenita and osteogenesis imperfecta tarda. With the congenital form, fractures  occur  in  utero  and  death  o ft en  occurs  during  the perinatal  period. Th e  tarda  form  typically  manifests  during childhood  or  early  adolescence  with  blue  sclerae  fractures a ft er minor trauma, kyphoscoliosis, bowing of the femur and tibia, and gradual onset of otosclerosis and deafness. Impaired platelet  function  may  produce  a  mild  bleeding  tendency. Hyperthermia with hyperhidrosis can occur in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta. An increased serum thyroxine concentration associated with an increase in oxygen consumption occurs in at least 50% of patients with this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  is  in fl uenced  by  the  co-existing orthopedic deformities and the potential for additional fractures during the perioperative period. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta o ft en have a decreased range of motion of the cervical  spine  resulting  from  remodeling  of  bone.  Tracheal intubation must be accomplished with as little manipulation and  trauma  as  possible,  because  cervical  and  mandibular

<!-- PAGE=? -->
464

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
fractures  may  easily  occur.  Awake fi beroptic  intubation  or videolaryngoscopy may be prudent if orthopedic deformities suggest that it will be di ffi cult  to  visualize  the  glottic  opening with direct laryngoscopy. Dentition is o ft en defective, and teeth  are  vulnerable  to  damage  during  direct  laryngoscopy. Succinylcholine-induced  fasciculations  may  produce  fractures.  Kyphoscoliosis  and  pectus  excavatum  decrease  vital capacity and chest wall compliance and can result in arterial hypoxemia caused by ventilation/perfusion mismatching. Use of  automated  blood  pressure  cu ff s  may  be  hazardous,  since in fl ation can result in fractures. Regional anesthesia is acceptable in selected patients because it avoids the need for endotracheal intubation, but it may be technically di ffi cult because of kyphoscoliosis. Th e coagulation status should be evaluated before  a  regional  anesthetic  technique  is  selected,  because osteogenesis imperfecta may be associated with a prolonged bleeding  time  despite  a  normal  platelet  count.  Desmopressin  may be e ff ective  in  normalizing platelet function. Th ese patients may have mild hyperthermia intraoperatively, but it is not a forerunner of malignant hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fibrodysplasia Ossificans

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fibrodysplasia ossi fi cans is a rare inherited autosomal dominant  disease  that  usually  presents  before  6  years  of  age  and is  characterized  by  myositis  and  proliferation  of  connective tissue. Th e term myositis ossi fi cans is also applied to this disease, but fi brodysplasia ossi fi cans may be a more correct term because this is principally a disease of connective tissue rather than  of  skeletal  muscle.  Connective  tissue  undergoes  cartilaginous and osteoid transformation, which eventually leads to  displacement  of  skeletal  muscles  by  ectopic  bone.  Body parts become rigid. Ectopic bone formation typically a ff ects the muscles of the elbows, hips, and knees, leading to serious limitations of joint movement. Cervical spine involvement is common. Th ere may be varying degrees of cervical fusion, and atlantoaxial subluxation is possible. Temporomandibular joint involvement may also occur. Muscles of the face, larynx, eyes, anterior abdominal wall, diaphragm, and heart usually escape involvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During the early stages of the disease, fever may occur at the same time that localized lumps appear in a ff ected skeletal muscles.  Alkaline  phosphatase  activity  is  increased  during active  phases  of  the  disease.  A  restrictive  breathing  pattern can result from limitation of rib movement, but progression to respiratory failure is rare. Pneumonia, however, is a common complication.  Abnormalities  on  electrocardiogram  include ST-segment  changes  and  right  bundle  branch  block.  Deafness may occur, but mental retardation is unlikely. Th ere is no e ff ective therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deformities of the Sternum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pectus carinatum (outward protuberance of the sternum) and pectus excavatum (inward concavity of the sternum) produce cosmetic  problems,  but  functional  impairment  is  unusual.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Considerable narrowing of the distance between the posterior sternum and the anterior border of the vertebral bodies can be  tolerated  with  little  e ff ect  on  cardiopulmonary  function. Rarely is pectus excavatum associated with increased cardiac fi lling pressures or dysrhythmias. Obstructive sleep apnea may be more common in young children with pectus excavatum, perhaps because of greater inward movement of the sternum and the pliable costochondral apparatus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia is an infrequent but potentially lethal postoperative complication that is most o ft en associated with posterior fossa  craniotomy performed in the sitting position. Possible causes of macroglossia include arterial compression, venous compression resulting from excessive neck fl exion or a headdown  position,  and  mechanical  compression  of  the  tongue by  the  teeth,  an  oral  airway,  or  an  endotracheal  tube.  Macroglossia may also have a neurogenic origin. When the onset of macroglossia is immediate, it is easily recognized and airway obstruction does not occur because tracheal extubation is delayed. In some patients, however, obstruction to venous out fl ow  from  the  tongue  leads  to  development  of  regional ischemia from compression of the lingual arteries. Th is is followed by a reperfusion injury that does not occur until the out fl ow obstruction is relieved. As a result, the development of macroglossia may be delayed for 30 minutes or longer. Th ere is then the risk of complete airway obstruction occurring at an unexpected time during the postoperative period.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Epidermolysis bullosa and pemphigus are characterized by bulla formation (blistering) that can involve extensive areas of  skin  and  mucous  membranes.  Even  minor  frictional trauma  can  result  in  bulla  formation.  Airway  management may be di ffi cult because of bullae in the oropharynx. Airway  manipulation,  including  direct  laryngoscopy  and endotracheal intubation, can result in acute bulla formation, upper airway obstruction, and bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients with scleroderma can present several problems in anesthetic  management.  Decreased  mandibular  motion and narrowing of the oral aperture caused by taut skin may make endotracheal intubation di ffi cult. Oral or nasal telangiectasias may bleed profusely if traumatized. Intravenous access may be impeded by dermal thickening. Systemic or pulmonary hypertension may be present. Hypotonia of the lower esophageal sphincter puts patients at risk of regurgitation and aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive, symmetrical  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  wasting  but  no evidence  of  skeletal  muscle  denervation.  Sensation  and re fl exes are intact. Increased permeability of skeletal muscle membranes precedes clinical evidence of muscular dystrophy. Patients with muscular dystrophy are susceptible to malignant hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e term myotonic dystrophy designates a group of hereditary degenerative diseases of skeletal muscle characterized by persistent contracture (myotonia) a ft er voluntary contraction of a muscle or electrical stimulation of the muscle. Peripheral nerves and the neuromuscular junction are not a ff ected. Th is inability of skeletal muscle to relax a ft er voluntary  contraction  or  stimulation  results  from  abnormal calcium metabolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e clinical course of myasthenia gravis is marked by periods  of  exacerbation  and  remission.  Muscle  strength  may be  normal  in  well-rested  patients,  but  weakness  occurs promptly with exercise. Ptosis and diplopia resulting from extraocular  muscle  weakness  are  the  most  common  initial  signs.  Weakness of pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles results  in  dysphagia,  dysarthria,  and  di ffi culty  handling saliva. Patients with myasthenia gravis are at high risk of pulmonary aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  acetylcholine  receptor-binding  antibodies  of  myasthenia gravis decrease the number of functional acetylcholine receptors, and this results in an increased sensitivity to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. However, patients with myasthenia gravis demonstrate resistance to  the  e ff ects of succinylcholine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Myasthenic  syndrome  (Eaton-Lambert  syndrome)  is  a disorder  of  neuromuscular  transmission  that  resembles myasthenia  gravis.  Myasthenic  syndrome  is  an  acquired autoimmune  disease  characterized  by  the  presence  of immunoglobulin G antibodies to voltage-sensitive calcium channels that causes a de fi ciency of these channels at the motor  nerve  terminal.  Anticholinesterase  drugs  e ff ective in  the  treatment of myasthenia gravis do not produce an improvement in patients with myasthenic syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cervical  spine  involvement  is  frequent  in  patients  with rheumatoid arthritis and may result in pain and neurologic complications. Th e most signi fi cant abnormality of the  cervical  spine  is  atlantoaxial  subluxation  and  consequent  separation  of  the  atlantoodontoid  articulation. When this separation is severe, the odontoid process may protrude into the foramen magnum and exert pressure on the spinal cord or impair blood fl ow through the vertebral arteries.

■ Involvement  of  the  cricoarytenoid  joints  by  rheumatoid  arthritis  is  suggested  by  the  presence  of  hoarseness or stridor or by the observation of erythema or edema of the  vocal  cords  during  direct  laryngoscopy.  Diminished movement of these joints can result in narrowing of the glottic opening and interference with passage of the endotracheal tube or an increased risk of cricoarytenoid joint dislocation.

■ Th e  spondyloarthropathies  are  a  group  of  nonrheumatic arthropathies  characterized  by  involvement  of  the  spine, especially  the  sacroiliac  joints;  asymmetrical  peripheral arthritis;  synovitis;  and  absence  of  rheumatic  nodules  or detectable  circulating  rheumatoid  factor. Th ese  diseases have a shared predilection for new bone formation at sites of chronic in fl ammation, and joint ankylosis o ft en results. Ocular in fl ammation is frequently present.

■ Osteoarthritis is by far the most common joint disease, one of the leading chronic diseases of the elderly and a major cause of disability. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative process that a ff ects articular cartilage. Both the cervical and lumbar spine may be involved. Th is  process is di ff erent from rheumatoid arthritis because there is minimal in fl ammatory reaction in the joints with osteoarthritis. Th e pathogenesis is likely related to joint trauma from biomechanical stresses,  joint  injury,  or  abnormal  joint  loading  resulting from  neuropathy,  ligamentous  injury,  or  muscle  atrophy. Pain is usually present on motion but is relieved by rest.

■ Kyphoscoliosis is a spinal deformity characterized by anterior fl exion (kyphosis) and lateral curvature (scoliosis) of the  vertebral  column.  Spinal  curvature  of  more  than  40 degrees is considered severe and is likely to be associated with physiologic derangements in cardiac and pulmonary function. Restrictive lung disease and pulmonary hypertension progressing to cor pulmonale are the principal causes of death in patients with kyphoscoliosis. During corrective surgery  for  scoliosis  or  kyphosis,  spinal  cord  monitoring now  utilizes  measurement  of  evoked  potentials  (sensory and motor) much more frequently than the wake-up test.
