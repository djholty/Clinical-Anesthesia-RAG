Congenital anomalies of the heart and cardiovascular system occur in 7 to 10 per 1000 live births (0.7% to 1.0%). Congenital heart disease is the most common form of congenital disease and  accounts  for  approximately  30%  of  all  congenital  diseases that occur. With the decline in rheumatic heart disease,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
congenital  heart  disease  has  become  the  principal  cause  of heart  disease,  with  10%  to  15%  of  a ff ected  children  having associated  congenital  anomalies  of  the  skeletal,  genitourinary, or gastrointestinal system. Nine congenital heart lesions comprise more than 80% of congenital heart disease, with a wide range of more unusual and complex lesions accounting for the remainder (Table 3-1). Th e population of adults with congenital heart disease, surgically corrected or uncorrected, is estimated to exceed 1 million persons in the United States. As the success rate of cardiac surgery increases, more patients with complex cardiac defects will survive into adulthood and undergo noncardiac surgery and cardiac catheterization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transthoracic  and  transesophageal  echocardiography  has facilitated early, accurate diagnosis of congenital heart disease, assessment of the intraoperative and postoperative course, and evaluation of the ventricular function response to anesthetics in these patients. Fetal cardiac ultrasonography has permitted prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart defects, allowing subsequent  perinatal  management.  Imaging  modalities  such  as cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  and  three-dimensional echocardiography have increased the understanding of complex cardiac malformations and allow visualization of blood fl ow  and  vascular  structures.  Cardiac  catheterization  and selective angiocardiography are the most de fi nitive diagnostic procedures available for use in patients with congenital heart disease.  Advances  in  molecular  biology  have  provided  new understanding  of  the  genetic  basis  of  congenital  heart  disease. Chromosomal abnormalities are associated with an estimated 10% of congenital cardiovascular lesions. Two thirds of these lesions occur in patients with trisomy 21; the other one third is found in patients with karyotypic abnormalities, such as  trisomy 13 and trisomy 18, and in patients with Turner's syndrome. Th e  remaining  90%  of  congenital  cardiovascular lesions  are  postulated  to  be  multifactorial  in  origin  and  to occur as a result of interactions of several genes with or without the in fl uence of external factors (rubella, ethanol abuse, lithium use, maternal diabetes mellitus). A widely used acronym, CATCH-22 ( c ardiac  defects, a bnormal  facies, t hymic hypoplasia, c le ft palate, h ypocalcemia), describes a congenital

<!-- PAGE=? -->
heart disease syndrome attributed to defects in chromosome 22. An increased incidence of congenital heart disease in the o ff spring of a ff ected adult patients suggests a role for singlegene defects in isolated congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of congenital heart disease in infants and  children  o ft en  include  dyspnea,  slow  physical  development, and the presence of a cardiac murmur (Table 3-2). Th e diagnosis  of  congenital  heart  disease  is  apparent  during  the fi rst  week  of  life  in  approximately  50%  of  a ff ected  neonates and before 5 years of age in virtually all remaining patients. Echocardiography is  the  initial  diagnostic  step  if  congenital heart disease is suspected. Certain complications are likely to accompany congenital heart disease (Table 3-3). For example, infective endocarditis is a risk associated with most congenital cardiac  anomalies,  and  guidelines  for  antibiotic  prophylaxis have been developed (see later). Cardiac dysrhythmias are not usually a prominent feature of congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acyanotic congenital heart disease is characterized by a le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt (Table 3-4). Th e ultimate result of this intracardiac shunt, regardless of its location, is increased pulmonary  blood fl ow  with  pulmonary  hypertension,  right ventricular hypertrophy, and eventually congestive heart failure. Th e  younger  the  patient  at  the  time  of  correction,  the greater the likelihood that pulmonary vascular resistance will normalize. In older patients, if pulmonary vascular resistance is one third or less of the systemic vascular resistance, corrective surgery is likely to prevent or, in some cases, even cause slight regression of pulmonary vascular disease. Th e onset and severity of clinical symptoms vary with the site and magnitude of the vascular shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial Septal Defect

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial septal defect (ASD) accounts for about one third of the congenital heart disease detected in adults, with a frequency in females of two to three times that observed in males. Anatomically,  an  ASD  may  take  the  form  of  ostium  secundum in the region of the fossa ovalis (o ft en located near the center of the interatrial septum and varying from a single opening  to  a  fenestrated  septum)  (Figure  3-1),  ostium  primum (endocardial  cushion  defect  characterized  by  a  large  opening in the interatrial septum), or sinus venosus located in the upper atrial septum. Secundum ASDs account for 75% of all ASDs. Coronary sinus ASDs, associated with persistent le ft -sided superior vena cava, occur but are rare. Additional cardiac  abnormalities  may  occur  with  each  type  of  defect  and include mitral valve prolapse (ostium secundum) and mitral

FIGURE 3-1 Secundum atrial septal defect located in the center of the interatrial septum. Blood flow is along a pressure gradient from the left atrium (LA) to the right atrium (RA). The resulting left-to-right intracardiac shunt is associated with increased blood flow through the pulmonary artery (PA). A decrease in systemic vascular resistance or an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance decreases the pressure gradient across the defect, which leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the shunt.

regurgitation resulting from a cle ft in the anterior mitral valve lea fl et (ostium primum). Most ASDs occur as a result of spontaneous genetic mutations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physiologic consequences of ASDs are the same regardless of the anatomic location and re fl ect the shunting of blood from one atrium to the other; the direction and magnitude of the shunt are determined by the size of the defect and the relative compliance of the ventricles. A small defect (<0.5 cm in diameter) is associated with a small shunt and no hemodynamic sequelae. When the diameter of the ASD approaches 2 cm, it is likely that le ft atrial blood is being shunted to the right atrium (the right ventricle is more compliant than the le ft ventricle), which results in increased pulmonary blood fl ow. A systolic ejection murmur audible in the second le ft intercostal space may be mistaken for an innocent fl ow murmur in a child who has otherwise been well. As the volume of pulmonary blood fl ow increases with time, pulmonary valve closure is delayed, and the second heart sound is typically widely split and fi xed. A pediatric cardiologist should evaluate a child with a loud systolic murmur and wide splitting of the second heart sound. A heart murmur is usually detected at age 6 to 8 weeks. Th e electrocardiogram (ECG) may re fl ect right axis deviation and incomplete right bundle branch block. Atrial fi brillation and supraventricular tachycardia may accompany an ASD that remains uncorrected into adulthood. Th e chest radiograph is likely  to  reveal  prominent  pulmonary  arteries  and  mild  to moderate  cardiomegaly.  Transesophageal  echocardiography and color fl ow Doppler echocardiography are both useful for detecting and determining the location of ASDs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because they initially produce no symptoms or striking fi ndings on physical examination, ASDs may remain undetected for years. A small defect with minimal right-to-le ft shunting (ratio  of  pulmonary fl ow  to  systemic fl ow  is  <1.5)  usually causes no symptoms and therefore does not require closure. When pulmonary blood fl ow is 1.5 times the systemic blood fl ow, the ASD should be closed either percutaneously via cardiac catheterization or surgically with open sternotomy and cardiopulmonary  bypass  to  prevent  right  ventricular  dysfunction  and  irreversible  pulmonary  hypertension.  Symptoms resulting from large ASDs include dyspnea on exertion, supraventricular dysrhythmias, right heart failure, paradoxical embolism,  and  recurrent  pulmonary  infections.  Abdominal viscera  may  become  congested  because  of  increased  rightsided  pressures  and  circulating  volume.  Prophylaxis  against infective endocarditis is not recommended for patients with ASDs unless a concomitant valvular abnormality (mitral valve prolapse or mitral valve cle ft ) is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  ASD  associated  with  a  le ft -to-right  intracardiac  shunt has only minor implications for the management of anesthesia. For example, as long as the systemic blood fl ow remains normal,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  inhaled  drugs  are  not  signi fi cantly  altered  despite  the  increased  pulmonary  blood fl ow. Conversely, increased pulmonary blood fl ow can dilute drugs injected intravenously. It is unlikely, however, that this potential dilution will alter the clinical response to these drugs because the pulmonary circulation time is brief.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any change in systemic or pulmonary vascular resistance during the perioperative period will have important implications for the patient with an ASD. For example, drugs or events that  produce prolonged increases in systemic vascular resistance should be avoided, because this change favors an increase in the magnitude of the le ft -to-right shunt at the atrial level. Th is  is  particularly  true  for  a  primum  ASD  associated  with mitral regurgitation. Use of high fractional concentrations of inspired oxygen will decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and  increase  pulmonary  blood fl ow  and  le ft -to-right  shunt. Conversely, decreases in systemic vascular resistance, as produced by volatile anesthetics or increases in pulmonary vascular resistance due to positive pressure ventilation of the lungs, tend to decrease the magnitude of the le ft -to-right shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another  consideration  in  the  management  of  anesthesia in the presence of ASDs is the need to provide prophylactic antibiotics  to  protect  against  infective  endocarditis  when  a cardiac valvular abnormality is present. In addition, meticulously avoiding the entrance of air into the circulation, as can

<!-- PAGE=? -->
occur through tubing used to deliver intravenous solutions, is  imperative.  Transient  supraventricular  dysrhythmias  and atrioventricular  conduction  defects  are  common  during  the early  postoperative  period  a ft er  surgical  repair  of  an  ASD, which may warrant a temporary use of a pacemaker and/or pharmacologic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular Septal Defect

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common congenital  cardiac abnormality in infants and children (Figure 3-2), occurring in 50% of all children with congenital heart disease and in 20% as an isolated lesion. In the adult population, VSDs are  the  most  common  congenital  heart  defect  excluding  a bicuspid aortic valve. A large number of VSDs close spontaneously by the time a child reaches 2 years of age. Anatomically, approximately 70% of these defects are located in the membranous portion of the intraventricular septum; 20% in the muscular portion of the septum; 5% just below the aortic valve, causing aortic regurgitation; and 5% near the junction of the mitral and tricuspid valves (atrioventricular canal defect).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography with Doppler fl ow  ultrasonography con fi rms  the  presence  and  location  of  the  VSD,  and  color fl ow mapping provides information about the magnitude and direction  of  the  intracardiac  shunt.  Cardiac  catheterization and  angiography  con fi rm  the  presence  and  location  of  the VSD and determine the magnitude of the intracardiac shunting and the pulmonary vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physiologic signi fi cance of a VSD depends on the size of the defect, the pressure in the right and le ft ventricular chambers, and the relative resistance in the systemic and pulmonary circulations. If the defect is small, there is minimal functional disturbance because pulmonary blood fl ow is only modestly increased. If the defect is large, the ventricular systolic pressures  equalize,  and  the  relative  vascular  resistances  of  these two  circulations  determine  the  magnitude  of  systemic  and pulmonary blood fl ow. Initially,  systemic vascular resistance exceeds pulmonary vascular resistance, and le ft -to-right intracardiac  shunting  predominates,  with  corresponding  pulmonary artery,  le ft atrial,  and  le ft ventricular  volume  overload. Over  time,  the pulmonary  vascular  resistance  increases, and the magnitude of the le ft -to-right intracardiac shunting decreases; eventually, the shunt may become right to le ft with the development of arterial hypoxemia (cyanosis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  murmur  of  a  moderate  to  large  VSD  is  holosystolic and is loudest at the lower le ft sternal border. Th e ECG and chest radiographic fi ndings remain normal in the presence of a small VSD. When the VSD is large, there is evidence of le ft atrial and ventricular enlargement on the ECG. If pulmonary hypertension develops, the QRS axis shi ft s  to  the  right,  and signs  of  right  atrial  and  ventricular  enlargement  are  noted on the ECG. Th e chest radiograph may then exhibit chamber enlargement to varying degrees, depending on the volume of the shunt, and increased pulmonary vascularity.

Blood flow is along a pressure gradient from the left ventricle (LV) to the RV .

Th e  natural  history  of  a  VSD  depends  on  the  size  of  the defect  and  the  pulmonary  vascular  resistance.  Adults  with small defects and normal pulmonary arterial pressures are generally asymptomatic, and pulmonary hypertension is unlikely to develop. Th ese patients are at risk of developing infective endocarditis even though they may not meet the criteria for surgical correction of the VSD. In the absence of surgical correction, a large VSD eventually leads to le ft ventricular failure or pulmonary hypertension with associated right ventricular failure. Surgical closure of the defect is recommended in these patients  if  the  magnitude  of  the  pulmonary  hypertension  is not prohibitive. Once the pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratio exceeds 0.7, the risk of surgical closure becomes prohibitive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotic prophylaxis to protect against infective endocarditis is indicated when noncardiac surgery is planned in patients with unrepaired VSDs. Th e pharmacokinetics of inhaled and injected drugs is not signi fi cantly altered by a VSD. As with an ASD, acute and persistent increases in systemic vascular resistance or decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance are undesirable, because these changes can accentuate the magnitude

<!-- PAGE=? -->
52

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of the le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt at the ventricular level. In  this  regard,  volatile  anesthetics  (which  decrease  systemic vascular resistance) and positive pressure ventilation (which increases  pulmonary  vascular  resistance)  are  well  tolerated. However, there may be increased delivery of depressant drugs to  the  heart  if  coronary  blood fl ow  is  increased  to  supply the  hypertrophied  ventricles.  Conceivably,  the  technique  of increasing  the  inspired  concentrations  of  volatile  anesthetics to achieve rapid induction of anesthesia, as is o ft en done in children without cardiac defects, could result in excessive depression of the heart before central nervous system depression is achieved in children with VSD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Right  ventricular  infundibular  hypertrophy  may  be  present in patients with VSDs. Normally, this is a bene fi cial change because it increases the resistance to right ventricular ejection, which leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the le ft -to-right intracardiac  shunt.  Nevertheless,  perioperative  events  that exaggerate this obstruction to right ventricular out fl ow, such as  increased  myocardial  contractility  or  hypovolemia,  must be minimized. Th erefore, these patients are o ft en anesthetized with  volatile  anesthetics.  In  addition,  the  use  of  halothane, iso fl urane, and sevo fl urane, with a fractional concentration of inspired oxygen of 1.0, did not change echocardiographically derived pulmonary/systemic blood fl ow ratios in 30 biventricular patients with le ft -to-right shunts. In addition, intravascular fl uid volume should be maintained by prompt replacement with crystalloid or colloid (depending on the clinical scenario).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia for placement of a pulmonary artery band to reduce  overcirculation  and  pulmonary  blood fl ow  is  o ft en achieved  with  drugs  that  provide  minimal  cardiac  depression. If bradycardia or systemic hypotension develops during surgery, it may be necessary to remove the pulmonary artery band promptly. Continuous monitoring of the systemic blood pressure using an intraarterial catheter is helpful. Use of positive end-expiratory pressure may be bene fi cial in the presence of congestive heart failure but should be discontinued when the  pulmonary  artery  band  is  in  place. Th e  high  mortality rate associated with pulmonary artery banding has led to attempted complete surgical correction at an early age. Th irddegree atrioventricular heart block may follow surgical closure if the cardiac conduction system is near the VSD. Premature ventricular  beats  may  re fl ect  the  electrical  instability  of  the ventricle due to surgical ventriculotomy. Th e risk of ventricular tachycardia is low, however, if postoperative ventricular fi lling pressures are normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patent Ductus Arteriosus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A patent  ductus  arteriosus  (PDA)  is  present  when  the  ductus  arteriosus  (which  arises  just  distal  to  the  le ft subclavian artery and connects the descending aorta to the le ft pulmonary  artery)  fails  to  close  spontaneously  shortly  a ft er  birth (Figure 3-3). In the fetus, the ductus arteriosus permits pulmonary arterial blood to bypass the de fl ated lungs and enter the descending aorta for oxygenation in the placenta. In fullterm newborns, the ductus arteriosus closes within 24 to 48

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 3-3 Patent ductus arteriosus connecting the arch of the aorta (Ao) with the pulmonary artery (PA). Blood flow is from the high-pressure Ao into the PA. The resulting Ao-to-PA shunt (left-toright shunt) leads to increased pulmonary blood flow. A decrease in systemic vascular resistance or an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance decreases the magnitude of the shunt through the ductus arteriosus.

hours  a ft er  delivery,  but  in  preterm  newborns,  the  ductus arteriosus frequently fails to close. When the ductus arteriosus fails to close spontaneously a ft er birth, the result is continuous fl ow of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. Th e pulmonary/systemic blood fl ow ratio depends on the pressure gradient from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, the pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratio, and the diameter and length of the ductus arteriosus. Th e PDA can usually be visualized by echocardiography, with Doppler studies con fi rming the continuous fl ow into the pulmonary circulation. Cardiac catheterization and angiography make it possible to quantify the  magnitude  of  the  shunting  and  the  pulmonary  vascular resistance and to visualize the PDA.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients  with  a  PDA  are  asymptomatic  and  have  only modest  le ft -to-right shunts. Th is cardiac defect is  o ft en detected during a routine physical examination, at which time the characteristic continuous systolic and diastolic murmur is best heard at the le ft infraclavicular area or le ft upper sternal border. If the le ft -to-right shunt is large, there may be evidence of le ft ventricular hypertrophy on the ECG and chest radiograph. If pulmonary hypertension develops, right ventricular hypertrophy is  apparent. Th e  potential  adverse  e ff ects  of  an

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
untreated PDA include ventricular hypertrophy with congestive heart failure, pulmonary vascular disease including Eisenmenger's  syndrome  with  shunt fl ow  reversal,  poor  physical growth,  infective  endocarditis,  aneurysmal  dilatation  of  the ductus, and ductal calci fi cation. Surgical ligation of a PDA is associated with low mortality and is unlikely to require cardiopulmonary bypass. Without surgical closure, most patients remain  asymptomatic  until  adolescence,  when  pulmonary hypertension  and  congestive  heart  failure  may  occur.  Once severe pulmonary hypertension develops, surgical or percutaneous closure is contraindicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  estimated  that  70%  of  preterm  infants  delivered  before 28 weeks of gestation require medical or surgical closure of a PDA. Surgical ligation of a PDA can be performed in neonatal  intensive  care  units  with  low  morbidity  and  mortality rates. Nevertheless, the risks of surgical closure are signi fi cant and  include  intracranial  hemorrhage,  infections,  and  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve  paralysis,  especially  in  infants  born  at less  than  28  weeks  of  gestation.  Inhibition  of  prostaglandin synthesis with nonselective cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors appears to be an e ff ective medical alternative to surgery for closure of a PDA in neonates. Indomethacin, a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor used for this purpose, has reduced the need for surgery by 60% and is the fi rst line of therapy for PDA. Adverse side e ff ects of indomethacin include decreased mesenteric, renal, and cerebral blood fl ow; hence, a single standard indomethacin regime is not the ideal for every premature infant. Ibuprofen is a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor that can be used e ff ectively to treat PDA and has less e ff ect on organ blood fl ow than indomethacin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotic prophylaxis for protection against infective endocarditis  is  recommended  for  patients  with  PDAs  who  are scheduled  for  noncardiac  surgery.  When  surgical  closure  of the PDA is planned through a le ft thoracotomy, appropriate preparations must be made in anticipation of the possibility of large blood loss should control of the PDA be lost during attempted  ligation. Th e  decrease  in  systemic  vascular  resistance produced by volatile anesthetics may improve systemic blood fl ow by decreasing  the  magnitude  of  the  le ft -to-right shunt. Likewise, positive pressure ventilation of the patient's lungs  is  well  tolerated,  as  pulmonary  vascular  resistance, thereby decreasing the pressure gradient across the PDA. Conversely, increases in systemic vascular resistance or decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance should be avoided, because these changes will increase the magnitude of the le ft -to-right shunt.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ligation  of  the  PDA  is  o ft en  associated  with  signi fi cant systemic hypertension during the postoperative period. Th is hypertension  can  be  managed  with  continuous  infusion  of vasodilating drugs such as nitroprusside. Long-acting antihypertensive drugs can be gradually substituted for nitroprusside if systemic hypertension persists.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Death  occurs  in  fewer  than  1%  of  patients  undergoing surgical  closure.  Injuries  to  the  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve (hoarseness), the le ft phrenic nerve (paralysis of the le ft hemidiaphragm),  or  the  thoracic  duct  (chylothorax)  are  among the  complications.  Recanalization  (reopening)  of  the  ductus is  possible,  although rare, occurring a ft er  ligation  alone  and without division.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aorticopulmonary Fenestration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aorticopulmonary  fenestration  is  characterized  by  a  communication between the le ft side of the ascending aorta and the right wall of the main pulmonary artery, just anterior to the  origin  of  the  right  pulmonary  artery. Th is  communication is due to failure of the aorticopulmonary septum to fuse and completely separate the aorta from the pulmonary artery. Clinical  and  hemodynamic manifestations of an aorticopulmonary communication are similar to those of a large PDA. Th e diagnosis is facilitated by echocardiography and angiocardiography. Treatment is surgical and requires the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Management of anesthesia follows the same principles as described for patients with PDAs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bicuspid aortic valves occur in 2% to 3% of the U.S. population, and an estimated 20% of these patients have other cardiovascular abnormalities, such as PDA or coarctation of the aorta (see Chapter 2). Th e deformed bicuspid aortic valve is not stenotic at birth, but with time, thickening and calci fi -cation of the lea fl ets  occur (usually not apparent before 15 years of age) with resulting immobility. Transthoracic echocardiography  with  Doppler fl ow  studies  permits  accurate assessment of the severity of the aortic stenosis and of le ft ventricular function. Cardiac catheterization is performed to determine  whether  concomitant  coronary  artery  disease  is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic  stenosis  is  associated  with  a  systolic  murmur  that  is audible  over  the  aortic  area  (second  right  intercostal  space) and o ft en radiates into the neck. Most patients with congenital aortic stenosis are asymptomatic until adulthood. Infants with severe  aortic  stenosis,  however,  may  have  congestive  heart failure.  Findings in patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) may include a characteristic appearance in which the facial bones are prominent, the forehead is rounded, and the  upper  lip  is  pursed.  Patients  with  congenital  SV AS  may also  have  associated  peripheral  pulmonary  artery  stenoses in  conjunction  with  Williams-Beuren  syndrome,  characterized  by  distinctive  personality  and  behavioral  traits,  el fi n facies,  and  transient  neonatal  hypercalcemia.  Strabismus, inguinal  hernia,  dental  abnormalities,  and  moderate  mental retardation  are  commonly present. Th e  nonsyndromic form of SVAS is much less common. Of note, in congenital SVAS, myocardial ischemia has been implicated in the majority of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
54

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cases of sudden death in conjunction with anesthesia or sedation.  Identifying  these  patients  remains  problematic,  but cardiac  magnetic resonance imaging with echocardiography has proved useful in addition to the gold standard of cardiac catheterization.  In  congenital  aortic  stenosis  the  ECG  typically  reveals  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy.  Depression  of  the ST segment on the ECG is likely during exercise, particularly if  the  pressure  gradient  across  the  aortic  valve  is  more  than 50 mm Hg. Chest radiographs show le ft ventricular hypertrophy with or without poststenotic dilation of the aorta. Angina pectoris in the absence of coronary artery disease re fl ects the inability of coronary blood fl ow to meet increased myocardial oxygen requirements of the hypertrophied le ft ventricle. Syncope can occur when the pressure gradient across the aortic valve exceeds 50 mm Hg. In the presence of aortic stenosis, the myocardium must generate an intraventricular pressure that is  two  to  three  times  normal,  whereas  pressure  in  the  aorta remains within a physiologic range. Th e resulting concentric myocardial hypertrophy leads to increased myocardial oxygen requirements.  Furthermore,  the  high  velocity  of  blood fl ow through the stenotic area predisposes to the development of infective endocarditis and is associated with poststenotic dilation of the aorta. In adults with symptomatic aortic stenosis (syncope, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure), the indicated treatment is surgical valve replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  requires  careful  attention  to  maintaining an age-appropriate heart rate, sinus rhythm, preload, contractility,  and  systemic  vascular  resistance,  and  avoiding increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. Drugs with vagolytic  activity  (atropine)  and  sympathomimetic activity (pancuronium)  should  be  avoided,  and  the  dose  of  atropine  or glycopyrrolate given with a reversal agent should be carefully chosen so as to avoid signi fi cant tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia, dysrhythmias, and hypotension should be treated aggressively.

Pulmonic stenosis producing obstruction to right ventricular out fl ow is valvular in 90% of patients; in the remainder, it is supravalvular or subvalvular. Supravalvular pulmonic stenosis o ft en co-exists with other congenital cardiac abnormalities (ASD, VSD, PDA, tetralogy of Fallot). It is a common feature of  Williams's  syndrome,  which  is  characterized  by  infantile hypercalcemia and mental retardation. Subvalvular pulmonic stenosis  usually  occurs  in  association  with  a  VSD.  Valvular pulmonic stenosis is typically an isolated abnormality, but it may occur in association with a VSD. Severe pulmonic stenosis is characterized by transvalvular pressure gradients of more than 80 mm Hg or right ventricular systolic pressures of more than 100 mm Hg. Echocardiography and Doppler fl ow studies can determine the site of the obstruction and the severity of the stenosis. Treatment of pulmonic stenosis is with percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  asymptomatic  patients,  pulmonic  stenosis  is  detected  by the presence of a loud systolic ejection murmur, best heard at the second le ft intercostal  space. Th e  intensity  and  duration of the cardiac murmur parallel the severity of the pulmonic stenosis. Dyspnea may occur on exertion, and eventually right ventricular failure with peripheral edema and ascites develops. If the foramen ovale is patent, right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting of blood may occur, causing cyanosis and clubbing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia is designed to avoid increases in right  ventricular  oxygen  requirements. Th erefore,  excessive increases in heart rate and myocardial contractility are undesirable. Th e  impact  of  changes  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance is minimized by the presence of fi xed obstruction of the pulmonic valve. As a result, increases in pulmonary vascular resistance  due  to  positive  pressure  ventilation  of  the  lungs are  unlikely  to  produce  signi fi cant  increases  in  right  ventricular  a ft erload  and  oxygen  requirements. Th ese  patients are  extremely  di ffi cult  to  resuscitate  if  cardiac  arrest  occurs because external cardiac compression is not highly e ff ective in forcing blood across a stenotic pulmonic valve. Th erefore, decreases  in  systemic  blood  pressure  should  be  promptly treated with sympathomimetic drugs. Likewise, cardiac dysrhythmias or increases in heart rate that become hemodynamically signi fi cant should be rapidly corrected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coarctation of the Aorta

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coarctation of the aorta typically consists of a discrete, diaphragm-like  ridge  extending  into  the  aortic  lumen  and  is described by its relationship to the ductus arteriosus (preductal, juxtaductal, postductal). A postductal coarctation extends just distal to the le ft subclavian artery at the site of the aortic ductal attachment (ligamentum arteriosum) and is most likely to manifest in young adults. Less commonly, the coarctation is immediately proximal to the le ft subclavian artery (preductal); this situation is most likely to present in infants. Coarctation of the aorta is more common in males and may occur in conjunction with a bicuspid aortic valve, PDA, mitral stenosis or regurgitation, aneurysms of the circle of Willis, and gonadal dysgenesis (Turner's syndrome).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since most adults with coarctation of the aorta are asymptomatic, the problem usually is diagnosed during a routine physical examination when systemic hypertension is detected in the arms in association with diminished or absent femoral arterial pulses. Characteristically, systolic blood pressure is higher in the arms than in the legs, but the diastolic pressure is similar, which results in widened pulse pressure in the arms. Th e femoral arterial pulses are weak and delayed. Systemic hypertension presumably re fl ects ejection of the le ft ventricular stroke volume into the fi xed resistance created by the narrowed aorta. A harsh systolic ejection murmur is present along the le ft sternal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
border and in the back, particularly over the area of the coarctation. In the presence of preductal coarctation of the aorta, there is no di ff erence in the systemic blood pressures in the arms and legs since extensive collateral arterial circulation to the distal body through the internal thoracic, intercostal, scapular, and subclavian arteries is present. In such cases, a systolic murmur may be heard in the back, re fl ecting this collateral blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ECG shows signs of le ft ventricular hypertrophy. On the  chest  radiograph,  increased  collateral fl ow  through  the intercostal arteries causes symmetrical notching of the posterior third of the third through eighth ribs. Notching is not seen in the anterior ribs because the anterior intercostal arteries are not located in costal grooves. Th e coarctation may be visible as an indentation of the aorta with prestenotic or poststenotic dilation of the aorta, producing the "reversed E," or "3," sign. Th e coarctation may be visualized with echocardiography, and Doppler examination makes it possible to estimate the transcoarctation pressure gradient. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and contrast aortography provide precise anatomic information regarding the location and length of the coarctation and the degree of collateral circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  clinical  symptoms  of  a  previously  unrecognized coarctation of the aorta manifest, they usually include headache,  dizziness,  epistaxis,  and  palpitations.  Occasionally, diminished blood fl ow to the legs causes claudication. Women with coarctation of the aorta are at increased risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy. Complications of coarctation of the aorta  include  systemic  hypertension,  le ft ventricular  failure, aortic  dissection,  premature  ischemic heart disease presumably  related  to  chronic  hypertension,  infective  endocarditis, and cerebrovascular accidents caused by rupture of intracerebral aneurysms. Patients with known coarctation of the aorta should be given prophylactic antibiotics  in  accordance  with the recommended guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  resection  of  the  coarctation  of  the  aorta  should  be considered for patients with a transcoarctation pressure gradient of more than 30 mm Hg. Although balloon dilation is a  therapeutic  alternative,  the  procedure  is  associated  with  a higher incidence of subsequent aortic aneurysm and recurrent coarctation than is surgical resection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for surgical resection of coarctation of the aorta must consider (1) the adequacy of perfusion to the lower portion of the body during cross-clamping of the aorta, (2)  the  propensity  for  systemic  hypertension  during  crossclamping of the aorta, and (3) the risk of neurologic sequelae due to ischemia of the spinal cord. Blood fl ow to the anterior spinal artery is augmented by radicular branches of the intercostal arteries and may be compromised during cross-clamping of the aorta for surgical resection of coarctation of the aorta. Paraplegia a ft er surgical resection of coarctation of the aorta is a rare complication. Continuous monitoring of systemic blood pressure above and below the coarctation is achieved by placing a catheter in the right radial artery and in a femoral artery. By monitoring these pressures simultaneously, it is possible to evaluate the adequacy of the collateral circulation during periods of aortic cross-clamping. Mean arterial pressures in the lower extremities should be at least 40 mm Hg to ensure adequate blood fl ow to the kidneys and spinal cord. If the systemic blood pressure cannot be maintained above this level, it may be necessary to use partial circulatory bypass. Somatosensory evoked potentials are useful for monitoring spinal cord function and the  adequacy of its  blood fl ow during cross-clamping of the aorta. Nevertheless, case reports of paraplegia despite normal somatosensory evoked potentials suggest that monitoring posterior (sensory) cord function does not ensure adequate blood fl ow to the anterior (motor) portion of the spinal cord. Excessive increases in systolic blood pressure during cross-clamping of the aorta may adversely increase the work of the heart and make surgical repair more di ffi cult. In this situation, the use of volatile anesthetics is helpful for maintaining normal systemic blood pressures. If systemic hypertension persists, continuous intravenous infusions of nitroprusside should be considered. Th e disadvantages of lowering the systemic blood pressure to normal levels are excessively decreased perfusion pressure in the lower part of the body and inadequate blood fl ow to the kidneys and spinal cord.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediately  postoperative  complications  include  paradoxical hypertension, possible sequelae of a bicuspid aortic valve (infective endocarditis and aortic regurgitation), and paraplegia. Baroreceptor re fl exes, activation of the renin-angiotensinaldosterone  system,  and  excessive  release  of  catecholamines have been implicated as possible causes of immediately postoperative  systemic  hypertension.  Regardless  of  the  cause, intravenous administration of nitroprusside with or without esmolol e ff ectively controls the systemic blood pressure during the early postoperative period. Longer-acting antihypertensive  drugs  may  be  needed  if  hypertension  persists.  If  a thoracic epidural catheter has been placed, local anesthetics or clonidine may be e ff ective adjuvants to control blood pressure. Paraplegia manifesting during the immediately postoperative period  is  assumed  to  re fl ect  ischemic  damage  to  the  spinal cord  during  the  aortic  cross-clamping  required  for  surgical resection  of  the  coarctation.  Le ft recurrent  laryngeal  nerve injury,  manifesting  as  stridor  or  hoarseness,  or  le ft phrenic nerve injury may prolong the need for airway and respiratory support. Abdominal pain may occur during the postoperative period and is presumably due to sudden increases in blood fl ow  to  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  which  leads  to  increased vasoactivity. Early feeding is not recommended because of the concerns about postcoarctation mesenteric arteritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of persistent or recurrent systemic hypertension and the survival rate are in fl uenced by the patient's age at the time of surgery. Most of the patients who undergo surgery during childhood are normotensive 5 years later, whereas those who undergo surgery a ft er 40 years of age o ft en manifest persistent systemic hypertension.

CYANOTIC CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyanotic congenital heart disease is characterized by a rightto-le ft intracardiac shunt (Table 3-5) with associated decreases in  pulmonary  blood fl ow  and  the  development  of  arterial hypoxemia. Th e magnitude of shunting determines the severity of arterial hypoxemia. Erythrocytosis secondary to chronic arterial hypoxemia results in a risk of thromboembolism, especially when the hematocrit exceeds 70%. Patients with secondary erythrocytosis may exhibit coagulation defects, most likely due to de fi ciencies of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver and defective platelet aggregation. Development of a brain abscess is a major risk in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. Th e onset of a brain abscess o ft en mimics a stroke. Survival in the presence of a right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt  requires  a  communication  between  the  systemic  and pulmonary circulations. Tetralogy of Fallot is the prototype of these defects and is included in the "5 Ts," or common cyanotic congenital heart defects (tetralogy of Fallot, transposition  of  the  great  arteries,  tricuspid  atresia,  total  anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and truncus arteriosus). Most children with cyanotic congenital heart disease do not survive to adulthood without surgical intervention. Principles for the management of anesthesia are the same for all the cyanotic congenital cardiac defects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetralogy of Fallot

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetralogy  of  Fallot,  the  most  common  cyanotic  congenital heart defect, accounting for about 10% of all congenital heart disease cases, is characterized by a large single VSD, an aorta that overrides the right and le ft ventricles, obstruction to right ventricular out fl ow (subvalvular, valvular, supravalvular, pulmonary arterial branches), and right ventricular hypertrophy (Figure 3-4). Several abnormalities may occur in association with  tetralogy  of  Fallot,  including  right  aortic  arch  in  25% of  cases,  ASD  (pentalogy  of  Fallot)  in  15%  of  patients,  and coronary  arterial  anomalies.  Right  ventricular  hypertrophy occurs because the VSD permits continuous exposure of the right  ventricle  to  the  high  pressures  present  in  the  le ft ventricle.  Right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunting  occurs  because  of increased  resistance  to fl ow in the right  ventricular  out fl ow tract, the severity of which determines the magnitude of the shunt. Because the resistance to fl ow across the right ventricular  out fl ow tract is  relatively fi xed,  changes  in  systemic  vascular resistance (drug induced) may a ff ect the magnitude of the shunt. Decreases in systemic vascular resistance increase

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 3-4 Anatomic cardiac defects associated with tetralogy of Fallot. Defects include (1) ventricular septal defect, (2) aorta (Ao) overriding the pulmonary artery (PA) outflow tract, (3) obstruction to blood flow through a narrowed PA or stenotic pulmonic valve, and (4) right ventricular hypertrophy. Obstruction to PA outflow results in a pressure gradient that favors blood flow across the ventricular septal defect from the right ventricle (RV) to the left ventricle (LV). The resulting right-to-left intracardiac shunt combined with obstruction to ejection of the stroke volume from the RV leads to marked decreases in pulmonary blood flow and the development of arterial hypoxemia. Any event that increases pulmonary vascular resistance or decreases systemic vascular resistance increases the magnitude of the shunt and accentuates arterial hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography is used to establish the diagnosis, assess for the  presence  of  associated  abnormalities,  and  determine  the level and severity of the obstruction to right ventricular out fl ow, the size of the main pulmonary artery and its branches, and the number and location of the VSDs. Right-to-le ft shunting through the VSD is visualized by color Doppler imaging, and the severity of the right ventricular out fl ow tract obstruction can be determined by spectral Doppler measurement. Cardiac catheterization  further  con fi rms  the  diagnosis  and  permits con fi rmation of anatomic and hemodynamic data, including the location and magnitude of the right-to-le ft shunt, the level and severity of the right ventricular out fl ow obstruction, the anatomic features of the right ventricular out fl ow obstruction,

the anatomic features of the right ventricular out fl ow tract and the main pulmonary artery and its branches, and the origin and course of the coronary arteries. Magnetic resonance imaging can also provide much of this information.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typically the infant with tetralogy of Fallot may be pink (not cyanotic) as a neonate and develops cyanosis between 2 and 6 months of age. Th e most common auscultatory fi nding is a systolic ejection murmur heard along the le ft sternal  border resulting from blood fl ow across the stenotic pulmonic valve or right ventricular out fl ow tract. In contrast to pulmonic stenosis with an intact ventricular septum, the murmur of tetralogy of Fallot becomes shorter and less intense with increasing severity of pulmonic stenosis. During a hypercyanotic spell, the murmur disappears or becomes very so ft .  A holosystolic murmur of VSD may be heard in the le ft lower sternal border in some children. Congestive heart failure rarely develops, because the large VSD permits equilibration of intraventricular pressures and cardiac workload. Chest radiographs show evidence of decreased lung vascularity, and the heart is boot shaped with an upturned right ventricular apex and a concave main pulmonary arterial segment. Th e ECG is characterized by changes indicative of right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Arterial oxygen desaturation is present even when the patient breathes 100% oxygen (Pa o 2 is  usually <50 mm Hg), indicating central cyanosis. Compensatory erythropoiesis is proportional to the magnitude of the arterial hypoxemia. Th e Pa co 2 and arterial pH are usually normal. Squatting is  a  common  feature  of  children  with  tetralogy  of  Fallot.  It is  speculated  that  squatting  increases  the  systemic  vascular resistance  by  kinking  the  large  arteries  in  the  inguinal  area. Th e resulting increase in systemic vascular resistance tends to decrease the magnitude of the right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt, which  leads  to  increased  pulmonary  blood fl ow and subsequent improvement in arterial oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercyanotic Attacks

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercyanotic attacks are characterized by sudden spells of  arterial  hypoxemia  associated  with  worsening  cyanosis, increasing rate and depth of respirations (hyperpnea), and, in some instances, loss of consciousness, seizures, cerebrovascular accidents, and even death. Th ese attacks can occur without obvious provocation but are o ft en associated with crying, defecation, feeding, or exercise. Th eir mechanism is not known, but the most likely explanation is a sudden decrease in pulmonary blood fl ow due to spasm of the infundibular cardiac muscle  or  decreased  systemic  vascular  resistance. Th ey  can occur any time between 1 month and 12 years of age, but the peak incidence is at 2 to 3 months.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  hypercyanotic  attacks  is  in fl uenced  by  the cause of the pulmonary out fl ow obstruction. When symptoms re fl ect a dynamic infundibular obstruction (spasm), appropriate  treatment  is  administration  of β -adrenergic  antagonists such as esmolol or propranolol. Indeed, long-term oral propranolol therapy is indicated in patients who have recurrent hypercyanotic  attacks  caused  by  spasm  of  the  out fl ow  tract muscle. If the cause is decreased systemic vascular resistance, treatment is intravenous administration of fl uids and/or phenylephrine. Emergently, the infant may be placed in the kneechest position. Sympathomimetic drugs that display β -agonist properties are not selected because they may accentuate the spasm of the infundibular cardiac muscle. Recurrent hypercyanotic attacks indicate the need for surgical correction of the abnormalities associated with tetralogy of Fallot.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese attacks do not occur in adolescents or adults. Adults with tetralogy of Fallot manifest dyspnea and limited exercise tolerance. Th ey may also have complications of chronic cyanosis,  including  erythrocytosis,  hyperviscosity,  abnormalities  of  hemostasis,  cerebral  abscess  or  stroke,  and  infective endocarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular Accident

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular  accidents  are  common  in  children  with severe  tetralogy  of  Fallot.  Cerebrovascular  thrombosis  or severe  arterial  hypoxemia  may  be  the  explanation  for  these adverse responses. Dehydration and polycythemia may contribute to thrombosis. Hemoglobin concentrations exceeding 20 g/dL are common in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral Abscess

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A cerebral abscess is suggested by the abrupt onset of headache, fever, and lethargy followed by persistent emesis and the appearance of seizure activity. Th e most likely cause is arterial seeding into areas of previous cerebral infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infective Endocarditis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infective endocarditis is a constant danger in patients with tetralogy of Fallot and is associated with a high mortality rate. Antibiotics  should  be  administered  to  protect  against  this serious possibility whenever dental or surgical procedures are planned in these patients in keeping with standard guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of tetralogy of Fallot is complete surgical correction when patients are extremely young (closure of the VSD with a Dacron patch and relief of right ventricular out fl ow obstruction by placement of a synthetic gra ft ).  Infants  with pulmonary atresia  undergo  Rastelli's  procedures.  Without  surgery, mortality exceeds 50% by 3 years of age. Pulmonic regurgitation caused by an incompetent pulmonic valve usually results from surgical correction of the cardiac defects characteristic of tetralogy of Fallot but poses no major hazard unless the distal pulmonary arteries are hypoplastic, in which case volume overload of the right ventricle secondary to regurgitant blood fl ow may result. Platelet dysfunction and hypo fi brinogenemia are common in these patients and may contribute to postoperative bleeding problems. Right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting o ft en develops through the foramen ovale during the postoperative period. Shunting through the foramen ovale acts as a safety valve if the right ventricle is unable to function with the same e ffi ciency as the le ft ventricle.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the past, infants underwent one of three palliative procedures  to  increase  pulmonary  blood fl ow.  All  three  palliative procedures involved anastomosis of a systemic artery to a pulmonary artery in an e ff ort to increase pulmonary blood fl ow and improve arterial oxygenation. Th ese palliative procedures are Waterston's operation (side-to-side anastomosis of the ascending aorta and the right pulmonary artery), Potts's operation (side-to-side anastomosis of the descending aorta to the le ft pulmonary artery), and the Blalock-Taussig operation (end-to-side anastomosis of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary  artery).  O ft en,  however,  these  procedures  are associated with long-term complications such as pulmonary hypertension,  le ft ventricular  volume  overload,  and  distortion of the pulmonary arterial branches. Nevertheless, if the patient does not meet the criteria for correction at the time, these preliminary measures may be undertaken. Balloon pulmonary  valvuloplasty  has  been  employed  in  some  patients with tetralogy of Fallot to augment pulmonary blood fl ow and to allow for growth and development of the pulmonary arterial  system  and  le ft ventricle  so  that  a  total  surgical  corrective procedure can be performed at a later time with a greater chance of success.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with tetralogy of Fallot  requires  a  thorough  understanding  of  those  events  and drugs that can alter the magnitude of the right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt. For example, when shunt magnitude is acutely increased, there are associated decreases in pulmonary blood fl ow and Pa o 2 .  Furthermore, the magnitude of the right-tole ft shunt may alter the pharmacokinetics of both inhaled and injected drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  magnitude  of  a  right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunt  can be  increased  by  (1)  decreased  systemic  vascular  resistance, (2) increased pulmonary vascular resistance, and (3) increased myocardial contractility, which accentuates infundibular obstruction to ejection of blood by the right ventricle. In many respects,  resistance  to  ejection  of  blood  into  the  pulmonary artery out fl ow tract is relatively fi xed, and hence the magnitude of the shunt is inversely proportional to the systemic vascular resistance. Pharmacologically induced responses that decrease systemic vascular resistance (response to volatile anesthetics, histamine release, ganglionic blockade, α -adrenergic blockade) increase the magnitude of the right-to-le ft shunt and accentuate arterial hypoxemia. Pulmonary blood fl ow can be decreased by increases in pulmonary vascular resistance that accompany such  intraoperative  ventilatory  maneuvers  as  intermittent positive airway pressure or positive end-  expiratory pressure. Furthermore,  the  loss  of  negative  intrapleural  pressure  on opening the chest increases pulmonary vascular resistance and the  magnitude of the shunt. Nevertheless, the advantages of controlled ventilation of the lungs during operations usually o ff set this potential hazard. Indeed, arterial oxygenation does not predictably deteriorate in patients with tetralogy of Fallot, either  with  the  institution  of  positive  pressure  ventilation  of the lungs or a ft er opening of the chest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Preparation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperatively,  it  is  important  to  avoid  dehydration  by maintaining oral feedings in extremely young patients or by providing intravenous fl uids before the patient's arrival in the operating room. Crying associated with intramuscular administration of drugs used for preoperative medication can lead to hypercyanotic attacks. Treatment with β -adrenergic antagonists should be continued until the induction of anesthesia in patients receiving these drugs for prophylaxis against hypercyanotic attacks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia in patients with tetralogy of Fallot is o ft en accomplished with ketamine (3 to 4 mg/kg IM or 1 to 2 mg/kg IV). Th e onset of anesthesia a ft er ketamine injection may  be  associated  with  improved  arterial  oxygenation;  this presumably  re fl ects  increased  pulmonary  blood fl ow resulting  from  ketamine-induced  increases  in  systemic  vascular resistance, which can lead to a decrease in the magnitude of the  right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunt.  Ketamine  has  also  been alleged  to  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  which would  be  undesirable  in  patients  with  a  right-to-le ft shunt. Th e e ffi cacious response to ketamine of patients with tetralogy of Fallot, however, suggests that this concern is not clinically signi fi cant. Tracheal intubation is facilitated by administration of muscle relaxants. It should be remembered that the onset of action of drugs administered intravenously may be more rapid in the presence of right-to-le ft shunts because the dilutional e ff ect in the lungs is decreased. For this reason, it may be prudent to decrease the rate of intravenous injection of depressant drugs in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  of  anesthesia  with  a  volatile  anesthetic  such as sevo fl urane is acceptable but must be accomplished with  caution  and  careful  monitoring  of  systemic  oxygenation.  Although  decreased  pulmonary  blood fl ow  speeds the  achievement  of  anesthetic  concentrations,  the  hazard  of decreased  systemic  blood  pressure  plus  decreased  systemic vascular resistance is great. Indeed, hypercyanotic attacks can occur during administration of low concentrations of volatile anesthetics. Halothane is the preferred inhalational anesthetic because it decreases contractility and maintains systemic vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia is o ft en achieved with nitrous oxide combined with ketamine. Th e  advantage of this  combination  is  preservation  of  the  systemic  vascular  resistance. Nitrous  oxide  may  also  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  but  this  potentially  adverse  e ff ect  is  more  than  o ff set by  its  bene fi cial  e ff ects  on  systemic  vascular  resistance  (no change  or  modest  increase). Th e  principal  disadvantage  of using nitrous oxide is the associated decrease in the inspired oxygen concentration. Th eoretically, increased inspired oxygen concentrations could decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, leading to increased pulmonary blood fl ow and improved Pa o 2 . Th erefore, it seems prudent to limit the inspired concentration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of nitrous oxide to 50%. Th e use of an opioid or benzodiazepine may also be considered during maintenance of anesthesia, but the dose and rate of administration must be adjusted to minimize decreased systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  skeletal  muscle  paralysis  may  be  provided with pancuronium in view of its ability to maintain systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance. An increase in heart rate associated with pancuronium is helpful for maintaining le ft ventricular cardiac output. Careful consideration should be given to selecting alternative nondepolarzing neuromuscular blocking drugs, because some drugs administered rapidly in high dose may evoke histamine release with associated decreases in systemic vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilation of the patient's lungs should be controlled, but it must be appreciated that excessive positive airway pressure may adversely increase the resistance to blood fl ow through the  lungs.  Intravascular fl uid  volume  must  be  maintained with intravenous fl uid administration, because acute hypovolemia may increase the magnitude of the right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt. In view of the predictable erythrocytosis, it is probably not necessary to consider blood replacement until approximately  20%  of  the  patient's  blood  volume  has  been lost. It is crucial that meticulous care be taken to avoid infusion  of  air  through  the  tubing  used  to  deliver  intravenous solutions because it could lead to systemic air embolization. α -Adrenergic  agonist  drugs  such  as  phenylephrine  must  be available to treat undesirable decreases in systemic blood pressure caused by decreased systemic vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS FOLLOWING SURGICAL REPAIR OF TETRALOGY OF FALLOT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although patients with surgically repaired tetralogy of Fallot are  usually  asymptomatic,  their  survival  is  o ft en  shortened because  of  sudden  death,  presumably  from  cardiac  causes. Ventricular  cardiac  dysrhythmias  are  common  in  patients following  surgical  correction  of  tetralogy  of  Fallot.  Patients with surgically repaired tetralogy of Fallot o ft en develop atrial fi brillation or fl utter.  Right bundle branch block is frequent, whereas third-degree atrioventricular heart block is uncommon. Pulmonic regurgitation may develop as a consequence of surgical repair of the right ventricular out fl ow tract and may eventually lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. An aneurysm may form at the site where the right ventricular out fl ow tract was repaired.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eisenmenger's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients in whom a le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt is reversed, as  a  result  of  increased  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  to  a level  that  equals  or  exceeds  the  systemic  vascular  resistance are said to have Eisenmenger's syndrome. It is presumed that exposure  of  the  pulmonary  vasculature  to  increased  blood fl ow and pressure, as may accompany a VSD or ASD, results in  pulmonary  obstructive  disease.  As  obliteration  of  the pulmonary vascular bed progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases until it equals or exceeds systemic vascular resistance and the intracardiac shunt is reversed. Shunt reversal occurs in approximately 50% of patients with an untreated VSD  and  approximately  10%  of  patients  with  an  untreated ASD. Th e murmur associated with these cardiac defects disappears when Eisenmenger's syndrome develops.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyanosis and decreased exercise tolerance occur as right-tole ft intracardiac shunting develops. Palpitations are common and are most o ft en due to the onset of atrial fi brillation or atrial fl utter.  Arterial  hypoxemia  stimulates  erythrocytosis, which leads to increased blood viscosity and associated visual  disturbances,  headache,  dizziness,  and  paresthesias. Hemoptysis may occur as a result of pulmonary infarction or rupture of dilated pulmonary arteries, arterioles, or aorticopulmonary collateral vessels. Abnormal coagulation and thrombosis o ft en accompany arterial hypoxemia and erythrocytosis. Th e  possibility  of  a  cerebrovascular  accident  or brain abscess is increased. Syncope most likely re fl ects inadequate cardiac output. Sudden death is a risk in patients with Eisenmenger's syndrome. Th e ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No  treatment  has  proved  e ff ective  in  producing  sustained decreases  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  although  intravenous epoprostenol may be bene fi cial. Phlebotomy with isovolemic replacement should be undertaken in patients with moderate or severe symptoms of hyperviscosity. Pregnancy is discouraged in women with Eisenmenger's syndrome. Lung transplantation with repair of the cardiac defect or combined heart-lung transplantation is an option for selected patients with  this  syndrome. Th e  presence  of  irreversibly  increased pulmonary  vascular  resistance  contraindicates  surgical  correction of the congenital heart defect that was responsible for the original le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  Eisenmenger's syndrome undergoing noncardiac surgery is based on maintenance of preoperative levels of systemic vascular resistance and recognition that increases in right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting  are  likely  if  sudden  vasodilation  occurs. Th ese  patients pose a challenge to anesthesiologists because of their inability to adapt to sudden changes in hemodynamics because their pulmonary vascular bed is fi xed. Since many agents used for induction  and  maintenance  of  general  anesthesia  depress myocardial function and reduce systemic vascular resistance, the  choice  should  be  limited  to  those  that  cause  the  least hemodynamic disturbance, such as ketamine or opioids with etomidate. Continuous intravenous infusions of norepinephrine have been reported to maintain systemic vascular resistance during the perioperative period. Minimization of blood loss  leading  to  hypovolemia  and  prevention  of  iatrogenic

paradoxical  embolization  are  important  considerations.  It may  be  useful  to  perform  prophylactic  phlebotomy  with isovolemic  replacement  in  patients  with  hematocrits  higher than  65%.  Preoperative  administration  of  antiplatelet  drugs is not encouraged, because intraoperative blood loss may be associated  with  the  impaired  coagulation  that  accompanies chronic arterial hypoxemia and erythrocytosis. Opioids have been administered safely for preoperative and postoperative analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laparoscopic  procedures  may  pose  an  increased  risk  to these  patients  because  insu ffl ation  of  the  peritoneal  cavity with carbon dioxide may cause increases in Pa co 2 that result in  acidosis,  hypotension,  and  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  E ff orts to maintain normocapnia may be accompanied by increases in airway pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance, especially as the intraabdominal pressure increases. Th ese events may be further exaggerated by placing the patient in the headdown position. Early tracheal extubation of these patients is preferable because of the deleterious e ff ects of positive pressure ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the potential for undesirable decreases in systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, the successful management of anesthesia using epidural anesthesia has been described in patients undergoing tubal ligation and cesarean section. If epidural anesthesia is selected, it seems prudent not to  add  epinephrine  to  the  local  anesthetic  solution  injected into the epidural space. Th is recommendation is based on the observation that peripheral β -agonist e ff ects produced by the epinephrine  absorbed  from  the  epidural  space  into  the  systemic circulation can exaggerate decreases in systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance associated with epidural  anesthesia.  Slowly  titrated  local  anesthetics  combined with epidural opioids may avoid the abrupt decline in systemic vascular resistance and provide adequate analgesia depending upon the surgical procedure.

Ebstein's Anomaly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ebstein's anomaly is an abnormality of the tricuspid valve in which the posterior and septal valve lea fl ets are malformed or displaced downward into the right ventricle and may adhere to the myocardium. Th e anterior tricuspid lea fl et is abnormally large and sail-like, and may have multiple fenestrations. As a result,  the  right  ventricle  has  a  small  distal  e ff ective portion and an atrialized proximal portion. Th e tricuspid valve is usually regurgitant but may also be stenotic. Most patients with Ebstein's  anomaly have an interatrial communication (ASD, patent foramen ovale) through which there may be right-tole ft shunting  of  blood  and  associated  pulmonary  atresia  or VSDs. Ebstein's anomaly is a rare condition, accounting for fewer than 1% of all congenital heart anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  severity  of  the  hemodynamic  derangements  in  patients with  Ebstein's  anomaly  depends  on  the  degree  of  displacement and the functional status of the tricuspid valve lea fl ets.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As a result, the clinical presentation of Ebstein's anomaly varies  from  congestive  heart  failure  in  neonates  to  the  absence of  symptoms  in  adults  in  whom  the  anomaly  is  discovered incidentally. Neonates o ft en manifest cyanosis and congestive heart  failure  that  worsens  a ft er  the  ductus  arteriosus  closes and thereby decreases pulmonary blood fl ow. Most neonates with symptomatic Ebstein's anomaly will not survive without surgical intervention in infancy. Older children with Ebstein's anomaly may be diagnosed because of an incidental murmur, whereas  adolescents  and  adults  are  likely  to  come  to  attention  because  of  supraventricular  dysrhythmias  that  lead  to congestive heart failure, worsening cyanosis, and occasionally syncope.  Patients  with  Ebstein's  anomaly  and  an  interatrial communication are at risk of paradoxical embolization, brain abscess, congestive heart failure, and sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e severity of cyanosis depends on the magnitude of the right-to-le ft shunt.  A  systolic  murmur  caused  by  tricuspid regurgitation is usually present at the le ft lower  sternal  border. Hepatomegaly resulting from passive hepatic congestion due  to  increased  right  atrial  pressures  may  be  present. Th e ECG is characterized by tall and broad P waves (resembling right bundle branch block), and fi rst-degree atrioventricular heart block is common. Paroxysmal supraventricular and ventricular tachydysrhythmias may occur, and as many as 20% of patients with Ebstein's anomaly have ventricular preexcitation by  way  of  accessory  electrical  pathways  between  the  atrium and ventricle (Wol ff -Parkinson-White syndrome). In patients with severe disease (marked right-to-le ft shunting and minimally  functional  right  ventricle),  marked  cardiomegaly  is present that is largely due to right atrial enlargement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  is  used  to  assess  right  atrial  dilation, the distortion of the tricuspid valve lea fl ets, and the severity of  the  tricuspid  regurgitation  or  stenosis. Th e  presence  and magnitude of interatrial shunting can be determined by color Doppler imaging studies. Enlargement of the right atrium may be so massive that the apical portions of the lungs are compressed, which results in restrictive pulmonary disease. Chest radiographs  in  symptomatic  infants  with  Ebstein's  anomaly o ft en  will  demonstrate  signi fi cant  enlargement  of  the  right atrium and cardiomegaly, which creates the appearance of a globe-shaped, "wall-to-wall" heart that fi lls the chest cavity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hazards  of  pregnancy  in  parturient  women  with Ebstein's  anomaly  include  deterioration  in  right  ventricular function due to increased blood volume and cardiac output, increased right-to-le ft shunting and arterial hypoxemia if an ASD is present, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Pregnancy-induced hypertension  may  result  in  the  development  of  congestive heart failure in these women.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Ebstein's  anomaly  is  based  on  the  prevention of associated complications, including antibiotic prophylaxis against  infective  endocarditis  and  administration  of  diuretics  and  digoxin  for  management  of  congestive  heart  failure. Patients with supraventricular dysrhythmias are treated pharmacologically or with catheter ablation if an accessory pathway

is present. In severely ill neonates with Ebstein's anomaly, an arterial shunt from the systemic circulation to the pulmonary circulation is created to increase pulmonary blood fl ow and thus decrease cyanosis. Further staged procedures to create a univentricular heart (Glenn's shunt and Fontan's procedure) may also be considered in these cases. Repair or replacement of the tricuspid valve in conjunction with closure of the interatrial communication is recommended for older patients who have severe symptoms despite medical therapy. Complications of surgery to correct Ebstein's anomaly include third-degree atrioventricular  heart  block,  persistence  of  supraventricular  dysrhythmias, residual tricuspid regurgitation a ft er  valve repair,  and  prosthetic  valve  dysfunction  when  the  tricuspid valve is replaced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hazards during anesthesia in patients with Ebstein's anomaly include accentuation of arterial hypoxemia due to increases in  the  magnitude of the right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunt  and the development of supraventricular tachydysrhythmias. Th e hemodynamic consequences in Ebstein's anomaly are determined by the functional status of the tricuspid valve, the size of  the  ASD  or  patent  foramen  ovale,  impairment  of  right and/or le ft ventricular  function,  and  the  presence  of  Wol ff -Parkinson-White syndrome. Also, since tachyarrhythmic sudden death is a threat regardless of the severity of Ebstein's anomaly, electrophysiologic evaluation is o ft en warranted and radiofrequency  ablation  may  be  performed  to  avoid  recurrent  arrhythmia  and  instability  in  the  perioperative  period. A de fi brillator and antidysrhythmics should be immediately available before the induction of anesthesia to potentially terminate  any  possible  arrhythmias.  Light  premedication  also assists in reducing the incidence of anxiety-induced tachycardia. Increased right atrial pressures may indicate the presence of right ventricular failure. In the presence of a probe-patent foramen ovale (present in approximately 30% of patients), an increase in right atrial pressure above the pressure in the le ft atrium can lead to a right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt through the foramen ovale. Unexplained arterial hypoxemia or paradoxical air embolism during the perioperative period may be due to shunting of blood or air through a previously closed foramen  ovale. Th e  anesthetic  plan  must  also  focus  on  the maintenance of right ventricular function and avoidance of an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, hence curtailing hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidemia. Agents that lower pulmonary vascular resistance, such as nitrates and nitric oxide, may be bene fi cial  in  patients  with  severe  pulmonary hypertension. Th e  delayed  onset  of  pharmacologic  e ff ects  a ft er intravenous administration of drugs during anesthesia most likely re fl ects pooling and dilution in an enlarged right atrium. Th e pooled blood also acts as a depot, releasing administered medication subsequently; this may have profound hemodynamic e ff ects,  so  that  care  in  dosing  and  patience in induction of anesthesia are required. Epidural analgesia with slow titration of local anesthetic has been used safely for labor and delivery.

Tricuspid Atresia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricuspid atresia is de fi ned as congenital absence or agenesis of  the  morphologic  tricuspid  valve  and  is  characterized  by arterial  hypoxemia,  a  small  right  ventricle,  a  large  le ft ventricle, and marked decreases in pulmonary blood fl ow. Poorly oxygenated  blood  from  the  right  atrium  passes  through  an ASD into the le ft atrium, mixes with oxygenated blood, and then  enters  the  le ft ventricle,  from  which  it  is  ejected  into the systemic circulation. Pulmonary blood fl ow is via a VSD, PDA, or bronchial vessels. Th e  relative  position  of  the  great vessels is quite variable and has been the basis for classi fi cation of  this  anomaly:  type  I  is  characterized  by  normally  related great arteries; type II shows dextro-transposition of the great arteries; type III has transposition of the great arteries other than dextro-transposition (such as double-outlet right or le ft ventricle, levo-malposition of the great arteries); and type IV is distinguished by truncus arteriosus. Patients with transposition may have associated pulmonary out fl ow tract obstruction, either subvalvular or valvular, whereas patients with normally related great arteries o ft en have obstruction at the VSD level. Hence, within each type there may be one or more subgroups: (1)  cases  with  pulmonary  atresia,  (2)  cases  with  pulmonary stenosis or hypoplasia, and (3) cases with normal pulmonary arteries and no stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately one half of patients with tricuspid atresia have symptoms on the fi rst day of life, and 80% exhibit symptoms by  the  end  of  the fi rst  month  of  life. Th e  magnitude  of  the pulmonary blood fl ow determines the type and timing of the clinical presentation. In infants (and children) with decreased pulmonary  blood fl ow,  the  physical  examination  reveals central  cyanosis,  clubbing  (in  older  children),  tachypnea  or hyperpnea, normal pulses, a prominent a wave in the jugular venous pulse (if  there  is  interatrial  obstruction),  no  hepatic enlargement, and no clinical signs of congestive heart failure. A holosystolic murmur suggestive of VSD may be heard in the le ft lower sternal border or continuous PDA murmur. In those with  increased  pulmonary  blood fl ow,  examination  reveals tachypnea,  tachycardia,  decreased  femoral  pulses  (if  associated with coarctation of the aorta), minimal cyanosis, hepatomegaly, prominent a waves, VSD and/or PDA murmurs, and clinical signs of congestive heart failure. In addition, di ffi culty feeding, failure to thrive, diaphoresis, and recurrent respiratory tract infections may also be seen in these patients. Chest radiographic fi ndings depend on the total pulmonary blood fl ow and provide no consistent pattern diagnostic of tricuspid atresia. Th e ECG in an infant with cyanotic tricuspid atresia shows signs of right atrial enlargement, le ft axis deviation, and le ft ventricular hypertrophy. Le ft axis deviation is seen in 80% of patients with type I anatomy (normally related great vessels) and in fewer than 50% of patients with type II (transposition) anatomy. Echocardiography shows the atretic tricuspid valve with the enlarged right atrium, le ft atrium, and le ft ventricle,  and  Doppler fl ow  studies  identify  obstruction  across

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since these patients o ft en come to attention as neonates, they are  frequently  managed  based  on  the  degree  of  pulmonary blood fl ow and associated  symptoms. Th e  cyanotic  neonate or neonate with decreased but ductal-dependent pulmonary blood fl ow  may  require  prostaglandin  to  maintain  patency and receive a Blalock-Taussig type of shunt until reaching an acceptable  age  or  stage  of  development  for  more  de fi nitive treatment. Patients with symptomatic pulmonary congestion may initially be managed medically with diuretics, and once in  stable  condition,  they  may  undergo  temporizing  treatment via pulmonary artery banding, then staged correction via  Glenn's  shunt  placement  and fi nally  Fontan's  operation. Ultimately, either of two types of Fontan's procedure is used to treat tricuspid atresia. One is the classical internal conduit with  anastomosis  of  the  right  atrial  appendage  to  the  right pulmonary artery to bypass the right ventricle and provide a direct atriopulmonary communication. Th e other is the extracardiac Fontan's procedure, which also diverts inferior vena caval fl ow into the pulmonary arteries. Th is operation is also used to treat pulmonary artery atresia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients undergoing Fontan's procedures  has  been  successfully  achieved  with  opioids  or volatile anesthetics. Immediately a ft er cardiopulmonary bypass and continuing into the early postoperative period, it  is  important  to  maintain  increased  right  atrial  pressures (16  to  20  mm  Hg)  to  facilitate  pulmonary  blood fl ow.  An increase  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  resulting  from acidosis,  hypercarbia,  hypothermia,  peak  airway  pressures higher than 15 cm H 2 O, or reactions to the tracheal tube may cause  right-sided  heart  failure.  Early  tracheal  extubation and spontaneous ventilation are desirable. Positive inotropic drugs (dopamine) with or without vasodilators (nitroprusside) are o ft en required to optimize cardiac output and maintain  low  pulmonary  vascular  resistance.  Pleural  e ff usions, ascites, and edema of the lower extremities are not uncommon postoperatively and usually resolve within a few weeks. Right atrial  pressure  that  is  equal  to  the  pulmonary  artery pressure  remains  elevated  a ft er  this  operation,  averaging 15 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although absence of a contractile right ventricle is compatible with long-term survival, the adaptability of the circulatory system is restricted. Th is decreased capacity of a single ventricle  to  respond  to  an  increased  workload  may  have  a signi fi cant impact on the management of these patients during  another  operation.  In  this  regard,  subsequent  management of anesthesia in patients who have undergone Fontan's procedures  is  facilitated  by  monitoring  the  central  venous pressure  (which  equals  the  pulmonary  artery  pressure  in

FIGURE 3-5 Transposition of the great arteries. The right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV) are not connected in series.

these patients) to assess the intravascular fl uid volume and to  detect  sudden  impairment  of  le ft ventricular  function and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Th e  value  of monitoring the central venous pressure re fl ects the absence of a contractile right ventricle and the impaired ability of a single ventricle to adapt to acute increases in a ft erload, which may necessitate prompt administration of positive inotropic drugs. Insertion of a thermodilution pulmonary artery catheter in patients a ft er Fontan's procedure may be technically di ffi cult because of the unusual anatomy. No information is available  regarding  the  accuracy  of  thermodilution  cardiac output measurements in such patients. Peak and mean airway pressure must be maintained, because this will increase pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  may  decrease  carbon dioxide signi fi cantly.

Transposition of the Great Arteries

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transposition of the great arteries constitutes 5% of all congenital  heart  disease  and  10%  of  all  neonatal  cyanotic  congenital heart disease. Transposition of the great arteries results from failure of the truncus arteriosus to spiral, so that the aorta arises from the anterior portion of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the le ft ventricle  (Figure 3-5).

Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is complete separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulations  such  that  systemic  venous  blood  traverses  the right atrium, right ventricle, aorta, and systemic circulation; and  pulmonary  venous  blood  traverses  the  le ft atrium,  le ft ventricle, pulmonary artery, and lungs. Th us, the circulation is parallel instead of normal in-series circulation. Survival is possible only if there is communication between the two circulations in the form of a VSD, ASD, or PDA.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  symptoms  depend  on  the  type.  Infants  in  group  I, who have transposition of the great arteries with intact ventricular septum, usually exhibit cyanosis in the fi rst week of life (sometimes within hours to days of life) or may otherwise be asymptomatic; they will, with time, become tachypneic and develop respiratory distress. Th e right ventricular impulse will be increased, and either no murmur or a grade I-II/VI nonspeci fi c systolic ejection murmur may be auscultated. Infants in group II, who have transposition of the great arteries with VSD, show symptoms of congestive heart failure (tachypnea, tachycardia, sweating, and poor feeding) between 4 to 8 weeks with  relatively  minimal  cyanosis.  Congestive  heart  failure re fl ects le ft ventricular failure resulting from volume overload created  by  the  le ft -to-right  intracardiac  shunt  necessary  for survival.  A  grade  III-IV/VI  holosystolic  murmur  at  the  le ft lower  sternal  border  and  mid-diastolic fl ow  rumble  (murmur) at the apex may be present. Infants in group III have transposition of the great arteries with VSD and pulmonary stenosis, and presentation varies based on the severity of the stenosis. If the pulmonary stenosis is severe, the presentation may present similar to that of patients with tetralogy of Fallot.  With  moderate  pulmonary  stenosis,  the  presentation  is late  with  longer  survival,  and  those  with  mild  stenosis  may exhibit  signs  of  congestive  heart  failure  similar  to  group  II patients. Th e ECG is likely to demonstrate right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy because the right ventricle is the systemic ventricle. Classically, the cardiac silhouette on the chest radiograph is described as being "egg shaped with a narrow stalk." Echocardiography is generally helpful in diagnosis and assessment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  immediate  management  of  transposition  of  the  great arteries  involves  creating  intracardiac  mixing  or  increasing the degree of mixing. Th is goal is accomplished with infusions of prostaglandin E 1 to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus and/or balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind's procedure). Administration of oxygen may decrease pulmonary vascular resistance and increase pulmonary blood fl ow. Diuretics and digoxin are administered to treat congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two  surgical  switch  procedures  have  been  used  to  treat complete  transition  of  the  great  arteries. Th e  surgical  procedure fi rst  used,  known  as Mustard's or Senning's  operation, generally involved resection of the atrial septum and its replacement with a ba ffl e to direct the systemic venous blood into the le ft ventricle and the pulmonary venous blood across the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Th is operation has been replaced by the arterial  switch  operation  in  which  the pulmonary artery and ascending aorta are transected above the semilunar valves and reanastomosed with the right and le ft ventricles; the coronary arteries are then reimplanted so that the aorta is connected to the le ft ventricle and the pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle. Th e arterial switch operation has some advantages over the venous switch procedure in that arrhythmias are less frequent and the le ft ventricle rather than the right ventricle serves as a pump to the systemic circuit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of transposition of  the  great  arteries  must  take  into  account  the  separation of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Drugs administered intravenously are distributed with minimal dilution to organs such as the heart and brain. Th erefore, doses and rates of injection of intravenously administered drugs may have  to  be  decreased.  Conversely,  the  onset  of  anesthesia produced  by  inhaled  drugs  is  delayed  because  only  small amounts of the inhaled drug reach the systemic circulation. In the fi nal analysis, induction and maintenance of anesthesia  are  o ft en  accomplished  with  ketamine  combined  with muscle relaxants to facilitate tracheal intubation. Ketamine can  be  supplemented  with  opioids  or  benzodiazepines  for maintenance of anesthesia. Nitrous oxide has limited application in these patients, because it is important to administer  oxygen at high inspired concentrations. Th e  potential cardiac-depressant  e ff ects of volatile anesthetics  detract from the use of these drugs. Selection of muscle relaxants is in fl uenced by the desire to avoid histamine-induced changes in  systemic  blood  pressure. Th e  ability  of  pancuronium  to increase the heart rate and systemic blood pressure modestly may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dehydration  must  be  avoided  during  the  perioperative period. Th ese patients may have hematocrits in excess of 70%, which may contribute to the high incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis. Th is fi nding suggests that oral fl uids should not be  withheld  from  these  patients  for  prolonged  periods.  An intravenous infusion should be initiated during the preoperative period. Atrial dysrhythmias and conduction disturbances may occur postoperatively.

Mixing of Blood between the Pulmonary and Systemic Circulations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rare congenital heart defects that result in mixing of blood from  the  pulmonary  and  systemic  circulations  manifest  as cyanosis and arterial hypoxemia of varying severity depending  on  the  magnitude  of  the  pulmonary  blood fl ow.  As  a result  of  the  mixing  of  blood  from  both  circulations,  pulmonary arterial blood has a higher oxygen saturation than that  of  systemic  venous  blood,  and  systemic  arterial  blood has a lower oxygen saturation than that of pulmonary venous blood.

Truncus Arteriosus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Truncus arteriosus refers to the congenital cardiac defect in which a single arterial trunk serves as the origin of the aorta and pulmonary artery (Figure 3-6). Th is single arterial trunk overrides both ventricles, which are connected through a VSD. Mortality is high, with a median survival of approximately 5 to 6 weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e spectrum of severity is based on the origin of the pulmonary arteries from the truncal artery. A main pulmonary artery may arise from the truncal artery (type I truncus arteriosus), the  branch  pulmonary  arteries  may  arise  separately  but  in close  proximity  (type  II),  or  the  branch  pulmonary  arteries may arise widely separate from the lateral aspects of the truncal artery (type III). Truncus arteriosus results in unrestrictive le ft -to-right  shunting  of  blood  and  pulmonary  overcirculation.  Presenting  signs  and  symptoms  of  truncus  arteriosus include cyanosis and arterial hypoxemia, failure to thrive, and congestive heart failure early in life. Peripheral pulses may be accentuated owing to the rapid diastolic runo ff of  blood into the pulmonary circulation. Auscultation of the chest and evaluation  of  the  ECG  do  not  give  predictable  information  and are  not  diagnostic.  Chest  radiography  reveals  cardiomegaly and increased vascularity of  the  lung fi elds. Th e  diagnosis  is con fi rmed  by  angiocardiography  performed  during  cardiac catheterization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  treatment  of  truncus  arteriosus  includes  banding of  the  right  and  le ft pulmonary arteries if pulmonary blood fl ow is excessive. In addition, an associated VSD can be closed so only le ft ventricular output enters the truncus arteriosus. When this is done, a Dacron conduit with a valve is also placed between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of truncus arteriosus  is  in fl uenced  by  the  magnitude  of  the  pulmonary blood fl ow.  When  pulmonary  blood fl ow  is  increased,  the use of positive end-expiratory pressure is bene fi cial and may serve to decrease the symptoms of congestive heart failure. Increased pulmonary blood fl ow may be associated with evidence of myocardial ischemia on the ECG. When myocardial ischemia that occurs intraoperatively does not respond to intravenous administration of phenylephrine or fl uids, or the  use  of  positive  end-expiratory  pressure,  consideration may be given to temporary banding of the pulmonary artery to increase systemic and coronary blood fl ow. Patients with decreased  pulmonary  blood fl ow  and  arterial  hypoxemia should be managed in the same way as patients with tetralogy of Fallot.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return is characterized by the presence of le ft or right pulmonary veins that empty into the right side of the circulation rather than the le ft atrium. In approximately one half of cases, the aberrant pulmonary veins drain into the superior vena cava. Th is abnormality results in le ft -to-right shunting of blood at the atrial level as well as right ventricular and right atrial dilatation. In the remaining cases, pulmonary veins  enter  the  right  atrium,  inferior  vena  cava, azygos vein, or coronary sinus. Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return may be more common than appreciated, as suggested by the presence of this anomaly in approximately 0.5% of routine autopsy cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  onset  and  severity  of  symptoms  produced  by  this abnormality depend on the amount of pulmonary blood fl ow routed through the right side of the heart. Fatigue and exertional  dyspnea  are  the  most  frequent  initial  manifestations, usually appearing during early adulthood. Cyanosis and congestive heart failure are likely if more than 50% of the pulmonary venous fl ow enters the right side of the circulation. With prolonged right atrial dilatation, right ventricular dysfunction and atrial arrhythmias can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiography is the most useful technique for con fi rming the diagnosis of partial anomalous pulmonary venous return. Cardiac catheterization usually demonstrates normal intracardiac pressures and increased oxygen saturations of blood in the right side of the heart. Treatment is by surgical repair.

Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, or TAPVC) is characterized by  drainage  of  all  four  pulmonary  veins  into  the  systemic venous  system. Th e  most  common  presentation  of  this defect-  supracardiac TAPVC-accounting for approximately one half of cases, is drainage of the four pulmonary veins into the le ft innominate vein in association with a le ft -sided superior vena cava. Oxygenated blood reaches the le ft atrium by way of an ASD. PDA is present in approximately one third of patients. Intracardiac TAPVC is present when the pulmonary venous return enters  a  common  con fl uence that  then  empties into the coronary sinus. Coronary venous return, pulmonary venous return, and systemic venous return empty into the right atrium. Th e le ft atrium receives mixed systemic and pulmonary venous return via an ASD. Infracardiac TAPVC is present when the pulmonary venous con fl uence drains inferiorly to the ductus venosus, which empties into the inferior vena cava and connects to the liver's portal vein system. Th e right atrium receives mixed systemic and pulmonary venous return, whereas the le ft atrium is supplied by the right atrium via an ASD.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TAPVC presents clinically as congestive heart failure in 50% of  patients  by  1  month  of  age  and  in  90%  by  1  year. Th ose with  obstructed  pulmonary  venous  return  are  severely  cyanotic,  developing  respiratory  distress,  tachypnea,  grunting, and retractions  of  the  rib  cage  muscles,  whereas  those  with unobstructed fl ow may initially  be  asymptomatic  with  mild cyanosis. Murmur indicative of an ASD is also present. Th e ECG demonstrates signs of right atrial and right ventricular enlargement. Th e  chest  radiograph  may  show  evidence  of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. Echocardiography can demonstrate enlargement of the right atrium and right ventricle and assess the size and fl ow across the ASD. It is de fi nitively diagnosed by angiocardiography. Cardiac catheterization can also  detect  whether  there  is  pulmonary  venous  obstruction and whether the ASD is restrictive. Mortality is approximately 80% by 1 year of age unless the TAPVC is surgically corrected using cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA AND TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  the  presence  of  TAPVC  may include application of positive end-expiratory pressure to the airways in an attempt to decrease excessive pulmonary blood fl ow.  Patients  who  have  pulmonary  edema  should  undergo positive  pressure  ventilation  through  an  endotracheal  tube before cardiac catheterization. Operative manipulation of the right atrium, which is tolerated by healthy patients, may result in obstruction to fl ow into the right atrium in these patients, manifesting as sudden decreases in systemic blood pressure and the  onset  of  bradycardia.  Intravenous  transfusions  may be hazardous, because any increase in right atrial pressure is transmitted directly to the pulmonary veins, which can lead to  pulmonary edema. Surgical repair takes advantage of the fact that in virtually all types of TAPVC, the pulmonary veins return to a common con fl uence behind the le ft atrium. Th e common pulmonary vein con fl uence is connected by the surgeon to the back of the le ft atrium, which results in normal connection of pulmonary veins to the le ft atrial chamber. Th e ASD is then closed. Postoperatively, atrioventricular conduction  disturbances,  atrial  tachydysrhythmias,  and  sinus  bradycardia  are  sometimes  encountered.  Elevated  pulmonary vascular resistance with decreased cardiac output and pulmonary  hypertension  may  develop,  requiring  hyperventilation, increased sedation, and administration of inhaled nitric oxide. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support is sometimes required in the early postoperative period.

Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoplastic le ft heart syndrome is characterized by le ft ventricular hypoplasia, mitral valve hypoplasia, aortic valve atresia, and hypoplasia of the ascending aorta. Extracardiac congenital anomalies do not usually accompany this syndrome. Th ere is complete mixing of pulmonary venous and systemic venous blood in a single ventricle, which is connected in parallel to both the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Systemic blood fl ow is dependent on a PDA. In addition to ductal patency, infant survival depends on a balance between systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, because both circulations are supplied from a single ventricle in a parallel fashion. An abrupt decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance a ft er delivery results in increased pulmonary blood fl ow at the expense  of  systemic  blood fl ow  (pulmonary  steal  phenomenon). When this occurs, coronary and systemic blood fl ow is inadequate, which leads to metabolic acidosis, high-output cardiac  failure,  and  ventricular fi brillation,  despite  increasingly high Pa o 2 values (Figure 3-7). Alternatively, any postnatal event that leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance can decrease the pulmonary blood fl ow so severely that arterial hypoxemia worsens, leading to progressive metabolic acidosis and circulatory collapse (see Figure 3-7). Because rapid changes  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  occur  during  the postnatal period, the necessary fi ne balance between pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  systemic  vascular  resistance  is unstable and di ffi cult to maintain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e common presentation of newborns with hypoplastic le ft heart syndrome at birth is cardiovascular collapse and shock. Th e  peripheral  pulses  are  weak,  without  a  major  di ff erence between the brachial  and  femoral  pulses. Th ere  is  usually  a mild to moderate degree of cyanosis, but no di ff erential cyanosis. Th e chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly and plethoric lung fi elds. Th e  ECG documents right ventricular hypertrophy and reduced le ft ventricular forces. If the diagnosis is suspected, infusion of prostaglandin normally maintains patency of  the  ductus arteriosus and prevents further cardiovascular compromise, progressive acidosis, and death.

FIGURE 3-7 Cardiovascular stability in the presence of hypoplastic left heart syndrome requires a balance between pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). An abrupt decrease in PVR after delivery can result in excessive pulmonary blood flow (PBF) relative to systemic blood flow (SBF) with cardiovascular collapse despite the absence of arterial hypoxemia. Conversely, postnatal changes that increase PVR can lead to cardiovascular collapse in the presence of arterial hypoxemia. PDA , Patent ductus arteriosus. (From Hansen DD, Hickey PR.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration  of  cardiac  inotropes  and  sodium  bicarbonate may be necessary. Ultimately, treatment of hypoplastic le ft heart  syndrome is  surgical,  beginning  with  a  palliative  procedure that eliminates the need for continued patency of the ductus arteriosus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage I, or the initial palliative procedure, consists of reconstructing the ascending aorta using the proximal pulmonary artery (Figure 3-8). A systemic-to-pulmonary shunt to provide pulmonary  blood fl ow  is  placed  between  the  reconstructed aorta and the distal pulmonary artery (Blalock-Taussig shunt). Typically,  infants  are  placed  on  cardiopulmonary  bypass  to permit induction of whole-body hypothermia; reconstruction of the aorta is then accomplished during 40 to 60 minutes of circulatory arrest. Th e central shunt is placed a ft er reinstitution of cardiopulmonary bypass and during rewarming. Th e completed palliative procedure leaves the single right ventricle connected in parallel to the systemic circulation and pulmonary  circulation. Th is  classic  Norwood  procedure  places  a nonvalved tube from the right ventricle to the le ft pulmonary artery (Sano's modi fi cation), and later to the right pulmonary artery. Controversy continues as to the advantages and disadvantages of either approach. At present there is no signi fi cant di ff erence in 1-year survival a ft er any of these procedures. At about  4  to  6  months  of  age,  children  who  underwent  stage I  palliation  experience  severe  cyanosis  because  of  the  very limited  pulmonary  blood fl ow.  It  is  then  common  practice to proceed to surgical creation of a bidirectional cavopulmonary (Glenn) shunt with interruption of the original BlalockTaussig shunt or the conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. At around 2 to 5 years of age, children with hypoplastic  le ft heart  syndrome  who  have  undergone  stage

I and II surgery will become increasingly fatigued and short of breath with cyanosis a ft er mild to moderate activity. Th e stage is now set for correction with Fontan's procedure when pulmonary vascular resistance has decreased to adult levels (see the section on tricuspid atresia). Execution of Fontan's procedure plus elimination of the systemic-to-pulmonary shunt separates the two circulations and facilitates development of normal arterial oxygen saturation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Umbilical artery and intravenous catheters are usually placed before  infants  with  uncorrected  hypoplastic  le ft heart  syndrome  arrive  in  the  operating  room.  A ft er  monitoring  is instituted, induction of anesthesia is o ft en accomplished with fentanyl  (50  to  75  mcg/kg  IV)  administered  simultaneously with pancuronium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese  infants  are  vulnerable  to  the  development  of  ventricular fi brillation resulting from inadequate coronary blood fl ow before the palliative procedure. Th e danger of ventricular fi brillation and borderline cardiac status argues against the use of volatile anesthetics in these infants. A high Pa o 2 implies excessive pulmonary blood fl ow at the expense of the systemic circulation. Indeed, if the initial Pa o 2 is  more than 100 mm Hg, maneuvers to increase pulmonary vascular resistance and decrease  pulmonary blood fl ow are instituted.  For  example, a  decrease  in  the  volume  of  ventilation  leads  to  increases in  Pa co 2 and  decreases  in  the  arterial  pH,  which  results in  increased  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  decreased pulmonary  blood fl ow.  If  the  Pa o 2 remains  unacceptably high, institution of positive end-expiratory pressure leads to increased lung volumes and further increases in pulmonary vascular resistance. In extreme cases, temporary occlusion of one pulmonary artery serves to decrease the Pa o 2 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dopamine or isoproterenol is administered when necessary for  inotropic  support  at  the  conclusion  of  cardiopulmonary bypass. Th e selection of speci fi c inotropic drugs is in fl uenced by pulmonary vascular resistance. Th e most frequent problem a ft er  cardiopulmonary  bypass  is  too  little  pulmonary  blood fl ow  with  associated  arterial  hypoxemia  (Pa o 2 of  <20  mm Hg). Methods to improve the Pa o 2 include  hyperventilation of the lungs to produce a low Pa co 2 (20 to 25 mm Hg) and to increase the arterial pH, plus infusion of isoproterenol to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance. A Pa o 2 higher than 50 mm Hg a ft er cardiopulmonary bypass may indicate inadequate systemic blood fl ow and the likely occurrence of progressive metabolic acidosis unless steps are taken to decrease pulmonary blood fl ow. In the setting of refractory cardiovascular and hemodynamic instability, there may be an indication for ECMO, but debate continues as to the selection of patients for this therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTION OF THE TRACHEA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e trachea can be obstructed by circulatory anomalies that produce a vascular ring or by dilation of the pulmonary artery secondary  to  absence  of  the  pulmonic  valve. Th ese  lesions must be considered when evaluating a child with unexplained stridor  or  other  evidence  of  upper  airway  obstruction. Th e possibility  of  an  undiagnosed  vascular  ring  should  be  considered  in  the  di ff erential  diagnosis  of  airway  obstruction that follows placement of a nasogastric tube or an esophageal stethoscope.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Double Aortic Arch

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Double aortic arch results in a vascular ring that can produce pressure on the trachea and esophagus. Compression resulting from this pressure can be manifested as inspiratory stridor, di ffi culty mobilizing secretions, and dysphagia. Patients with this cardiac defect usually prefer to lie with the neck extended because fl exion of the neck o ft en accentuates compression of the trachea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical transection of the smaller aortic arch is the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients. During surgery, the tracheal  tube  should  be  placed  beyond  the  area  of  tracheal compression if this can be safely accomplished without producing endobronchial intubation. It must be appreciated that esophageal stethoscopes or nasogastric tubes can cause occlusion of the trachea if the tracheal tube remains above the level of vascular compression. Clinical improvement a ft er surgical transection is o ft en prompt. In addition to hemodynamic factors,  weaning  from  mechanical  ventilation  should  take  into account the risk of tracheomalacia caused by prolonged compression of the trachea, which can jeopardize the patency of the trachea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aberrant Left Pulmonary Artery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tracheal  or  bronchial  obstruction  can  occur  when  the  le ft pulmonary artery is absent and the arterial supply to the le ft lung is derived from a branch of the right pulmonary artery passing  between  the  trachea  and  esophagus. Th is  anatomic arrangement has been referred to as vascular sling because a complete ring is not present. Th e sling can cause obstruction of the right main bronchus, the distal trachea, or rarely the le ft main bronchus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  manifestations  of  an  aberrant  le ft pulmonary artery  include  stridor,  wheezing,  and  occasionally  arterial hypoxemia.  Unlike  with  a  true  vascular  ring,  esophageal obstructions are rare, and the stridor produced by this defect is  usually  present  during  exhalation  rather  than  inspiration. Chest radiographs may demonstrate an abnormal separation between  the  esophagus  and  the  trachea.  Hyperin fl ation  or atelectasis of either lung may be present. Angiography is the most accurate approach for con fi rming the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical division of the aberrant le ft pulmonary artery at its origin and redirection of its course anterior to the trachea, with anastomosis to the main pulmonary artery, is the treatment of choice. During the fi rst months of life, surgical correction with deep hypothermia without cardiopulmonary bypass may be considered. Th eoretically, continuous positive airway

pressure or positive end-expiratory pressure should relieve the airway obstruction and associated stridor in these cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Absent Pulmonic Valve

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Absence of the pulmonic valve results in dilation of the pulmonary artery, which can result in compression of the trachea  and  le ft main  bronchus. Th is  lesion  may  occur  as  an isolated  defect  or  in  conjunction  with  tetralogy  of  Fallot. Symptoms include signs of tracheal obstruction and occasionally  the  development  of  arterial  hypoxemia  and  congestive  heart  failure.  Any  increase  in  pulmonary  vascular resistance, as may occur with arterial hypoxemia or hypercarbia, accentuates airway obstruction. Tracheal intubation and maintenance of 4 to 6 mm Hg of continuous positive airway pressure can be used to keep the trachea distended, which reduces the magnitude of airway obstruction. De fi nitive  treatment  consists  of  inserting  a  tubular  gra ft with  an arti fi cial pulmonic valve.

THE ADULT PATIENT WITH CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE UNDERGOING NONCARDIAC SURGERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  of  improvements  in  medical  and  surgical  care, increasing numbers of children with congenital heart disease are living into adulthood. In the United States alone there are more adult patients with congenital heart disease than pediatric  patients  with  these  disorders,  and  the  number  of  surviving citizens is estimated to be between 1 million and 2.9 million. Th e prevalence of severe congenital heart disease in adult patients increased by 85% from 1985 to 2000, signi fi -cantly outpacing that in the pediatric population. Although survival into adulthood has improved for patients with congenital heart disease, attributable to more profound knowledge of the multisystem e ff ects of congenital heart disease as well as better surgical and percutaneous techniques, the fact that the median age of the congenital heart disease population in 2002 was 40 years and that of the severe congenital heart disease population was 29 years indicates that survival is  not  normal  in  this  cohort. Th e  majority  of  the  mortality and morbidity in these patients can be attributed to chronic di ffi culties,  namely,  cardiovascular  causes  such  as  chronic heart failure. In two large cohorts, hospitalization rates were 50%,  twice  that  of  the  general  population.  Long-term  cardiac  complications  include  pulmonary  hypertension,  ventricular  dysfunction,  dysrhythmias  and  conduction  defects, residual  shunts,  valvular  lesions  (regurgitation  and  stenosis),  hypertension, and aneurysms. A signi fi cant number of these patients require additional cardiac surgeries to address residual lesions, such as atrioventricular valve regurgitation, pulmonary valve regurgitation, out fl ow tract obstruction, or arrhythmias.  Noncardiac  sequelae  include  developmental abnormalities,  central  nervous  system  abnormalities  such as  seizure  disorders  from  prior  thromboembolic  or  cerebrovascular events, secondary erythrocytosis, cholelithiasis, nephrolithiasis,  hearing  or  visual  loss,  and  restrictive  and obstructive  lung  disease.  Debate  continues  as  to  whether these  patients  are  best  served  in  children's  hospitals,  since the procedures are o ft en performed by pediatric cardiac surgeons, or in adult centers, where there is familiarity with some of the comorbidities in adults not seen as o ft en in children, such as atherosclerotic coronary disease, peripheral vascular disease, deep venous thrombosis, and emphysema. In either case, adult patients with congenital heart disease should be treated optimally by clinicians with expertise in the physiology of congenital heart disease and its manifestations in the mature individual. Th erefore,  knowledge of  and  experience with the physiology of adult congenital heart disease and its challenges is paramount for the anesthesiologist during the perioperative period.

PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adult  congenital  heart  disease  patients  can  be  viewed  on a  continuum in which some patients have defects that have not  been  corrected,  some  have  received  palliative  repairs (e.g., partial or total cavopulmonary shunts), and others have undergone complete correction. In nearly all cases, congenital heart disease in adults should be viewed as a systemic condition with associated multiorgan dysfunction. Perioperative risk is substantially increased in adults with congenital heart disease,  particularly  those  with  poor  functional  status,  pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, and cyanosis. In addition to obtaining the basic preoperative information, the anesthesiologist should be familiar with the patient's speci fi c  anatomy and physiology as determined by echocardiographic and cardiac catheterization results. Th e most common lesions seen in adult patients with congenital heart disease are (1)  conotruncal  abnormalities  a ft er  repair  (of  tetralogy  of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, double-outlet right ventricle), (2)  coarctation  of  the  aorta  a ft er  repair,  (3)  transposition  of the great arteries a ft er an atrial or arterial switch procedure, (4) complex single ventricles a ft er Fontan's procedure, (5) pulmonary valve stenosis, (6) congenital aortic valve stenosis, (7) atrioventricular canal defects (complete and partial) a ft er  repair,  (8)  secundum  ASDs,  (9)  congenitally  corrected transposition  of  the  great  arteries,  and  (10)  sinus  venosus ASDs with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With each lesion, there are unique manifestations require a  meticulous  perioperative  plan. Premedication is  advantageous in those adult congenital heart disease patients with anxiety because of multiple prior procedures or developmental  delay  (trisomy  21)  but  must  be  undertaken  cautiously, because hypercapnia and hypoventilation can increase pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and  be  deleterious  to  patients with  pulmonary  hypertension  or  systemic-to-  pulmonary shunts. Endocarditis  prophylaxis is  also  an  important  perioperative factor for these patients, and new guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) are discussed in the last section.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 3 CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysrhythmias are  common  in  adults  with  congenital heart  disease;  for  example,  supraventricular  dysrhythmias occur in 20% to 45% of patients who have undergone previous  atrial  surgery  (late  ASD  closure,  Mustard's  or  Fontan's procedure) or who have atrial dilatation. Th e most common form  of  tachyarrhythmia  observed  is  intraatrial  reentrant tachycardia originating from the right atrium, which can be resistant to pharmacologic treatment and lead to rapid hemodynamic  deterioration.  Ventricular  dysrhythmias  may  be seen in adult congenital heart disease patients who have signi fi cantly  depressed right or le ft ventricular  function.  Some patients may require permanent pacemakers or an intracardiac de fi brillator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure, namely, right-sided and le ft -sided failure, is a  common complication of both corrected and uncorrected congenital  heart  disease.  Abnormal  cardiac  autonomic  nervous  system  regulation  and  altered  hemodynamics  contribute to the development of heart failure in these patients. Approaches for the management of le ft ventricular failure are well documented, and such management should be optimized in the perioperative period. Unlike for le ft ventricular failure, there are no evidence-based guidelines for the management of heart failure in patients with a systemic right ventricle (congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries and single ventricles).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary hypertension poses another risk factor to adults with  congenital  heart  disease.  It  can  be  due  to  pulmonary venous hypertension secondary to elevated ventricular enddiastolic pressure, elevated pulmonary venous atrial pressure, or pulmonary vein stenosis. Although some patients may have decreased oxygen saturation resulting from residual shunt or poor lung function, the main cause of pulmonary hypertension in adults with congenital heart disease is the presence of chronic large and nonrestrictive shunts. Th e increased blood fl ow and near  systemic  pressure  to  the  pulmonary  vasculature  can  lead  to  irreversible  vascular  changes  and  elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Eisenmenger's syndrome, for instance,  is  pulmonary  hypertension  resulting  from  chronic le ft -to-right shunting. Predictors of mortality in these patients include  poor  functional  status,  younger  age  at  presentation  or  development  of  symptoms,  syncope,  supraventricular  dysrhythmias, elevated right atrial pressures, low oxygen saturation (<85%), renal insu ffi ciency, severe right ventricular dysfunction, and trisomy 21.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulation and bleeding abnormalities may also be apparent in adults with congenital heart disease. Cyanotic patients o ft en have low levels of circulating vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, factor V , and von Willebrand factor, which leads to an elevated international normalized ratio and a prolonged activated  partial  thromboplastin  time.  However,  because  of decreased fl ow  and  increased  blood  viscosity,  they  do  not have an elevated bleeding time. Th e  increased  bleeding  risk does not counteract the risk of thrombosis due to secondary erythrocytosis,  which  develops  as  a  compensatory  response to  chronic hypoxia and from overproduction of erythropoietin.  As  a  result,  the  increased  whole-blood  viscosity  with increased red cell mass and decreased plasma volume leads to reduced fl ow-through in the small arterioles and capillaries. In the perioperative setting, preoperative fasting might exacerbate  symptoms  of  hyperviscosity  and  increase  the  risk  of cerebrovascular thrombosis; hence, adequate hydration with intravenous fl uids is paramount in these fasting patients, and in  some  cases,  preoperative  phlebotomy  might  be  advisable when hematocrit levels exceed 65%. Coagulation status must also be assessed and potentially corrected in patients undergoing moderate or major surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  intraoperative anesthetic strategy depends on the complexity  of  the  congenital  heart  disease,  prior  surgery,  the patient's  functional  status,  and  the  type  of  operation  being performed.  In  addition to direct  examination,  standard monitoring  with  pulse  oximetry,  ECG,  arterial  blood  pressure measurement, capnography, and temperature measurement should be used in all patients, with careful consideration of  the  underlying  anatomy  and  physiology.  For  example,  in those patients with hypoplastic le ft heart syndrome who have undergone  three  stages  of  repair  (Blalock-Taussig  shunt, Glenn's shunt, and Fontan's procedure), placement of a central venous catheter, as well as interpretation of its readings obtained, may be complicated. In patients with Fontan circulation, for example, central venous pressure re fl ects mean pulmonary artery pressure. In patients with an intraatrial ba ffl e (e.g.,  Mustard's  or  Senning's  procedure),  pulmonary  artery catheter placement may be di ffi cult or impossible. Intraarterial monitoring may be essential in adult congenital heart disease patients, especially those with Eisenmenger's syndrome, intracardiac  shunts,  or  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts,  who are sensitive to sudden changes in preload and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. However, vascular access may be  challenging  because  of  the  presence  of  scar  tissue  from prior  vessel  catheterization.  Finally,  transesophageal  echocardiography may be useful to monitor intravascular volume status and ventricular function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless  the  patient  is  having  a  primary  or  staged  cardiac repair,  there  are  no  evidence-based  recommendations  to guide the anesthetic management of the adult congenital heart disease  patient  undergoing  surgery.  However,  intraoperative management should promote tissue oxygen delivery by preventing arterial desaturation, maintaining a balance between pulmonary  and  systemic fl ows,  and  optimizing  hematocrit. Most intravenous agents depress myocardial contractility and decrease systemic vascular resistance, which could have a deleterious e ff ect on tissue oxygen delivery during induction of anesthesia. Th e  use  of  ketamine  has  been  shown to be bene fi cial  in  children  with  congenital  heart  disease  and  pulmonary hypertension undergoing sevo fl urane anesthesia because it  maintains  ventricular  performance  and  systemic  vascular resistance without increasing pulmonary vascular resistance, but it has been associated with an increase in pulmonary vascular  resistance  in  adults  without  congenital  heart  disease. Overall  choice  of  anesthetic  agent  should  be  guided  by  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
70

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
patient's underlying physiology and current presentation, and by the goal of balancing systemic and pulmonary blood fl ow. Intracardiac  and  systemic-to-pulmonary  shunts can  provide challenges to case management. For example, in patients with cyanotic heart disease, ventilation with high airway pressures can  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  compromise venous  return,  and  exacerbate  right-to-le ft shunt  physiology. Placement in Trendelenburg's position can increase central venous (superior vena cava) pressure and cause cerebral hypoperfusion in a patient with a Glenn shunt or Fontan circulation. In those adult patients with large ASDs, inadequate anesthesia and sympathetic nervous system stimulation might increase systemic vascular resistance, exacerbate le ft -to-right shunting, and reduce cardiac output. Adult congenital heart disease patients with univentricular physiology and anatomy, and  pulmonary  hypertension,  such  as  those  with  Eisenmenger's syndrome, can be the most challenging in terms of intraoperative  anesthetic  management.  As  another  example, adults  with  congenital  heart  disease  who  have  undergone Fontan's procedure generally have passive, nonpulsatile fl ow from both the inferior and superior vena cava to the pulmonary artery; hence, any factor that increases pulmonary vascular resistance will decrease pulmonary blood fl ow and lead to arterial desaturation. Prevention and treatment of pulmonary hypertensive  crisis  includes  hyperventilation  (with  1.0  fractional inspired oxygen concentration), correction of acidosis, avoidance of sympathetic nervous system stimulation, maintenance of normothermia, minimization of intrathoracic pressure, and use of inotropic support. Inhaled nitric oxide may be useful for sudden increases in pulmonary vascular resistance in high-risk patients. Regional anesthesia may be an alternative  for  certain  procedures, but a caveat to the use of spinal and epidural anesthesia is the decrease in systemic vascular resistance  in  patients  with  unrestrictive  intracardiac  shunts. Th e  anesthesiologist must also be prepared for an increased intraoperative bleeding risk, such as in patients with Fontan circulation with associated liver dysfunction, as well as potential thrombosis in patients with secondary erythrocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adults with congenital heart disease should be strati fi ed to the appropriate  postoperative  environment  based  on  the  severity  of  disease,  type  of  procedure,  and  perioperative  course through consultation among the anesthesiologist, the surgeon, and, optimally, the patient's congenital heart disease cardiology specialist. Th e major postoperative risks are the same as those  in  the  preoperative  and  intraoperative  settings,  such as  bleeding,  thrombosis,  worsening  pulmonary  hypertension, and dysrhythmias. Patients who have severe congenital heart disease and/or have undergone high-risk surgery should be  managed in an intensive care unit experienced in caring for adults with congenital heart disease. To date there are no evidence-based  guidelines  for  perioperative  management  of adults with congenital heart disease; hence, clinical trials are warranted to improve the anesthetic care of these unique yet challenging patients.

INFECTIVE ENDOCARDITIS ANTIBIOTIC PROPHYLAXIS IN PATIENTS WITH REPAIRED AND UNREPAIRED CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Of particular interest to adults with congenital heart disease are  the  modi fi ed  recommendations  for  infective  endocarditis  prophylaxis.  Current  recommendations  have  resulted in a more restrictive use of such prophylaxis. Th e AHA has recently published updated guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis. A ft er  reviewing the literature for the past  40  years,  its  expert  panel  found  that  very  few  cases  of endocarditis  could  have  been  prevented  by  antibiotic  prophylaxis. Th e guidelines now emphasize the use of infective endocarditis  prophylaxis  in  patients  at  high  risk,  particularly  those  with  prosthetic  cardiac  materials. Th ese  include patients  with  prosthetic  valves  or  prosthetic  material  used for  valve  repair,  palliative  shunts,  and  conduits;  completely repaired congenital heart disease with prosthetic material or a  device  placed  during  surgery  or  by  catheter  intervention during the fi rst  6  months a ft er  the  procedure; and repaired congenital heart disease with residual defects at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device (which inhibit endothelialization). In addition, infective endocarditis prophylaxis is recommended for those with previous infective  endocarditis,  unrepaired  congenital  heart  disease,  or cyanotic congenital heart disease, and for cardiac transplantation  recipients  who  develop  cardiac  valvulopathy.  Except for  patients  with  the  aforementioned  conditions,  antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for patients with congenital heart disease. In addition, the committee concluded that for patients with these underlying cardiac conditions at highest risk for adverse outcomes from infective endocarditis, prophylaxis is reasonable for all dental procedures involving manipulation of the gingival tissue, the periapical region of teeth,  or  perforation of the oral mucosa. Prophylaxis is not recommended based solely on an increased lifetime risk of acquiring infective endocarditis. Th e committee also does not recommend administering antibiotics solely to prevent infective endocarditis in patients undergoing genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract operations. Th ese new guidelines have been designed to clearly de fi ne appropriate indications for infective  endocarditis  prophylaxis  and  to  provide  more  uniform recommendations.

■ Advances in molecular biology have provided new insights into the genetic basis of congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In patients with acyanotic or cyanotic congenital heart disease, an understanding of the relationship between systemic and  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  is  essential  to  determine appropriate anesthetic management. For example, in patients with cyanotic heart disease, ventilation with high airway  pressures  can  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  compromise  venous  return,  and  exacerbate  rightto-le ft shunt  physiology.  Placement  in  Trendelenburg's position can increase central venous (superior vena cava) pressure and cause cerebral hypoperfusion in a patient who has a Glenn shunt or has undergone Fontan's procedure. In those patients with large ASDs, inadequate anesthesia and sympathetic  nervous  system  stimulation  might  increase systemic vascular resistance, exacerbate le ft -to-right shunting, and reduce cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ New modalities for decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance  have  had  a  signi fi cant  impact  on  the  treatment  of patients with intracardiac and systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, whether in acyanotic or cyanotic congenital heart disease.  Management  of  pulmonary  vascular  resistance and hence prevention of pulmonary hypertension is essential for better hemodynamic stability in the intraoperative and  postoperative  environment  as  well  as  for  improved long-term outcomes. Prevention and treatment of pulmonary hypertensive crisis in congenital heart disease patients includes  hyperventilation  (with  1.0  fractional  inspired oxygen  concentration),  correction  of  acidosis,  avoidance of  sympathetic  nervous  system  stimulation,  maintenance of normothermia, minimization of intrathoracic pressure, and use of inotropic support. Inhaled nitric oxide may be useful  for  sudden  increases  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance in patients at high risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ As innovation and expertise continue to improve survival, the growing adult patient population with repaired congenital heart defects provides a unique challenge to the anesthesiologist.  Familiarity  and  experience  with  congenital heart disease anatomy and physiology in adults, in addition to  a  profound  understanding  of  perioperative  complications  such  as  bleeding  and  thrombosis  risk,  pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and dysrhythmias, are essential for e ff ective anesthetic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e American Heart Association published updated new  guidelines  for  infective  endocarditis  prophylaxis  in patients  with  repaired  and  unrepaired  congenital  heart defects. Th e  guidelines  now  emphasize  the  use  of  antibiotic  prophylaxis  in  patients  at  high  risk,  particularly those  with  prosthetic  cardiac  materials  (as  discussed),  a history  of  infective  endocarditis,  unrepaired  congenital  heart  defects,  or  cyanotic  congenital  heart  disease  as well as cardiac transplant recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy. Th e committee concluded that for patients with these underlying cardiac conditions who are at highest  risk  for  adverse  outcomes  from  infective  endocarditis,  prophylaxis  is  reasonable  for  all  dental  procedures
