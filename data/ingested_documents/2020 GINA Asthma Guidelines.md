INTERIM GUIDANCE ON ASTHMA MANAGEMENT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advise patients with asthma to continue taking their prescribed asthma medications, particularly inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) medications, and oral corticosteroids (OCS) if prescribed

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma medications should be continued as usual during the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes ICS-containing medications (alone or in combination), and add-on therapy including biologic therapy for severe asthma. Stopping ICS often leads to potentially dangerous worsening of asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For a small proportion of patients with severe asthma, long-term OCS may sometimes be needed, and it is very dangerous to stop these suddenly. Advise patients to discuss with you before stopping any asthma medication. Make sure that all patients have a written asthma action plan An action plan tells the patient how to recognize worsening asthma, how to increase their reliever and controller medications, and when to seek medical help. A short course of OCS may be needed during severe asthma flare-ups (exacerbations). See the GINA 2020 report Box 4-2 for more information about the options for asthma action plans. Where possible, avoid using nebulizers due to the risk of transmitting infection to healthcare workers and other patients COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nebulizers can transmit respiratory viral particles for approximately 1 meter. Instead, to deliver short-acting beta2-agonist for acute asthma in adults and children, use a pressurized metered-dose inhaler and spacer, with a mouthpiece or tightly fitting face mask, if required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoid spirometry in patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spirometry can disseminate viral particles and expose staff and patients to risk of infection. While community transmission of the virus is occurring in your region, postpone spirometry and peak flow measurement within health care facilities unless there is an urgent need. If spirometry is needed urgently for clinical management, follow infection control recommendations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Follow infection control recommendations if other aerosolgenerating procedures are needed

<!-- PAGE=? -->
These include oxygen therapy (including with nasal prongs), sputum induction, manual ventilation, non-invasive ventilation and intubation. World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations are found here: www.who.int/publications-detail/infection-preventionand-control-during-health-care-when-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)infection-is-suspected-20200125

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Follow local health advice about hygiene strategies and use of personal protective equipment, as new information becomes available in your country or region.

UPDATE ON GINA RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MILD ASTHMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The 2019 GINA strategy report represented the most important change in asthma management in 30 years. For safety, GINA no longer recommends treatment with short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA) alone , without inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) . There is strong evidence that SABA-only treatment, although providing short-term relief of asthma symptoms, does not protect patients from severe exacerbations, and that regular or frequent use of SABAs increases the risk of exacerbations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GINA now recommends that all adults and adolescents with asthma should receive ICS-containing controller treatment. This can be either symptom-driven (in mild asthma, GINA Steps 1 to 2) or daily (GINA Steps 2 to 5), to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations and to control symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to provide consistent messaging about the aims of asthma treatment, including prevention of exacerbations, across the whole spectrum of asthma severity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Details about the 2020 GINA treatment recommendations, and the rationale and evidence for the recommendations about symptom-driven ICS-formoterol treatment in mild asthma, begin on page 20. The treatment figures are on pages 22 and 26, and new figures about initial asthma treatment are on page 24 and 28. Information about ICS doses is found on page 30. Why did GINA change its recommendations for mild asthma in 2019? The 2019 recommendations represented the culmination of a 12-year campaign by GINA to obtain evidence for strategies to improve the treatment of mild asthma. Our aims were: · to reduce the risk of serious asthma-related exacerbations and death, including in patients with so-called mild asthma, COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to avoid establishing a pattern of patient reliance on SABA early in the course of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since then, two additional studies of as-needed ICS-formoterol have been published, providing further support for the GINA recommendation about treatment of mild asthma. These were open-label studies, representing the way that patients would use as-needed ICS-formoterol in real life. These studies also found that the benefit of as-needed ICS-formoterol, compared with as-needed SABA or maintenance ICS, was independent of markers of eosinophilic inflammation at baseline. Details start on page 21.

ABOUT GINA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide. It is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups, with increasing prevalence in many developing countries, rising treatment costs, and a rising burden for patients and the community. Asthma still imposes an unacceptable burden on health care systems, and on society through loss of productivity in the workplace and, especially for pediatric asthma, disruption to the family. Asthma still contributes to many deaths worldwide, including among young people.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Health care providers managing asthma face different issues globally, depending on the local context, the health system, and access to resources.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established to increase awareness about asthma among health professionals, public health authorities and the community, and to improve prevention and management through a coordinated worldwide effort. GINA prepares scientific reports on asthma, encourages dissemination and implementation of the recommendations, and promotes international collaboration on asthma research. The Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to asthma management that can be adapted for local conditions and for individual patients. It focuses not only on the existing strong evidence base, but also on clarity of language and on providing tools for feasible implementation in clinical practice. The report is updated each year. In 2019, GINA published important new recommendations for treatment of mild asthma (page 20) and severe asthma (page 35). COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT ASTHMA?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is a common and potentially serious chronic disease that imposes a substantial burden on patients, their families and the community. It causes respiratory symptoms, limitation of activity, and flare-ups (attacks) that sometimes require urgent health care and may be fatal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fortunately, asthma can be effectively treated , and most patients can achieve good control of their asthma. When asthma is under good control, patients can:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Avoid troublesome symptoms during day and night

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Need little or no reliever medication

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Have productive, physically active lives

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Have normal or near normal lung function

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Avoid serious asthma flare-ups (exacerbations, or attacks)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma flare-ups (also called exacerbations or attacks) can be fatal, even in people with apparently mild asthma. They are more common and more severe when asthma is uncontrolled, and in some high-risk patients. However, flare-ups may occur even in people taking asthma treatment, so all patients should have an asthma action plan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
What is asthma? Asthma causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time in their occurrence, frequency and intensity. These symptoms are associated with variable expiratory airflow, i.e. difficulty breathing air out of the lungs due to bronchoconstriction (airway narrowing), airway wall thickening, and increased mucus. Some variation in airflow can also occur in people without asthma, but it is greater in untreated asthma. There are different types of asthma (also called phenotypes), with different underlying disease processes. Factors that may trigger or worsen asthma symptoms include viral infections, allergens at home or work (e.g. house dust mite, pollens, cockroach), tobacco smoke, exercise and stress. These responses are more likely when asthma is uncontrolled. Asthma can also be induced or symptoms triggered by some drugs, e.g. beta-blockers, and (in some patients), by aspirin or other NSAIDs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing medications markedly reduces the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms and markedly reduces the risk of flare-ups or dying of asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma treatment should be customized to the individual patient , taking into account their level of symptom control, their risk factors for exacerbations, phenotypic characteristics, and preferences, as well as the effectiveness of available medications, their safety, and their cost to the payer or patient.

CRITERIA FOR MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Box 2. Features used in making the diagnosis of asthma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1. A history of variable respiratory symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typical symptoms are wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
People with asthma generally have more than one of these symptoms,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The symptoms occur variably over time and vary in intensity,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The symptoms often occur or are worse at night or on waking,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms are often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens or cold air,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms often occur with or worsen with viral infections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2. Evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At least once during the diagnostic process (e.g. when FEV1 is low), document that the FEV1/FVC ratio is below the lower limit of normal † .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Significant bronchodilator reversibility may be absent during severe exacerbations or viral infections. If significant bronchodilator reversibility is not present when it is first tested, the next step depends on the clinical urgency and the availability of other tests.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Document that variation in lung function is greater than in healthy people. For example, excess variability is recorded if: o FEV1 increases by >200 mL and >12% of the baseline value (or in children, increases from baseline by >12% of the predicted value) after inhaling a bronchodilator. This is called significant bronchodilator responsiveness or reversibility. o Average daily diurnal PEF variability* is >10% (in children, >13%) o FEV1 increases by more than 12% and 200 mL from baseline (in children, by >12% of the predicted value) after 4 weeks of anti-inflammatory treatment (outside respiratory infections). · The greater the variation, or the more times excess variation is seen, the more confident you can be of the diagnosis of asthma. · Testing may need to be repeated during symptoms, in the early morning, or after withholding bronchodilator medications.

HOW TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS IN PATIENTS TAKING CONTROLLER TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For many patients (25-35%) with a diagnosis of asthma in primary care, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed. If the basis of the diagnosis has not already been documented, it should be confirmed with objective testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If standard criteria for asthma (Box 2, p.12) are not met, consider other investigations. For example, if lung function is normal, repeat reversibility testing when the patient is symptomatic, or after withholding SABA for >4 hours, twice-daily ICS-LABAs for >12 hours, and once-daily ICS+LABAs for >24 hours. If the patient has frequent symptoms, consider a trial of step-up in controller treatment and repeat lung function testing after 3 months. If the patient has few symptoms, consider stepping down controller treatment; ensure the patient has a written asthma action plan, monitor them carefully, and repeat lung function testing. More information about confirming the diagnosis of asthma is in Boxes 1-3 and 1-4 of the full GINA 2020 report.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma may be under-diagnosed in the elderly, due to poor perception, an assumption that dyspnea is normal in old age, lack of fitness, or reduced activity. Asthma may also be over-diagnosed in the elderly if shortness of breath due to heart failure or ischemic heart disease is mistakenly attributed to asthma. If there is a history of smoking or biomass fuel exposure, COPD or asthma-COPD overlap should also be considered (see below).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSING ASTHMA IN OTHER CONTEXTS Occupational asthma and work-aggravated (work-exacerbated) asthma Every patient with adult-onset asthma should be asked about occupational exposures, and whether their asthma is better when they are away from work. It is important to confirm the diagnosis objectively (which often needs specialist referral) and to eliminate exposure as quickly as possible. Pregnant women Ask all pregnant women and those planning pregnancy whether they have asthma, and advise them about the importance of taking asthma controller treatment for the health of both mother and baby.

Smokers and ex-smokers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma and COPD may co-exist or overlap (sometimes called asthma-COPD overlap [ACO] or asthma+COPD), particularly in smokers and the elderly. The history and pattern of symptoms and past records can help to distinguish asthma with persistent airflow limitation from COPD. Uncertainty in diagnosis should prompt early referral, because asthma-COPD overlap has worse outcomes than asthma or COPD alone. Asthma-COPD overlap is not a single

<!-- PAGE=? -->
disease, but is likely caused by several different mechanisms. There is little randomized controlled trial evidence about how to treat these patients, as they are often excluded from clinical trials. However, patients with a diagnosis of COPD who also have any history or diagnosis of asthma should be treated as for asthma, including at least low dose ICS (see p.30), because of the risks associated with treating asthma with bronchodilators alone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with persistent cough as the only respiratory symptom

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This may be due to chronic upper airway cough syndrome ('post-nasal drip'), chronic sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), inducible laryngeal obstruction (often called vocal cord dysfunction), eosinophilic bronchitis, or cough variant asthma. Cough variant asthma is characterized by cough and airway hyperresponsiveness, and documenting variability in lung function is essential to make this diagnosis. However, lack of variability at the time of testing does not exclude asthma. For other diagnostic tests, see Box 2, and Chapter 1 of the GINA report, or refer the patient for specialist opinion.

ASSESSING A PATIENT WITH ASTHMA

· Local : high dose or potent ICS; poor inhaler technique ICS: inhaled corticosteroid; OCS: oral corticosteroid HOW TO ASSESS ASTHMA CONTROL Asthma control means the extent to which the effects of asthma can be seen in the patient, or have been reduced or removed by treatment. Asthma control has two domains: symptom control and risk factors for future poor outcomes, particularly flare-ups (exacerbations) (see Box 4, p.15). Questionnaires like Asthma Control Test and Asthma Control Questionnaire assess only symptom control. Poor symptom control is a burden to patients and a risk factor for flare-ups. Risk factors are factors that increase the patient's future risk of having exacerbations (flare-ups), loss of lung function, or medication side-effects. What is the role of lung function in monitoring asthma? COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once asthma has been diagnosed, lung function is most useful as an indicator of future risk. It should be recorded at diagnosis, 3-6 months after starting treatment, and periodically thereafter. Most patients should have lung function measured at least every 1-2 years, more often in children and those at higher risk of flare-ups or lung function decline. Patients who have either few or many symptoms relative to their lung function need more investigation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
How is asthma severity assessed?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Currently, asthma severity is assessed retrospectively from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. Mild asthma is asthma that can be controlled with Step 1 or 2 treatment. Severe asthma is asthma that requires Step 5 treatment. It may appear similar to asthma that is uncontrolled due to lack of treatment.

MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The long-term goals of asthma management are risk reduction and symptom control . The aim is to reduce the burden to the patient and to reduce their risk of asthma-related death, exacerbations, airway damage, and medication side-effects. The patient's own goals and preferences regarding their asthma and its treatment should also be identified.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Population-level recommendations about 'preferred' asthma treatments represent the best treatment for most patients in a population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patient-level treatment decisions should take into account any individual characteristics, risk factors, comorbidities or phenotype that predict how likely the patient's symptoms and exacerbation risk are to be reduced by a particular treatment, together with their personal goals, and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence, and affordability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A partnership between the patient and their health care providers is important for effective asthma management. Training health care providers in communication skills may lead to increased patient satisfaction, better health outcomes, and reduced use of health care resources. Health literacy - that is, the patient's ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions should be taken into account in asthma management and education. THE ASTHMA MANAGEMENT CYCLE TO MINIMIZE RISK AND CONTROL SYMPTOMS Asthma management involves a continuous cycle to assess , adjust treatment and review response (see Box 6, p.19). COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment of a patient with asthma includes not only symptom control , but also the patient's individual risk factors and comorbidities that can contribute to their burden of disease and risk of poor health outcomes, or that may predict their response to treatment. Patients (or parents of children with asthma) should be asked about their goals and preferences for asthma treatment, as part of shared decision-making about asthma treatment options.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment to prevent asthma exacerbations and control symptoms includes:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medications: GINA now recommends that every adult and adolescent with asthma should receive ICS-containing controller medication to reduce their risk of serious exacerbations, even patients with infrequent symptoms. Every patient with asthma should have a reliever inhaler, either low dose ICS-formoterol or SABA.

GINA RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MILD ASTHMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For safety, GINA no longer recommends starting with SABA-only treatment. GINA recommends that all adults and adolescents with asthma should receive ICS-containing controller treatment to reduce their risk of serious exacerbations and to control symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Box 7A (p.22) shows the new ICS controller options. These now include:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(for mild asthma) as-needed low dose ICS-formoterol* or, if not available, low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken † , or

<!-- PAGE=? -->
regular ICS or ICS-LABA every day, plus as-needed SABA, or

<!-- PAGE=? -->
maintenance and reliever treatment with ICS-formoterol. §

Why did GINA change its recommendations in 2019?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The new recommendations represented the culmination of a 12-year campaign by GINA to obtain evidence for new strategies for treatment of mild asthma. Our aims were:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to reduce the risk of asthma-related exacerbations and death, including in patients with so-called mild asthma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to provide consistent messaging about the aims of treatment, including prevention of exacerbations, across the spectrum of asthma severity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to avoid establishing a pattern of patient reliance on SABA early in the course of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional information is provided on page 31 about the evidence and rationale for each of the new recommendations in Steps 1 and 2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Why are there concerns about SABA-only treatment?

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many guidelines recommend that patients with mild asthma should be treated with as-needed SABA reliever alone. This dates back more than 50 years, to when asthma was thought of primarily as a disease of bronchoconstriction. However, airway inflammation is found in most patients with asthma, even in those with intermittent or infrequent symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although SABA provides quick relief of symptoms, SABA-only treatment is associated with increased risk of exacerbations and lower lung function. Regular use of SABA increases allergic responses and airway inflammation, and reduces the bronchodilator response to SABA when it is needed. Over-use of SABA (e.g. ≥3 canisters dispensed in a year) is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations. D ispensing of ≥12 SABA canisters in a year is associated with increased risk of asthma-related death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STARTING ASTHMA TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For the best outcomes, ICS-containing treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after the diagnosis of asthma is made, because:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with even mild asthma can have severe exacerbations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low dose ICS markedly reduces asthma hospitalizations and death

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low dose ICS is very effective in preventing severe exacerbations, reducing symptoms, improving lung function, and preventing exerciseinduced bronchoconstriction, even in patients with mild asthma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early treatment with low dose ICS leads to better lung function than if symptoms have been present for more than 2-4 years

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients not taking ICS who experience a severe exacerbation have lower long-term lung function than those who have started ICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In occupational asthma, early removal from exposure and early treatment increase the probability of recovery For most adults or adolescents with asthma, treatment can be started at Step 2 with either regular daily low dose ICS, or as-needed low dose ICS-formoterol (or, if not available, low dose ICS whenever SABA is taken). Most patients with asthma do not need higher doses of ICS , because at a group level, most of the benefit (including prevention of exacerbations) is obtained at low doses. For ICS doses, see Box 9, p.30. Consider starting at Step 3 (e.g. daily low dose ICS-LABA or medium dose ICS) if, at initial presentation, the patient has troublesome asthma symptoms on most days; or is waking from asthma once or more a week. If the patient has severely uncontrolled asthma at initial asthma presentation, or the initial presentation is during an acute exacerbation, start regular controller treatment at Step 4 (e.g. medium dose ICS-LABA); a short course of OCS may also be needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consider stepping down after asthma has been well-controlled for 3 months. However, in adults and adolescents, ICS should not be completely stopped.

This is not a table of equivalence , but suggested total daily ICS doses for the 'low', 'medium' and 'high' dose options in Boxes 7 and 8. It is based on available studies and product information. Doses may be countryspecific depending on local availability, regulatory labelling and clinical guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low dose ICS provides most of the clinical benefit for most patients. However, ICS responsiveness varies between patients, so some patients may need medium dose ICS if asthma is uncontrolled despite good adherence and correct inhaler technique with low dose ICS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High dose ICS is needed by very few patients, and its long-term use is associated with an increased risk of local and systemic side-effects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STEPWISE APPROACH FOR ADJUSTING TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENT NEEDS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once asthma treatment has been started (Box 7B, p.24 and Box 8B, p.28), ongoing decisions are based on a cycle of shared decision-making to assess the patient, adjust their treatment (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) if needed, and review their response (Box 6, p.19).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The preferred controller treatments at each step for adults and adolescents are summarized below and in Box 7A (p.22) for adults and adolescents, and Box 8A (p.26) for children 6-11 years. For more details, including for children 5 years and younger, see the full GINA 2020 report. See Box 9 (p.30) for ICS doses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At each step, other controller options are also listed, that are not as effective as the 'preferred controller', but that may be considered for patients with particular risk factors, or if the preferred controller is not available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients whose asthma is not well-controlled on a particular treatment, adherence, inhaler technique and comorbidities should be checked before considering a different medication in the same step, or before stepping up.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STEP 1. Preferred controller: As-needed low dose ICS-formoterol

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Step 1 recommendations are for:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial asthma treatment for patients with symptoms less than twice a month and no exacerbation risk factors, a group that is rarely studied

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Step-down treatment for patients whose asthma is well-controlled on Step 2 treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As-needed low dose ICS-formoterol is the preferred approach for such patients. This strategy is supported by indirect evidence from two studies comparing as-needed budesonide-formoterol with SABA-only treatment in patients eligible for Step 2 therapy (see below).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In making this recommendation, the most important considerations were that:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with few interval asthma symptoms can have severe or fatal exacerbations (Dusser et al, Allergy 2007).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Severe exacerbations were reduced by about 60% with as-needed low dose budesonide-formoterol compared with SABA-only, at 20-50% of the average ICS dose compared with daily low dose ICS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to avoid conflicting messages in which patients are initially told to use SABA for symptom relief but then (despite this treatment being effective from their perspective) they are told that they need to take a daily controller to reduce their SABA use and prevent exacerbations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
31

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adherence with daily ICS is particularly poor in patients with infrequent symptoms, exposing them to risks of SABA-only treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All evidence for the safety and efficacy of as-needed ICS-formoterol so far is with low dose budesonide-formoterol, but beclometasone-formoterol may also be suitable. These medications are well-established for maintenance and reliever therapy in Steps 3 to 5, and no new safety signals were seen in the as-needed studies with budesonide-formoterol. The maximum recommended dose of budesonide-formoterol in a single day is a total of 72 mcg formoterol. However, in the clinical trials in mild asthma, average usage of budesonideformoterol was around only 3-4 inhalations per week.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other controller options at Step 1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken : In Step 1, the evidence is again indirect, from studies with separate or combination ICS and SABA inhalers in patients eligible for Step 2 treatment (see below). For this recommendation, the most important considerations were reducing the risk of severe exacerbations, and the fact that adherence with daily ICS is poor in patients with symptoms less than twice a month.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STEP 2. Preferred controller: Daily low dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, OR as-needed low dose ICS-formoterol

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Daily low dose ICS had been suggested by GINA since 2014 in Step 1 to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations. However, patients with symptoms less than twice a month are unlikely to take ICS regularly, leaving them exposed to the risks of SABA-only treatment, so it is no longer recommended. Children 6-11 years Taking ICS whenever SABA is taken is a possible option, with indirect evidence from two Step 2 studies with separate ICS and SABA inhalers (see below). COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Daily low dose ICS with as-needed SABA : there is a large body of evidence from RCTs and observational studies showing that the risks of severe exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality are substantially reduced with regular low dose ICS; symptoms and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction are also reduced. Severe exacerbations are halved even in patients with symptoms 0-1 days a week (Reddel et al, Lancet 2017).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For this recommendation, the most important consideration was reducing the risk of severe exacerbations, but before prescribing daily ICS, the clinician should consider whether the patient is likely to have good adherence. Poor adherence would expose patients to the risks of SABA-only treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
32

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As-needed low dose ICS-formoterol : the evidence to date is with low dose budesonide-formoterol. With this treatment, compared with as-needed SABA alone, a large double-blind study in mild asthma found a 64% reduction in severe exacerbations (O'Byrne et al, NEJMed 2018). A 60% reduction was also seen in an open-label study in which patients were using as-needed budesonide-formoterol as they would in real life (Beasley et al, NEJMed 2019). Compared with daily low dose ICS, as-needed budesonide-formoterol was non-inferior for severe exacerbations in two large double-blind studies (O'Byrne et al, NEJMed 2018; Bateman et al, NEJMed 2018), and was superior to daily low dose ICS in two open-label studies (Beasley et al, NEJMed 2019; Hardy et al, Lancet 2019), with a very small or no difference in symptom control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In both the open-label studies, the treatment effects with as-needed budesonide-formoterol were similar regardless of whether blood eosinophils or FeNO were low or elevated at entry.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For this recommendation, the most important considerations were to prevent severe exacerbations and to avoid the need for daily ICS in patients with mild asthma. The small differences in symptom control and lung function, compared with daily ICS, were considered to be less important, as they were less than the minimal important difference. The maximum recommended dose of budesonide-formoterol in a single day is a total of 72 mcg formoterol. However, in the clinical trials in mild asthma, average usage of as-needed budesonide-formoterol was around only 3-4 inhalations per week. One study of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction with ICS-formoterol taken as-needed and before exercise showed similar benefit as daily ICS (Lazarinis et al, Thorax 2014). This suggests that patients prescribed as-needed ICSformoterol do not need to be prescribed a SABA for pre-exercise use. Other controller options at Step 2 COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken, either in combination or separate inhalers (off-label). Two studies showed reduced exacerbations compared with SABA-only treatment, one in ages 5-18 years with separate inhalers (Martinez et al, Lancet 2011) and one in adults with combination ICS-SABA (Papi et al, NEJMed 2007). Evidence for similar or fewer exacerbations compared with daily ICS comes from the same studies plus others in adults (Calhoun et al, JAMA 2012) and children aged 6-17 years (Sumino et al, J Allerg Clin Immunol 2019). In making this recommendation, a high importance was given to preventing severe exacerbations, and a lower importance was given to small differences in symptom control and the inconvenience of needing to carry two inhalers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) are less effective than regular ICS, particularly for preventing exacerbations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
33

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Daily low dose ICS-LABA as initial therapy leads to faster improvement in symptoms and FEV1 than ICS alone but is costlier and the exacerbation rate is similar.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For purely seasonal allergic asthma, evidence is needed. Current advice is to start ICS at the start of the allergen season and cease 4 weeks after end of exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children 6-11 years

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The preferred controller option for children at Step 2 is regular low dose ICS (see Box 9, p.30 for ICS dose ranges in children). Other less effective controller options for children are daily LTRA, or taking low dose ICS whenever SABA is taken, using separate inhalers (Martinez et al, Lancet 2011). Another study in children aged 6-17 years showed similar outcomes with taking ICS whenever SABA was taken as with physician-directed treatment (Sumino et al, J Allerg Clin Immunol Pract 2019).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STEP 3. Preferred controller: low dose ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy, OR daily low dose ICS-LABA maintenance plus as-needed SABA Before considering a step-up from daily low dose ICS, check adherence, inhaler technique and comorbidities. For patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on low dose ICS, low dose combination ICS-LABA leads to a reduction of about 20% in exacerbation risk, and higher lung function, but little difference in reliever use. For patients with ≥1 exacerbation in the last year, maintenance and reliever treatment with low dose BDP-formoterol or BUDformoterol is more effective than maintenance ICS-LABA or higher dose ICS with as-needed SABA in reducing severe exacerbations, with a similar level of symptom control. The maximum recommended dose of ICS-formoterol in a single day is a total of 48mcg formoterol for BDP-formoterol, and 72mcg formoterol for budesonide-formoterol. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other controller options : Medium dose ICS, or low dose ICS plus LTRA. For adult patients with rhinitis who are allergic to house dust mite, consider adding sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), provided FEV1 is >70% predicted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children (6-11 years) : The preferred controller for this age-group is medium dose ICS or low dose ICS-LABA, which have similar benefits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
34

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STEP 4. Preferred controller: Low dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy, OR medium dose ICS-LABA maintenance plus as-needed SABA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At a group level, most benefit from ICS is obtained at low dose, but individual ICS responsiveness varies, and some patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on low dose ICS-LABA despite good adherence and correct technique may benefit from increasing the maintenance ICS dose to medium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other controller options include: add-on tiotropium by mist inhaler for patients ≥ 6 years with a history of exacerbations, add-on LTRA, or increasing to high dose ICS-LABA, but with the latter, consider the potential increase in ICS side-effects. For adult patients with rhinitis and asthma who are allergic to house dust mite, consider adding SLIT, provided FEV1 is >70% predicted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children (6-11 years) : Continue controller, and refer for expert advice. STEP 5. Refer for phenotypic investigation ± add-on treatment Patients with uncontrolled symptoms and/or exacerbations despite Step 4 treatment should be assessed for contributory factors, have their treatment optimized, and be referred for expert assessment including severe asthma phenotype, and potential add-on treatment. The GINA Pocket Guide on Difficult to Treat and Severe Asthma v2.0 2019 provides a decision tree and practical guide for assessment and management in adults and adolescents. Sputum-guided treatment, if available, improves outcomes in moderate-severe asthma. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Add-on treatments include tiotropium by mist inhaler for patients ≥ 6 years with a history of exacerbations, anti-IgE (SC omalizumab, ≥6 years ) for severe allergic asthma, and anti-IL5 (SC mepolizumab, ≥ 6 years, or IV reslizumab, ≥18 years) or anti-IL5R (SC benralizumab, ≥ 12 years) or anti-IL4R (SC dupilumab, ≥ 12 years) for severe eosinophilic asthma. See glossary (p.45) and check local eligibility criteria for specific add-on therapies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other options : Some patients may benefit from low dose OCS but long-term systemic side-effects are common and serious.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REVIEWING RESPONSE AND ADJUSTING TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
How often should patients with asthma be reviewed?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients should preferably be seen 1-3 months after starting treatment and every 3-12 months after that, but in pregnancy, asthma should be reviewed every 4-6 weeks. After an exacerbation, a review visit within 1 week should be scheduled. The frequency of review depends on the patient's initial level of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
35

<!-- PAGE=? -->
symptom control, their risk factors, their response to initial treatment, and their ability and willingness to engage in self-management with an action plan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stepping up asthma treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is a variable condition, and periodic adjustment of controller treatment by the clinician and/or patient may be needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sustained step-up (for at least 2-3 months) : if symptoms and/or exacerbations persist despite 2-3 months of controller treatment, assess the following common issues before considering a step-up

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o incorrect inhaler technique

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o poor adherence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o modifiable risk factors, e.g. smoking

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o are symptoms due to comorbid conditions, e.g. allergic rhinitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Short-term step-up (for 1-2 weeks) by clinician or by patient with written asthma action plan (p.41), e.g. during viral infection or allergen exposure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Day-to-day adjustment by patient with as-needed low dose ICSformoterol for mild asthma, or low dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stepping down treatment when asthma is well-controlled

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consider stepping down treatment once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 3 months, to find the lowest treatment that controls both symptoms and exacerbations, and minimizes side-effects:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choose an appropriate time for step-down (no respiratory infection, patient not travelling, not pregnant)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assess risk factors, including history of previous exacerbations or emergency department visit, and low lung function

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Document baseline status (symptom control and lung function), provide a written asthma action plan, monitor closely, and book a follow-up visit

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Step down through available formulations to reduce the ICS dose by 25-50% at 2-3 month intervals (see Box 3-9 in full GINA 2020 report for details of how to step down different controller treatments)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If asthma is well-controlled on low dose ICS or LTRA, as-needed low dose ICS-formoterol is a step-down option based on two large studies with budesonide-formoterol in adults and adolescents (O'Byrne et al, 2018; Bateman et al, 2018) and an open-label study (Hardy et al, 2019). Smaller studies have shown that low dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (with combination or separate inhalers) is more effective as a stepdown strategy than SABA alone (Papi et al, NEJMed 2007; Martinez et al, Lancet 2011).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Do not completely stop ICS in adults or adolescents with asthma unless this is needed temporarily to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Make sure a follow-up appointment is arranged.

INHALER SKILLS AND ADHERENCE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Provide skills training for effective use of inhaler devices

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients (up to 80%) cannot use their inhaler correctly. This contributes to poor symptom control and exacerbations. Ensure effective inhaler use:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choose the most appropriate device for the patient before prescribing: consider medication, physical problems e.g. arthritis, patient skills, and cost; for ICS by pressurized metered dose inhaler, prescribe a spacer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Check inhaler technique at every opportunity. Ask the patient to show you how they use the inhaler. Check against a device-specific checklist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Correct using a physical demonstration, paying attention to incorrect steps. Check technique again, up to 2-3 times if necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Confirm that you have checklists for each of the inhalers you prescribe, and can demonstrate correct technique on them.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Check medication usage, from prescription date, inhaler date/dose counter, dispensing records

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Information about inhaler devices and techniques for their use can be found on the GINA website (www.ginasthma.org) and the ADMIT website (www.inhalers4u.org). Check and improve adherence with asthma medications At least 50% of adults and children do not take controller medications as prescribed. Poor adherence, with reliance on SABA reliever, contributes to poor symptom control and exacerbations. It may be unintentional (e.g. forgetfulness, cost, misunderstandings) and/or intentional (e.g. not perceiving the need for treatment, fear of side-effects, cultural issues, cost). Identify patients with adherence problems: · Ask an empathic question, e.g. ' Most patients don't take their inhaler exactly as prescribed. In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it? 0 days a week, or 1, or 2 days [etc]? ', or ' Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or night? ' COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ask about attitudes and beliefs about asthma and medications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Only a few adherence interventions have been studied closely in asthma and have improved adherence in real-world studies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Shared decision-making for medication and dose choice

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhaler reminders for missed doses

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATING MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exacerbation risk can be minimized by optimizing asthma medications, and by identifying and treating modifiable risk factors. Some examples of risk modifiers with consistent high quality evidence are:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guided self-management : self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF, a written asthma action plan (p.41), and regular medical review

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of a regimen that minimizes exacerbations : prescribe an ICScontaining controller, either daily, or, for mild asthma, as-needed ICSformoterol. For patients with 1 or more exacerbations in the last year, a low dose ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever regimen reduces the risk of severe exacerbations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of exposure to tobacco smoke

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Confirmed food allergy : appropriate food avoidance; ensure availability of injectable epinephrine for anaphylaxis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
School-based programs that include asthma self-management skills

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Referral to a specialist center , if available, for patients with severe asthma, for detailed assessment and consideration of add-on biologic medications and/or sputum-guided treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to medications, other therapies and strategies may be considered where relevant, to assist in symptom control and risk reduction. Some examples with consistent high quality evidence are:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Smoking cessation advice : at every visit, strongly encourage smokers to quit. Provide access to counselling and resources. Advise parents and carers to exclude smoking in rooms/cars used by children with asthma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical activity : encourage people with asthma to engage in regular physical activity because of its general health benefits. Provide advice about management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Investigation for occupational asthma : ask all patients with adult-onset asthma about their work history. Identify and remove occupational sensitizers as soon as possible. Refer patients for expert advice, if available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identify aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease , and before prescribing NSAIDs including aspirin, always ask about previous reactions .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although allergens may contribute to asthma symptoms in sensitized patients, allergen avoidance is not recommended as a general strategy for asthma. These strategies are often complex and expensive, and there are no validated methods for identifying those who are likely to benefit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
38

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some common triggers for asthma symptoms (e.g. exercise, laughter) should not be avoided, and others (e.g. viral respiratory infections, stress) are difficult to avoid and should be managed when they occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS OR CONTEXTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnancy : asthma control often changes during pregnancy. For baby and mother, the advantages of actively treating asthma markedly outweigh any potential risks of usual controller and reliever medications. Down-titration has a low priority in pregnancy, and ICS should not be stopped. Exacerbations should be treated aggressively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rhinitis and sinusitis : these often coexist with asthma. Chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis are associated with more severe asthma. Treatment of allergic rhinitis or chronic rhinosinusitis reduces nasal symptoms but does not improve asthma control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD): a history of exacerbation following ingestion of aspirin or other NSAIDs is highly suggestive. Patients often have severe asthma and nasal polyposis. Confirmation of the diagnosis of AERD may require challenge in a specialized center with resuscitation facilities, but avoidance of NSAIDs may be recommended on the basis of a clear history. ICS are the mainstay of treatment, but OCS may be required; LTRA may also be useful. Desensitization is sometimes effective but must be done under specialist care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity : document the diagnosis of asthma in the obese, to avoid over- or under-treatment. Include weight reduction in the treatment plan for obese patients with asthma; even 5-10% weight loss can improve asthma control. The elderly : comorbidities and their treatment may complicate asthma management. Factors such as arthritis, eyesight, inspiratory flow, and complexity of treatment regimens should be considered when choosing medications and inhaler devices. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): this is commonly seen in asthma. Symptomatic reflux should be treated for its general health benefits, but there is no benefit from treating asymptomatic reflux in asthma. Anxiety and depression : these are commonly seen in people with asthma, and are associated with worse symptoms and quality of life. Patients should be assisted to distinguish between symptoms of anxiety and of asthma. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Food allergy and anaphylaxis : food allergy is rarely a trigger for asthma symptoms. It must be assessed with specialist testing. Confirmed food allergy is a risk factor for asthma-related death. Good asthma control is essential; patients should also have an anaphylaxis plan and be trained in appropriate avoidance strategies and use of injectable epinephrine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
39

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery : whenever possible, good asthma control should be achieved preoperatively. Ensure that controller therapy is maintained throughout the perioperative period. Patients on long-term high dose ICS, or having more than 2 weeks' OCS in the past 6 months, should receive intra-operative hydrocortisone to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASTHMA FLARE-UPS (EXACERBATIONS)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A flare-up or exacerbation is an acute or sub-acute worsening in symptoms and lung function from the patient's usual status; occasionally it may be the initial presentation of asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For discussion with patients, the word 'flare-up' is preferred. 'Episodes', 'attacks' and 'acute severe asthma' are often used, but they have variable meanings, particularly for patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The management of worsening asthma and exacerbations should be considered as a continuum, from self-management by the patient with a written asthma action plan, through to management of more severe symptoms in primary care, the emergency department and in hospital. Identifying patients at risk of asthma-related death Patients with features indicating increased risk of asthma-related death should be flagged for more frequent review. These features include: · History : A history of near-fatal asthma (ever) requiring intubation and ventilation; hospitalization or emergency care for asthma in the last year · Medications : not currently using ICS, or with poor adherence with ICS; currently using or recently stopped OCS (an indication of recent severity); over-use of SABA, especially more than 1 canister per month · Comorbidities : history of psychiatric disease or psychosocial problems; confirmed food allergy in a patient with asthma COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance ICS-formoterol : Consider quadrupling maintenance ICS-formoterol dose (note maximum formoterol dose above).

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For children, 1-2 mg/kg/day up to 40mg, usually for 3-5 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tapering not needed if OCS has been given for less than 2 weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGING EXACERBATIONS IN PRIMARY OR ACUTE CARE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assess exacerbation severity while starting SABA and oxygen. Assess dyspnea (e.g. is the patient able to speak sentences, or only words), respiratory rate, pulse rate, oxygen saturation and lung function (e.g. PEF). Check for anaphylaxis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consider alternative causes of acute breathlessness (e.g. heart failure, upper airway dysfunction, inhaled foreign body or pulmonary embolism). Arrange immediate transfer to an acute care facility if there are signs of severe exacerbation, or to intensive care if the patient is drowsy, confused, or has a silent chest. For these patients, immediately give inhaled SABA, inhaled ipratropium bromide, oxygen and systemic corticosteroids. Start treatment with repeated doses of SABA (usually by pMDI and spacer), early OCS, and controlled flow oxygen if available. Check response of symptoms and saturation frequently, and measure lung function after 1 hour. Titrate oxygen if needed to maintain target saturation of 93-95% in adults and adolescents (94-98% in children 6-12 years). For severe exacerbations, arrange transfer to an acute care facility, add ipratropium bromide, and consider giving SABA by nebulizer. In acute care facilities, intravenous magnesium sulfate may be considered for inadequate response to intensive initial treatment. COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

REVIEWING RESPONSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitor patients closely and frequently during treatment, and titrate treatment according to response. Transfer to higher level care if worsening or failing to respond. Decide on need for hospitalization based on clinical status, symptoms and lung function, response to treatment, recent and history of exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before discharge, arrange ongoing treatment . For most patients, prescribe regular controller therapy (or increase current dose) to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. Continue increased controller doses for 2-4 weeks, and reduce reliever to as-needed dosing. Check inhaler technique and adherence. Provide an interim written asthma action plan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arrange early follow-up after any exacerbation, within 2-7 days (for children, within 1-2 working days). Consider early referral for specialist advice after hospitalization, or for patients with repeated ED presentations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Comprehensive post-discharge programs that include optimal controller management, inhaler technique, self-monitoring, written asthma action plan and regular review are cost-effective and are associated with significant improvement in asthma outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FOLLOW-UP AFTER AN EXACERBATION Exacerbations often represent failures in chronic asthma care, and they provide opportunities to review the patient's asthma management. All patients must be followed up regularly by a health care provider until symptoms and lung function return to normal. Take the opportunity to review: · The patient's understanding of the cause of the exacerbation · Modifiable risk factors for exacerbations, e.g. smoking · Understanding of purposes of medications, and inhaler technique skills · Adherence with ICS and OCS as this may fall rapidly after discharge. · Written asthma action plan - revise if necessary COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL- DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Referral for expert advice should be considered for patients who have been hospitalized for asthma, or who re-present for acute asthma care. Patients who have had more than 1 or 2 exacerbations/year despite Step 4 or 5 treatment should be referred (see GINA 2019 Pocket Guide on Difficult to Treat and Severe Asthma, www.ginasthma.org/severeasthma/).

| Assess risk factors at diagnosis and periodically, at least every 1-2 years, particularly for patients experiencing exacerbations. |                                |
| Having uncontrolled asthma symptoms is an important risk factor for exacerbations |                                |
| Additional potentially modifiable risk factors for exacerbations, even in patients with few asthma symptoms, include: |                                |
| • Medications: ICS not prescribed; poor adherence; incorrect inhaler technique; high SABA use (with increased mortality if >1x200-dose canister/month) |                                |
| • Comorbidities: obesity; chronic rhinosinusitis; GERD; confirmed food allergy; anxiety; depression; pregnancy |                                |
| • Exposures: smoking; allergen exposure if sensitized; air pollution |                                |
| • Setting: major socioeconomic problems                          |                                |
| • Lung function: low FEV 1, especially if <60% predicted; higher reversibility |                                |
| • Other tests: sputum/blood eosinophilia; elevated FeNO in allergic adults on ICS |                                |
| Other major independent risk factors for flare-ups (exacerbations) include: |                                |
| Having any of these risk factors increases the patient's risk of exacerbations even if they have few asthma symptoms |                                |

| Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (pMDIs or DPIs) e.g. beclometasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, mometasone, triamcinolone | ICS are the most effective anti-inflammatory medications for asthma. ICS reduce symptoms, increase lung function, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of exacerbations and asthma-related hospitalizations and death. ICS differ in their potency and bioavailability, but most of the benefit is seen at low doses (see Box 9 (p. 30 ) for low, medium and high doses of different ICS). OR Most patients using ICS do not experience side-effects. Local side-effects include oropharyngeal candidiasis and dysphonia; these can be reduced by use of a spacer with pMDIs, and rinsing with water and spitting out after inhalation. Long-term high doses increase the risk of systemic side-effects such as osteoporosis, cataract and glaucoma. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ICS and long-acting beta 2 agonist bronchodilator combinations (ICS-LABA) (pMDIs or DPIs) e.g. beclometasone- formoterol, budesonide- formoterol, fluticasone furoate-vilanterol, fluticasone propionate formoterol, fluticasone propionate-salmeterol, and mometasone- formoterol. | When a low dose of ICS alone fails to achieve good control of asthma, the addition of LABA to ICS improves symptoms, lung function and reduces exacerbations in more patients, more rapidly, than doubling the dose of ICS. Two regimens are available: low dose combination beclometasone or budesonide with low dose formoterol for maintenance and reliever treatment, and maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as reliever. Maintenance and reliever treatment with low dose ICS-formoterol reduces exacerbations compared with conventional maintenance therapy with SABA as reliever. (See section on Relievers below re as-needed ICS-formoterol in mild asthma). | The LABA component may be associated with tachycardia, headache or cramps. LABA and ICS are safe for asthma when used in combination. LABA should not be used without ICS in asthma (or in patients with asthma+COPD) due to increased risk of serious adverse outcomes. |
| Leukotriene modifiers (leukotriene receptor antagonists, LTRA) (tablets) e.g. montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast, zileuton | Target one part of the inflammatory pathway in asthma. Used as an option for controller therapy, particularly in children. When used alone: less effective than low dose ICS. When added to ICS: less effective than ICS-LABA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Few side-effects in placebo-controlled studies except elevated liver function tests with zileuton and zafirlukast. Risk of serious behaviour and mood changes, including in children, should be discussed with patients/parents.       |

| Anti-IL5 and anti-IL5R (anti-IL5 mepolizumab [SC, ≥12 years*] or reslizumab [IV, ≥18 years], or anti-IL5 receptor benralizumab | Add-on options for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma uncontrolled on high dose ICS-LABA*. For SC injection, self-administration may be permitted* | Headache, and reactions at injection site are common but minor.                                                          |
| Anti-IL4R (dupilumab, SC, ≥12 years*)                                      | An add-on option for patients with severe eosinophilic or Type 2 asthma uncontrolled on high dose ICS-LABA, or requiring maintenance OCS. Also approved for treatment of moderate-severe atopic dermatitis. Self-administration may be permitted* | Reactions at injection site are common but minor. Blood eosinophilia occurs in 4-13% of patients.                       |
| Systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension or IM or IV injection) e.g. prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone | Short-term treatment (usually 5-7 days in adults) is important in the treatment of severe acute exacerbations, with main effects seen after 4-6 hours. OCS therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing relapse. Tapering is required if treatment given for more than 2 weeks. Long-term treatment with OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma, but side-effects must be taken into account. | Short-term use: some adverse effects e.g. sleep disturbance, reflux, appetite increase, hyperglycemia, mood changes. Long-term use: limited by significant systemic adverse effects e.g. cataract, glaucoma, hypertension, diabetes, adrenal suppression osteoporosis. Assess for osteoporosis risk and treat. |

| Short-acting inhaled beta 2 -agonist bronchodilators (SABA)      | Inhaled SABAs provide quick relief of asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction including in acute exacerbations, and for pre-treatment of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. SABAs should be used only as-needed and at the lowest dose and frequency required. | Tremor and tachycardia are commonly reported with initial use of SABA. Tolerance develops rapidly with regular use. Excess use, or poor response indicate poor asthma control. |
| Low dose ICS-formoterol                                           | Low dose budesonide-formoterol or BDP formoterol is the reliever for patients prescribed as-needed controller therapy for mild asthma, where it substantially reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with SABA-only treatment. It is also used as the reliever for patients with moderate-severe asthma prescribed maintenance and reliever treatment, where it reduces the risk of exacerbations compared with maintenance-only treatment plus as-needed SABA, with similar symptom control. NOT COPY OR | As for ICS-LABA above. The maximum recommended dose in a single day for BDP-formoterol is a total of 48 mcg formoterol, and for budesonide-formoterol, 72 mcg of formoterol. DISTRIBUTE |
| Short-acting anticholinergics DO                                  | Long-term use: ipratropium is a less effective reliever medication than SABAs. Short-term use in severe acute asthma: inhaled ipratropium added to SABA reduces the risk of hospital admission MATERIAL-                               | Dryness of the mouth or a bitter taste.                                                             |
