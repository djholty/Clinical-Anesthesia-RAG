ABSTRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Background: The use of lung-protective ventilation (LPV) strategies may minimize iatrogenic lung injury in surgical patients. However, the identification of an ideal LPV strategy, particularly during one-lung ventilation (OLV), remains elusive. This study examines the role of ventilator management during OLV and its impact on clinical outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from the hospital electronic medical record and the Society of Thoracic Surgery database for subjects undergoing thoracic surgery with OLV between 2012 and 2014. Mean tidal volume (V T ) during twolung ventilation and OLV and ventilator driving pressure ( ∆ P) (plateau pressure - positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) were analyzed for the 1,019 cases that met the inclusion criteria. Associations between ventilator parameters and clinical outcomes were examined by multivariate linear regression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Results: After the initiation of OLV, 73.3, 43.3, 18.8, and 7.2% of patients received V T greater than 5, 6, 7, and 8  ml/kg predicted body weight, respectively. One hundred and eighty-four primary and 288 secondary outcome events were recorded. In multivariate logistic regression modeling, V T was inversely related to the incidence of respiratory complications (odds ratio, 0.837; 95% CI, 0.729 to 0.958), while ∆ P predicted the development of major morbidity when modeled with V T (odds ratio, 1.034; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.068).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conclusions: Low V T per se ( i.e. , in the absence of sufficient PEEP) has not been unambiguously demonstrated to be beneficial. The authors found that a large proportion of patients continue to receive high V T during OLV and that V T was inversely related to the incidence of respiratory complications and major postoperative morbidity. While low (physiologically appropriate) V T is an important component of an LPV strategy for surgical patients during OLV, current evidence suggests that, without adequate PEEP , low V T does not prevent postoperative respiratory complications. Thus, use of physiologic V T may represent a necessary, but not independently sufficient, component of LPV. (A nesthesiology 2016; 124:00-00)

M ECHANICAL ventilation is a necessary supportive therapy for critically ill patients and those undergoing major surgeries. However, phasic lung expansion under positive pressure subjects the lungs to a variety of potentially injurious stimuli, which can ultimately result in clinically significant ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Historically, approaches to intraoperative mechanical ventilation focused primarily on preventing intraoperative atelectasis and thus endorsed the use of high tidal volumes (V T s). 1 More recent experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated that a high V T approach to ventilator management can be injurious. The demonstration that high V T ventilation resulted in significantly  higher  mortality  in  patients  with  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS) 2 led  to  the  concept  of 'protective' ventilation strategies-that is, limiting alveolar overdistension  through  the  application  of  smaller  physiologic V T , and this approach represents the standard of care for critically ill patients with lung injury. Subsequent studies of  high V T ventilation  in  surgical  patients  at  risk  for  lung

processes, the nature of the planned surgery, loss of functional  lung  parenchyma  (pulmonary  resection),  and  the detrimental effects of mechanical ventilation, particularly one-lung  ventilation  (OLV).  Thus,  these  patients  could potentially  derive  even  greater  benefit  from  the  application of protective ventilation principles. Despite significant advances in our understanding of protective ventilation in patients subjected to two-lung ventilation (TLV), considerably  less  evidence  is  available  to  guide  management  of OLV, a technique commonly used to optimize operating conditions for thoracic surgery. In this study, we hypothesized  that  large V T s  and  higher  driving  pressures  during OLV are associated with an increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and overall morbidity after thoracic surgery.

Materials and Methods

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This study was approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Review Board for Health Sciences Research. Data were  retrospectively  collected  from  the  hospital  electronic medical record and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database  for  all  patients  undergoing  thoracic  surgery  with OLV between January 1, 2012, and June 30, 2014. Cases were  excluded  for  the  following  reasons:  age  less  than 18  yr  and  incomplete  height  and/or  weight  data.  A  total of  1,232  cases  met  the  initial  inclusion  criteria.  Additionally, we excluded cases due to reoperation, incomplete data, or  erroneous  duplication  of  case  records.  The  final  study cohort consisted of 1,019 cases. Patient demographics and characteristics included age, sex, height, weight, and medical  diagnoses.  Ventilator  parameters  recorded  during TLV and OLV included V T s,  PEEP ,  plateau  ventilator  pressures (P plat ), inspired oxygen fraction, expiratory carbon dioxide, and  respiratory  rate.  Ventilation  parameters  for TLV  were recorded for a 5-min epoch beginning 10 min before initiation of OLV. For OLV, the 5-min epoch began 10 min after the  initiation  of  OLV .  Standard  practice  during  the  study period  included  initiation  of  OLV  well  before  chest  wall incision. Thus, the transition from TLV to OLV in the current study generally reflects a transition to OLV well before opening of the pleura. Also, since the 5-min epoch started 10 min after the initiation of OLV, the nonventilated lung can be considered to be at least partially collapsed. V T was calculated  on  the  basis  of  actual  body  weight  (ABW)  and predicted body weight (PBW). PBW was calculated as follows: PBW for males = 50 kg + 2.3 kg × (Height [in] - 60); PBW for females = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg × (Height [in] - 60).

The STS database was used to obtain information for risk prediction  based  on  previously  published  thoracic  surgery risk models 7-9 and for specific information on postoperative outcomes.  Definitions  of  risk  predictors  and  specific  outcome events are as specified by the STS (STS GTSD Version  2.3,  updated  January  2015)  and  are  available via the following  link: http://www.sts.org/sites/default/files/documents/STSThoracicDataSpecsV2_3.pdf (accessed March

21,  2016).  The  candidate  risk  predictor-major  preoperative morbidity-was defined to include any patient with a preoperative diagnosis of coronary artery disease, congestive heart  failure,  peripheral  vascular  disease,  and/or  diabetes mellitus.

The  primary  outcome  was  respiratory complications, including tracheostomy, empyema requiring treatment, pneumonia,  reintubation,  initial  ventilator  support  greater  than 48 h, ARDS, bronchopleural fistula, pulmonary embolism, air leak greater than 5 days, atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy, and respiratory failure. The secondary complication was overall postoperative morbidity, including all respiratory complications listed above and major nonrespiratory complications such as unexpected return to the operating room, atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias requiring treatment, myocardial infarction, sepsis, renal failure, central neurologic event, unexpected intensive care unit admission, and anastomotic leak.

Driving  pressure  ( ∆ P)  and  static  compliance  (C s )  were defined  and  calculated  as  follows: ∆ P  =  P plat -  PEEP; C s = V T /(P plat - PEEP).

Statistical Analysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Summary and descriptive statistics were obtained for all clinical data. V T during TLV and OLV were calculated relative to ABW and PBW.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Categorical  variables  were  compared  using  chi-square tests, and continuous variables were compared across patient groups  using  means  and  the  two-sample t test.  Changes within  patients  from  TLV  to  OLV  were  compared  using paired t tests for continuous variables and McNemar test for discrete variables. Associations between continuous variables were assessed using Pearson correlation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The association of primary and secondary outcomes with patient and surgical characteristics was assessed using multivariate logistic regression. The regression models were constructed with variables identified a priori , based on previous studies, 7-9 as significant predictors of adverse outcomes after major  thoracic  surgeries.  Since  there  were  fewer  primary than secondary outcome events, adherence to the statistical rule allowing 10 outcome events per predictor mandated a reduced set of predictors in the primary outcome models. 10 Forced expiratory volume 1-s (FEV 1 ) data were missing in 37.4%  of  cohort  patients.  Since  spirometric  testing  data, including FEV 1 ,  are  more likely to be available in patients with  advanced  lung  disease  and/or  in  those  undergoing major pulmonary resection surgery, the absence of such data may itself represent a meaningful predictor. To control for potential confounding, we added a 'FEV 1 missing' indicator variable and replaced the missing FEV 1 data with zeros. This  approach  leaves  the  FEV 1 coefficient  identical  to  the condition  in  which  data  were  restricted  to  only  patients with nonmissing FEV 1 and separately models risk for those patients with missing FEV 1 data.

Baseline patient characteristics and procedural frequencies are shown in table 1. Figure 1 depicts the derivation of the final study cohort. Table 2 depicts ventilation parameters during TLV and OLV periods. Mean V T during TLV was 6.0 ml/kg ABW and 7.3 ml/kg PBW. After initiation of OLV, the mean V T decreased from 6.0 to 4.9 ml/kg ABW ( P < 0.001) and from 7.3 to 5.9 ml/kg PBW ( P < 0.001). P plat increased from 17.7 to 21.7 cm H 2 O ( P < 0.001), end-tidal carbon dioxide increased from 37.4 to 39.5 mmHg ( P <  0.001),  and  the frequency of cases utilizing PEEP greater than or equal to 5  cm H 2 O increased from 32.5 to 46.6% ( P < 0.001). Static compliance  decreased  during  this  transition  from  35.6  to 23.2 ml/cm H 2 O ( P < 0.001).

Mean PEEP values during OLV for the cohort was 4.2 cm H2 O (SD, 1.6 cm H 2 O), and this did not significantly differ between patients who developed complications (4.2 cm H2 O) and those who did not (4.2 cm H 2 O).

The frequency and types of major morbidities are shown in table 3. Multivariate logistic regression models for the primary  and  secondary  outcomes  are  shown  in  table  4. Generally, the patient and procedural risk predictors were consistent  with  previously  published  models  in  the  surgical  literature.  Risk  predictors  for  the  primary  outcome included  Zubrod  score,  preoperative  FEV 1 ,  thoracotomy incision,  and  segmentectomy/lobectomy  procedures.  Significant  predictors  for  the  secondary  outcome  include patient  age,  Zubrod  score,  induction  chemotherapy and/ or radiation, FEV 1 , thoracotomy incision, esophageal surgery, segmentectomy and lobectomy procedures, and blood product transfusion.

V T was inversely related to the incidence of the primary outcome-respiratory complications (odds ratio [OR], 0.837; 97.5% CI, 0.729 to 0.958). Thus, an increase in V T of 1  ml/kg PBW was associated with approximately a 16% reduction in the risk of respiratory complications. The relationship between V T and major morbidity was qualitatively similar  and  approached,  but  did  not  reach,  statistical  significance  ( P =  0.08).  The  inverse  relationship  between  V T and the primary outcome was also seen in model 2 (OR, 0.854; 97.5% CI, 0.748 to 0.973), which excluded ∆ P and included PEEP , although PEEP itself was not predictive for development of either outcome. Ventilator ∆ P was identified as  a  risk  factor  for  the  development of the secondary outcome (OR, 1.034; 97.5% CI, 1.001 to 1.068) in model 1. Each  unit  of  driving  pressure  (1  cm  H 2 O)  was  associated with a 3.4% increase in the risk of major morbidity. When modeled without V T (model 3), the effect of ∆ P approached,

Discussion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In this study cohort, we found that, during OLV, patients received higher V T when calculated on the basis of PBW as compared to ABW. In multivariate logistic regression models, V T was inversely related to the incidence of the primary outcome-respiratory complications. After controlling for  other  candidate  risk  predictors,  the  odds  of  developing  respiratory  complications  after  thoracic  surgery  were lower in patients ventilated with higher V T . Ventilator ∆ P was identified as a risk factor for the development of major morbid  complications  in  a  regression  model  inclusive  of V T . However, when modeled without V T , the effect of ∆ P approached, but did not reach, statistical significance.

Protective Ventilation in TLV and OLV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Studies of general surgery patients at high risk for postoperative respiratory complications have reported that lung-protective  ventilation  (LPV)  strategies  (lower V T s   and  higher PEEP) improve  clinical  outcomes  in  patients  with  preoperatively healthy lungs. 5,6 However, these studies have been criticized for the use of a control group with high V T s without the use of PEEP (zero end-expiratory pressure [ZEEP]). Although these studies may contribute to the identification of a protective ventilation strategy, they do not permit the elucidation  of  specific  factors  (V T ,  PEEP ,  airway  pressure, driving  pressure,  and  transpulmonary  pressure)  responsible for the observed clinical effect. More recent trials have

evaluated the role of V T and PEEP in lung protection via controlled modification of a single ventilator variable. T reschan et al. 11 demonstrated no differences in postoperative lung  function  in  upper  abdominal  surgery  patients  ventilated with a high (V T 12  ml/kg PBW) or low (V T 6  ml/kg PBW) V T strategy that included comparable levels of PEEP (5  cm H 2 O) in both groups.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  thoracic  surgery  patients,  OLV  contributes  to  the development of lung injury and the development of serious complications. Very  little  data  exist  to  specifically  support a particular approach to management of OLV with regard to clinical outcomes. Some but not all 12 prospective studies examining putative protective OLV (reduced V T and moderate PEEP) have demonstrated a reduction in pulmonary 13 or systemic inflammation, 3 extravascular lung water, 14,15 or pulmonary complications. 13,16 A  retrospective  study  following institution of a protective ventilation protocol incorporating reduced  V T ,  increased  PEEP ,  limited  ventilator  pressures, and  recruitment  maneuvers  during  OLV  for  lung  cancer  surgery  is  also  consistent  with  a  reduced  risk  of  acute lung injury. 17 In  retrospective  reviews  of  pneumonectomy, V T s, 17,18 ventilation  pressures, 19,20 and  duration  of  OLV 19 have been identified as risk factors for the development of lung injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to note that the results of the current study complement  rather  than  contradict  those  of  recent  highquality prospective trials. No studies have yet unambiguously demonstrated a specific advantage of low V T ventilation in the absence of other ventilatory strategies (PEEP , airway pressure  limitation,  and  recruitment  maneuvers),  and  it  is  not yet clear which ventilator parameters, if any, are most likely to predict adverse outcomes. That a low V T regimen per se is  not  inherently  protective  is  supported  by  a  high-quality study  of  surgical  patients,  which  demonstrated  no  difference in postoperative pulmonary function between high and low  V T regimens,  both  with  equivalent  moderate  levels  of PEEP 11 ; a large retrospective study of surgical patients, which demonstrated an association between low intraoperative V T with minimal PEEP and the subsequent risk of mortality 21 ; and the results of the present study, in which we found a similar inverse relationship between V T during OLV and the risk of complications after thoracic surgery. In our study cohort, as in the study by Levin et al. , 21 patients received low PEEP (4.2  cm H 2 O), which may have been insufficient to stabilize alveoli, reduce alveolar strain, and prevent atelectasis. While atelectasis is a significant consideration in all anesthetized surgical patients, it may be of greater importance during OLV, due to the use of higher inspiratory oxygen fractions (absorption atelectasis) and the greater potential for dependent lung compression  (compression  atelectasis).  Without  adequate PEEP , low V T during OLV may predispose to atelectasis and thus contribute to an increased risk of morbidity. Perioperative atelectasis results in a profoundly injurious inflammatory state  and  has  been  extensively  reviewed. 22 The  presence  of nonlobar atelectasis appears to act as a 'stress concentrator' and can even cause inflammation and alveolar injury in adjacent healthy lung parenchyma. 23 Furthermore, the presence of  atelectatic  regions  may  promote bacterial translocation 24 and increase the risk of pneumonia. 24-26

<!-- PAGE=? -->
That atelectasis contributes to the increased risk of morbidity in surgical patients ventilated with both low V T and low PEEP is supported by studies that demonstrate that the addition of significant PEEP is required to promote lung protection, improve lung function, and reduce the risk of postoperative complications during both TLV 5,6 and OLV. 3,13,16 The administration of either high PEEP 27 or  low V T 11 as  a  sole variable between groups has not been shown to be protective. The synergistic interaction between V T and PEEP has been described in experimental models that demonstrate an interdependence between these variables. 28,29 Moreover, although the use of all studied ventilation regimens resulted in substantial release of cytokines in an animal model of lung injury, the

combination of low V T and ZEEP resulted in a much higher mortality relative to groups that received either higher V T or PEEP , 30 suggesting that the nature, and perhaps severity, of lung  injury  resulting  from  atelectasis versus overdistension may  be  qualitatively  different.  The  ideal  amount  of  PEEP and the ideal approach to titrating PEEP in surgical patients have not yet been elucidated. However, the use of pulmonary mechanical parameters to identify intratidal recruitment during TLV suggests that 5 cm H 2 O PEEP may be insufficient to prevent this injurious process. 31 Likewise, titrating PEEP on the basis of static compliance during OLV resulted in the selection of a much higher PEEP (10 cm H 2 O) than is conventionally used by most practitioners. 32 Collectively,  these studies indicate that an effective LPV strategy results from the use of a physiologic (low) V T and sufficient PEEP to minimize both overdistension and atelectasis and suggest that the level of PEEP utilized in the current OLV study cohort and that of a previously reported TLV cohort 21 were insufficient to  prevent  the  pathophysiologic  processes  and  sequelae  of atelectasis and tidal recruitment/derecruitment.

An alternative explanation for the results of both studies is that unidentified patient factors, which may lead anesthesia care providers to use lower V T , might be independently linked  to  adverse  outcomes.  That  the  use  of  lower  V T in their  cohort  might  be  caused  by  reduced  compliance  and higher airway pressures was excluded by Levin et al. 21 based

on their inclusion of compliance and inspiratory pressure in the multivariate model. Our results paralleled those of Levin et al. V T and static compliance (V T /P plat - PEEP) were significantly ( P < 0.001) but not strongly correlated ( r = 0.467). However, inclusion of compliance in regression models for both the primary and secondary outcomes did not alter the primary findings. This indicates that, despite a correlation between V T and compliance, a low V T is an independent risk factor for the development of these adverse outcomes.

Practice Patterns of OLV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the present study examining single tertiary center practice patterns  of  OLV  for  thoracic  surgery,  we  found  that  relative to current recommendations, 33 practitioners continue to use high V T and low levels of PEEP . Moreover, high patient body mass index was associated with the use of larger V T upon normalization to PBW. After normalization to PBW, 73.3, 43.3, 18.8, and 7.2% of patients in the cohort were ventilated with V T greater than 5, 6, 7, and 8  ml/kg, respectively. These findings mirror those of large database studies of  surgical  patients,  which  demonstrated  that  patients  of short stature, high body mass index, and female sex received higher V T than the general population when normalized to predicted or ideal body weight. 21,34 This occurs presumably because anesthesia ventilators in general do not receive input regarding patient height or weight and because the selection of V T by the anesthesia care provider tends to inadequately compensate  for  the  discrepancy  between  ABW  and  PBW. Mean PEEP levels during OLV in our cohort were 4.2 cm H2 O and did not significantly differ between patients with and without major postoperative morbidity. During OLV, fewer than half (47%) of the patient cohort received PEEP greater than or equal to 5  cm H 2 O.

Pathophysiologic Determinants of VILI

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  important  to  point  out  that  much  of  the  contradictory  results  in  studies  of  VILI  in  critically  ill  and  surgical patients may arise from the imprecision inherent in the studied ventilator variables. Neither V T nor PEEP data contain information inherently important from a pathophysiologic standpoint. That is, the pathophysiologic effect of a delivered positive pressure tidal breath, if any, derives from the generated transpulmonary pressure (P L ) and its subsequent impact on tissue deformation (stress and strain). Dynamic alveolar strain (V T /functional residual capacity) defines the degree of alveolar tissue deformation between inspiration and expiration. Dynamic but not static alveolar strain is injurious in healthy pigs ventilated at total lung capacity 35 and appears to be the more important determinant of VILI. 36

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although ∆ P has been identified as a risk factor for the development of ARDS in a general surgical population, it has not been previously studied in thoracic surgery. 37 In  a large  retrospective  study  of  ARDS patients, Amato et  al. 38 identified ∆ P  but  not  V T as  the  ventilation  variable  that best  stratified  risk  of  mortality.  Using  double-stratification analysis, these authors were able to identify ∆ P as the only ventilator variable that predicted mortality in ARDS. Thus, ∆ P  may  serve  as  a  surrogate  for  dynamic  alveolar  strain. PEEP  is  important  to  the  extent  that  it  reduces ∆ P  and dynamic strain. That PEEP stabilizes the alveolus and can be  used  to  reduce  dynamic  strain  is  well  established  from animal 28 and clinical models. 35,36 The effect of ∆ P on major morbidity after OLV is not yet entirely clear. While ∆ P predicts major morbidity after thoracic surgery with OLV in a model including V T , the effect of ∆ P in a model without V T approaches, but does not reach, statistical significance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Limitations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are several limitations to this study. First, as a consequence of its retrospective design, the relationship between V T , driving  pressure,  and  subsequent  complications  cannot  yet be construed as causal. Second, in an effort to reduce the risk of inaccurate sampling of anesthetic/ventilator data (due to undocumented termination of OLV), we evaluated brief periods (5-min epochs) early during both TLV and OLV. This approach  was  mandated  by  the  absence  of  a  clearly  documented OLV end-time in approximately 40% of these cases. We believe that this approach is likely to result in a sampling of ventilator management data most representative of overall OLV since standard OLV management at our institution is established early during this period and early sampling of OLV data is most likely to avoid the undocumented reinstitution of TLV. Also, this is a single-center study and as such may not be reflective of practice patterns at other institutions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Finally, in this study as in that of Amato et al. , 38 statistical analysis of ∆ P and V T is limited by the mechanistic linkage between these variables. Although the correlation between these variables in the current study is low, there is nonetheless a concern about physiologic interdependence. That is, for a given respiratory system compliance, ∆ P should be proportional to V T . Thus, one would expect a qualitatively similar relationship between both variables and the studied outcome measures. However, we found that, while V T was inversely related to the primary outcome, ∆ P predicted major morbidity after thoracic surgery with OLV in a regression model including V T and approached, but did not reach, statistical significance in a model without V T . One explanation for this discrepancy relates to the variation in ∆ P resulting from a given V T based on the 'size' of functional lung parenchyma in a manner analogous to that of the 'baby lung' concept in  ARDS. 39 Significant  variation  in  nature  and  severity  of lung  diseases  and  resultant  effects  on  functional  lung  volume and elastance is expected in a large cohort of thoracic surgical patients. Severely diseased lungs, particularly those with restrictive disease, would be expected to exhibit a larger ∆ P for a given V T , while normal lungs would be expected to  exhibit  a  lesser  increase  in ∆ P.  A  larger V T delivered  to normal lung parenchyma (with a resultant lower ∆ P  relative to that of a diseased lung) could conceivably contribute to a reduced likelihood of atelectasis development, while a

low V T in such a patient would be more likely to promote atelectasis  and  related  morbidity.  The  discrepant  ability  of V T and ∆ P to predict postoperative morbidity in this cohort might then be explained by a differential potential of a given V T to cause overdistension or contribute to atelectasis based on functional lung volume and respiratory system elastance. Additionally,  since  composite  outcome  measures  used  in this study are not likely to reflect a single pathophysiologic mechanism,  it  is  also  possible  that  lower  V T and  higher ∆ P  might  differentially  promote  distinct  pathophysiologic pathways-atelectasis versus overdistension. Such a possibility  is  supported  by  experimental  evidence  that  while  high V T with ZEEP produces a similar cytokine response, low V T with ZEEP results in higher mortality. 30

Conclusions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical ventilation has the potential to adversely affect outcomes  in  surgical  patients.  These  risks  clearly  extend to  patients  subjected  to  OLV.  Protective  ventilation  with low V T and PEEP has been recommended by a number of experts, 33,40,41 but no standardized guidelines exist. While it is clear that a high V T regimen without PEEP is injurious, especially in high-risk patients and surgeries, low V T without adequate  PEEP  may  also  be  injurious. 21,30 It  is  important for the practitioner to note that we are not advocating the use of high or supraphysiologic V T .  High-quality prospective data strongly support the use of LPV in TLV and, to a lesser  extent,  in  OLV . While the ideal LPV regimen is yet to  be  completely  elucidated,  the  current  evidence  strongly indicates that protection from iatrogenic lung injury follows from the concomitant use of both physiologic (low) V T and sufficient  PEEP  to  prevent  overdistension,  atelectasis,  and tidal  recruitment/derecruitment  phenomena.  Ultimately, advances in our understanding of protective ventilation during OLV are likely to derive from well-designed randomized trials controlling for variables of inherent pathophysiologic significance.  The  control  of  P L , ∆ P,  and  alveolar  strain  in such trials of protective ventilation will be important for the identification of optimal ventilation strategies.
