PREAMBLE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) have translated  scientific  evidence  into  clinical  practice  guidelines (guidelines) with recommendations to improve cardiovascular health. These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide  a  cornerstone  for  quality  cardiovascular  care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of guidelines without commercial support, and members of each organization volunteer their time to the  writing  and  review  efforts.  Guidelines  are  official policy of the ACC and AHA.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intended Use

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practice  guidelines  provide  recommendations  applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular  disease.  The  focus  is  on  medical  practice  in  the United  States,  but  guidelines  developed  in  collaboration with other organizations can have a global impact. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or  payer  decisions,  they  are  intended  to  improve  patients' quality of care and align with patients' interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients  in  most,  but  not  all,  circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical Implementation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management in accordance with guideline recommendations is effective only when followed by both practitioners and  patients.  Adherence  to  recommendations  can  be enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methodology and Modernization

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) continuously reviews, updates, and modifies  guideline  methodology on the basis of published standards from organizations, including the Institute of Medicine, P-1, P-2 and on the basis of internal reevaluation. Similarly, the presentation and delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modified on the basis of evolving technologies and other factors to facilitate optimal dissemination of information to healthcare professionals at the point of care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Toward this goal, this guideline continues the introduction of an evolved format of presenting guideline recommendations and associated text called the 'modular knowledge chunk format.' Each modular 'chunk' includes  a  table  of  related  recommendations,  a  brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text, and when appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. References are provided at the end of the document in  their  respective  sections.  Additionally,  this  format will facilitate seamless updating of guidelines with focused updates as new evidence is published, as well as content tagging for rapid electronic retrieval of related recommendations on a topic of interest. This evolved approach  format  was  instituted  when  this  guideline was near completion; therefore, the present document represents a transitional format that best suits the text as  written.  Future  guidelines  will  fully  implement  this format, including provisions for limiting the amount of text in a guideline.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recognizing  the  importance  of  cost-value  considerations  in  certain  guidelines,  when  appropriate  and feasible, an analysis of the value of a drug, device, or intervention may be performed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology. P-3

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with full guideline revisions commissioned in approximately 6-year cycles. Publication of new, potentially practice-changing study results that are relevant to an existing or new drug, device, or management strategy will  prompt  evaluation  by  the  Task  Force,  in  consultation with the relevant guideline writing committee, to  determine  whether  a  focused  update  should  be commissioned. For additional information and policies regarding guideline development, we encourage readers  to  consult  the  ACC/AHA  guideline  methodology manual P-4 and other methodology articles. P-5-P-8

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selection of Writing Committee Members

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds. Writing committee  members  represent  different  geographic  regions, sexes, ethnicities, races, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice. The Task Force may also invite organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners, collaborators, or endorsers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Relationships With Industry and Other Entities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that guidelines are developed without bias or improper influence. The complete relationships with  industry  and  other  entities  (RWI)  policy  can  be found  online.  Appendix  1  of  the  present  document lists writing committee members' relevant RWI. For the purposes of full transparency, writing committee members' comprehensive disclosure information is available online. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online.

Evidence Review and Evidence Review Committees

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  developing  recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data. P-4-P-7  Literature searches focus on randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  but  also  include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only key references are cited.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  independent  evidence  review  committee  (ERC) is  commissioned when there are 1 or more questions deemed of utmost clinical importance that merit formal systematic review. The systematic review will determine which patients are most likely to benefit from a drug, device, or treatment strategy and to what degree. Criteria for commissioning an ERC and formal systematic review include: a) the absence of a current authoritative systematic review, b) the feasibility of defining the benefit and risk in a time frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, c) the relevance to a substantial number of patients, and d) the likelihood that the findings can be  translated  into  actionable  recommendations.  ERC members may include methodologists, epidemiologists, healthcare  providers,  and  biostatisticians.  The  recommendations developed by the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked with 'SR.'

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guideline-Directed Management and Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The term guideline-directed management and therapy (GDMT)  encompasses  clinical  evaluation,  diagnostic testing,  and  pharmacological  and  procedural  treatments.  For  these  and  all  recommended  drug  treatment regimens, the reader should confirm the dosage by reviewing product insert material and evaluate the treatment regimen for contraindications and interactions. The recommendations are limited to drugs, devices, and treatments approved for clinical use in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  Class  of  Recommendation  (COR)  indicates  the strength of the recommendation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the quality of scientific evidence that supports the intervention on the basis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources (Table 1).

This  document was reviewed by 3 official reviewers each  nominated  by  the  ACC  and  AHA,  and  1  to  2 reviewers  each  from  the  AATS,  ASE,  HRS,  ISACHD, SCAI, STS; and 32 individual content reviewers. Reviewers' RWI information was distributed to the writing  committee  and  is  published  in  this  document (Appendix 2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This document was approved for publication by  the  governing  bodies  of  the  ACC  and  the  AHA and endorsed by the AATS, ASE, HRS, ISACHD, SCAI, and STS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1.4. Scope of the Guideline

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  2018  ACHD  guideline  is  a  full  revision  of  the '2008 ACC/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Adults with Congenital Heart Disease,' S1.4-1  which was the  first  US  guideline  to  be  published  on  the  topic. This  revision  uses  the  2008  ACHD  guideline  as  a framework and incorporates new data and growing ACHD expertise  to  develop  recommendations.  Congenital  heart  disease  (CHD)  encompasses  a  range of  structural  cardiac  abnormalities  present  before birth  attributable  to  abnormal  fetal  cardiac  development  but  does  not  include  inherited  disorders  that may have cardiac manifestations such as Marfan syndrome or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Also not included are anatomic variants such as patent foramen ovale.  Valvular  heart  disease  (VHD)  may  be  congenital,  so  management  overlaps  with  the  '2014  AHA/ ACC Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Valvular  Heart  Disease,' S1.4-2 particularly  for  bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease. Where overlap exists, this document focuses on the diagnosis and treatment of congenital valve disease when it differs from acquired valve  disease,  whether  because  of  anatomic  differences, presence of concomitant lesions, or differences to consider given the relatively young age of patients with ACHD. This guideline is not intended to apply to children (<18 years of age) with CHD or adults with acquired VHD, heart failure (HF), or other cardiovascular diseases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  prevalence  of  ACHD  is  growing  because  of the  success  of  pediatric  cardiology  and  congenital cardiac  surgery  in  diagnosing  and  treating  congenital  heart  defects  in  children.  Improved  survival  to adulthood is most striking for those with the most severe disease, with survival to age 18 years now expected  for  90%  of  children  diagnosed  with  severe CHD. S1.4-3-S1.4-5   Patients  with  ACHD  are  a  heterogeneous population, both in underlying anatomy and physiology,  as  well  as  surgical  repair  or  palliation. Consequently, although the prevalence of ACHD is increasing, the population of patients with a given congenital abnormality or specific repair may be relatively small. S1.4-3,S1.4-6-S1.4-8

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with CHD are not cured of their disease after  successful  treatment  in  childhood.  Almost  all patients  with  ACHD  will  have  sequelae  of  either their  native  CHD  or  its  surgical  repair  or  palliation, although these sequelae can take decades to manifest.  The  heterogeneity  of  the  population  and  the long, symptom-free intervals constrain the ability to generate  data  applicable  across  the  population  of ACHD or  to  adults  with  specific  lesions  or  repairs. Despite the difficulty in studying ACHD populations, there is a growing body of high-quality data in these patients  to  guide  the  care  of  this  relatively  'new' population and, whenever feasible, these data were used  to  develop  recommendations.  Recommendations are made based on the available data; however, when important clinical issues lacked data, first principles, extrapolation from data in other populations, and expert consensus are used to guide care. Patients with ACHD may have concomitant disease to which other existing guidelines apply, such as coronary artery disease, HF, and arrhythmias. The data from acquired heart disease populations may apply to some patients  with  ACHD,  and  those  circumstances  are acknowledged in these recommendations and referenced accordingly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with ACHD who are cared for in ACHD centers have better outcomes than those cared for in centers without ACHD expertise, S1.4-9 and this need for specialized care is noted throughout the guideline. These recommendations  are  intended  to  provide  guidance to a wide variety of providers caring for patients with ACHD, including general, pediatric, and ACHD cardiologists, as well as surgeons, primary care providers, and other healthcare providers.

2. BACKGROUND AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.1. Anatomic and Physiological Terms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The International Society for Nomenclature of Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease (also known as the Nomenclature Working Group) defined, codified, mapped, and  archived  examples  of  nomenclatures  and  developed standards  for  terminology. S2.1-1-S2.1-5 The  International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code (IPCCC) nomenclature for anatomic lesions and repairs is used in this guideline (http://ipccc.net). S2.1-6

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.2. Severity of ACHD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  a  patient  with  CHD,  severity  of  disease  is  determined by native anatomy, surgical repair, and current physiology. Prior documents, including the 2008 ACHD guideline, S2.2-1 relied  primarily  on  anatomic  classifications to rank severity of disease. However, patients with the same underlying anatomy may have very different repairs  and  experienced  variable  physiological  consequences of those repairs. For example, a patient with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) after a valve-sparing primary repair may have excellent biventricular function with normal exercise capacity and no arrhythmias, whereas another patient of the same age with TOF may have had palliative  shunting  followed  by  a  transannular  patch repair resulting in severe pulmonary regurgitation (PR) with  right  ventricular  (RV)  enlargement,  biventricular dysfunction, and ventricular tachycardia (VT). To categorize disease severity in CHD in a more comprehensive way, the writing committee developed an ACHD Anatomic  and  Physiological  (AP)  classification  system  (Tables 3 and 4) that incorporates the previously described CHD anatomic variables as well  as  physiological  variables, many of which have prognostic value in patients with ACHD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.3. The ACHD AP Classification

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The ACHD AP classification (Tables 3 and 4), newly elaborated in this guideline, is intended to capture the complexity  of  ACHD  anatomy  and  physiology,  which  are not always correlated. Certain anatomic abnormalities of clinical importance are shared across diagnoses (eg, aortic  enlargement),  which  may  be  found  in  patients with BAV, coarctation of the aorta (CoA), transposition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of the great arteries, and TOF, amongst others. In every patient, anatomic and physiological variables should be considered. In using Tables 3 and 4, a patient should be classified based on the 'highest' relevant anatomic or physiological feature. For example, a normotensive patient with repaired CoA, normal exercise capacity, and normal end-organ function would be ACHD AP classification IIA, whereas an otherwise similar patient with ascending aortic diameter of 4.0 cm would be ACHD AP classification IIB, and if moderate aortic stenosis were also present, the ACHD AP classification would be IIC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  ACHD  may  have  baseline  exercise limitations, cyanosis, end-organ dysfunction, or other clinically important comorbidities related to their CHD. They are also at risk of HF, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death (SCD), and development or progression of cardiac  symptoms  such  as  dyspnea,  chest  pain,  and exercise intolerance. Concomitant valvular disease or aortic pathology may be present. There are growing data  regarding  the  prognostic  implications  of  these variables  in  patients  with  ACHD,  but  not  the  abundance  of  data  available  for  patients  with  acquired heart disease. S2.3-1-S2.3-16

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The variables forming part of the ACHD AP classification (Table 3) were selected because data exist suggesting  their  importance  in  prognosis,  management, or  quality  of  life  (QoL).  As  new  data  become  available, we expect changes in the relative weights attributed to the components of the ACHD AP classification and perhaps new components, resulting in a scheme that  ever  more  precisely  tracks  overall  severity  of  disease  and  need  for  more  or  less  intensive  follow-up and management.

Similar  to  the  New  York  Heart  Association  (NYHA) classification  of  functional  status,  patients  may  move from one ACHD AP classification to another over time. If clinical status worsens, the classification will change to a higher severity group, but improvement in status, for example after an intervention such as valve replacement or control of arrhythmia, can result in change to a lower severity classification. Such movement among classes is unlike the AHA HF A to D classification, S2.3-17 in which patients move in only one direction. This ACHD AP classification is used throughout this document, particularly when considering follow-up visits and need for testing. As the ACHD AP classification worsens because of changes in physiology (eg, development of arrhythmias, HF, end-organ disease), the nature and frequency of recommended follow-up visits and testing will also change,  adapting  to  the  patient's  changing  circumstance instead of depending solely on a description of anatomic disease, which may not adequately discriminate physiological changes that alter severity over time.

Some patients with ACHD may have substantial acquired comorbidities unrelated to CHD and, as a consequence, their follow-up strategies might be more appropriately based on other existing guidelines for acquired heart disease. For example, an 80-year-old patient who

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.1. ACHD Program

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with complex CHD have generally better outcomes when cared for in an integrated, collaborative, and multidisciplinary program. S3.1-1  Many medical issues in patients with ACHD involve cardiac sequelae, and the diagnosis and management may require cardiac  anesthesiologists,  electrophysiologists,  and  interventional  cardiologists;  imaging  services  such  as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)/cardiac computed  tomography  (CCT);  and  pulmonary  hypertension  services  with  expertise  in  ACHD  (Table 5).  Appropriate  specialty  care  must  be  available  to address pregnancy, acquired cardiovascular disease, and acute noncardiac illness complicating CHD, management of which is frequently more complicated in patients with ACHD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  individual  providers  may  be  community-based  affiliates,  ACHD  programs  are  inpatient, outpatient, and hospital-based with staffing and expertise  available  on-site  or  accessible  when  needed (Table 5).

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As patients with ACHD grow beyond the pediatric age group,  continued  access  to  specialized  cardiovascular care presents several challenges:

 Lack  of  guided  transfer  from  pediatric  to  adult care;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Insufficient availability of ACHD programs;

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many patients with CHD face gaps in care during and after adolescence. S3.2-2  Common reasons include lack of knowledge regarding need for follow-up, inability to find specialized providers, insurance issues, and feeling well. S3.2-1 Patients with gaps in care are more  likely  to  develop  medical  problems  requiring  intervention  than  those  receiving  continuous care. S3.2-3,S3.2-4 Canadian patients with CHD in specialized care programs had lower mortality than those in  centers  without  ACHD  expertise. S3.2-5 Improving transition programs and recognizing the importance of  long-term care will hopefully improve access to specialty  care.  Insurance  barriers  and  lack  of  specialty providers for the large number of patients are issues; thus, relationships with regulatory agencies to address these challenges are important.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients with ACHD, particularly those with more severe CHD, cared for in specialized centers have lower mortality than those managed without specialized care. S3.3-1 Although clinical practice guidelines can be helpful, many management decisions for patients with ACHD must be based on insufficient data or care guidelines and require clinical experience often involving multiple members of an ACHD team. Patients with complex anatomic and  physiological  forms  of  ACHD  may  need approaches  to  evaluation  and  treatment  that

<!-- PAGE=? -->
differ  from  those  applicable  to  adults  without ACHD who have valve disease, HF, or arrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From a practical perspective, it may be difficult to identify clinicians with expertise in ACHD, and expertise in ACHD varies across medical and surgical specialties. Some specialties, such as cardiology and congenital heart surgery, have defined ACHD fellowship training and board certification, whereas for others, ACHD expertise is gained by focused experience during training and practice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 2012, the American Board of Medical Specialties  approved  ACHD  as  a  subspecialty  of  internal  medicine  ('adult')  cardiology  and  pediatric  cardiology.  Therefore,  for  cardiologists,  one marker of ACHD expertise is board eligibility/board certification in ACHD. There are expert ACHD clinicians  who  are  not  board-certified,  including those  whose  expertise  was  acquired  before  the development of formal certification programs and those trained outside the United States who may also have different pathways to achieve ACHD expertise. Expertise in the surgical management of patients  with  ACHD  may  be  identified  through board  eligibility/board  certification  in  congenital heart  surgery.  There  are  expert  ACHD  surgeons who are not board-certified, including those surgeons trained in other countries who are not eligible for certification in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Specific  ACHD  training  options  are  not  generally  available  for  cardiac  anesthesiologists,  but many of them develop expertise through training in pediatric anesthesiology, cardiac anesthesiology, mentoring, and practice experience. Other providers involved in the care of patients with ACHD (eg, obstetricians,  pulmonologists,  radiologists,  nurse practitioners, physician assistants) derive expertise from  training  and/or  practice.  Individual  providers may gain ACHD expertise in a specific area or discipline, such as intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or interpretation of CMR.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients  with  ACHD  who  are  undergoing  invasive  cardiovascular  procedures  in  specialized ACHD  centers  generally  have  better  outcomes, including survival, than those managed in other care settings. S3.3-2 Special attention is required to ensure appropriate periprocedural care, including identification  of  procedure-related  risk  factors and availability of ancillary imaging. S3.3-3-S3.3-10

CLINICAL STATEMENTS AND GUIDELINES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.4.1. Electrocardiogram

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The ECG is an essential part of a complete cardiovascular  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  ACHD, similar to elements of the physical examination. Regardless of anatomic diagnosis, it is important to obtain an ECG at baseline for comparison to any subsequently obtained ECG, because an abnormal baseline ECG is expected in many forms of CHD, particularly those who have undergone surgical repair. A follow-up ECG is recommended in  specific  lesions  and  in  the  setting  of  new  or worsening congestion or low cardiac output syndrome (Table 7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Asymptomatic arrhythmias seen in patients with ACHD  may  be  associated  with  development  of symptoms  and  increased  risk  of  death,  and  are more  common  in  particular  lesions  or  repairs. Bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias may occur, with some requiring treatment even when asymptomatic.  For  example,  sinus  node  dysfunction  is common  in  patients  with  atrial  switch  repairs  of transposition  of  the  great  arteries  (TGA),  whereas complete heart block is seen in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries  (CCTGA)  or  late  after  atrioventricular  septal defect  (AVSD)  repair,  especially  in  those  patients with transient postoperative heart block. S3.4.1-1-S3.4.1-3 Some of  these  events  have  occurred  as  late  as 15 years after surgery. The atrioventricular node is  typically  displaced  inferiorly  in  AVSD,  which is  associated  with  relative  hypoplasia  of  the  left anterior fascicle. S3.4.1-4 Atrial tachyarrhythmias are  common  in  atrial  switch  repairs  of  TGA, Fontan  repairs,  and  Ebstein  anomaly. S3.4.1-5-S3.4.1-7 Thus, baseline and periodic screening for asymptomatic arrhythmias with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring is advised to ensure that asymptomatic arrhythmias that would warrant a change in therapy are not present, S3.4.1-8  acknowledging  the  limitations  of  monitoring  over  short

<!-- PAGE=? -->
periods  of  time.  Any  symptoms  of  arrhythmia should prompt investigation to establish an accurate diagnosis and direct subsequent therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.4.2. Ionizing Radiation Principles

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low-dose  ionizing  radiation  is  a  known  carcinogen,  and  certain  levels  of  exposure  similar  to medical exposure have been associated with later malignancy. S3.4.2-5,S3.4.2-6   Patients  with  ACHD  have multiple potential exposures to low-dose ionizing radiation  throughout their  lifetimes  from  cardiac catheterizations, computed tomographic (CT) scans,  nuclear  perfusion  scans,  stress  tests,  and chest x-rays. It remains unclear whether there is an increased risk of malignancy among patients with ACHD, but the exposure levels from multiple procedures are in the range of concern. Every effort should  be  made  to  use  tests  without  radiation whenever possible or to select protocols with the lowest possible doses of radiation compatible with securing the needed clinical information.

 For  patients  with  ACHD in whom abnormalities and changes that may be identified on echocardiography (eg, valvular or ventricular function or pulmonary pressures) commonly influence management decisions; echocardiography is an indispensable  tool  in  the  initial  and  serial  follow-up evaluation. TTE is also valuable in the initial and serial evaluation of patients without symptoms or changes in examination (Table 8).

3.4.4. CMR Imaging

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 CMR plays a valuable role in assessment of RV size and function, because it provides data that are reproducible and more reliable than data obtained with  alternative  imaging  techniques. S3.4.4-1-S3.4.4-4 Real-time 3-dimensional (3D) echocardiography is an emerging technique that shows some promise for replacing CCT and even CMR for serial studies, especially when focusing on ventricular volumes and intracardiac structures only, and if reasonably complete data sets can be obtained. S3.4.4-11

<!-- PAGE=? -->
require  modification  of  plans  during  acquisition  of  images,  as  well  as  specialized  skills  in interpretation. S3.4.4-12,S3.4.4-13 Thus,  a  dedicated  CMR service is integral to an ACHD program. S3.4.4-4,S3.4.4-5 CMR can provide exquisite anatomic detail and unique physiological information in many forms of  CHD.  It  has  a  particularly  important  role  in the  assessment  of  extracardiac  cardiovascular defects  (eg,  CoA,  aortic  aneurysm,  and  abnormalities of the thoracic arterial  and  venous anatomy and connections). S3.4.4-6,S3.4.4-7 The elucidation  of  uncommon, complex forms and variations of CHD is routinely facilitated by a CMR study. S3.4.4-5   Contraindications  to  CMR  are  common in patients with ACHD, so they should be sought and confirmed. However, the high value of  serial  CMR  has  encouraged  modification  of newer  pacemakers,  leads,  and  other  devices and  imaging  protocols  to  facilitate  imaging  in an  expanding  subset  of  patients  with  ACHD who  have  had  previous  instrumentation.  If  a contraindication  is  confirmed,  alternative  forms of imaging, especially CCT, can obtain much of the  information  otherwise  obtained  from  CMR and  some  unique  information  not  provided  by CMR. S3.4.4-14   However,  CCT  has  the  disadvantage of substantial patient exposure to ionizing radiation, especially when serial studies are contemplated over a lifetime. S3.4.4-9  Real-time 3D echocardiography shows promise for replacing CCT and even CMR for serial studies, especially when focusing on ventricular volumes and intracardiac structures only, and if reasonably complete data sets can be obtained (Tables 8 and 9). S3.4.4-11,S3.4.4-15

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.4.5. Cardiac Computed Tomography

 CMR  has  unique  value  in  the  assessment  and serial follow-up of patients with ACHD, because it offers unrestricted access to the heart and great vessels  noninvasively  and  without  ionizing  radiation.  The  complexity  and  variability  of  lesions, repairs,  and sequelae in CHD constrain the use of standard protocols and sequences, and often

The  most  important  disadvantage  of  CCT  (including CT angiography) as an imaging technique is  the  associated  exposure  to  ionizing  radiation. This  is  especially  problematic  in  patients  with ACHD  in  whom  serial  assessments  are  contemplated over a lifetime. S3.4.5-1  Gating CCT to the ECG allows  image  acquisition  during  multiple  phases of  the  cardiac  cycle,  thereby  providing  cine  imaging and the ability to select phases of the cycle of  specific  interest  (usually  end-systole  and  enddiastole), at the cost of increased radiation dose. Electrocardiographic gating is generally unnecessary when the focus is assessment of extracardiac vascular  structures,  which  can  consequently  be imaged using substantially lower doses of ionizing radiation. Ongoing development of protocols and equipment  that  reduce  radiation  exposure  are welcome advances. S3.4.5-2

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.4.6. Cardiac Catheterization

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Cardiac  catheterization  remains  a  standard  tool when  diagnosis,  prognosis,  or  management  require a) more precise definition of anatomy than is achievable via advanced noninvasive imaging (eg, structures  with  low  flow  or  those  shielded  from other techniques), b) calculation of pressures and resistances, or c) physiological or anatomic simulation to allow additional calculation or anatomic visualization.  Cardiac  catheterization  can  provide unique information not reliably available from other diagnostic modalities (eg, direct pressure measurement in a vessel or chamber, determination of pulmonary artery (PA) pressures and resistance, and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
optimal imaging of vessels in which flow is compromised). Procedures should be planned with appreciation of the anatomy and physiology likely to be encountered, including sequelae and residua of prior surgery and interventions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The expansion of interventional catheter techniques has dramatically expanded possibilities for interventional treatment for an increasing number of conditions. Operators require specialized training and expertise in ACHD. In addition, catheterization laboratories specially equipped with devices and tools used in ACHD intervention are needed and personnel trained in their use. Such equipment and expertise differ from those found in catheterization laboratories devoted primarily to diagnostic catheterization and coronary interventions.

 For patients at low or intermediate risk of obstructive  coronary  disease,  CT  coronary  angiography can  be  an  alternative  to  cardiac  catheterization for assessing coronary artery course and patency.

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients  with  ACHD  often  overestimate  their physical capabilities and underreport limitations. In  contrast  to  patients  with  acquired  heart  disease,  patients  with  ACHD  may  never  have  experienced 'normal' function. Decline in physical capacity  may  occur  imperceptibly  over  many years. S3.4.7-1,S3.4.7-2  Consequently, tools more precise than patient history are necessary for evaluation and serial follow-up of functional capacity. CPET provides  objective,  reproducible,  and  repeatable assessment of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems and has been shown to have prognostic value in patients with a wide variety of ACHD conditions. S3.4.7-1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 In severely impaired patients with ACHD, or those who cannot complete CPET for other reasons, the 6-minute walk test provides a more limited set of data, which nevertheless has prognostic value beyond history alone. S3.4.7-3,S3.4.7-4

Preparing a patient for independent cardiac care is an ongoing process that should start in early adolescence if not sooner S3.5-3  and may extend beyond 18 years of age in many patients. The recommendation and goals for transition and transition education have been described and include verbal, written, and experiential efforts to teach patients and families about their specific heart disease, expectations, and concerns regarding CHD, as well as  skills  to  navigate  the  healthcare  system  as  an adult. S3.5-4 Lack  of  education  about  the  need  for transition and lifelong cardiac care leads to gaps in  care  that  can  result  in  increased  hospitalizations, need for urgent intervention, and increased morbidity. S3.5-5,S3.5-6 A structured approach to transition education improves health related knowledge and self-management.

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Historically,  guidelines  for  physical  activity  among  patients  with  CHD  have  focused  on  restriction,  rather than promotion of activity. S3.6-14,S3.6-15 Because  of  fears of adverse events such as SCD or aortic dissection, rec- ommendations derived from those that apply to competitive  sports S3.6-16 have  been  applied  to  recreational activities  despite  the  absence  of  evidence  on  the  risk or safety of moderate activity. The 2015 'Eligibility and Disqualification Recommendations for Competitive Athletes With Cardiovascular Abnormalities: Task Force 4:  Congenital  Heart  Disease' S3.6-14   does  work  toward encouraging  participation  and  shared  decision-making  with  patients  regarding  competitive  sports  participation.  Most  patients  with  ACHD  can  safely  engage in regular, moderate physical activity. A few conditions, such  as  systemic  ventricular  systolic  dysfunction,  systemic  ventricular  outflow  tract  obstruction,  hemodynamically  significant  arrhythmias,  or  aortic  dilation, warrant more cautious recommendations. S3.6-17

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Physical activity is widely recognized as being beneficial to the physical and mental health of those who participate. S3.6-2-S3.6-4 There is conflicting evidence regarding physical activity levels in patients with  CHD,  with  some  suggesting  the  tendency for less activity S3.6-5,S3.6-9  and a greater prevalence of  obesity S3.6-1 than  in  the  general  population. Studies describe the beneficial effects and safety of exercise programs for patients across the spectrum of CHD. S3.6-18,S3.6-19  Activity recommendations should  be  individualized  based  on  the  patient's clinical status and their interests. S3.6-20

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 There  is  evidence  that  exercise  capacity  varies among congenital heart defects, with declining capacity (generally) as complexity increases. S3.6-10,S3.6-11 Knowledge  of  the typical exercise capacity for patients with a specific lesion is important when making appropriate activity recommendations. S3.6-10   Self-directed  activity  is usually at 40% to 60% of maximal exercise capacity, whereas fitness training occurs at 60% to 80% of maximal capacity. S3.6-20   Exercise  capacity is  defined  in  relation  to  maximal  oxygen  consumption. The writing committee recognizes that not all ACHD centers will have the resources to conduct CPET, which is the preferred method of evaluation.  If  CPET  cannot  be  performed,  other exercise  tests  using  an  established  treadmill  or bicycle ergometer protocol are an acceptable alternative for assessing exercise capacity, recognizing that valuable information may be unavailable compared with CPET.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 As with other populations of cardiac patients, inactivity  leads  to  reduced  exercise  performance. Regular  exercise  and  cardiac  rehabilitation  may improve exercise capacity and HF symptoms, and ought to be encouraged. S3.6-6,S3.6-7,S3.6-21,S3.6-22

Mental health and neurodevelopmental issues are common in patients with ACHD and may significantly affect QoL.  Neurodevelopmental  abnormalities  are  more  frequently seen in children who have complex disease, complex surgical repairs, and other characteristics. S3.7-10-S3.7-12 There  is  extensive  literature  in  the  pediatric  population on the frequency and importance of neurodevelopmental  abnormalities,  However,  many  adults  may  not  have been  evaluated  as  children  in  accordance  with  current diagnostic and treatment strategies. S3.7-13,S3.7-14   Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as impairment of cognition, social skills and communication, and attention disorders, are often underrecognized even though appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation may be beneficial in optimizing function and QoL. An AHA scientific statement describes the common neurodevelopmental disorders affecting children with CHD and may inform neurodevelopmental issues related to adults with CHD. S3.7-13

3.8. Endocarditis Prevention

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with ACHD have an increased risk of developing  infective  endocarditis  (IE). S3.8-1,S3.8-2   The  most  common pathogens responsible for IE include Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus species, and Enterococcus species. Despite advances in antimicrobial therapy and surgical techniques, IE remains a condition associated with  significant  morbidity  and  mortality.  Numerous guidelines are available with recommendations on the prevention and diagnosis of IE. S3.8-3-S3.8-5 These guidelines include consistent descriptions of the patients at highest risk of adverse effects from endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis continues to be recommended for patients with high-risk characteristics, which are often found in patients with ACHD. S3.8-2  These patients include:

Patients with genetic syndromes may have phenotypic manifestations and associated CHD as clinical features of  the  genetic  abnormality.  An  underlying  chromosomal abnormality exists in at least 10% of infants with CHD and may not have been previously tested in patients with ACHD. S3.9-3 Clinicians caring for patients with ACHD should recognize the potential for undiagnosed genetic  abnormalities  that  may  affect  overall  health (Table 10) and pursue appropriate evaluation.

  Several forms of CHD may be associated with underlying  genetic  syndromes  (Table  10).  Some  genetic syndromes may not be phenotypically apparent in adults, and prior childhood genetic workup may  not  be  readily  available;  therefore,  genetic syndromes may be missed in patients with ACHD. Many  of  these  syndromes  may  have  important clinical comorbidities, including but not limited to learning disabilities, psychiatric conditions, and reproductive  disorders.  Up  to  5%  of  children  born with CHD have DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion), the congenital heart defects most commonly associated  being  those  of  conotruncal  origin.  DiGeorge syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition. Therefore, genetic testing is reasonable for patients with ACHD with conotruncal defects for recognition and management of comorbidities and for counseling on the potential risk of recurrence in offspring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  ACHD  can  acquire  other  cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, vascular disease, stroke, and HF . S3.10-1-S3.10-3

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  impact  of  acquired  heart  disease  is  increasing  as the lifespan of patients with ACHD extends. Myocardial infarction  is  one  of  the  leading  contributing  causes  of death for late surviving adults with acyanotic CHD. S3.10-4 Major adverse cardiac events, such as HF, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery,  malignant  arrhythmia,  cardiac  shock,  and  placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator  (ICD), are also quite prevalent. S3.10-5,S3.10-6 Overall, cardiovascular reasons account for approximately 77% of all deaths in patients with ACHD, with approximately half attributable to chronic HF. S3.10-7 Evaluation for acquired cardiac conditions is warranted in patients with risk factors, although results  of  testing  (eg,  stress  perfusion  studies)  should account  for  preexisting  abnormalities  caused  by  CHD, recognizing prior interventions can mimic abnormalities otherwise suggestive of acquired heart disease. S3.10-8

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with ACHD, prevention and treatment of conditions predisposing to acquired cardiovascular disease such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia,  and/or  similar  comorbidities  are  important.  Given  the  increased  risk  of  acquired  cardiovascular  disease  with  age,  promoting  a  healthy  lifestyle is important in all patients with ACHD, although there are not data demonstrating the effects of risk reduction on clinical outcomes specific to the ACHD population.

Patients with ACHD are at risk of hepatitis C because  of  blood  exposure  during  cardiac  surgery. Hepatitis screening is warranted especially in those with exposure to blood products before universal screening for  hepatitis  C,  which  began  in  1992. Hepatitis vaccination and/or consultation with a hepatologist should also be offered where appropriate, particularly in patients with ACHD with concomitant liver disease (eg, Fontan patients).

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  ACHD  may  have  greater  operative  risk than  patients  without  ACHD.  The  '2014  ACC/AHA Guideline  on  Perioperative  Cardiovascular  Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery' S3.12-10   may be applied; however, those guidelines may not apply directly. One must remain cognizant that  there  are  differences  in  cardiac  issues  commonly present  in  patients  with  ACHD,  such  as  mechanisms for  ventricular  dysfunction,  type  and  mechanisms  of arrhythmia, and the probability of coronary artery disease. The 2014 guideline S3.12-10  was developed primarily with evidence and experience derived from, and related to, patients with acquired heart disease. Thus, the evidence  supporting  recommendations  regarding  risk indices and management strategies may not apply to many patients with ACHD.

 A checklist of issues to consider in the assessment and management of patients with ACHD undergoing  noncardiac  surgery  is  presented in  Table  11.  Patients  with  ACHD  may  present with nonroutine and unusual physiological challenges  (eg,  those  related  to  fluid  balance in  the  setting  of  single  ventricle  or  the  impact of  vascular  resistances  on  shunts  in  cyanotic patients).

 Case series and analysis of administrative databases confirm  that  surgical  procedures  in  patients  with ACHD carry greater risk than in patients without ACHD. S3.12-1-S3.12-3,S3.12-6,S3.12-8,S3.12-11-S3.12-13 Risk relates to the specific type of ACHD, surgical procedure, urgency of intervention, and availability of specialized resources. S3.12-1,S3.12-3-S3.12-6,S3.12-8,S3.12-14   Noncardiac surgery is usually accomplished without substantial  morbidity  or  mortality,  but  even  minor  surgery can be complicated in patients with ACHD. Surgery that is low risk in the general population may be associated with higher risk in the ACHD population. S3.12-1,S3.12-6   Patients  with  ACHD  may present with nonroutine and unusual physiological challenges (eg, those related to fluid balance in  the  setting  of  single  ventricle  or  the  impact of  vascular  resistances  on  shunts  in  cyanotic patients).

When possible, patients with ACHD, especially those with complex disease (ACHD AP classification II and III) and/or whose disease has progressed (stages B, C, D) (Tables 3 and 4), should receive preoperative evaluation and surgery or other nonsurgical  intervention  within  an  ACHD  program. Because the inability to access resources or urgent conditions may preclude transfer or timely consultation,  collaboration  with  members  of  the  multidisciplinary  ACHD  team  may  be  helpful.

validation study suggests that the World Health Organization  classification  is  the  most  accurate  prediction model. S3.13.1-11   Although  many  women  with  CHD  tolerate the hemodynamic changes of pregnancy, others may  face  significant  immediate  or  late  risks  of  pregnancy  including  volume  overload,  arrhythmias,  progressive cardiac dysfunction, and death. Cardiac medications  may  need  to  be  adjusted  during  pregnancy and counseling provided to discuss the options for and potential impact of those changes. Some specific complications may be more common in women with certain types of CHD, such as hypertension, which is more common in women with coarctation. S3.13.1-22,S3.13.1-23  The offspring of patients with ACHD have an increased risk of CHD and other events such as prematurity. S3.13.1-24 All women with CHD should receive appropriate counseling regarding contraception choices. A multidisciplinary team that includes ACHD specialists and maternal-fetal  medicine  obstetricians  with  expertise  in  caring  for women with heart disease is appropriate for achieving optimal outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Prepregnancy counseling allows for an individualized risk assessment. This will include discussing  maternal  risks  for  pregnancy,  delivery,  and postpartum  period,  and  medications  that  may be teratogenic and require alternative therapies (eg,  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors/ angiotensin-receptor blockers). Additionally, counseling  should  include  a  discussion  related to fetal risk in regard to CHD transmission and overall risk to the health of the fetus. ACHD cardiologists  are  valuable  in  accurately  assessing pregnancy  risks.  Risk  may  be  overestimated  or underestimated  by  providers  without  expertise in CHD and pregnancy, leading to patients' receiving inaccurate recommendations on risks of pregnancy, risks of delivery, and the type of delivery (eg, the incorrect notion that most women with  CHD require  cesarean  delivery  for  cardiac reasons).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 This care plan should address maternal cardiac risks  on  the  basis  of  the  individual  patient's anatomy  and  physiology.  Clear  documentation is important so that all providers are well aware of the risks and expected outcomes, including risk of maternal volume shifts, arrhythmias,  labor  and  delivery  plan,  and  need  for maternal  cardiac  monitoring  when  indicated. Contingency  plans  for  anticipated  complications  related  to  the  presence  of  CHD  should also be developed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Chronic anticoagulation during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of maternal bleeding and thrombotic events as well as a higher risk of fetal loss, and in the case of warfarin, the risk of teratogenicity. S3.13.1-5,S3.13.1-14  The choice of specific  anticoagulant  must  balance  maternal well-being and risks for mother and fetus, and should  be  individualized.  Patients  with  mechanical valves should be treated according to GDMT. S3.13.1-25

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The use of contraceptive agents should be balanced against the risks of pregnancy in every woman with CHD after menarche. S3.13.2-6  There are no data on the safety of  various  contraceptive  techniques  in  patients  with ACHD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The individualized benefits and risks of each contraceptive therapy must be determined based on the patient's anatomy and physiology in consultation with a gynecologist. This counseling should include the expected failure rates of contraceptive options  and  the  anticipated  maternal  and  fetal risks  of  unplanned pregnancy, with these issues revisited on a regular basis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Contraceptive choices include combined hormonal (estrogen/progesterone) contraception, progesterone-only  agents,  intrauterine  devices, barrier  methods,  and  permanent  sterilization.  Lowdose combination oral contraceptive ( ≤ 20 mcg of ethinyl  estradiol)  is  an  option  except  in  women who  are  at  increased  risk  of  thrombosis. S3.13.2-4 Medroxyprogesterone  acetate  is  a  less  effective method of contraception, and the potential for fluid  retention  must  be  considered. S3.13.2-5 Intrauterine  devices  are  highly  effective  methods  of contraception; however, women may experience vasovagal reactions at the time of implant. Tubal ligation  is  generally  safe  with  recognized  risks associated with anesthesia and abdominal insufflation. An efficacious option is a vasectomy for the male partner; however, the long-term prognosis  of  the  female  patient  with  CHD  must  be considered and discussed openly. In the case of unplanned pregnancy with desire for termination, the morning-after pill (levonorgestrel) is safe for women, but acute fluid retention is a risk to be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Women with CHD who are at high risk of thrombosis include those with cyanosis, Fontan physiology, mechanical valves, prior thrombotic events, and PAH. In women who are at high risk of thrombosis and who receive warfarin, there are no data on  which  to  base  a  recommendation  or  counseling  as  to  whether  it  is  safe  to  use  estrogencontaining  contraception.  It  is  unclear  whether the use of warfarin offsets adequately the additional risk of thrombosis related to pregnancy in high-risk patients.

3.13.3. Infertility Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Menstrual cycle disorders are not uncommon in women with CHD. In small case series of women with CHD, various  causes  for  infertility  were  documented  including primary  and  secondary  amenorrhea,  oligomenorrhea, and  uterine  anomalies. S3.13.3-1,S3.13.3-2   In  more  complex forms of CHD (eg, the population with Fontan palliation), the prevalence of primary amenorrhea may be as high as 40%. S3.13.3-2   Menarche occurs at an older age in these women than in the general population. S3.13.3-2 Women with CHD also have higher rates of spontaneous  abortion  and  miscarriage. S3.13.3-3-S3.13.3-5 The  prevalence of infertility in men with CHD is unknown. Each patient with ACHD should be counseled regarding the potential for infertility and referral to a specialized reproductive endocrinologist when appropriate, although there  is  little  specific  guidance  for  women  based  on types of CHD. Alternative options for family planning including assisted reproductive technologies and adoption is appropriate, and risks versus benefits of all options are addressed during counseling.

3.13.4. Sexual Function

Sexuality  is  an  important  element  of  QoL.  Although there are data that sexual function is a concern in both women  and  men,  there  is  minimal  evidence  on  the prevalence of sexual concerns among adults with CHD and far less to guide interventions. S3.13.4-1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Concerns with sexual health are present in 20% to 40% of men with CHD. S3.13.4-2-S3.13.4-4 Erectile dysfunction is reported by up to 42% of men with CHD. S3.13.4-1,S3.13.4-3 Men with CHD report being in sexual relationships significantly less often than the general population. S3.13.4-1, S3.13.4-4  Among men with CHD who report sexual health concerns,  there  is  a  high  level  of  psychological  distress and diminished QoL. S3.13.4-1,S3.13.4-2,S3.13.4-4,S3.13.4-5 The ACHD provider should be mindful of this often-unspoken concern and create an environment in which the patient feels  comfortable  addressing  concerns  about  their sexuality.

3.14.1. Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HF is a significant issue in patients with ACHD. It is common, associated  with  morbidity  and  mortality,  and  is anticipated to increase in prevalence. However, despite the clinical importance of HF in patients with ACHD and efforts  to  study  the  effects  of  medication  and  device therapy in these patients, there are no data to support treatment recommendations. For patients with biventricular  physiology,  systemic  left  ventricular  (LV)  dysfunction,  no  repairable  residual  hemodynamic  abnormalities, and persistent HF symptoms, standard GDMT is ostensibly preferable to no treatment. However, expectations of its benefit should be tempered, and risk may  be  different  in  patients  with  acquired  CVD,  because CHD patients have not been included in the trials by which those guidelines were developed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HF is common in patients with ACHD and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. S3.14.1-1S3.14.1-4   There  are  many  causes  of  HF  symptoms that  may  be  reversible,  including  valve  dysfunction, shunts, arrhythmias, venous obstruction, and systolic  and/or  diastolic  ventricular  dysfunction, which  require  evaluation  and  treatment  when possible. Unlike acquired HF, and despite the clinical  importance of HF in ACHD, data to support a  treatment  recommendations  including  typical HF  medical  therapy  (eg,  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists) S3.14.1-5 are limited in patients with ACHD. S3.14.1-6-S3.14.1-22 HF in  patients  with  ACHD  is  multifactorial  and  may manifest as variable response to pharmacotherapy. Advanced HF therapies may be technically difficult or considered too late in the course. Thus, timely evaluation by ACHD and HF specialists is crucial to optimal care of such patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.14.2. Heart Transplant

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the prevalence of HF among patients with CHD, heart  transplantation  is  increasingly  being  considered as a therapeutic option. Data on proper timing of transplantation are limited, particularly for individual lesions. Larger studies based on transplant databases do not allow for analysis based on the type of CHD. S3.14.2-1S3.14.2-4   Currently, patients with ACHD may have fewer mechanical  circulatory  devices  (eg,  ventricular-assist devices), which may lower their listing status and hence potential for organ receipt. S3.14.2-1,S3.14.2-2,S3.14.2-4-S3.14.2-7

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  specific  criteria  for  timing  of  referral  for transplantation are desirable, universal recommendations cannot be made based on current data. Generally, published data show that immediate and early posttransplantation risk is higher in ACHD than in acquired heart disease because of increased perioperative mortality. S3.14.2-2 However, once beyond the perioperative period, patients with ACHD do as well as or better than those with acquired  heart  disease,  with  expected  10-year  survival  equivalent  to  or  better  than  that  of  patients  without ACHD. S3.14.2-2-S3.14.2-4,S3.14.2-6,S3.14.2-7  Risks for poor outcomes include  single  ventricle  anatomy,  anatomic  complexity, protein-losing enteropathy, or high titers of panel reactive antibodies. S3.14.2-8,S3.14.2-9 The current allocation system puts patients with ACHD at a disadvantage. Rather than priority dictated by the usual accepted risk markers, patients with ACHD are often listed by 'exception,' a process that requires the clinician to argue that the patient warrants higher priority than would be evident by applying the used risk markers. There is also significant mortality for patients with ACHD while on the waitlist. S3.14.2-10, S3.14.2-11 Surgical  alternatives  to  transplantation  exist  for some patients with CHD (eg, valve replacement, shunt closure), but these patients are at high risk of perioperative mortality. S3.14.2-12 Ideally, providers will consider early referral  to  a  transplant  center  with  expertise  in  ACHD transplantation when transplantation becomes a relevant clinical consideration. Additionally, it is advisable to consider options for transplantation or ventricular assist device as a backup before other high-risk surgery is pursued. See Online Data Supplement 23 for referenced studies.

3.14.3. Multiorgan Transplant

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recognizing the vulnerability of many organ systems in patients with CHD, multiorgan transplantation is often considered,  although  infrequently  performed.  Multiorgan  transplantation  requires  a  multidisciplinary  and comprehensive approach with thoughtful planning and communication among practitioners.

The  occurrence  of  simultaneous  heart-liver  transplantation is an option in patients with severe right-sided HF and in single ventricle patients after Fontan palliation. Given the recognized vulnerability of the liver to injury in Fontan patients and the fact that heart alone transplantation  outcomes have been poor in patients with concomitant liver dysfunction, transplant centers may favor heart-liver transplantation in those with cirrhosis,  but  this  policy  is  not  universal.  Fewer  than  15 such procedures are performed annually in the United States, and approximately 20% of patients are referred because of underlying CHD. S3.14.3-5,S3.14.3-6  Consequently, experience with these procedures is limited, S3.14.3-5,S3.14.3-7 and heterogeneity makes generalizability difficult. Data are  insufficient  to  support  recommendations.  For  all patients,  survival  mimics  that  for  liver  transplantation alone with 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival at 84%, 74%, and 72%, respectively. S3.14.3-6   Outcomes in Fontan patients with  or  without  cirrhosis  are  not  necessarily  different in those who receive heart transplantation alone. S3.14.3-5, S3.14.3-8   Multicenter  data  gathering  on  patients  considered for multiorgan transplantation are needed to inform future recommendations for these therapies.

3.15. Palliative Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  ACHD  sometimes  have  significant morbidities  not  amenable  to  effective  medical  or surgical treatment and may be best managed using the consultative expertise of palliative care specialists. Accurate predictions of prognosis in ACHD are difficult, and patients commonly receive aggressive treatments  during  their  terminal  admission. S3.15-4 There is a discrepancy between patient-reported interest in discussing advance directives and physicianreported discussions, with more patients interested in such discussions than recognized by providers. S3.15-1, S3.15-2 Early discussion of advance planning is favored by nearly twice as many patients as physicians. S3.15-3 Early  discussion  of  end-of-life  issues  is  consistent with patient-centered care and patient satisfaction and can facilitate palliative care. Although discussing end-of-life options would seem appropriate for all patients, there are circumstances (eg, cultural or cognitive)  when  those  conversations  may  not  be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
appropriate.  Similarly,  although  the  goal  is  not  to wait to discuss end-of-life until death is imminent, such discussion may not have the same benefit for young patients who are clinically well with low-risk disease. Thus, it is important to always have and encourage the option to discuss end-of-life issues, but timing of conversation is individualized.

3.16. Cyanosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The definition of cyanosis is 'blueish discoloration of the skin  and/or  mucous  membranes  resulting  from  inadequate oxygenation of the blood.' Generally, for cyanosis to be visible, at least 5 g/L of unsaturated hemoglobin in  tissue  is  needed. S3.16-1   Anemia may result in hypoxemia that is  not  manifest  as  cyanosis.  In  this  guideline, 'cyanosis' is used as a generic term to identify hypoxemia caused by right-to-left shunting of blood, but not all hypoxemic patients will be visibly cyanotic at all times.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyanotic heart disease encompasses a widely heterogeneous group; therefore, an individualized approach is needed for each patient according to the clinical details.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary erythrocytosis (a physiological increase in red blood cell mass in response to hypoxemia) and polycythemia (a  neoplastic  proliferation  of  hematopoietic  cells  including the red blood cell line) are fundamentally different conditions that require different treatments. In secondary erythrocytosis,  the  patient' s  own  homeostatic  processes generally direct achievement of an optimal level of red cell mass, estimated by hemoglobin and hematocrit. S3.16-2

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals. S3.16-3 In  addition  to  contributing  to  symptoms, iron deficiency causes a reduction of hemoglobin without a proportional change in hematocrit and thus compromises systemic oxygen transport without lowering viscosity. S3.16-3  Symptoms mimic those of hyperviscosity. Consequences of iron deficiency may include stroke and myocardial ischemia, S3.16-4-S3.16-6  although published findings are inconsistent. Iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels, because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening  test. S3.16-7 Limited  data  suggest  that  treatment  of transferrin saturation <20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely. S3.16-8

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  there  is  an  exponential  relationship  between viscosity and hematocrit, available data do not justify a cut point for a 'safe' hematocrit. S3.16-3 There is no clear correlation between viscosity, iron deficiency, and a patient's symptoms or clinical condition. S3.16-3  The nature and cause of hyperviscosity symptoms are not well understood. The severity and frequency of symptoms of hyperviscosity do not correlate with measured hematocrit. Phlebotomy is, therefore, rarely necessary in patients with secondary erythrocytosis, and routine phlebotomy  is  not  supported  by  data.  Patients  with suspected hyperviscosity need to be rehydrated either

with  oral  fluids  or  intravenous  normal  saline  solution as a first-line therapy, evaluated for iron deficiency, and treated if appropriate. Phlebotomy (with equal volume fluid  replacement)  is  sometimes  performed  in  special cases  wherein,  after  adequate  hydration,  hematocrit remains higher than the patient's baseline and symptoms persist, or there is evidence of end-organ damage attributable to hyperviscosity (eg, myocardial ischemia, transient ischemic attack/stroke).

Observational  studies  in  cyanotic  individuals  have shown  evidence  of  altered  synthesis  and  function  of clotting factors that may contribute to both hypo- and hypercoagulability, S3.16-11,S3.16-12 and thrombosis and bleeding  (particularly  epistaxis  or  hemoptysis)  have been described in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, which may be life-threatening. S3.16-13-S3.16-15  These disparate  trends  preclude  developing  universally  applicable recommendations, including use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant  therapy  in  these  patients. S3.16-16 Similarly, there is not a clear role for preoperative phlebotomy to improve coagulation properties.

3.17. Pharmacological Therapy for ACHD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with ACHD are commonly excluded from clinical  trials,  and  there  are  few  data  to  guide  pharmacological  therapies.  Although  it  may  be  tempting  to extrapolate  from  management  guidelines  developed for  patients  without  CHD  (eg,  HF  guidelines), S3.17-1 treatments may not have the same benefit in the heterogeneous population of patients with ACHD and in some cases may cause harm. The evaluation of new symptoms in a patient  with  ACHD  must  be  tailored to the patient's anatomy, surgical repair, and physiology. Before considering pharmacological therapies, evaluation for residual shunts, baffle stenosis, valvular or conduit dysfunction, and collateral vessels, any of which may be amenable to interventions, is an important consideration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The literature documenting pharmacological therapies for patients with ACHD is limited to small studies with  limited  duration  of  drug  administration  and  follow-up. Additionally, the endpoints used are often surrogate markers that have not been validated for clinical decision-making, and studies are also often underpow-

However, studies in patients with ACHD do exist and evaluate conventional pharmacological therapy, especially for HF and for arrhythmia, including beta blockers,  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors,  angiotensin-receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, although results vary. S3.17-2-S3.17-9

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacological  therapies  in  patients  with  ACHD are often directed to specific conditions (ie, beta blockers for arrhythmia treatment). However, there are limited  data  examining  the  benefits  of  beta  blockers  in specific ACHD populations. Results from a small study indicate that beta-blocker therapy may have potential to improve functional class in patients with a systemic right ventricle and  a  pacemaker. S3.17-2   Angiotensinconverting  enzyme  inhibitors  and  angiotensin-receptor  blockers  have  also  been  assessed  in  small  studies in  specific  ACHD  populations  in  which  no  significant benefit on ventricular function or exercise capacity has been  proven.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASDs are common and may occur as a consequence of different  anatomic  defects,  including  secundum  ASD, primum ASD, sinus venosus defect (not properly a defect in the atrial septum but considered in this section), and coronary sinus septal defect. Left-to-right shunting may result in right heart enlargement and RV dysfunction and, in a minority of patients, PAH. Some patients may have right-to-left shunting or paradoxical embolism, and some may develop arrhythmias. Percutaneous device or surgical closure are the mainstays of therapy in those with hemodynamic or clinical consequences of the defect. Severe PAH is a contraindication to closure, and  its  presence  must  be  accurately  excluded  before closure. S4.1.1-21-S4.1.1-23

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASD  may  occur  with  other  congenital  cardiac  abnormalities. In some circumstances, such as in patients with Ebstein anomaly and pulmonary stenosis (PS) or right HF, the physiology related to the ASD is substantially  more  complex,  and  ASD  closure  could  result  in clinical  deterioration.  Therefore,  these  recommendations regarding ASD address only isolated ASDs and not ASD associated with complex CHD.

 Pulse oximetry is useful in defining shunt direction at rest and with exercise, which will help guide decisions regarding therapeutic options. Pulse oximetry at rest and with exercise may identify patients with increased pulmonary arterial resistance and shunt reversal.  In  a  subset  of  patients  with  resting  systemic oxygen saturation >90%, a decrease in oxygen saturation with activity to <90% may occur, emphasizing the importance of performing resting and ambulatory pulse oximetry assessment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 TTE has limited use in assessment of anomalous pulmonary  venous  connections  in  adults  with ASD. Moreover, the poor visualization of the superior and posterior atrial septum by TTE in adults may require testing with other imaging modalities to clearly define septal anatomy. TEE is excellent for visualization of the entire atrial septum as well as  pulmonary  venous  connections.  Anomalous right  upper  and  middle  lobe  pulmonary  venous connections often occur in combination with superior  sinus  venosus  defect;  TEE  is  excellent  for visualization of this combination but may not visualize  other  anomalous  pulmonary  venous  connections.  Cross-sectional  imaging  with  CMR  or CCT  is  ideal  for  delineating  pulmonary  venous connections, particularly those that are associated with veins that may be difficult or impossible to image by echocardiography (eg, innominate vein or vertical vein). CMR has the advantages of not involving ionizing radiation and ability to quantify degree of shunting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 It is considered standard of care to use echocardiographic imaging to guide closure of interatrial communications.  TEE  and  intracardiac  echocardiography are the most widely studied and used modalities  for  guidance  of  ASD  closure.  Defect size, defect morphology, atrial rim adequacy, pulmonary venous anomalies, and left atrial appendage  thrombus  can  all  be  evaluated  using  TEE. Echocardiography is also used to determine sizing either  by  balloon  diameter  producing  complete occlusion  of  the  defect  ('stop  flow'  diameter) or by direct visualization and measurement using intracardiac echocardiography. Echocardiography can assess for pericardial effusion and for thrombi on  wires  or  devices.  TTE  has  also  been  studied for guiding percutaneous ASD closure but is not widely used for this purpose.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Cardiac catheterization is performed at the time of transcatheter ASD closure. Provided noninvasive imaging is of sufficiently high quality to estimate pulmonary  artery  pressures  and  shunt  magnitude,  not  every  patient  with  an  ASD  requires  a diagnostic catheterization before surgical closure. However,  a  diagnostic  catheterization  may  be necessary  to  determine  detailed  hemodynamics for  decision-making  or  to  clarify  discrepant  or inconclusive  noninvasive  imaging  data.  Patients with reduced functional capacity presumed caused  by  hemodynamically  important  secundum ASD (moderate or large left-to-right shunt and evidence of right heart volume overload in the absence of significant PAH) benefit from surgical  or  transcatheter  closure  of  the  secundum ASD. S4.1.1-8,S4.1.1-10   Patients  who  do  not  undergo ASD  closure  have  worse  long-term  outcomes, including more atrial arrhythmias, reduced functional  capacity,  and  eventually  greater  degrees of  PAH.  Older  adults  should  be  evaluated  for left  atrial  hypertension  resulting  from  diastolic dysfunction, which may cause similar symptoms but  could  result  in  clinical  worsening  after  ASD closure  because  of  further  increase  in  left  atrial pressures when blood from the relatively restrictive and higher pressure left atrium can no longer decompress into the lower pressure right atrium. Cyanosis with exercise typically occurs in association with poor RV diastolic compliance and hemodynamics with exercise, and the ASD acts as a 'pop-off' to maintain cardiac output. However, exercise-induced cyanosis is not an absolute contraindication  to  ASD  closure,  because  there  are rare cases of either streaming or directed tricuspid regurgitation (TR) leading to right-to-left shunting with exercise not related to abnormal RV diastolic pressures that may allow for closure after expert evaluation. Data are most compelling that closure

capacity but, in patients with normal functional capacity, the long-term benefit of ASD closure is less  clear. S4.1.1-1,S4.1.1-9 Pending  further  study,  it  is reasonable to close an ASD that is hemodynamically important in the absence of significant PAH. Older  adults  should  be  evaluated  for  left  atrial hypertension resulting from diastolic dysfunction that may cause symptoms simulating those from an ASD alone, in whom ASD closure could result in clinical worsening because of further increase in left atrial pressure because the relatively restrictive and higher pressure left atrium can no longer decompress into the lower pressure right atrium. Concomitant  tricuspid  annuloplasty  can  be  of benefit in patients with moderate or more TR, as the additional volume load may adversely affect RV remodeling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 If  surgical  treatment  is  necessary  for  other  congenital  or  acquired  cardiac  conditions  and  the patient has a secundum ASD, it is reasonable to perform ASD closure at the time of surgery. When there  is  moderate  or  greater  TR,  tricuspid  valve repair may improve RV remodeling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 To evaluate the patient with PAH and ASD, ensure the  shunt  remains  left  to  right  despite  elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and/or pulmonary pressure  and  that  pulmonary  pressure  and  PVR are  accurately  measured.  In  this  circumstance, data derived from invasive hemodynamic assessment are important in clarifying the appropriate course of action. The exclusion of patients with severe  PAH  from  ASD  closure  may  eventually be  obviated  by  PA  vasodilator  and  remodeling therapy with prostaglandins, endothelin blockers, and PDE-5 inhibitors. Because of the complexity of  the  hemodynamics in such patients, collaboration between ACHD and pulmonary hypertension  providers  is  important.  Pretreatment  with PAH therapies and pulmonary arterial remodeling agents, with a demonstrated reduction in pulmonary arterial resistance of >20%, portends a favorable prognosis after ASD closure.

4.1.2. Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connections

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal connection between a pulmonary vein and systemic vein will result in volume overload of the right heart, with a physiological effect similar to that of an ASD. However, in the absence of an associated ASD, anomalous pulmonary venous connection differs in that there is no potential for right-to-left shunting, and the magnitude of the left-to-right shunt is not exacerbated by the development of acquired left heart disease. The most common anomalous pulmonary venous connection is of the right upper pulmonary vein to the superior vena cava, S4.1.2-10  which may be associated with a sinus venosus  defect.  Other  abnormal  connections  include right pulmonary vein(s) to the inferior vena cava (often via a so-called 'scimitar vein' and associated with sequestration of the right lower lobe), left upper pulmonary vein(s) to the left innominate vein, and right upper

Long-term sequelae of anomalous pulmonary venous connections reflect the impact of right heart volume overload and are similar to the sequelae of ASDs. Surgical  repair  can  be  challenging  as  low-velocity  venous flow imparts risk of thrombosis of the surgically operated vein.

Echocardiography is an important part of the evaluation and may identify the anomalous veins, S4.1.2-11 particularly  in  patients  with  excellent  acoustic  windows; however, CMR and CTA are  superior  for  evaluating  extracardiac  vascular anatomy.

 In  higher-risk  patients,  invasive  hemodynamic assessment can be useful for direct measurement of pressures, quantification of shunt magnitude, and  measurement  of  pulmonary  arterial  resistance  and  responsiveness  to  pulmonary  vasodilator therapy. Invasive hemodynamic assessment is especially important in adult patients who are being considered for surgical correction.

 It  is  unusual  for  a  single  anomalous  pulmonary venous connection of only 1 pulmonary lobe to result  in  a  sufficient  volume  load  to  justify  surgical repair. However, if a patient has symptoms referable  to  the  shunt,  there  is  >1  anomalous vein, and a moderate or large left-to-right shunt, then  surgical  repair  is  associated  with  a  reduction in RV size and PA pressure.

Life expectancy after VSD closure in an adult is not normal but has improved over the past 50 years. Transcatheter device occlusion of muscular and perimembranous VSD is feasible, and trials have demonstrated a good safety and efficacy profile. S4.1.3-16, S4.1.3-17 VSD in adults is most commonly either small, or  large  and  associated  with  Eisenmenger  syndrome; therefore, data regarding optimal management of moderate VSD in adults are lacking because of relative infrequency of a hemodynamically significant VSD for which closure is an option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Small restrictive defects of the muscular or membranous  septum  may  be  managed  by  observation  without  need  for  operative  intervention. However, 6% of patients with small supracristal (subaortic)  or  perimembranous  defects  may  develop aortic valve prolapse and resultant AR that may  be  progressive. S4.1.3-1,S4.1.3-2,S4.1.3-18 There  is  a paucity of data supporting the timing of VSD closure in patients with AR. Ideally, the VSD is closed if AR is progressive to avoid the continued worsening of AR and the need for aortic valve replacement. In the presence of a VSD, an aortic valve cusp  (usually  the  right  coronary  cusp)  may  prolapse and partially or completely close the VSD, often  with  associated  AR.  At  the  time  of  VSD closure, aortic valve repair may be performed in an effort to stabilize or improve AR. For patients who meet GDMT criteria for aortic valve replacement, this may be performed concomitant with VSD closure. S4.1.3-19

In  patients  with  unrepaired  VSD,  there  is  an increased risk of IE, typically involving the tricuspid and pulmonic valves.

Early  attempts  at  surgical  closure  of  nonrestrictive VSD in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome were associated with an unacceptably high risk of

mortality, and the practice was quickly abandoned. However, there are adult patients with large VSD and PAH who may benefit from closure of the VSD if the net shunt is left-to-right either at baseline or with PAH therapies. The use of fenestrated devices and fenestrated surgical patches in these patients leaves a small residual shunt to allow decompression of the right heart. S4.1.3-5,S4.1.3-6 In theory, treatment of these patients with PAH therapies before closure could improve outcomes.

Closure of nonrestrictive VSD  in adults with Eisenmenger syndrome who do not demonstrate left-to-right  shunting  and  a  decline  in  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  with  PAH  therapies  carries  a  high  risk  of  mortality  and  should  not  be performed. S4.1.3-7-S4.1.3-9

CLINICAL STATEMENTS AND GUIDELINES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AVSDs represent about 4% to 5% of congenital heart defects and include a primum ASD, inlet VSD, and common atrioventricular  valve.  They  can  occur  in  several anatomic variations including partial AVSD with only a primum ASD component and typically a cleft left atrioventricular valve, complete AVSD with both ASD and VSD and a common atrioventricular valve, and transitional  and  intermediate  AVSD  with  incomplete  atrial and VSDs and/or incomplete abnormalities of the common atrioventricular valve. AVSD anatomy is also commonly described by the Rastelli classification. S4.1.4-7,S4.1.4-8 The Rastelli classification describes anatomic variations of the superior bridging leaflet of the atrioventricular valve. In addition to the Rastelli classification or other similar descriptors, the relative sizes of the ventricles as balanced or unbalanced guide the type of repair (eg, biventricular or single ventricle repair). This section refers to patients with balanced AVSD and biventricular repair. AVSD also occurs in association with other congenital lesions  including  TOF,  CoA,  and  heterotaxy.  There  is also  a  strong  association  with  syndromes,  most  commonly trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From a management perspective, most adults with AVSD will have had surgical repair as children. If those with complete AVSD (with large ASD and VSD) are not repaired  early  in  life  (typically  <6  months  of  age),  irreversible pulmonary vascular disease usually develops resulting  in  Eisenmenger  physiology,  precluding  complete repair. For those who underwent a surgical repair, long-term follow-up is required to monitor for left atrioventricular valve regurgitation and stenosis, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction attributable to the abnormal shape of the LVOT, and tachyarrhythmias and bradyarrhythmias. Left atrioventricular valve regurgitation is the most common reason for later surgical reintervention. There are few long-term follow-up studies  of  patients  after  AVSD repair in childhood, so the most effective and efficient timing and type of surveillance are still being evaluated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The atrioventricular node is typically displaced inferiorly in AVSD and is associated with relative hypoplasia  of  the  left  anterior  fascicle. S4.1.4-9   Late-onset  complete heart block (as late as 15 years after surgery) has been noted after surgery in patients operated on for AVSD  who  were  discharged  from  the  hospital  with normal  conduction,  although  more  commonly  seen in  those  patients  with  transient  postoperative  heart block. Regular monitoring for symptoms and screening with an ECG are important to evaluate for conduction abnormalities. S4.1.4-10

 Invasive hemodynamic assessment still has an important  role  as  a  confirmatory  tool  and  for  the evaluation  of  pulmonary  vasoreactivity,  which does carry prognostic significance for adults with shunts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Although  the  left  atrioventricular  valve  in  an AVSD  malformation  is  not  anatomically  the same as a mitral valve, one can extrapolate the criteria  for  consideration  of  left  atrioventricular  valve  surgery  from  the  VHD  guideline  for mitral  regurgitation  and  mitral  stenosis. S4.1.4-1 In extrapolating these criteria, there are important potential differences in this patient population compared with those with acquired mitral valve  disease.  There  are  anatomic  differences in  position  of  the  annulus,  papillary  muscles and the morphology of the LVOT, which is an anterior, narrow, and  potentially obstructed structure,  such  that  congenital  surgical  expertise  is  needed.  Patients  with  an  AVSD  have typically  had  at  least  1  prior  attempt  to  repair the  AVSD,  have  different  risks  of  arrhythmia, and may have other anatomic lesions (eg, subaortic  stenosis  [subAS]).  In  1  meta-analysis  of studies  of  adult  left  atrioventricular  valve  surgery in patients with AVSD, the risk of needing a  pacemaker  was  higher  in  those  who  underwent valve replacement than in those who underwent  repair. S4.1.4-2   In  another  single-center study,  one  third  of  repaired  patients  required

an  additional  reoperation. S4.1.4-3   When  replacement is required, the choice to use mechanical versus bioprosthetic valve is individualized, but a mechanical valve is usually necessary because of the potential for LVOT obstruction from the struts  of  the  bioprosthetic  valve.  Nevertheless, valve  repair  is  preferred  to  valve  replacement when it is technically feasible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 There are no large studies on residual shunts in patients  with  AVSD,  but  extrapolating  from  information  on  residual  isolated  ASD  or  isolated VSD, a moderate or large residual shunt is likely to result in worsening clinical status over time and thus  merits  consideration  of  repair. S4.1.4-11-S4.1.4-13 See Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.3 for related considerations regarding ASD and/or VSD. Pulse oximetry at rest and with ambulation may identify patients with  increased  pulmonary  resistance  and  shunt reversal.  There is  a  subset  of  patients  with  resting  systemic  oxygen  saturation  >90%  who  will have a decrease in oxygen saturation with activity to  <90%,  emphasizing  the  importance  of  performing  resting  and  ambulatory  pulse  oximetry assessment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients with AVSD are at risk of LVOT obstruction  because  of  the  abnormal  anatomy  of  the LVOT.  Surgical  resection  of  LVOT  obstruction  in association with AVSD is reasonable when there is moderate-to-severe obstruction or less obstruction but associated HF or mitral regurgitation or AR.  In  isolated  subAS  studies,  worse  outcomes were revealed in patients with maximum gradients ≥ 50 mm Hg or with gradients <50 mm Hg in association with symptoms of HF. S4.1.4-14-S4.1.4-17 Importantly the LVOT obstruction in AVSD may not  be  discrete  and,  therefore,  surgical  repair may be more complex. When evaluating patients with  tunnel-like  or  complex  LVOT  obstruction, the peak Doppler gradients and Bernoulli equation may inaccurately reflect the severity of obstruction,  and  cardiac  catheterization  may  be needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients with AVSD, particularly those with Down syndrome, are at high risk of developing pulmonary  vascular  disease  resulting  in  Eisenmenger syndrome. S4.1.4-18,S4.1.4-19   For  those  who  continue to have a net left-to-right shunt despite elevated PA pressures, closure of the defect may prevent exacerbation of PAH. This is an unusual circumstance  and  decision-making  requires  collaboration  with  ACHD  and  pulmonary  hypertension providers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Morbidity  and  mortality  are  prohibitively  high when surgical repair is attempted in patients with open  shunts  such  as  AVSD  when  Eisenmenger syndrome is present. S4.1.4-5,S4.1.4-6

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  ductus  arteriosus  is  a  vascular  connection  between the aorta and PA that is present in fetal life. It typically closes shortly after birth but, in some people, it will remain patent. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is found in about 0.3% to 0.8% of term infants and is twice as common in females as males. S4.1.5-6-S4.1.5-8  The clinical  and  physiological  manifestations  of  the  PDA are dependent on the size of the vessel and the relative  systemic  and  pulmonary  vascular  resistances. The  PDA  can  range  from  a  small  hemodynamically insignificant  lesion  that  is  not  heard  on  auscultation to  one  that  without  intervention  is  large  enough  to cause  congestive  HF  and  pulmonary  hypertension. Many PDAs are now closed  in  infancy  or  childhood with catheter-based or surgical approaches. For those whose ductus remains patent in adulthood, catheterbased or surgical intervention consideration depends on the symptoms and physiological expression of the lesion. Follow-up of these patients as adults is important  for  all,  although  timing  and  testing  will  vary  among individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
See Section 3.3 for recommendations on who should perform  surgeries,  cardiac  catheterization,  and  other procedures  in  these  patients;  Section  3.4  for  recommendations on diagnostic evaluation; Section 4.4.6 for recommendations on severe PAH (4.4.6.1) and Eisenmenger syndrome (4.4.6.2) associated with PDA; and Table 16 for routine testing and follow-up intervals.

 Because cyanosis caused by right-to-left shunting in PDA may manifest predominantly downstream from the ductal insertion into the aorta, accurate assessment of oxygen saturation by oximetry and assessment of cyanosis should be done in the feet and both hands.

A subset of patients with resting  systemic  oxygen  saturation  >90%  will  have a  decrease  in  oxygen  saturation  with  activity to  <90%,  emphasizing  the  importance  of  performing  resting  and  ambulatory  pulse  oximetry assessment.

 Invasive hemodynamic assessment still has an important  role  as  a  confirmatory  tool  and  for  the evaluation of pulmonary vasoreactivity, which carries prognostic significance. S4.1.5-1,S4.1.5-4

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 When signs of volume overload are indicative of significant left-to-right shunt, closing the PDA is likely to prevent further left atrial or LV enlargement, progression or development of PAH, and pulmonary  hypertension  secondary  to  left  HF and will possibly provide symptom relief if symptoms are present. Closure is typically performed percutaneously  with  good  success  and  minimal complications. S4.1.5-2   Pulmonary  blood  flow  and thus Qp:Qs can be difficult to calculate accurately because of differences in right/left PA blood flow caused  by  the  flow  from  the  PDA.  Invasive  hemodynamics including pulmonary vascular resistance are generally relied on for decision-making. Surgical closure can be performed but is potentially hazardous in adults because of calcification and tissue fragility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Even  with  elevated  pulmonary  pressure  and  elevated  pulmonary  vascular  resistance,  closure of  a  PDA  may  improve  clinical  status  in  some patients with persistent left-to-right shunting and prevent  further  progression  of  PAH. S4.1.5-3,S4.1.5-4 Consultation with ACHD and pulmonary hypertension providers is important given the low frequency of this circumstance and the complexity of decision-making.

4.2.1. Cor Triatriatum

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cor triatriatum occurs when a membrane divides either the left atrium (sinister), or right atrium (dexter). Cor triatriatum sinister is usually associated with other congenital malformations, specifically ASD, VSD, or anomalous pulmonary venous connection (partial or total). S4.2.1-1S4.2.1-4 The left atrial appendage is invariably in the same chamber as the mitral valve, separated from the pulmonary veins by the membrane. Supravalvular mitral stenosis is typically caused by a fibrous ring on the atrial side of the mitral valve, separating the mitral valve from both the left atrial appendage and the pulmonary veins. The finding will have similar physiology to cor triatriatum and similar indications for intervention. It can be associated with an abnormal mitral valve that may also require intervention. Supravalvular mitral stenosis often comprises one part of a more complex sequence of serial left-sided inflow and outflow obstructions (ie, Shone complex).

 Cor triatriatum sinister is a membrane spanning the left atrium. Surgery has been largely successful with relatively few early or late deaths, which are  usually  attributable  to  associated  congenital abnormalities. S4.2.1-4 The  gradient  across  the  defect at the time of surgery was at least 8 mm Hg (mean 17 mm Hg; range 8 to 40 mm Hg). S4.2.1-3 After  repair,  recurrence  of  stenosis  is  not  expected.  Although  pulmonary  vein  stenosis  has

 Although risks of isolated cor triatriatum sinister surgery is low, it should be performed when there is evidence of a substantial gradient. In 1 series, the mean gradient at the time of surgical repair was at least 8 mm Hg.

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SubAS may occur as a discrete membrane below the aortic valve in the LVOT, as a longer tunnel-like obstruction, as a consequence of chordal attachments in patients with abnormalities such as AVSD, or because of surgical repairs involving VSD baffled to a transposed aorta, such as seen in the Rastelli operation. SubAS may occur in isolation or as part of a suite of abnormalities. In adults with Shone complex or its variants, subAS may be one of several LV obstructive lesions, including variants of congenital mitral stenosis, supravalvular mitral stenosis,  valvular  aortic  stenosis,  supravalvular  aortic stenosis, and CoA. S4.2.3-7

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SubAS tends to recur, particularly when initial resection is needed in childhood. Surgical repair for subAS carries a 10% to 15% risk of complete heart block. S4.2.3-6 SubAS may be first diagnosed in adulthood and may be confused  with  hypertrophic  obstructive  cardiomyopa- thy when LV hypertrophy of sufficient severity has developed such that the subaortic membrane is less evident on imaging.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  recommendations  in  this  guideline  apply  to subAS caused by a discrete  membrane or  tunnel-like obstruction. Similar principles may apply to more complex causes of subAS, but insufficient data exist to support recommendations for more complex lesions, and extrapolation  needs  to  take  the  additional  anatomic complexity into account.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Turbulent  flow  created  distal  to  the  subaortic  obstruction may cause barotrauma to the adjacent aortic valve leaflets and result in progressive AR, which may itself become clinically significant. Resection of the subaortic obstruction ideally delays or prevents the eventual  need for aortic valve replacement, and concomitant aortic valve repair could also help delay the need for aortic valve replacement in these cases.

These patients may benefit from surgical relief of LVOT obstruction. Patients with evidence of resting or stress-induced ischemia in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease and in the presence of moderate subAS (maximum gradient >30 mm Hg and <50 mm Hg) may benefit from surgical relief of subAS. S4.2.3-9

 Discrete subAS tends to be progressive with age, and  patients  with  a  resting  maximum  gradient ≥ 50 mm Hg are more likely to have progressive subAS and concomitant moderate or severe aortic valve regurgitation. S4.2.3-4 Therefore, surgical intervention may be considered in the asymptomatic patient  with  severe  subAS.  Tunnel-type  subAS, which is often associated with a small aortic valve annulus, is associated with worse long-term outcomes and a higher risk of recurrence after surgical  resection  compared with subAS caused by a  discrete  membrane. S4.2.3-5 Surgical  intervention on patients with asymptomatic subAS (maximum gradient ≥ 50 mm Hg) with preserved LV ejection fraction may delay progression of, or improve the degree  of,  aortic  valve  regurgitation.  SubAS  in adults may progress more slowly than in children, and although mild AR is common, it may not be progressive in medium-term follow-up. S4.2.3-10

Synopsis

Indications  for  aortic  valve  replacement  according  to the 2014 VHD guideline S4.2.4-5   generally apply. Recommendations above deal with issues specific to congenital aortic valve disease, which includes BAV, as well as unicuspid aortic valve and aortic stenosis caused by hypoplastic aortic annulus. The underlying anatomy must be taken into account in patients with congenital aortic stenosis, as intervention may need to include annular enlarging procedures and other surgical techniques not commonly used in  valvular  aortic  stenosis.  These  patients are often young adults, for whom lifestyle considerations such as athletic endeavors, employment, and childbearing may influence the type of intervention.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS AND GUIDELINES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the association of these abnormalities, evaluation of patients with BAV for CoA is warranted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 BAV  is  the  most  prevalent  congenital  cardiac abnormality  with  an  estimated  prevalence  of 4.6 per 1000 live births, and is 1.5 times more prevalent in males than females. S4.2.4-7-S4.2.4-13 Most  cases  are  spontaneous;  however,  familial inheritance  may  occur  in  an  autosomal  dominant pattern with variable penetrance. On echocardiographic  screening,  1  study  reports  the prevalence of asymptomatic BAV in first-degree relatives of patients is 9%, and 32% of first-degree  relatives  without  a  BAV  will  have  an  abnormal aorta. S4.2.4-4

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Calcification of the aortic valve in adults necessitates  that  most  patients  who  require  therapy for  aortic  stenosis  will  require  aortic  valve  replacement per GDMT. S4.2.4-5 However,  young patients with congenitally abnormal valves and relatively  little  calcification  may  be  candidates for  balloon  valvuloplasty.  Balloon  valvuloplasty may improve the degree of stenosis and symptoms in  patients  with  mobile  noncalcified  BAV stenosis.  In  general,  the  valves  that  would  be amenable  to  successful  balloon  valvuloplasty are found in young patients, who are often <25 years  of  age.  Restenosis  will  occur  over  time and in a relatively short time in some patients. Balloon valvuloplasty of calcified BAV is associated  with  decreased  efficacy  and  an  increased risk  of  AR. S4.2.4-14,S4.2.4-15   Although  transcatheter interventions for aortic stenosis are increasingly commonly performed in older adults and, thus, there  are  increasing  numbers  of  interventional cardiologists technically skilled at balloon aortic valvuloplasty  and  transcatheter  aortic  valve  replacement, the differences in anatomy and patient  population  necessitate  collaboration  with an ACHD cardiologist for younger patients.

4.2.4.1. Turner Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The management of valve dysfunction is generally as directed by the 2014 VHD guideline. S4.2.4.1-3  Aortopathy is a commonly associated condition, and frequently involves the mid-ascending aorta, which may not be reliably seen on TTE. Measurement of aortic dimensions with  magnetic  resonance  angiography  and  CCT  has not been standardized, and clinicians should be wary of comparisons of reported diameters between modalities. Side-by-side comparisons are more reliable for detecting changes over time. Baseline and routine serial measurements  of  the  aortic  size  are  useful,  with  imaging interval determined by the indexed size and rate of  progression.  Pregnancy  in  Turner  syndrome,  which often requires assisted reproductive technology, is associated with an increased risk of aortic dissection, especially if there is a preexisting abnormality of the aortic valve or aorta. S4.2.4.1-4

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Women with Turner syndrome are at substantial risk of BAV, CoA, and aortic enlargement, which can  result  in  morbidity  and  mortality  if  left  untreated. Therefore, evaluation is necessary to help decide what interventions may be necessary and provide  accurate  risk  assessment  for  exercise, pregnancy, or other considerations that could be influenced by aortic pathology.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Because  of  case  series  reporting  dissection  at smaller aortic diameters than in non-Turner aortopathy,  prophylactic  surgery  is  reasonable  at lower  diameters,  particularly  if  rapid  dilation  is present.  Measurements  must  take  into  account the  patient's  stature  either  by  indexing  to  body surface area utilizing Turner-specific normative data or by using ratio of aortic area to body height.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4.2.4.2. Aortopathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  CHD  subtypes  and/or  repairs  are  associated with  enlargement  of  the  aorta.  The  management  of these varies by condition, as some are perceived to have a stronger association with aortic dissection or rupture than others, although the true natural history of most is  unknown. There is wide heterogeneity of timing of surgical referral, which makes interpretation of longitudinal studies problematic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BAV is the most common CHD, is associated with aortopathy, and is of high concern for aortic complications, as discussed in other guideline statements. S4.2.4.2-1S4.2.4.2-3  Although in many published series of aortic dissection, BAV patients account for a higher proportion of  dissections  than  expected  from  prevalence  of  BAV

in the general population alone, the risk of dissection or  rupture  amongst all BAV patients is less clear. The largest population study reported a 0.5% risk of aortic rupture or dissection after a mean of 16 years of followup, S4.2.4.2-4  although 11% underwent elective aortic surgery. Risk factors for aortic complications were age and an enlarged aorta at baseline. Frequency of dissection in BAV disease is higher in adults with Turner syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A dilated neoaortic root after a Ross procedure is not uncommon, although only a single dissection has been reported. S4.2.4.2-5 Because  of  this,  it  is  generally  believed that  prophylactic  root  replacement  strategies  based  on sinus of Valsalva diameters can be less aggressive after a Ross procedure than in a native BAV patient, but practice patterns vary. Most patients with a Ross repair had underlying congenitally abnormal aortic valves (BAV or unicuspid aortic valve) and, therefore, are at risk of the ascending aortic dilation typical of those abnormalities. Thus, in addition to the dilation at the sinuses of Valsalva associated with the Ross repair, dilation of the native ascending aorta above the sinotubular junction can also occur.

Although patients with conotruncal abnormalities (TOF , dextrotransposition of the great arteries [d-TGA] after arterial switch, S4.2.4.2-6-S4.2.4.2-8 pulmonary atresia with VSD, truncus arteriosus) commonly have aortic diameters of 40 mm to 50 mm, aortic complications are extremely rare (only 6 published case reports). S4.2.4.2-9-S4.2.4.2-14 Therefore, there is no strong justification for empiric prophylactic surgery in such patients based solely on aortic diameter. Watchful observation has often been recommended unless surgery is being undertaken for other indications. S4.2.4.2-15  However, there are rare patients who develop substantially greater aortic  enlargement  and  for  whom  prophylactic  surgery may have more of a role. Risk factor management such as control of hypertension is important. There are no RCTs evaluating the efficacy of medical therapy to reduce the rate of progression of aortic dilation or incidence of aortic dissection in this population.

4.2.5. Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a relatively rare condition overall but is seen commonly in patients with Williams syndrome or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The stenotic ridge tends to occur distal to the coronary artery orifices at the sinotubular junction. In addition to pressure load physiology similar to other causes of LVOT obstruction, coronary abnormalities can occur, including significant coronary ostial stenosis resulting in risk of SCD and anesthesia risk. S4.2.5-10-S4.2.5-14 Unlike subAS or valvular aortic stenosis, the coronary arteries are exposed to the higher pressure generated by the supravalvular obstruction.

 TTE  with  Doppler  imaging  is  useful  in  deriving peak and mean pressure gradients across the area of supravalvular aortic stenosis from apical, suprasternal, and right parasternal views; however, visualization of the full extent of supravalvular aortic stenosis with TTE is limited. TEE is superior in this regard, and 3D TEE allows excellent visualization of the narrowed ascending aorta. CMR and CTA provide  comprehensive  and  detailed  images  of supravalvular  aortic  stenosis  and  are  used  with echocardiography in the assessment of patients before and after repair. S4.2.5-15

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Impaired coronary perfusion may occur because of  varying  degrees  of  aortic  valve  leaflet  adhesion  to  the  narrowed  sinotubular  junction  or because  of  fibrotic  thickening  in  the  area  immediately  surrounding  the  coronary  ostia.  This causes ostial stenosis with restriction in diastolic filling  of  the  coronary arteries; the left coronary is most frequently involved. TEE with Doppler can be used in the assessment of proximal coronary patency and to search for flow turbulence. CMR can also be used in assessing the coronary ostia. Electrocardiographic-gated  CT  coronary  angiography or invasive selective coronary angiography provides excellent visualization of the coronary arterial anatomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CoA typically  occurs  near  the  ductal  remnant  and  left subclavian artery. Hypertension is the most common sequela of CoA, whether repaired or unrepaired. BAV is commonly associated with CoA and is present in more than half of CoA patients. S4.2.6-15-S4.2.6-21 Intracranial aneurysms may occur. Ascending aortic aneurysms are often found in those with BAV, and aneurysms are seen at the site of coarctation repair in the descending thoracic aorta or arch. Dissection can occur, presumably more likely in the setting of poorly controlled hypertension. Even with excellent repair, hypertension remains common and predisposes to later myocardial infarction, stroke, and HF .

evidence of recoarctation can be found on clinical examination  and  echocardiography,  aneurysms near the site of repair may not be well seen by echocardiography. Patients who have undergone surgical  patch  repair  are  at  an  increased  risk  of developing aneurysms that can be evaluated by CMR or  CTA.  After  successful  transcatheter  intervention  with  stenting  or  balloon  angioplasty, follow-up CMR or CTA imaging is recommended to evaluate for long-term  complications (eg, aneurysm  formation,  stent fracture, or stent migration). S4.2.6-1  The same CMR or CTA study will also evaluate the ascending aorta, which may become aneurysmal over the years of follow-up.

 Unoperated adults with CoA almost invariably  present  with  systemic  arterial  hypertension measured in the upper extremities. Brachial and femoral  pulse  timing  and  amplitude  evaluation on  physical  examination  reveals  a  delay  or  decrease in amplitude of the femoral pulse. Upper and lower extremity noninvasive blood pressure measurement is recommended in all patients with unoperated or operated/intervened CoA.

 Multiple studies have demonstrated an increased frequency of intracranial aneurysm in adults with CoA. Approximately 10% of patients with CoA have  intracranial  aneurysms  identified  on  magnetic  resonance angiography or CTA. Increasing age  has  been  identified  as  a  risk  factor.  Many such  identified  aneurysms  are  small;  however,

the  expected  outcome  and  ideal  management of  such  aneurysms  are  not  clear.  Providers  and patients should be aware of management uncertainties  when  considering  routine  screening  for aneurysms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Despite successful surgical repair or transcatheter intervention, hypertension can persist and may not be identified during resting blood pressure measurement. Up to 80% of patients with prior CoA intervention manifest an abnormally elevated upper extremity  exercise  blood  pressure  response,  and peak blood pressure is correlated with increased LV mass. S4.2.6-24 Moreover, restenosis of the previously repaired  or  stented  region  may  be  identified  by increased peak blood pressure response, increased upper to lower extremity blood pressure gradient with exercise, and  increased Doppler velocity across the coarctation site during exercise TTE.

 Significant  native  or  recurrent  aortic  coarctation has  been  defined  as  follows:  upper  extremity/ lower  extremity  resting  peak-to-peak  gradient >20 mm Hg or mean Doppler systolic gradient >20 mm Hg; upper extremity/lower extremity gradient >10 mm Hg or mean Doppler gradient >10 mm Hg plus either decreased LV systolic function or AR; upper extremity/lower extremity gradient >10 mm Hg or mean Doppler gradient >10 mm Hg with collateral  flow.

Valvular  PS  is  one  of  the  most  common  congenital  heart defects, estimated to occur in up to 7% of children  born  with  CHD. S4.3.1-9-S4.3.1-11   Some  common findings  associated  with  isolated  valvular  PS  include a dilated main PA and dysplastic valve cusps. Surgical or catheter-based intervention depends on degree of obstruction, RV pressure and function, and associated symptoms. Patients with isolated pulmonary valve stenosis (native or recurrent after an intervention) require ongoing  cardiac  follow-up  and  monitoring  for  evidence  of  progressive  valve  stenosis  or  regurgitation, RV  hypertrophy,  HF,  and  arrhythmias. S4.3.1-12 Patients with  mild  native  pulmonary  valve  stenosis  (Table  22) have a reassuring  natural  history,  and  intervention  is not usually necessary. Patients with severe PS (Table 22)

Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum is a rare congenital heart lesion that is associated with varying  degrees of RV hypoplasia and tricuspid valve hypoplasia in addition to pulmonary valve atresia. Adults with pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum followed  various  surgical  pathways  in  childhood,  either biventricular repair, 1 1/2 ventricular repair, Fontan procedure, transplant, or shunt palliation. S4.3.1-13  Adults with history of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum have a high incidence of need for reintervention and management of atrial arrhythmias. S4.3.1-14, S4.3.1-15 Restrictive  RV  physiology  is  common  in  adults with history of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular  septum  and  may  be  associated  with  substantial ventricular  fibrosis S4.3.1-16   and  RV-dependent  coronary circulation.

when there is marked dysplasia of the pulmonary valve or significant hypoplasia of the annulus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Relief  of  a  severely  stenotic  pulmonary  valve  in an asymptomatic patient will reduce the RV pressure and the possibility of potential sequelae. As in symptomatic patients, the procedure can be performed by surgery or interventional catheterization with low morbidity and mortality. If intervention is deferred, careful follow-up to evaluate for symptoms,  decline  in  exercise  capacity,  worsening  RV function, or development of cyanosis is important and may prompt reconsideration of intervention.

4.3.1.1. Isolated PR After Repair of PS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although many patients with valvular PS do not require intervention,  some  have  PS  that  is  severe  enough  to warrant intervention, often in infancy or childhood. PS can be alleviated either by surgical valvotomy or with balloon valvuloplasty. Either surgical or catheter intervention  may  result  in  hemodynamically  important  PR that can result in symptoms, RV enlargement, and/or dysfunction requiring pulmonary valve replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients  with  isolated  PS  who  have  previously undergone  an  intervention  on  the  pulmonary valve require ongoing clinical follow-up and monitoring of PR, RV size and function, and functional capacity. This may  include echocardiography, CPET, and advanced imaging. The right ventricle in patients with PR after intervention for PS may be  smaller  than  in  patients  with  TOF;  however, patients with PR may have evidence of decreased RV  ejection  fraction  or  decreased  exercise  capacity. Pulmonary valve replacement can improve symptoms  for  patients  with  symptoms  that  are

<!-- PAGE=? -->
attributable to moderate or greater PR, and can improve RV size and/or RV function if there is RV dilation or decreased RV ejection fraction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 PR resulting from treatment of isolated PS may have progressive  impact  on  RV  size  and  function,  and may result in symptoms, such that pulmonary valve replacement would be considered. Serial follow-up for  clinical  evaluation,  CPET ,  and  imaging  to  evaluate  for  symptoms,  exercise  intolerance  attributable to PR, and/or RV dilation or RV dysfunction will allow appropriate timing of intervention if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 There are no data to suggest appropriate timing for pulmonary valve replacement in the presence of RV dilation, but it is likely inappropriate to directly extrapolate the data applicable to patients with TOF. S4.3.1.1-1  However, RV dilation or dysfunction should improve, or at least not progress further, if the volume overload from PR is alleviated by pulmonary valve replacement. Thus, although specific RV size criteria are not available for these patients to determine timing of pulmonary valve replacement, patients with progressively worsening  RV  size  or  function  presumably  represent  a subset  of  patients  for  whom  valve  replacement could be beneficial.

4.3.2. Branch and Peripheral Pulmonary Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary branch and peripheral PS can be isolated, occur as part of a constellation of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction, or be found in association with a syndrome (eg, Noonan, Alagille, Williams, maternal rubella exposure). Intervention decisions are typically based on symptoms, distribution of pulmonary blood flow, RV function, and RV systolic pressure. TTE is a good modality to obtain RV pressure and function but does not adequately image the peripheral pulmonary arteries.  Alternative  imaging  (eg,  CMR,  CCT)  can  visualize anatomic obstructions and branch PA anatomy. In addition, CMR and pulmonary perfusion testing can quantify relative pulmonary blood flow.

 Cardiac  follow-up  and  imaging  may  include evaluation  of  RV  pressure;  quantifying  relative pulmonary blood flow and imaging for evidence of  residual  lesions  or  PA  obstruction  or  aneurysm at sites of prior intervention; and in-stent stenosis  and/or  stent  fracture  (the  latter  often best  seen  by  fluoroscopy).  Stenting  of  branch PA stenosis is effective in reducing the pressure gradients,  but  patients  often  require  further intervention. S4.3.2-2 In-stent  stenosis  with  a  reduction in the ipsilateral pulmonary blood flow is  seen in approximately 25% of patients after percutaneous  PA  angioplasty  and  stent  placement, more common in patients with abnormal pulmonary arteries, such as those with TOF or Williams  syndrome.

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Double-chambered  right  ventricle  is  uncommon  in adults. Hypertrophied muscle bundles develop in the RV cavity, creating RVOT obstruction. S4.3.3-5,S4.3.3-6 It is commonly associated with a VSD.

 VSD is often present and may communicate with the higher or lower pressure chamber in the right ventricle,  with  resulting  differences  in  shunt  direction and flow characteristics. In patients with a severe gradient through the right ventricle, the VSD may be associated with right-to-left shunting if proximal to the obstruction, or associated with left-to-right  shunting  if  distal.  Exercise  testing performed in a subjectively asymptomatic patient will often be abnormal. Patients may benefit from repair of both the VSD and outflow obstruction, especially if exercise capacity is decreased.

4.3.4. Ebstein Anomaly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ebstein  anomaly  is  an  uncommon  congenital  heart defect occurring in about 0.005% of live births. S4.3.4-16S4.3.4-18 It  is  a  malformation of the tricuspid valve and the  right  ventricle  and  varies  in  severity,  including babies who do not survive infancy, asymptomatic adults diagnosed incidentally in the sixth and seventh decades of life, and many variations in severity between those extremes. Ebstein anomaly can occur with other defects including ASD, VSD, and PS. A patent foramen ovale, otherwise usually considered normal, may have significant  impact  in  Ebstein  anomaly.  Accessory  pathways and  arrhythmias  are  relatively  common.  Patient  surveillance  and  management  varies  depending  on  age, severity  of  the  lesion,  and  associated  abnormalities including  HF,  cyanosis,  and  arrhythmias.  Surveillance includes echocardiographic and other advanced imaging to assess RV size and function, rhythm assessment, pulse  oximetry,  and  stress  testing.  Treatments  include medical and surgical therapy for patients with manifest symptoms as well as catheter-based structural and electrophysiological interventions when indicated.

 Deciphering  the  anatomy  and  size  of  the  right atrium and right ventricle  in  Ebstein  anomaly  is often difficult using echocardiography alone, particularly in adults. Data obtained from CMR can inform clinical care and surgical planning or decision-making, because CMR data correlate well with intraoperative findings.

 Two-dimensional  and  3D  TEE  can  better  define the anatomy and function of the tricuspid valve before surgery and provide valuable information in planning surgical repair.

 Approximately  one  third  of  adults  with  Ebstein anomaly and ventricular preexcitation have multiple accessory pathways, associated with a high risk of SCD. Adults with Ebstein anomaly also have a high prevalence  of  atrial  tachyarrhythmia. S4.3.4-3,S4.3.4-4 In  the  setting  of  ventricular  preexcitation,  atrial tachyarrhythmia  may  expose  the  patient  to  a higher  risk  of  lethal  ventricular  arrhythmia.  In patients with clinical supraventricular tachycardia, management is according to existing GDMT. S4.3.4-19 A Pediatric & Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES)/HRS expert consensus document provides additional information on the management of arrhythmias. S4.3.4-20

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Concealed  accessory  pathways  are  common  in Ebstein anomaly and may coexist with manifest

<!-- PAGE=? -->
accessory  pathways.  In  addition,  preexcitation may be present but difficult to appreciate on the surface  ECG.  Tricuspid  valve  surgery  can  hinder transcatheter access to right-sided accessory pathways and the slow pathway in AV node reentry, such that it may be reasonable to assess for arrhythmia substrates and proceed with catheter ablation if identified, before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Data demonstrate that delay of surgery until HF or  RV  systolic  dysfunction  ensues  is  associated with  poorer  outcomes;  surgery  before  either  of those  develops  is  recommended. S4.3.4-6,S4.3.4-7,S4.3.4-10 Ebstein anomaly is understood as not just valve disease but also a myopathic process. Consequently, threshold for operation may be different than in other RV volume-loading lesions, because there is more concern regarding the capacity of the myopathic Ebstein right ventricle to tolerate a volume load.  Also,  there  are  cohort  series  of  Ebstein patients to inform decisions. S4.3.4-6,S4.3.4-7,S4.3.4-10 Surgical repair generally consists of tricuspid valve repair (preferred when feasible) or replacement, selective plication of atrialized right ventricle, reduction  atrioplasty,  arrhythmia  surgery,  and/or closure of atrial level shunt. Surgery may result in improvement of symptoms and functional ability, and prevent or delay worsening symptoms.

 Adults with Ebstein anomaly and ventricular preexcitation  often  have  multiple  accessory  pathways, which are associated with a higher risk of SCD.

 Systemic  desaturation  and  arrhythmias  are  frequently signs of worsening hemodynamics, progressive  TR,  or  worsening  RV  function.  Surgery for  the  tricuspid  valve  as  well  as  closure  of  the ASD or stretched patent foramen ovale and arrhythmia  surgery  can  be  beneficial.  When  arrhythmia surgery is required, it typically involves a modified right atrial maze procedure. In the presence of AF, the addition of a left atrial Cox Maze III procedure can be beneficial to reduce the risk of recurrent AF.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The use of the bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt is much more common in children than in adults. When it is applied in the adult, it is usually reserved for patients with severe RV dysfunction  with  concern  that  the  right  ventricle  will not  tolerate  supporting  the  entirety  of  stroke volume. S4.3.4-6,S4.3.4-15 Preoperative  catheterization to  determine  hemodynamics  and  feasibility  of applying  the  bidirectional  cavopulmonary  shunt becomes  progressively  more  important  in  older patients, particularly those with longstanding hypertension with LV hypertrophy, which can lead to diastolic dysfunction and elevated pulmonary pressures.

4.3.5. Tetralogy of Fallot

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term survival after surgery for TOF continues to improve. However, residual hemodynamic and electrophysiological abnormalities are common in adulthood. Adults with repaired TOF face an increased risk of arrhythmias,  exercise  intolerance,  HF,  and  death  beginning  in  early  adulthood. S4.3.5-1,S4.3.5-18-S4.3.5-20 Surgical  repair  of  TOF  has  evolved  over  time,  with  relief  of  the RVOT  obstruction  usually  involving  infundibulotomy, resection of obstructive muscle bundles, and the use of a patch to enlarge the pathway from the right ventricle to  the  pulmonary  arteries.  These  procedures  result  in scar tissue and create a dyskinetic and often aneurysmal area in the RVOT. Residual RVOT stenosis, branch PA stenosis, residual ASD or VSD, TR, RV dilation and dysfunction, aortic dilation, AR, and LV dysfunction are some of the anatomic and functional abnormalities encountered in patients with repaired TOF. The most common hemodynamic sequela of TOF repair is PR. Current  evidence  confirms  that  adults  with  repaired  TOF are  at  risk  of  severe  PR,  RV  dilation  and  dysfunction, LV dysfunction and electromechanical dyssynchrony, all of  which contribute to adverse clinical outcomes late after  TOF  repair. S4.3.5-1,S4.3.5-20-S4.3.5-24 Despite  intense  interest and numerous publications on pulmonary valve replacement in adults with repaired TOF, optimal timing  for  this  intervention  remains  uncertain,  and  most studies have focused on preoperative RV volumes that would  result  in  normalization  of  postoperative  RV volumes.

 Cardiac  magnetic  resonance  imaging  is  the  gold standard imaging modality for quantification of  right  ventricular  size  and  function  in  patients with repaired TOF. It also allows for quantification of  valve  regurgitation  and  pulmonary  and  systemic flows as well as delineating pulmonary artery  anatomy and detection of scar tissue in the ventricular  myocardium.  Serial  cardiac  magnetic resonance imaging examinations allows for longitudinal follow-up of patients with repaired TOF and provides useful information that aids in the timing of pulmonary valve replacement. S4.3.5-1,S4.3.5-34-S4.3.5-37

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Before any surgical or percutaneous intervention in  patients  with  TOF,  the  origins  and  proximal courses of the coronary arteries should be delineated. Patients with repaired TOF and abnormal coronary  artery  anatomy  have  a  substantial  risk of  coronary  artery  compression  during  percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement or direct injury  to  the  coronary  during  surgical  pulmonary valve  replacement.  During  cardiac  catheterization, the coronary pattern may be demonstrated by  performing  simultaneous  RVOT  angiography and  coronary  angiography. S4.3.5-2   Coronary  compression  testing  generally  involves  simultaneous coronary  angiography  or  aortography  and  balloon  dilation  of  the  RVOT  to  ascertain  whether

In adults with TOF, inducible sustained VT has been associated with an increased risk of clinical VT or SCD, beyond standard ECG, hemodynamic, and clinical factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Cardiac  catheterization  is  the  only  method  that can accurately and reliably determine PA pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Symptomatic patients (with dyspnea, chest pain, and/or exercise intolerance otherwise unexplained)  with  repaired  TOF  and  severe  PR  who undergo pulmonary valve replacement often report improved functional class after intervention. Improvement in symptoms often correlates with a reduction in RV size and relief of PR. S4.3.5-9-S4.3.5-11 Symptom improvement is more likely in patients with underlying PS and PR than in patients with PR alone. For patients with significant LV or RV dysfunction,  pulmonary  valve  replacement  may not be tolerated or sufficient; therefore, evaluation by ACHD cardiologists and HF cardiologists is  appropriate  to  decide  appropriate  course  of action, particularly in deciding if a patient may be appropriate for mechanical circulatory support or heart transplant.

 There are data that indicate that pulmonary valve replacement performed prior to specific ventricular  size  is  associated  with  normalization  of  RV volumes. However, it is not yet evident that this correlates  with  an  improvement  in  mortality. Clinically, it therefore is most compelling to perform pulmonary valve replacement if 2 of the following are met: S4.3.5-1,S4.3.5-9,S4.3.5-12-S4.3.5-14

The  increasing  use  of  CMR  in  the  longterm  follow-up  for  patients  with  repaired  TOF has  provided  quantification  of  ventricular  size, function, and PR. However, there is lack of consensus regarding optimal indications and timing of pulmonary valve replacement in this population. Pulmonary valve replacement results in reduction of RV volume and relief of PR; however, these  are  only  surrogates  for  outcomes.  Many patients with repaired TOF may deny symptoms yet  demonstrate  reduced  exercise  tolerance. Pulmonary  valve  replacement  in  such  patients has  been  associated  with  improved  functional status. S4.3.5-9,S4.3.5-10

The  largest  study  of  patients  with  repaired TOF  and  ICDs  included  121  patients  from  11 North American and European sites followed for a  median  of  3.7  years  after  ICD  implantation. Overall, 30% of patients received at least 1 appropriate ICD discharge, corresponding to annual appropriate  shock  rates  of  7.7%  and  9.8%  for primary  and  secondary  prevention  indications, respectively. S4.3.5-16 Unlike  patients  with  acquired HF, evidence suggests that patients with TOF who have inducible sustained polymorphic VT (hazard ratio: 12.9) fare as poorly as or worse than those with  inducible  sustained  monomorphic  VT. S4.3.5-5 Negative  consequences  associated  with  ICDs  in adults with TOF must be carefully considered in selecting  appropriate  candidates.  These  include high  rates  of  inappropriate  shocks  (5%  to  6%

 In  patients  with  repaired  TOF  and  moderate  or greater PR who are undergoing cardiac surgery for a separate lesion (eg, RVOT aneurysm, TR, branch PA  stenosis,  residual  VS  D,  arrhythmia  ablation, coronary  artery  revascularization,  aortic  root  replacement), it may be reasonable to concurrently perform pulmonary valve replacement. S4.3.5-41

 Although correction of the hemodynamic lesion (ie,  PR),  may  be  clinically  beneficial,  pulmonary valve  replacement  alone  has  not  consistently been demonstrated to reduce risk of subsequent VT or SCD.

 Coronary compression testing generally involves simultaneous  selective  coronary  angiography  or aortography and balloon dilation in the RVOT, to ascertain whether a balloon expanded stent will compress  the  coronary  artery.  Coronary  artery compression  with  conduit  balloon  angioplasty or  stenting  occurs  in  approximately  5%  to  6% of  patients  with  right  ventricle-to-PA  conduits and  usually  involves  the  left  main/left  anterior descending in those with conventional coronary anatomy.  Patients  with  anomalous  right  or  left coronary  arteries  are  at  risk  of  coronary  compression as are those with reimplanted coronary arteries.

Annualized rate of IE is up to 2.4% of patients treated  with  Melody  valve  implantation,  but  infection in most cases involves valves other than the Melody valve, including left-sided valves. S4.3.6-3, S4.3.6-17-S4.3.6-20 Patients typically present with fever and malaise as well as worsening PS or PR. Cases may respond well to medical management with intravenous  antibiotics  if  IE  is  identified  and treatment  initiated  early  in  the  disease  course, although sometimes surgical removal of the valve may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Although noninvasive imaging with echocardiography, CMR, or CTA provides a reasonably comprehensive  assessment  of  ventricular  function, conduit function, and patency as well as pulmonary arterial anatomy, cardiac catheterization is  reasonable  to  directly  assess  hemodynamics in  the  setting  of  clinical  decompensation.  Direct assessment of intracardiac and pulmonary arterial pressures and cardiac output provides useful information regarding volume status, pulmonary arterial resistance, and degree of conduit stenosis or regurgitation. Because of anatomic and technical factors,  noninvasive  imaging  may provide equivocal information and may underestimate the degree of conduit stenosis or regurgitation; invasive assessment is especially important in such cases.

 Right ventricle-to-PA conduit intervention includes surgical  replacement  or  percutaneous  stenting and/or transcatheter valve placement.

or transcatheter conduit intervention to relieve stenosis and/or regurgitation. Transcatheter stenting and  pulmonary  valve  replacement  may  be  performed with high procedural success and low mortality rates, and result in improved hemodynamics and  improved  exercise  capacity.  Surgical  conduit replacement carries a higher risk of periprocedural complications  with  good  long-term  outcomes. Predictors  of  conduit  dysfunction  and  reoperation include placement of small diameter conduits; therefore,  insertion  of  conduits  with  the  largest possible diameter should be attempted, S4.3.6-8 anticipating that subsequent valve replacement may be via a transcatheter approach.

 Right ventricle-to-PA conduit intervention, which includes  surgical  replacement  or  percutaneous stenting  and/or  transcatheter  valve  placement, may  be  reasonable  in  asymptomatic  patients with severe right ventricle-to-PA conduit stenosis or  regurgitation  in  the  presence  of  reduced  RV systolic function or dilation in the expectation of improvement  in  hemodynamics,  decreased  RV size,  improved RV stroke volume, and improved RV ejection fraction. Moreover, peak oxygen consumption and anaerobic threshold may also improve with conduit intervention.

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common problems for patients with d-TGA with atrial switch  (Mustard  or  Senning  procedure)  include  leak across or obstruction of the venous pathways, arrhythmias, need for pacemakers/defibrillators, and systolic dysfunction  of  the  systemic  ventricle.  Although  reports describing these sequelae abound, data that inform management decisions are sparse, and many of the most common clinical issues cannot be addressed by data-supported recommendations. Two such issues are medical therapy for RV dysfunction and prevention of SCD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The systematic review report, 'Medical Therapy for Systemic Right Ventricles: A Systematic Review (Part 1) for the 2018 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of  Adults  With  Congenital  Heart  Disease,'  has  the complete  systematic  evidence  review S4.4.1.1-3 for  additional data and analyses. The results from the question 'Are outcomes improved with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta blockers, or aldosterone antagonists alone or in combination in patients with a systemic right ventricle?' and the  writing  committee's  review  of  the  totality  of  the literature  demonstrated  that  medical  therapy  for  systolic ventricular dysfunction remains largely uncertain. Consequently, no recommendations regarding specific medical therapy for systolic dysfunction of the systemic right ventricle can be made.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to the report provided by the ERC regarding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin-receptor  blocker,  and  aldosterone  antagonist  use for patients with systemic right ventricles, beta blockers and other commonly used HF medications lack data to support recommendations in the treatment of atrial switch  patients. S4.4.1.1-4-S4.4.1.1-7 Concerns  regarding  routine use of beta blockers for asymptomatic RV dysfunction include potentially greater predisposition to bradycardia and limited distensibility of the interatrial baffle, which  creates  a  preload  limited  physiology. S4.4.1.1-8 Although no clear benefit has been demonstrated for HF medical therapy overall, there is speculation of benefit in more symptomatic patients or those with larger and/ or more dysfunctional right ventricles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with dysfunction of the systemic right ventricle are at risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias. The  role  of  ICD  implantation  for  primary  prevention of arrhythmia in patients with a low systemic ventricular  ejection  fraction  is  uncertain.  This  practice  is  unsupported  by  any  research  and  cannot  be  universally recommended. Many such patients do not progress to receive therapies from their device. S4.4.1.1-2 Decisions regarding primary prevention ICD implantation is based on  the  patients'  full  clinical  presentation  and  in  consultation  with  cardiac  electrophysiologists  with  ACHD expertise.

 There  is  a  progressive  loss  of  sinus  rhythm  in patients  who  have  undergone  the  Senning  or Mustard procedure for d-TGA, and the development of significant sinus bradycardia, while often asymptomatic,  is  important  to  identify,  because it  will  influence  and  limit  treatment  with  antiarrhythmic medications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients  with  d-TGA  with  atrial  switch  have  abnormal cardiac anatomy, with common long-term complications including systemic RV dysfunction,  TR,  subpulmonic  obstruction,  obstruction of  systemic  or  pulmonary  venous  return,  and baffle leaks. Imaging  should  be  goal-directed with  an  understanding  of  potential  long-term sequelae, and nuanced for the patient's particular circumstances. S4.4.1.1-9 CMR  offers  quantification of systemic RV function and should be used routinely unless there are contraindications. Late gadolinium enhancement is an important tool that can identify  areas  of  myocardial  scar  that  are  associated with adverse clinical markers including atrial arrhythmia. S4.4.1.1-10 The  importance  of  change  in late gadolinium enhancement over time in directing care is less clear, so repetitive use of gadolinium contrast for this purpose is of less value.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Recognizing  both  the  abnormal  venous  pathways after atrial switch palliation and the risk of thromboembolic complications from transvenous pacing  leads  in  those  with  intracardiac  shunts, thorough assessment of the venous pathways for either obstruction or baffle leak is a prudent step before  lead  placement  or  revision.  Baffle  leaks should  be  sought  because  they  are  common and may alter treatment considerations such as thromboembolic concerns or options for closure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  using  agitated  saline  contrast is a sensitive method for this assessment. It is unnecessary on every study, but interval assessment of  baffle  leak  is  appropriate,  especially  in circumstances where therapy may be altered by the  result.  In  some  patients,  injection  in  upper and lower extremities may be necessary to evaluate  superior  and/or  inferior  systemic  venous baffle leak, respectively, because a negative study from  an  injection  in  upper  extremity  may  not exclude  an  inferior  systemic  venous  baffle  leak. Assessment for baffle leak may involve use of TTE with  agitated  saline  contrast,  TEE,  intracardiac echocardiography, or angiography. S4.4.1.1-1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Sustained intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia is a potential cause of SCD in adults who have undergone atrial switch and puts patients at risk for thromboembolism. Treatment to maintain sinus rhythm may involve antiarrhythmic medication or catheter ablation. Although there are not data demonstrating  that  maintenance  of  sinus  rhythm  prevents SCD,  there  is  evidence  that  atrial  arrhythmias preceded or coexisted with VT in 50% of cases, suggesting that atrial arrhythmias are a common trigger for ventricular arrhythmias.

There is a biologically plausible explanation that may include longer atrial tachycardia cycle lengths in the context of extensive atrial sutures/scar that could favor rapid (eg, 1:1) ventricular conduction, a  reduction  in  stroke  volume  with  faster  heart rates  attributable  to  poor  atrial  transport,  and myocardial ischemia despite the absence of CAD attributable to an inefficient coronary circulation supplying the systemic ventricle. S4.4.1.1-12 Efforts to maintain  sinus  rhythm  or  atrial  pacing  (and  not simply rate control) should be the initial strategy of management,  acknowledging  that  patients  may rarely tolerate permanent atrial tachycardia when attempts to maintain sinus rhythm have failed.

Atrial arrhythmias predominantly involve tissue of right atrial origin which, because of the surgical anatomy, is found primarily in the pulmonary venous atrium, making access for catheter ablation challenging.

4.4.1.2. Transposition of the Great Arteries With Arterial Switch

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications after the arterial switch include: 1) stenosis at the arterial anastomotic sites, most commonly supravalvular PS; 2) neoaortic root dilation; 3) neoaortic valve regurgitation (native pulmonary valve); and 4) coronary  obstruction.  Evaluation  for  the  first  3  complications listed is accomplished by usual imaging, including echocardiography, CCT, and/or CMR. Coronary complications  are  inadequately  evaluated  by  resting echocardiography, and stress imaging in asymptomatic patients is not sensitive. It is unclear that coronary abnormalities will present de novo or that those present in childhood will progress. However, because patients did not receive an arterial switch before the late 1980s, the long-term natural history of the coronary arteries after arterial switch is still unknown. This is particularly true regarding the impact of risks for concomitant acquired coronary artery disease in patients whose coronary substrate is not normal. At this time, investigation and management of suspected coronary abnormalities in adults with the arterial switch for TGA should largely be  symptom-driven  and  in  accordance  with  existing guidelines for acquired coronary artery diseases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  residua  and  sequelae  in  adults  after  arterial  switch merit consideration of reoperation. Severe RVOT obstruction (Table 22) not amenable or responsive to percutaneous treatment is an indication for reoperation; lesser degrees of obstruction can be considered an indication for intervention if greater degrees of  exercise  are  desired.  Pulmonary  valve  replacement or repair is often considered when severe PR is present and there is significant RV dilation or RV dysfunction. Coronary ostial stenosis late after arterial switch may be repaired by coronary artery bypass graft surgery or ostial arterioplasty techniques. The threshold aortic diameter  at  which  dissection/rupture  risk  exceeds  the risk of operation is not known, and consequently the threshold for prophylactic operation for neoaortic root dilation is undefined.

 Imaging in patients after arterial switch should be performed with specific sequelae in mind, including PS (recognizing the Lecompte maneuver has been used during surgery in most), and neoaortic root and valve problems.

 Because of nuances of the arterial switch, decisions  regarding coronary intervention should be considered jointly by ACHD providers and those with expertise in coronary revascularization techniques. Abnormalities commonly occur proximally and  close  to  the  anteriorly  positioned  coronary buttons.  Coronary  buttons  are  usually  located posterior to the main PA after the Lecompte maneuver. Revascularization techniques may include revision of the coronary buttons, ostioplasty, interposition grafts, or coronary bypass grafting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 There is evidence that coronary abnormalities are common after arterial switch (6% to 10%), especially  in  the  setting  of  coronary  anomalies  at birth, or extensive manipulation of the coronaries at the time of the operation. However, most coronary problems and events described so far tend to occur in childhood in the first few years after surgery, with limited experience in adults, S4.4.1.2-1, S4.4.1.2-2,S4.4.1.2-4,S4.4.1.2-5 although the prevalence of  coronary  issues  may  increase  as  the  population  ages.  Physiological  testing  lacks  sensitivity. Therefore, a benchmark assessment of the anatomic course and patency of the coronary arteries (ie, catheter angiography or CT angiography) is  prudent  in  adults  in  whom  this  information has  not  already  been  obtained.  MR  coronary angiography may also be an option for evaluating coronary patency. S4.4.1.2-9 Thereafter, coronary  investigations  will  be  prompted  largely  by symptoms.

 Decisions  about  the  indications  and  approach for coronary intervention after an arterial switch can  be  guided  according  to  management  recommendations  for  care  of  atherosclerotic  coronary disease, emphasizing prudent medical therapy  and  a  symptom-guided  approach  to intervention. S4.4.1.2-6,S4.4.1.2-8 The  unique  aspects  of the  anatomic  abnormalities  and  unusual  course of the proximal coronary arteries must be kept in mind,  mandating  collaboration  between  ACHD providers and those with the necessary surgical or interventional expertise.

 Although some degree of neoaortic valve regurgitation is common, surgery to replace the neoaortic valve has only rarely been reported. Indications for valve replacement should be based on LV size and/or  symptoms  according  to  the  2014  VHD guideline. S4.4.1.2-6   The  more  common  concern  is dilation  of  the  neoaortic  root  with  preserved aortic  valve  competence.  Valve-sparing  root  replacement is often considered in such cases, but surgical  options  should  be  individualized  based upon  anatomy  and  changes  over  time.  There are  not  data  to  support  a  specific  aortic  diameter beyond which the risk of dissection or rupture increases sufficiently to warrant prophylactic aortic replacement.

The  clinical  course  of  adults  with  CCTGA  often  depends on the presence and severity of associated cardiac  anomalies, S4.4.1.4-6 which  will  often  have  required pediatric intervention. Rarely, CCTGA may be first diagnosed in adulthood, particularly if patients do not have associated  cardiac  lesions.  Conduction  abnormalities are common, and the prevalence of spontaneous complete  heart  block  increases  with  age. S4.4.1.4-7,S4.4.1.4-8 PS, ASD, and VSD are common. Seventy percent to 90% of patients with CCTGA have a dysplastic or Ebsteinlike malformation of the tricuspid valve.

 Symptomatic adults with CCTGA and severe TR with no more than mildly depressed systemic ventricular function should be evaluated for tricuspid valve replacement. In general, tricuspid valve replacement is preferred to tricuspid repair in the adult CCTGA population. TR is often because of a dysplastic tricuspid valve and has been shown to be an independent predictor of death in CCTGA patients. S4.4.1.4-4   Systemic RV dysfunction is often attributable to longstanding TR, and efforts should be made to relieve the TR before worsening dysfunction. S4.4.1.4-3,S4.4.1.4-9 Tricuspid valve repair has been attempted; however, recurrent clinically significant TR is observed frequently after tricuspid valve repair in patients with CCTGA; hence, valve replacement is preferred.

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fontan repairs are the most common palliation of single ventricle physiology seen in adults. The physiology is  complex,  with  long-term  consequences  related  to the obligatory elevation in central venous pressure and reduced cardiac output. Proposed medical therapy for the 'failing Fontan,' which may manifest as proteinlosing enteropathy, hepatic dysfunction, lower extremity  venous  congestion,  and/or  exercise  limitation,  has included  many  different  modalities,  although  there  is limited  proven  benefit  in  published  research.  Options for medical therapy include aldosterone antagonists or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, which may stabilize the proteoglycan layer of the gut. PAH therapies are of increasing interest. Endothelin antagonists have been studied in a single RCT, which showed improved exercise capacity in 75 subjects randomized to bosen- tan compared with placebo. S4.4.2-19  Two other small nonrandomized studies demonstrated minimal response to therapy. S4.4.2-22,S4.4.2-23

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids,  specifically  budesonide,  may  be helpful for Fontan patients with hypoalbuminemia in the  setting  of  protein-losing  enteropathy  poorly  responsive to other therapies. Budesonide seems to have fewer  systemic  effects  than  other  oral  steroids;  however,  close  monitoring  for  signs  of  hypercortisolism remains necessary. S4.4.2-28,S4.4.2-29  Octreotide may be considered; it is a therapy with favorable but very limited anecdotal  experience  reported,  with  further  research needed. S4.4.2-28,S4.4.2-30   A combination of these therapies may be applied in an affected patient, as such strategies  collectively  appear  to  have  produced  improved outcome compared with historic controls. S4.4.2-31

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fontan surgery has been associated with prolongation  of  atrial  refractory  periods,  extensive  atrial  scarring,  and  intra-atrial  conduction  delay. S4.4.2-32-S4.4.2-38 Sinus node dysfunction occurs in up to 45% of adults during  long-term  follow-up  after  Fontan  surgery  and has  been  associated  with  a  reduction  in  preload  to the single ventricle, increased pulmonary venous pressure, reduced cardiac output, plastic bronchitis, and protein-losing  enteropathy. S4.4.2-39-S4.4.2-43   Transvenous atrial pacing may be feasible in most adults with atriopulmonary Fontan connections and in some with intracardiac lateral tunnels, S4.4.2-44  although the potential for thrombotic complications must be addressed. Ventricular  pacing may be performed via the coronary sinus in  selected  patients,  but  most  require  an  epicardial approach. S4.4.2-45,S4.4.2-46   Management  of  atrial  arrhythmias is discussed in the associated recommendations.

 Atrial  tachyarrhythmias  occur  in  up  to  60%  of adults  with  Fontan  palliation  and  are  associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. S4.4.2-2 These arrhythmias may be difficult to manage, are usually poorly tolerated, and cause serious hemodynamic compromise  often  with  dire  consequences. S4.4.2-1 Therefore,  they  should  be  addressed  promptly, including urgent consultation with ACHD providers who can help guide immediate management strategies, even if remotely. Consideration for antithrombotic therapy in Fontan patients should take into account the high prevalence of thrombus formation and potentially catastrophic impact of pulmonary  or  systemic  thromboembolus.

‡CMR may be indicated for assessment of the long-term sequelae of Fontan palliation: thrombosis, right-to-left shunts (eg, fenestration. intrapulmonary atrioventricular malformation), obstructive lesion, systemic atrioventricular valve dysfunction, ventricular size and function, collateral burden, and branch pulmonary artery obstruction. Baseline study is recommended with periodic followup CMR, with frequency of repeat imaging determined by anatomic and physiological findings.

§CCT may be used if CMR is not feasible and to evaluate cross-sectional imaging status-post stent therapy. CCT with contrast injection in Fontan patients can be misleading; therefore, it should be done only when clinically indicated and when it can be appropriately protocoled and interpreted. If CCT is used instead of CMR imaging, the frequency should be weighed against radiation exposure.

decision-making  strategies  about  rhythm  versus rate  control  or  thromboembolic  prophylaxis  derived  from  and  recommended  for  patients  with acquired  heart  disease  and  AF  do  not  apply  to patients with Fontan physiology, for whom rhythm control and anticoagulation are of greater importance than would be concluded from application of the standard algorithms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinus node dysfunction may predispose Fontan patients to atrial tachyarrhythmias, the most  common  being  macro-reentrant  circuits or intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia. S4.4.2-13,S4.4.2-47 Nearly  90%  of  Fontan  patients  who  die  from HF have coexisting atrial tachyarrhythmias. S4.4.2-48 Fontan patients are at increased risk of complications  from  antiarrhythmic  therapy,  such  as  torsades de pointes with dofetilide S4.4.2-49 and  amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. S4.4.2-50  Such agents should  be  used  cautiously  and  in  consultation with  ACHD  cardiologists  and  electrophysiology specialists with expertise in ACHD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Serial imaging can be valuable for assessing many of  the  long-term  sequelae  of  Fontan  palliation such as thrombosis, right-to-left shunts (eg, fenestration, intrapulmonary AV malformation), obstructive  lesions,  systemic  AV  valve  dysfunction, diastolic  or  systolic  ventricular  function,  collateral burden, and branch PA obstruction. Imaging can  be  challenging  and  requires  informed  understanding about the patient's particular situation.  Although  CCT  is  possible  in  patients  with Fontan  physiology,  it  is  challenging  to  ensure contrast  dispersal  through  the  pulmonary  vasculature  because of streaming of venous return

 Hemodynamic assessment, particularly of the pulmonary circulation, is crucial to making informed decisions  about  the  type  and  timing  of  surgical intervention.

 Hemodynamic problems may first manifest through  arrhythmia.  Thus,  first  presentation  of arrhythmia  should  warrant  thorough  review  of the  patient's  Fontan  circulation  and  ventricular function.

 Aerobic  exercise  may  help  maintain  respiratory mechanics,  which  can  improve  transpulmonary flow in the Fontan circulation. Stroke volume during exercise and exercise capacity are directly related to skeletal muscle function. Consequently, strength  training  may  improve  exercise  capacity in patients with Fontan palliation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 There  is  increasing  recognition  of  hepatic  vulnerability after Fontan palliation, including cirrhosis S4.4.2-6,S4.4.2-53   but uncertainty about which patients  are  at  highest  risk,  or  how  to  address problems  when  identified.  Routine  assessment of  liver  function  and  structure  may  help  inform broader decisions such as timing and risk of surgery or transplantation, as well as provide insights into the emerging natural history of this unique condition. Consultation with a hepatologist may be  of  value  in  interpreting  and  following  the liver  abnormalities  encountered  in  patients  with Fontan physiology.

 Because of both the anatomic and physiological complexities of these patients, and the potential for  concurrent  intervention,  hemodynamic  and interventional cardiac catheterization of the adult with single ventricle/Fontan palliation should be performed only by persons with expertise in CHD in coordination with an ACHD cardiologist. Recognizing that it is difficult to accurately assess Fontan hemodynamics by clinical examination or noninvasive imaging, cardiac catheterization may be needed in these scenarios and others:

 Protein-losing enteropathy and plastic bronchitis contribute substantially to perioperative mortality, yet  transplantation  may  be  curative. S4.4.2-9,S4.4.2-11 Medical  therapy  options  are  often  ineffective. Therefore, consideration of transplantation early in the course of PLE may be warranted. Evaluation of additional organs is necessary, particularly the liver, as these patients are susceptible to cirrhosis as  a  consequence  of  the  Fontan  circulation. Although symptoms may improve, there are no published  data  regarding  impact  on  survival  for transplanted Fontan patients with PLE compared with those who do not undergo transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Although catheterization plays an important role  in  management  of  single  ventricle/Fontan patients,  it  is  often  driven  by  symptoms.  The role  of  routine  hemodynamic  assessment  is  less certain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Fontan  circulation  imparts  risk  of  thrombosis, and  anticoagulation  with  vitamin  K  antagonists should be offered as preventive therapy in clinical  situations  including  prior  arrhythmia. S4.4.2-60 Patients may also benefit from anticoagulation if they  have  significant  residual  intracardiac  rightto-left shunt or veno-veno collaterals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Catheter ablation has been associated with improved clinical status despite the frequent coexistence of multiple arrhythmia substrates. S4.4.2-61 Given the progressive nature of the atrial myopathy, successful ablation is less frequent than in acquired heart disease or other congenital heart diseases, and recurrence is common. The development  of  new  arrhythmias  over  time  remains problematic,  but  multiple  ablation  procedures may be justified in selected patients. S4.4.2-13,S4.4.2-14

 Conversion  to  a  total  cavopulmonary  connection Fontan combined with a modified right atrial Maze  procedure  may  be  considered  in  patients with symptomatic refractory recurrent intra-atrial reentrant  tachycardia. S4.4.2-16,S4.4.2-17 In  the  presence of  documented AF, a left  atrial  Cox  Maze procedure may  also be indicated. S4.4.2-16,S4.4.2-62 Some  patients  may  not  be  appropriate  surgical candidates for reasons of elevated PA or Fontan pressures, elevated ventricular end-diastolic pressures, or renal or hepatic dysfunction, and the decision to perform Fontan revision surgery is rarely straightforward.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Pulmonary vasoactive medications, specifically endothelin receptor antagonists and PDE-5 inhibitors,  are  of  increasing  interest  as  a  means of  reducing  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  and improving cardiac output. In limited studies, use of PDE-5 inhibitors appears favorable for Fontan patients  with  improvement  noted  in  pulmonary blood flow and exercise capacity. S4.4.2-21,S4.4.2-63  Use of endothelin antagonists has been investigated in a randomized trial. S4.4.2-19  After 14 weeks of randomization in 69 subjects successfully completing the study, there was a modest but significant increase in peak oxygen consumption and exercise duration in those taking bosentan compared with those on placebo.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Although  anticoagulation  is  prudent  in  those with  prior  arrhythmia  or  known  thromboembolic events, routine use of anticoagulation with vitamin  K  antagonist  cannot  as  yet  be  strongly recommended.  An  RCT  in  Fontan  children/adolescents  did  not  show  benefit, S4.4.2-64   although adults  later  after  Fontan  may  be  more  at  risk. However, a secondary analysis of that RCT as an observational study S4.4.2-65  found the risk of thromboembolism was lower in those patients on warfarin who consistently achieved minimum target international  normalized  ratio  levels,  as  well  as in  those  on  acetylsalicylic  acid  compared  with patients who often failed to meet target international normalized ratio level. Rates of thrombosis were considerably higher in patients on warfarin who  did  not  consistently  achieve  target  international  normalized  ratio.  A  study  of  modes  of

S4.4.2-1 Direct  oral anticoagulants are unstudied and thus cannot be recommended at the present time. There are concerns about liver function vulnerability in Fontan patients, which theoretically may increase the risk of complications with some of those agents.

 There  are  occasions  where  surgery  or  catheter intervention  may  be  alternatives  to  transplantation  for  a  'failing  Fontan'  after  weighing  risks and benefits of the intended procedure (ie, alleviation of atrioventricular valve regurgitation, systemic or pulmonary venous pathway obstruction). Reoperation  for  atrioventricular  valve  regurgitation may be high-risk, particularly when systemic ventricular  function  is  impaired.  Although  valve repair  is  preferred  and  operative  risk  is  usually lower, it is not always possible. Risk of valve replacement in this setting is high.

4.4.3. Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome/Norwood Repair

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Norwood repair is the first of 3 steps in palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome and consists of atrial septectomy, transection, and ligation of the distal main PA with construction of a systemic-to-PA shunt, and anastomosis of the proximal stump of the main PA to the hypoplastic ascending aorta with augmentation of the entire aortic arch from the sinotubular junction to beyond the ductus arteriosus. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is fatal unless surgical palliation is performed in the neonatal period. Subsequent surgeries include a bidirectional  cavopulmonary  anastomosis  (often  performed around 6 months of age), followed finally by a Fontan procedure (often at approximately 2 to 4 years of  age).  Sequelae  of  hypoplastic  left  heart  syndrome are largely those of the Fontan palliation, but additional concerns  related  to  the  underlying  anatomy  and  the Norwood repair is important in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. These include aortic obstruction related to anastomosis of the PA and aorta, and neoaortic  dilation.  Additionally,  native  anatomy  wherein coronary  arteries  arise  from  a  small  aortic  root  make coronary ischemia a greater concern than in other underlying disorders managed with Fontan repair. The frequency and spectrum of long-term sequelae specific to the Norwood repair are not yet known.

4.4.4. Truncus Arteriosus

Truncus  arteriosus  in  the  adult  has  almost  invariably been  repaired  in  childhood,  and  in  the  rare  circumstances  when  an  adult  has  unrepaired  truncus  arteriosus,  Eisenmenger  physiology  is  typical.  Pulmonary hypertension  may  be  present  in  repaired  patients. The  types  of  operative  repairs  may  involve  VSD  clo- sure, right ventricle-to-PA conduit placement, reconstruction of the pulmonary arteries, and replacement of the truncal (neoaortic) valve. Unifocalization of the pulmonary arteries may be necessary in very complex cases.  The  aorta  may  be  dilated.  Recommendations regarding  assessment  and  management  of  truncus arteriosus can generally be inferred in the recommendations  for  the  specific  components,  including  right ventricle-to-PA conduit, VSD, aortic valve disease, and aortopathies.

4.4.5. Double Outlet Right Ventricle

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Double outlet right ventricle is an anatomic descriptor that includes abnormalities similar to TOF in some patients (when the aorta is closely related to the VSD) and similar to d-TGA with a VSD in others (when the PA is more closely related to the VSD than the aorta). Repairs  are  predicated  on  the  underlying  anatomy and may involve VSD closure with relief of PS, right ventricle-to-PA conduit, or Rastelli-type repair. In severe cases, single-ventricle physiology may be present. Consequently, recommendations for the management of a patient with double outlet right ventricle can generally be inferred in the recommendations for the lesion  with  the  most  similar  anatomy  and  physiology (eg, TOF can reasonably be based on the recommendations  in  Section  4.4.1,  recognizing  that  a  patient with double outlet right ventricle is more likely to have residual LVOT obstruction).

Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary hypertension is defined as elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure to ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest and does  not  imply  a  specific  underlying  pathophysiology. Pulmonary hypertension is further classified on the basis of the presumed mechanism (including elevation of pulmonary  venous  pressure  [denoted  as  'postcapillary pulmonary  hypertension'],  parenchymal  or  restrictive lung  disease,  rheumatologic  disease,  portal  hypertension,  toxin  exposure,  and  thromboembolism). It is also classified  by  developmental  or  acquired  anatomic  abnormalities of decreased pulmonary arterial capacitance, impedance, or stenosis throughout the pulmonary arterial vascular bed. PAH as initially described required pulmonary venous pressure ≤ 15 mm Hg with concomitant elevation  of  pulmonary  vascular  resistance.  Although left-to-right  shunting was the initial research model of triggered PAH, pulmonary hypertension in patients with ACHD can be caused by, or associated with, any of the factors described above. Effective therapies may be specific to the primary mechanism of pulmonary hypertension in a given patient, so patients with CHD should have thorough investigation for all potential contributing etiologies to pulmonary hypertension that may require specific therapy if best clinical outcomes are to be achieved. Adverse effects of pulmonary hypertension therapies in patients with ACHD with pulmonary hypertension may differ  from  those  noted  in  other  patients,  because  of concomitant multiorgan and vascular effects from longstanding congenital heart and vascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Shunt-related  PAH  in  patients  with  ACHD  can  develop in the pre- or perioperative period but also may develop  years  to  decades  after  closure  of  defects. Mechanisms for development of PAH may include genetic factors and environmental exposures. Severity of PAH may range from incidentally noted mild pressure and resistance elevation to profound systemic or suprasystemic levels of PA pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. If an anatomic defect that allows shunting is present, shunt reversal and cyanosis may develop as pulmonary  resistance  rises  above  systemic  resistance (ie, Eisenmenger syndrome).

Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients  with  ACHD  with  pulmonary  hypertension,  particularly  PAH,  have  a  poorer  prognosis than do patients with ACHD with similar histories and anatomic abnormalities who do not have pulmonary hypertension. The fields of ACHD and pulmonary vascular disease care have increasingly disparate  but  complementary  bodies  of  knowledge,  and  both  are  necessary  to  achieve  optimal outcomes for patients with PAH. Clinicians cross-trained in both subspecialties or partnering experts from each subspecialty appear necessary to fully counsel patients with ACHD with PAH regarding: diagnostic evaluation, prognosis, lifestyle choices, suitability for operative or catheter-based repair of existing shunts or vascular obstructions contributing to PAH, nature and effectiveness of additional medical therapies, mechanical circulatory and pulmonary vascular support, and goals of care.

Echocardiography may demonstrate subpulmonic ventricular dysfunction and/or enlargement  and  estimate  central  venous  and  PA pressures. However, echocardiography alone is  insufficient  to  accurately  determine  PA pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance, so echocardiography is best used in conjunction with data obtained at cardiac catheterization when making decisions about instituting or changing therapy for PAH.

 Cardiac catheterization remains the standard for accurate  diagnosis  of  pulmonary  hypertension syndromes  and  for  selection  of  optimal  therapies  for  patients  with  ACHD  with  pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Mechanical interventions targeting relief of anatomic contributors to PAH (eg, closure of septal or  great  arterial  defects  to  eliminate  shunting) may be considered as part of short-term plans of care for patients with ACHD with PAH. However, even modest residual levels of PAH substantially determine  intermediate  and  longer-term  outcomes.  Patients  should  be  followed  for  pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Although history, noninvasive testing, and laboratory analysis (biochemistry and hematology) are all  part  of  the  workup  of  pulmonary  hypertension associated with CHD, cardiac catheterization with  careful  hemodynamic  measurements,  with or without provocative maneuvers and/or angiography, remains fundamental to accurate diagnosis and design of therapeutic plans.

4.4.6.2. Eisenmenger Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synopsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Historically  Eisenmenger  syndrome  has  been  understood  as  the  most  advanced  form  of  PAH  associated with congenital intracardiac and great arterial shunting. The  natural  course  and  outcomes  of  PAH  in  patients with ACHD with Eisenmenger syndrome, as contrasted to other adults with PAH, remain incompletely defined. However,  it  is  believed  that  better  survival  and  functional ability of untreated adults with Eisenmenger syndrome might be explained by sharing of loading conditions between right- and left-sided cardiac chambers, as well as multiorgan system adaptations that develop over time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  fundamental  cause  of  Eisenmenger  syndrome is elevated pulmonary vascular resistance driving rightto-left intracardiac or great arterial shunting leading to systemic arterial desaturation. The risk of development of Eisenmenger syndrome is influenced by concomitant congenital syndromes, anatomic location of congenital defects, size of anatomic defects, genetic factors, and environmental exposures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to development of Eisenmenger syndrome are not fully understood.  Suggested  triggers  and  pathways  include blood  flow-induced  shear  and  circumferential  stress, vasoconstriction, and vascular cell proliferation associated with fibrosis and thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyanosis,  erythrocytosis,  abnormalities  of  loading conditions, and abnormalities of systemic and pulmonary  perfusion  all  contribute  to  functional  incapacity and  potential  for  multiorgan  system  dysfunction  and other sequelae, including stroke, brain abscess, osteo-

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Palliative therapies that may be helpful include supplemental oxygen if systemic arterial oxygen saturation is empirically noted to rise in response, systemic anticoagulation, and avoidance of circumstances recognized to contribute to risk (eg, high altitude, pregnancy, exposure to high heat or humidity leading to vasodilation, nephrotoxin  exposure,  extreme  exertion,  large  shifts in intravascular volume). However, supportive data for these strategies are limited or nonexistent. Systemic anticoagulation has the potential for adverse as well as possible helpful effects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical circulatory and pulmonary support, lung transplantation  with  concomitant  repair  of  anatomic cardiovascular defects, and heart-lung transplantation have all been applied in patients with ACHD with Eisenmenger syndrome with deteriorating functional ability. Indications  for  such  therapies  for  adults  with  Eisenmenger  syndrome  are  not  standardized;  comparative outcomes have not been tested, and to date successes have  been  limited.  However,  pharmacological  treatment of PAH is helpful in the management of certain patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.

 Right-to-left shunting through septal defects or connections  between  the  great  arteries  associated with subpulmonary ventricular hypertension may  be  diagnosed  as  Eisenmenger  syndrome. PAH medications may be beneficial for patients with  Eisenmenger  syndrome;  however,  other conditions  may  cause  right-to-left  shunting  for reasons other than shunt-related PAH and thus may  require  different  treatment  options.  These other conditions include: a) severe pulmonary hypertension of other cause (eg, thromboembolic disease,  rheumatic  disease),  b)  subpulmonary chamber outflow obstruction, c) abnormalities of subpulmonary chamber compliance, and d) vascular streaming. Accurate diagnosis is necessary to  guide  therapy.  For  example,  PAH  therapies will  not  be  beneficial  if  the  source  of  right-toleft shunting is RVOT obstruction; rather, alleviation  of  the  RVOT  obstruction  is  the  necessary

<!-- PAGE=? -->
treatment.  Accurate  diagnosis  of  Eisenmenger syndrome and exclusion of other potential contributors  to  right-to-left  shunting  or  pulmonary hypertension by means of advanced imaging and cardiac  catheterization  are  crucial  prerequisites to optimize therapy for adults with Eisenmenger syndrome.

 In adults with Eisenmenger syndrome associated with ASD or VSD in World Health Organization functional class III or IV, RCTs demonstrate improved 6-minute walk distance, hemodynamics,  and  subjective  functional  ability  after  4 months  of  oral bosentan. S4.4.6.2-17   Longer-term benefit  has  been  demonstrated  through  openlabel  extension  of  this  initial  RCT S4.4.6.2-1 and  in single-center registry cohorts. S4.4.6.2-1,S4.4.6.2-17  There may  be  a  class  effect  for  endothelin  receptor antagonists, but others have not been studied in this population.

 A randomized crossover trial of combination PAH therapy (PDE-5 inhibitor therapy and endothelin receptor antagonist therapy) enrolled adults with Eisenmenger  syndrome  or  with  idiopathic  PAH and  demonstrated  improvement  in  systemic  arterial  saturation  but  not  in  functional  ability  or hemodynamics. S4.4.6.2-6   Use  of  combination  PAH therapy  for  adults  with  Eisenmenger  syndrome was  further  supported  by  a  single-center  cohort series suggesting improvement in 6-minute walk  testing  and  hemodynamics  in  adults  with Eisenmenger syndrome using combined PDE-5 inhibitory therapy and endothelin receptor antagonist therapy.

 Open-label  single-center  registries  and  cohort studies  of  adults  with  Eisenmenger  syndrome, attributable  to  shunts  other  than  ASD/VSD  or with  complex  congenital  heart  lesions,  suggest benefit  in  functional  capacity  or  hemodynamics after  months  of  endothelin  receptor  antagonist therapy. S4.4.6.2-1,S4.4.6.2-7   Patients  with  ACHD  and Down  syndrome  have  greater  likelihood  to  develop  pulmonary  hypertension,  and  they  have unique comorbidities that influence the nature of their pulmonary hypertension, the metrics used in follow-up, and the potential for benefit from as well as adverse response to therapy. Open-label single-center registries and cohorts of adults with Down  syndrome  and  Eisenmenger  syndrome suggest  benefit  in  subjective  and/or  objective functional capacity after months of endothelin receptor antagonist therapy, generally as contrasted to  performance  before  institution  of  endothelin receptor antagonist therapy. S4.4.6.2-8-S4.4.6.2-10 Accurate diagnosis of PAH and Eisenmenger syndrome  remains  essential  before  initiating  such therapy.

4.4.7. Coronary Anomalies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coronary  abnormalities  are  among  the  most  common congenital  cardiovascular  anomalies,  surpassing in  prevalence  nearly  all  others  combined.  Coronary anomalies include anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA), coronary fistula, and myocardial bridge. Many congenital coronary abnormalities have a benign outcome. In contrast, natural history studies of anomalous coronary artery from the PA (particularly anomalous left coronary artery from the PA) suggest poor  outcome  in  untreated  patients;  similar  natural history studies are lacking regarding untreated patients with AAOCA, but other evidence raises concern. See Table 34 and Figure 5 for a diagnostic and treatment algorithm for AAOCA.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment  of  the  risk  of  SCD  in  patients  with AAOCA and of the role of AAOCA in causing ischemia or symptoms is difficult because available data do not adequately capture the clinical spectrum of these anomalies. Autopsy series are available that help describe the anomalies found in patients who suffered SCD contrasted to other causes of death. S4.4.7-1-S4.4.7-5 There  are  surgical  case  series  that  describe  findings before operation, operative anatomy and postoperative course. S4.4.7-2,S4.4.7-5-S4.4.7-8  There are imaging studies describing  the  anatomy  and  potential  pathophysiological  abnormalities  associated  with  AAOCA. S4.4.7-6, S4.4.7-9-S4.4.7-11 There  are  surgical  series  describing  improvement  in  symptoms  after  operation. S4.4.7-6-S4.4.7-8 There  are  surveys  and  registries  that  describe  the heterogeneous  management  strategies  applied  to AAOCA. S4.4.7-12-S4.4.7-14 What  is  lacking  are  data  proving that any particular management strategy prevents SCD. As a consequence, decisions regarding whether surgery  is  necessary  or  exercise  restriction  or  medical therapy might be beneficial are all based on synthesizing  limited  data  and  applying  to  an  individual patient. Clinicians commonly extrapolate to assist in medical  decision-making,  but  the  consequences  of

being 'wrong' for a young patient with AAOCA may be perceived to be greater than for many other conditions.  Consequently,  there  is  often  a  clinical  urge to seek a reason to do something like surgical repair, because the available data do not identify clinical features that provide reassurance that a patient is at low risk of cardiovascular events. Unfortunately, evidence demonstrating  that  surgical  repair  ameliorates  SCD risk, derived from large enough cohorts followed over a sufficient period of time, is not available.

4.4.7.1. Anomalous Coronary Artery Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 CTA, CMR, and catheterization can all delineate the  proximal  course  of  the  coronary  artery  and relationship to other structures. CTA is generally preferred because it has superior spatial and temporal  resolution,  although  CMR  may  also  provide adequate delineation of the relationship of the  coronary  artery  to  the  aorta,  PA  and  other structures, including whether the proximal course appears to be intramural. Coronary angiography by catheterization can be helpful when there is concern about stenosis in the coronary artery or when concomitant hemodynamic evaluation for shunt  assessment  or  intravascular  ultrasonography/flow evaluation is needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Assessment  of  AAOCA  is  enhanced  when  the precise  anatomy  and  physiological  impact  of the coronary artery anomaly are understood. As described in Table 34, the specific anomalous origin,  anatomy of the orifice and proximal vessel and presence of  ischemia  may  all  influence  the clinical course and thus the management options. Understanding  these  issues  as  precisely  as  possible will better inform clinical decisions.

4.4.7.2. Anomalous Aortic Origin of Coronary Artery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 In patients with symptoms related to AAOCA, repair of the anomaly should alleviate symptoms. In autopsy and surgical series, cardiac symptoms are more common in patients with a left coronary artery  arising  from  the  right  coronary  cusp.  In  autopsy studies of patients who died because of an anomalous  coronary  artery,  fibrosis  is  a  common finding, suggesting that ischemia preceded the terminal event. However, there are patients in whom a SCD event occurred despite normal stress ECG, and consequently absence of ischemia is not reassuring.  Autopsy  series  show  that  many  patients whose death is attributed to anomalous coronary arteries  are  young,  thus  management  of  patients should  take  age  into  account,  with  heightened concern about the risk of sudden death in younger patients. S4.4.7.2-7-S4.4.7.2-9

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Anomalous left coronary from the right sinus is less common than anomalous right coronary from the left sinus, S4.4.7.2-10 but anomalous left coronary artery from the right is more commonly found in autopsy series of athletes and military recruits who had nontraumatic death than right coronary from the left sinus. S4.4.7.2-1,S4.4.7.2-11-S4.4.7.2-13 The  overrepresentation of the anomalous left coronary from the right sinus suggests a higher risk of SCD, particular at extremes of exertion and in patients <35 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  are  some  anatomic  features  that  are thought to be associated with increased risk of compromise of coronary flow and/or SCD, including a fish-mouth-shaped or slit-like orifice, or intramural course, S4.4.7.2-14 although the slit-like orifice is more commonly encountered in a right coronary arising from the left cusp. It is difficult to quantitate the absolute risk of SCD associated with anomalous aortic origin of the left coronary from the right sinus, and data  demonstrating  that  surgery  ameliorates  the SCD  risk  have  not  been  published.  Until  studies suggest  otherwise,  limited  data  and  expert  consensus suggest that it is reasonable that adults with this malformation should undergo surgical unroofing unless there are extenuating circumstances that would make surgery high risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 In patients with ventricular arrhythmias presumed related to ischemia caused by anomalous origin of a coronary artery, repair is an option to alleviate the ischemia and presumably mitigate the recurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. However, care should be individualized, as there may be other factors (eg, CAD,  cardiomyopathy,  residual  ischemia)  contributing to ventricular arrhythmias that warrant continued vigilance and additional therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary from the left sinus is more common than anomalous aortic origin of the left coronary from the right sinus. The risk of SCD with the former malformation is difficult to quantitate. There is some physiological rationale to  believe  that  asymptomatic  patients  without  evidence  of  compromised  blood  flow  would  benefit from unroofing, but there are not data to demonstrate that surgical interventions alter the risk of SCD. Thus, watchful waiting may be an appropriate course as well, particularly for a patient with an anomalous right coronary arising from the left sinus.

5. EVIDENCE GAPS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There  are  multiple  challenges  to  developing  evidenced-based  care  for  patients  with  ACHD.  The heterogeneity  of  conditions  leads  to  small  numbers of  specific  ACHD  populations  from  which  to  derive guidelines. Additionally, lack of infrastructure to track  prevalence,  fragmented  care  systems,  loss  to follow-up, and changes in treatment strategies over time  all  contribute  to  the  challenges  of  developing GDMT care. S5-1  Comprehensive multicenter and population registries and databases are needed to have adequate  numbers  of  patients  to  address  clinical questions. Novel study methodologies are needed to ascertain effectiveness of diagnostic and therapeutic options when each disease is sufficiently rare and events  occur  over  sufficiently  long  periods  that  RCTs are impractical. Although there are data that patients with  complex  CHD  have  improved  survival  when cared for at an ACHD center, how can networks of care  be  developed  that  ensure  patients  get  the  expert care needed when there are inadequate number of  ACHD  cardiologists  and  ACHD  centers?  How  do we ensure that patients are not lost to care as they transition from pediatric to adult cardiology? How do we ensure that patients with ACHD who would benefit from heart transplantation receive accurate listing priority? See Table 35 for a collection of high-impact research questions in ACHD.

This table represents the relationships of committee members with industry and other entities that were determined to be relevant to this document. These relationships were reviewed and updated in conjunction with all meetings and/or conference calls of the writing committee during the document development process. The table does not necessarily reflect relationships with industry at the time of publication. A person is deemed to have a significant interest in a business if the interest represents ownership of >5% of the voting stock or share of the business entity, or ownership of >$5  000 of the fair market value of the business entity; or if funds received by the person from the business entity exceed 5% of the person's gross income for the previous year. Relationships that exist with no financial benefit are also included for the purpose of transparency. Relationships in this table are modest unless otherwise noted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According to the ACC/AHA, a person has a relevant relationship IF: a) the relationship or interest relates to the same or similar subject matter, intellectual property or asset, topic, or issue addressed in the document; or b) the company/entity (with whom the relationship exists) makes a drug, drug class, or device addressed in the document or makes a competing drug or device addressed in the document ; or c) the person or a member of the person's household , has a reasonable potential for financial, professional or other personal gain or loss as a result of the issues/content addressed in the document .

*The ACHD Guideline began in March 2014. Over the initial years of the CMS Open Payment System, understandably, there have been issues related to accurate reporting of food and beverage payments. For this reason, the ACC and AHA have not considered these minor charges relevant relationships with industry.

†Writing committee members are required to recuse themselves from voting on sections to which their specific relationships with industry and other entities may apply. Section numbers pertain to those in the full-text guideline.

‖ CMS reported payments to Dr. Dearani in 2016 related to research for the Sorin Group and Cormatrix; however, he disagrees with this report. The sections authored by Dr. Dearani have been reviewed, and it was affirmed that there was no implication of any influence of industry.

| Pulmonary hypertension                      | Pulmonary hypertension is a broad term that encompasses pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is pulmonary hypertension with increased pulmonary vascular resistance. This document defines PH and PAH as they are used in the field of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is defined as: Mean PA pressure by right heart catheterization ≥ 25 mmHg. PAH is defined as: Mean PA pressure by right heart catheterization ≥ 25 mmHg and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤ 15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance ≥ 3 Wood units S2.2-20 |
| Shunt (hemodynamically significant shunt) | An intracardiac shunt is hemodynamically significant if: There is evidence of chamber enlargement distal to the shunt And/or evidence of sustained Qp:Qs ≥ 1.5:1 An intracardiac shunt not meeting these criteria would be described as small or trivial |
| Venous and arterial stenosis               | Aortic recoarctation after CoA repair Supravalvular aortic obstruction Venous baffle obstruction Supravalvular pulmonary stenosis Branch PA stenosis Stenosis of cavopulmonary connection Pulmonary vein stenosis               |

| Administration of anesthesia for invasive procedures in patients with ACHD AP classification IB-D, IIA-D, and IIIA-D * | 1. Performed by, or in collaboration with, an anesthesiologist with expertise in the management of patients with ACHD. | 1. ACHD-specific issues need to be addressed when considering anesthesia, including underlying cardiac physiology and hemodynamics, and the effects of anesthetic medications and ventilation strategies. The application of anesthesia for laparoscopic procedures can be especially challenging in Fontan patients. Significant cardiovascular and respiratory alterations may occur as a result of increased intra-abdominal pressure and decreased venous return. Abdominal insufflation may lead to lower preload and hypotension, while at the same time elevating systemic vascular resistance and compromising cardiac output. Elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance attributable to hypercarbia can be caused by either direct carbon dioxide absorption or hypoventilation. S3.3-19 | 2. If clinical urgency precludes transfer, consultation with an anesthesiologist with ACHD expertise would be of benefit to on-site providers who do not have ACHD expertise. | 2. Many patients with ACHD have had surgeries in the past, which may have created or identified airway or vascular access concerns. Patients with ACHD can also have underlying restrictive and/or obstructive lung disease that should be considered. S3.3-17,S3.3-18 |
| Patients with ACHD and pulmonary hypertension                                 | 1. Consultation with experts in pulmonary hypertension and ACHD to assist in the interpretation of diagnostic and invasive studies and determine the best course of management. | 1. PAH imparts a poor prognosis compared with CHD without PAH. Because of the complexity of PAH in the setting of CHD, patients with ACHD benefit from the expertise of both ACHD providers and pulmonary hypertension providers. S3.3-20-S3.3-28 Management of PAH in patients with shunts can be difficult. For example, in patients for whom PAH treatment is expected to allow subsequent closure of a shunt, cohort series demonstrate progression of pulmonary vascular resistance or late mortality if defects with associated pulmonary vascular resistance elevation beyond 2.5 Wood units (>4 Wood units×m²) or Qp:Qs >3 were closed. S3.3-29,S3.3-30 The utility of acute administration of pulmonary vasodilator therapy as a marker of reversibility of pulmonary vascular resistance remains uncertain. 'Treat-to-repair' strategies involving use of PAH therapies to bring pulmonary vascular resistance into a range where repair can be considered have been applied, but the utility of such strategies also remains uncertain. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
