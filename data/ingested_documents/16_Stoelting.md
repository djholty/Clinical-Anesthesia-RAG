Nutritional diseases are caused by either an underconsumption  of  essential  nutrients  or  an  overconsumption  of  poor nutrients.  Both  result  in  forms  of malnutrition. Currently, the  most  prevalent  nutritional  disease  worldwide  is  obesity. Because of its detrimental impact on overall health and functional  status,  obesity  is  now  considered  one  of  the  leading preventable  causes  of  medical  illness  in  the  world. Th e  U.S. Surgeon General considers obesity a "national epidemic" and "a  serious public health threat." Most evidence suggests that obesity is due to a combination of elements, including genetic, environmental, psychologic, and socioeconomic factors. Controlling the obesity epidemic will depend on a better understanding of its causes as well as a systems-based team approach to its medical management.

OBESITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Definition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity is de fi ned as an abnormally high amount of adipose tissue  compared  with  lean  muscle  mass  (20%  or  more  over ideal body weight). It is associated with increased morbidity

and mortality due to a wide spectrum of medical and surgical diseases (Table 16-1). Body mass index (BMI) is the most commonly used quanti fi er  of  obesity  despite  the  fact  that  it does  not  measure  adipose  tissue  directly.  BMI  is  calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (BMI = kg/m 2 ). Th is BMI ratio is used because of its simplicity. However, there are fl aws in the formula that should be taken into consideration when using the BMI clinically. For example, those persons with an unusually high percentage of lean muscle mass, such as body builders, may have a high BMI that does not correlate with a high ratio of adipose tissue. In general, calculation of BMI provides a useful predictive indicator  of  weight  categories  that  may  lead  to  health  problems (Table 16-2). It should be noted that the weight category term morbid obesity has been replaced with the term clinically severe obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidemiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Over the past 20 years, obesity has increased dramatically, and it is now recognized as a national public health threat. In the United States in 2007 and 2008, it was estimated that approximately  two  thirds  of  adults  (73  million  people)  were  overweight  or  obese.  Obesity  prevalence  has  steadily  increased, and in 2007 and 2008, it a ff ected approximately 32% of men and 35% of women. Over the last few years, the prevalence of childhood obesity has nearly tripled and is currently estimated at about 25%. As the prevalence of obesity increases, so do its associated health care costs. On average, the annual health care costs for an obese patient are approximately 42% more than for a normal-weight patient. In 2008, $147 billion was spent on obesity-related medical problems.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Currently, obesity is the sixth most important risk factor for  disease  worldwide.  In  addition  to  being  associated  with major comorbid conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease,  obesity  is  also  associated  with  a

Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weight gain results when caloric intake exceeds energy expenditure.  Energy  expenditure  is  primarily  determined  by  basal metabolic rate, which is responsible for maintaining homeostasis of bodily functions. Most metabolic activity occurs within lean tissue and involves small sources of energy expenditure, including the thermal e ff ect  of  physical  activity  and  the  heat produced by food digestion, absorption, and storage. Exercise can  increase  energy  consumption  not  only  during  exercise but for up to 18 hours a ft erward. It does so by increasing the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
thermal e ff ects  of  physical  activity,  and  with  regular  exercise over  time,  the  body's  basal  metabolic  rate  increases.  Caloric restriction  (i.e.,  fasting) without  exercise, on  the  other  hand, leads to a reduction in basal metabolic rate due to promotion of the body's e ff orts to conserve energy. Th is reduction in basal metabolic rate leads to slow weight loss during the dieting phase but rapid weight gain when normal caloric intake is resumed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FAT STORAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A positive caloric balance is stored by the body as fat in adipocytes. Th is fat is primarily in the form of triglycerides. Triglycerides serve as an e ffi cient form of energy storage because of their high caloric density and hydrophobic nature. Adipocytes are able to increase to a maximum size, and then they begin dividing. It is believed that at BMIs of up to 40 kg/m 2 , adipocytes  are  only  increased  in  size,  whereas  in  clinically  severe obesity, there exists an absolute increase in the total number of fat cells. Th e storage of triglycerides is regulated by lipoprotein lipase. Th is enzyme's activity varies in di ff erent parts of the body, and it is more active in abdominal fat than in hip fat. Th e increase in metabolic activity of abdominal fat may contribute to  the  higher  incidence  of  metabolic  disturbances associated with central obesity. Abdominal obesity is more common in men and is therefore known as android fat distribution. Peripheral  fat  around  the  hips  and  buttocks  is  more  common  in women and is known as gynecoid fat distribution. It is currently accepted that a waist-to-hip ratio of more than 1.0 in men and more than 0.8 in women is a strong predictor of ischemic heart disease,  stroke,  diabetes,  and  death  independent  of  the  total amount of body fat. Environmental factors such as stress and cigarette  smoking  stimulate  cortisol  production,  which  may facilitate deposition of extra calories as abdominal fat.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CELLULAR DISTURBANCES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity  leads  to  severe  metabolic  derangements,  mainly because  of  disturbances  in  insulin  regulation.  At  a  cellular level,  fatty  in fi ltration  of  the  pancreas  leads  to  decreased secretion  of  insulin  while,  at  the  same  time,  engorgement

<!-- PAGE=? -->
316

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of  adipocytes  promotes  insulin  resistance.  In  addition,  the engorged  adipocytes  are  capable  of  secreting  various  cytokines,  including  interleukin-1  (IL-1)  and  IL-6  and  tumor necrosis  factorα . Th ese  cytokines  worsen  glucose  intolerance  by  decreasing  the  secretion  of  adiponectin,  a  powerful  insulin  sensitizer.  Leptin,  another  hormone  secreted  by adipose  tissue,  travels  centrally  to  the  ventromedial  hypothalamus and modulates the secretion of neuropeptides that regulate energy expenditure and food intake. Leptin induces satiety when present in high concentrations. Leptin secretion accelerates  in fl ammatory  changes  by  activating  monocytes and  decreasing  the  capacity  of  neutrophils  to  migrate  and activate. Acting in opposition to leptin, the hormone ghrelin increases appetite. Ghrelin appears to modulate appetite both peripherally and centrally by a ff ecting the mechanosensitivity of gastric vagal a ff erents, making them less sensitive to distention and thus facilitating overeating. An antiobesity vaccine  directed  against  the  hormone  ghrelin  is  currently under development. Th e developers are hoping to produce a vaccine that induces an autoimmune response against ghrelin,  preventing it from reaching the central nervous system so that its e ff ects on appetite are suppressed. With abdominal obesity, the high level of fatty in fi ltration of omental adipocytes (usually devoid of fat) leads to an increased in fl ux of fatty acids, hormones, and cytokines. All of these substances eventually stimulate the liver to produce increased levels of very  low-density  lipoproteins  and  apolipoprotein  B.  As  a result the pancreas is stimulated to secrete more insulin and more pancreatic polypeptides. Th e end result is di ff use intracellular in fl ammatory changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GENETIC FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From  a  Darwinian  perspective,  the  ability  of  the  body  to conserve  and  store  energy  probably  conferred  a  survival advantage.  However,  in  a ffl uent  societies  where  food  is very  calorie  dense  and  serving  sizes  are  abnormally  large, this ability to conserve and store energy may actually prove deleterious to survival. For this reason, scientists are looking  for  speci fi c  genes  that  may  favor  energy  storage  and diminish  energy  expenditure  as  possible  explanations  for the current obesity epidemic. Th e discovery of the various hormones responsible for signaling satiety in the brain and thus maintaining a normal body weight has lead scientists to  believe  that  overeating  resulting  in  obesity  may  be  due to  genetic  mutations.  In  fact,  research  suggests  that  many forms of severe obesity may be related to a combination of inherited gene mutations. Genetic factors have been shown to in fl uence the degree of weight gain and to predict which individuals are most likely to gain weight. Statistical analyses suggest that more than half of the variations in individual BMIs are genetically in fl uenced. For example, mutations in  the  gene  that  controls  the  hypothalamic  melanocortin receptor, which is involved in appetite suppression, explains about  5%  of  severe  early  childhood  obesity.  Homozygous mutations in genes responsible for leptin and ghrelin secretion and receptor activity are also associated with extreme childhood  obesity.  However,  it  is  clear  that  the  metabolic consequences from inheritance of maladaptive genes are not entirely responsible for the current obesity epidemic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENVIRONMENT FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Environmental factors, including the consumption of highcalorie foods in combination with decreased physical activity  and  aging,  are  also  important  considerations  in  the development  of  obesity. Th e  technologic  developments  of the past 50 years have contributed signi fi cantly to a decline in physical activity. From the automobile and the TV remote control to electronic gaming systems, our modern environment is designed to promote a sedentary lifestyle. Th ere has also been a change in our food habits with the development of "fast food" and intense food marketing and industry competition. Th ese  new  food  habits  only  amplify  the  obesity problem.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some people try to solve their weight problem by following popular fad diets that claim to aid in weight loss. Although these  "lose-weight-quick"  diets  appear  to  work  initially,  it  is unlikely  that  they  contribute  to  sustained  weight  loss.  Both proteins  and  carbohydrates  can  be  metabolically  converted into fat. Evidence is lacking to prove that changing the relative proportions of protein, carbohydrates, and fat in the diet without  reducing  overall  caloric  intake  will  promote  weight loss. Th e bottom line is quite simple: if an individual is to lose weight and keep the weight o ff , daily energy expenditure must exceed  daily  caloric  intake.  If  daily  caloric  (energy)  intake exceeds energy expenditure by only 2%, the cumulative e ff ect a ft er 1 year is approximately a 2.3-kg (5-lb) increase in body weight. Th e critical elements of weight loss are both diet and exercise. Even slight exertion has been shown to provide some bene fi t to a highly sedentary adult, and the bene fi t is not exclusively related to weight loss. Exercise has a positive impact on cardiovascular  health  and  glucose  control.  It  limits  the  progressive decline in lean body tissue with age, decreases the risk of developing osteoporosis, and improves overall psychologic well-being.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PSYCHOLOGIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In many societies obesity historically was viewed as a sign of  wealth  and  elite  socioeconomic  status.  Today,  however, much more emphasis  is  placed  on  appearing  slim  and fi t. Media  and  marketing  pressures  are  leading  overweight individuals,  particularly  women,  to  experiment  with  quick weight-loss  schemes  and  to  develop  obsessive,  unhealthy eating  disorders  to  avoid  discrimination.  Nearly  37%  of women in the United States are at risk of developing major depression  related  to  obesity.  Eating  disorders  linked  with both  depression  and  obesity  include  binge  eating  disorder and night eating syndrome (Table 16-3). Th ese eating disorders are seen in a large proportion of patients attending obesity clinics. It is important to recognize the characteristics of eating disorders, as well as signs of depression and anxiety, because psychologic assessment and counseling are essential for treatment of these conditions.

treat depression related to obesity can be risky, because many of  these  drugs  are  associated  with  weight  gain  themselves (Table 16-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lack of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation  of  the  labeling  of  the  nutritional  content  of  food  has allowed  the  food  industry  to  sell  foods  rich  in  potentially harmful chemicals that prolong the shelf life of the food and to  add  ingredients  that  increase  the  caloric  density  of  the food without increasing its macronutrient content. Fast food restaurants  have  made  huge  pro fi ts  by  attracting  consumers with sugary and salty foods rich in fats, extracted sugars, and re fi ned starches. All of these may taste good but, when eaten in large quantities, are toxic to the body. Clever marketing trends to "supersize" meal portions to fool consumers into believing they are getting more value for their dollar has also led to an unhealthy and unnecessary increase in calorie consumption.

Diseases Associated with Obesity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity can have detrimental e ff ects on many organ systems. Th e  most  profound  e ff ects  are  on  the  endocrine,  cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, immune, musculoskeletal, and  nervous  systems.  Clinically  severely  obese  individuals have limited mobility and may therefore appear to be asymptomatic even in the presence of signi fi cant respiratory and cardiovascular impairment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENDOCRINE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many of the comorbid conditions caused by obesity are related to  the metabolic syndrome, also  known  as syndrome X. Th is syndrome has been de fi ned in a number of ways. Th e  most accepted de fi nition requires the presence of at least three of the following  signs:  large  waist  circumference,  high  triglyceride

levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glucose intolerance, and hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Type 2

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Excess weight is an important risk factor for the development of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus. Increased adipose tissue leads to increased resistance of peripheral tissues to the e ff ects of insulin, which ultimately results in glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus. Events that increase stress levels in these patients, such as surgery, may necessitate the use of exogenous insulin. Resolution of type 2 diabetes can be achieved in more than three quarters of obese patients by weight loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrinopathies Causing Obesity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Certain diseases of the endocrine system may promote the development  of  obesity.  Examples  are  hypothyroidism  and Cushing's disease. It is important to consider the possibility of an endocrine disorder when evaluating obese patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in obese individuals and may manifest as systemic hypertension, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure. In patients with clinically severe obesity, cardiac function is best at rest and exercise is poorly tolerated. Physical activity may cause exertional dyspnea and/or angina pectoris. Any increase in cardiac output is achieved by an increase in heart rate without an increase in stroke volume or ejection fraction. Changing position from sitting to supine is associated with an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure as well as a decrease in heart rate and systemic vascular resistance. Obese individuals with cardiac dysfunction may choose to sleep sitting up in a chair to avoid symptoms of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. A history of such a sleep pattern should raise concern about the patient's cardiovascular status.

mechanism  of  hypertension  in  obesity  is  multifactorial (Figure  16-1).  Obesity-induced  hypertension  is  related to  insulin  effects  on  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  and extracellular  fluid  volume.  Hyperinsulinemia  appears  to increase circulating levels of norepinephrine; norepinephrine  has  direct  pressor  activity  and  increases  renal  tubular  reabsorption  of  sodium  and  calcium,  which  results  in hypervolemia.  Cardiac  output  increases  by  an  estimated 100  mL/min  for  each  kilogram  of  adipose  tissue  weight gain.  At  the  cellular  level,  insulin  activates  adipocytes  to release  angiotensinogen,  which  activates  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone  pathway;  this  in  turn  leads  to  sodium retention and development of hypertension. An increase in circulating cytokines is seen in obesity, and this may cause damage to and fibrosis of the arterial wall, thereby increasing arterial stiffness. If hypertension is not well controlled, a mixed eccentric and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy can develop that eventually leads to heart failure and pulmonary  hypertension.  Weight  loss  can  significantly improve or even completely resolve hypertension. In general, a decrease of 1% in body weight can decrease systolic blood pressure by 1 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coronary Artery Disease. Obesity seems to be an independent risk factor for the development of ischemic heart disease, and  this  coronary  artery  disease  is  more  common  in  obese individuals  with  central  (abdominal)  fat  distribution. Th is risk is compounded by the presence of dyslipidemia, a chronic in fl ammatory state, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Insulin  resistance and abnormal glucose tolerance are associated with  progression  of  atherosclerosis.  Young  obese  patients are showing a signi fi cant incidence of single-vessel coronary artery disease, particularly in the right coronary artery. Obese men seem to be a ff ected 10 to 20 years before women, which may  re fl ect  a  protective  e ff ect  from  estrogen  that  dissipates a ft er menopause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart  Failure. Obesity  is  an  independent  risk  factor  for heart failure. Possible mechanisms for the development of this heart  failure  are  structural  and  functional  modi fi cations  of the heart resulting from volume overload and vascular sti ff -ness. Th ese changes in obese patients cause pressure overload that  leads  to  concentric  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy,  a  progressively less compliant le ft ventricle, le ft ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and, fi nally, le ft ventricular systolic dysfunction. Increased metabolic demands and a larger circulating blood volume result in a hyperdynamic circulation. Right ventricular a ft erload may be increased because of associated sleepdisordered breathing and changes in le ft ventricular function (Figure 16-2). Insulin resistance also appears to play a signi fi -cant role in the development of heart failure. Cardiac steatosis, lipoapoptosis, and activation of speci fi c cardiac genes that promote le ft ventricular remodeling and cardiomyopathy may contribute  to  obesity-related  cardiomyopathy. Th e  increased demands  placed  on  the  cardiovascular  system  by  obesity decrease cardiovascular reserve and limit exercise tolerance. Cardiac  dysrhythmias  in  obese  individuals  may  be  precipitated by arterial hypoxemia, hypercarbia, ischemic heart disease, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and fatty in fi ltration of the cardiac conduction system. It is important to note that ventricular  hypertrophy  and  dysfunction  worsen  with  the duration  of  obesity.  However,  some  of  these  structural  and functional changes are reversible with signi fi cant weight loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESPIRATORY DISORDERS

Respiratory derangements associated with obesity are related to the presence of redundant tissue in the upper airway, thorax,  and  abdomen  that  a ff ects  lung  volumes,  gas  exchange, lung compliance, and work of breathing.

Lung Volumes

Obesity can produce an extrinsic restrictive pattern of ventilation resulting from the added weight of the thoracic cage or chest wall and abdomen. Th e added weight impedes motion of  the  diaphragm,  especially  in  the  supine  position,  which

results in an overall decrease in functional residual capacity (FRC),  expiratory  reserve  volume,  and  total  lung  capacity. FRC declines  exponentially  with  increasing  BMI.  FRC  may decrease to the point that small airway closure occurs, that is, closing volume becomes greater than FRC. Th is results in ventilation/perfusion mismatching, right-to-le ft intrapulmonary shunting, and arterial hypoxemia. General anesthesia accentuates these changes. A 50% decrease in FRC occurs in obese anesthetized patients compared with a 20% decrease in nonobese individuals. Application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can improve FRC and arterial oxygenation but at the potential expense of cardiac output and oxygen delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decrease in FRC impairs the ability of obese patients to  tolerate  periods  of  apnea,  such  as  during  direct  laryngoscopy for endotracheal intubation. Obese individuals are likely  to  experience  oxygen  desaturation  following  induction  of  anesthesia  despite  adequate  preoxygenation. Th is phenomenon re fl ects a decreased oxygen reserve secondary to the reduced FRC and an increase in oxygen consumption resulting from the increased metabolic activity of excess adipose tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gas Exchange and Work of Breathing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the obese patient's increased body mass, oxygen consumption  and  carbon  dioxide  production  are  increased. To maintain normocapnia, obese patients must increase minute  ventilation,  which  also  increases  the  work  of  breathing. Obese patients will typically increase their minute ventilation by  rapid  shallow  breathing,  because  this  breathing  pattern utilizes  the  least  amount  of  energy  and  may  prevent  fatigue from  the  increased  work  of  breathing.  Clinically  severely obese individuals may exhibit only modest decreases in arterial oxygenation and modest increases in the alveolar-arterial oxygen di ff erence. Th e Pa co 2 and ventilatory response to carbon dioxide remain within the normal range in obese patients, which re fl ects the high di ff using capacity and favorable characteristics of the carbon dioxide dissociation curve. However, arterial  oxygenation may deteriorate markedly on induction

of anesthesia (increased oxygen consumption and decreased oxygen  reserves)  so  that  a  high  fraction  of  inspired  oxygen (F io 2 ) is required to maintain an acceptable level of Pa o 2 and oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung Compliance and Airway Resistance

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased BMI is associated with decreased lung compliance and increased airway resistance. Th e decrease in lung compliance is caused by accumulation of fat tissue in and around the chest wall and abdomen and the added e ff ects of increased pulmonary blood volume. Decreased lung compliance is associated with decreases in FRC and impaired gas exchange. Th ese changes in lung compliance and resistance are most marked when obese individuals assume the supine position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstructive Sleep Apnea

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstructive  sleep  apnea (OSA)  is  de fi ned  as  cessation  of breathing for longer than 10 seconds during sleep. Th ere may be frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep. Hypopnea is a reduction in the size or number of breaths compared with normal ventilation and is associated with some degree of arterial desaturation. Apnea occurs when the pharyngeal airways collapse.  Pharyngeal  patency  depends  on  the  action  of dilator muscles that prevent upper airway collapse. Th e pharyngeal  muscle  tone  is  decreased  during  sleep,  and  in  many individuals, this reduced tone leads to a signi fi cant narrowing of the upper airway, resulting in turbulent air fl ow and snoring. In susceptible individuals this may progress to severe snoring and, ultimately, to sleep apnea. Sleep fragmentation is the most likely explanation for the daytime somnolence, which is associated  with  impaired  concentration,  memory  problems,  and even motor vehicle accidents in patients with sleep apnea. Airway obstruction may induce physiologic changes that include arterial  hypoxemia,  arterial  hypercarbia,  polycythemia,  systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure. In addition, patients may complain of morning headaches caused by nocturnal carbon dioxide retention and cerebral vasodilation. OSA is diagnosed using polysomnography in a sleep laboratory, where episodes of apnea during sleep can be observed and quanti fi ed Th e severity of OSA is measured by the average number of incidents per hour. More than fi ve  incidents  per  hour  is  considered  sleep  apnea  syndrome. Th e main predisposing factors for the development of OSA are male gender, middle age, and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ). Other factors such as evening alcohol consumption or use of pharmacologic sleep aids can worsen the problem. Treatment of OSA is aimed at applying enough positive airway pressure through a  nasal  mask  to  sustain  patency  of  the  upper  airway  during sleep.  Patients  treated  with  positive  airway  pressure  demonstrate  improved  neuropsychiatric  function  and  a  lessening of daytime somnolence. Patients with mild OSA who do not tolerate positive airway pressure may bene fi t  from nighttime application of oral appliances designed to enlarge the airway by keeping the tongue in an anterior position or by displacing the mandible forward. Th e use of drugs such as protriptyline and fl uoxetine to treat OSA has not been shown to be reliably e ff ective. Nocturnal oxygen therapy is another possibility for individuals who experience signi fi cant oxygen desaturation. In severe cases of sleep apnea surgical treatment, including uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, tracheostomy, or maxillofacial surgery (i.e., genioglossal advancement), may be performed. In many instances, weight loss results in a signi fi cant improvement in or even complete resolution of OSA symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is the long-term consequence  of  OSA.  It  is  characterized  by  nocturnal  episodes  of  central  apnea  (apnea  without  respiratory  e ff orts) re fl ecting  progressive  desensitization  of  the  respiratory  center to nocturnal hypercarbia. At its extreme, OHS culminates in pickwickian syndrome, which is characterized by obesity, daytime hypersomnolence, arterial hypoxemia, polycythemia, hypercarbia,  respiratory  acidosis,  pulmonary  hypertension, and right ventricular failure. In patients with OHS, even light sedation can cause complete airway collapse and/or respiratory arrest. All patients with a history of OSA or OHS must be thoroughly evaluated preoperatively.

Th e risk of developing gallbladder and biliary tract disease is  increased threefold in obese people, which perhaps re fl ects abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Abnormal liver function test results and fatty in fi ltration of the liver are frequent fi ndings. Th erefore, caution should be used when selecting medications known to cause liver dysfunction. Interestingly, the increased metabolism of volatile anesthetics (de fl uorination) seen in obese patients has not been shown to result in hepatic dysfunction.

Steatohepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity is the most important risk factor associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), also known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Obesity causes an excess of intrahepatic triglycerides, impaired insulin activity, and additional release of in fl ammatory cytokines. Th ese factors can lead to destruction of hepatocytes and disruption of hepatic physiology and architecture. Because of the increasing prevalence of obesity, NAFLD has become one of the most common causes of endstage liver disease in the United States. Approximately one third of overweight children, adolescents, and adults have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. About 85% of severely obese adults have NAFLD. In most cases, this form of hepatitis follows a benign course. However, in severe cases it may progress to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and/or hepatocellular carcinoma requiring  liver  transplantation.  Most  patients  are  asymptomatic, but some may experience fatigue and abdominal discomfort. Liver function test results may be abnormal. Among patients with NAFLD, 22% also develop diabetes mellitus, 22% develop systemic  hypertension,  and  25%  die  of  coronary  heart  disease within 5 to 7 years. Weight reduction, especially bariatric surgery-induced weight loss, has been shown to signi fi cantly

improve the metabolic abnormalities associated with fatty liver disease or even cure this form of hepatic in fl ammation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gallbladder Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gallbladder disease is closely associated with obesity. Most commonly,  obese  patients  have  cholelithiasis  resulting  from supersaturation of bile with cholesterol resulting from abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Women with a BMI of more than 32 kg/m 2   have  a  three  times  higher  risk  of  developing  gallstones and those with a BMI of more than 45 kg/m 2  have a seven times higher risk of gallstones than lean people. Paradoxically, rapid weight loss, especially a ft er bariatric surgery, increases the risk of gallstones.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastric Emptying and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity per se is not a risk factor for delayed gastric emptying or gastroesophageal re fl ux disease (GERD). Indeed, most obese patients may actually have increased gastric emptying, although  obese  patients  have  greater  gastric fl uid  volumes. Not all obese patients require routine administration of prophylactic proton pump inhibitors, antacids, or rapid-sequence induction for general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME OF OBESITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A higher rate of perioperative infection is seen in the obese population. Th is  phenomenon  may  be  due  to  the  inability  of  neutrophils to activate, migrate, and adhere at sites of in fl ammation as a result of adipose tissue secretion of various  proin fl ammatory  cytokines  or  "adipokines."  Markers  of in fl ammation, such as C-reactive protein, interleukins (IL-6, IL-18), and tumor necrosis factor, are released by adipocytes. Th e  elevated  concentrations  of  these  in fl ammatory  markers consistently  decrease  a ft er  weight-loss  surgery.  In  addition, adiponectin, an adipose tissue-derived cytokine that is associated  with  insulin  sensitivity,  decreases  in  obese  states  and increases with weight loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e depressed immune function of the obese patient signi fi -cantly  increases  the  risk  of  development  of  certain  cancers. Th e  World  Health  Organization  International  Agency  for Research on Cancer estimates that obesity and lack of physical  activity  are  responsible  for  25%  to  33%  of  breast,  colon, endometrial, renal, and esophageal cancers. Prostate and uterine cancer are also seen in a higher percentage of overweight patients.  Peripheral  conversion  of  sex  hormones  in  adipose tissue  by  aromatase,  together  with  decreased  concentrations of plasma sex steroid-binding globulin, may be responsible for the increased incidence of some of these cancers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOEMBOLIC DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk of deep vein thrombosis in obese patients undergoing surgery is approximately double that of nonobese individuals. Th is  increased  risk  of  thromboembolic  disease  presumably re fl ects  the  compounded  e ff ects  of  polycythemia,  increased intraabdominal pressure, increased fi brinogen levels associated with a chronic in fl ammatory state, and immobilization leading to venostasis. At a cellular level, adipocytes produce excessive plasminogen activator inhibitor and tissues have a decreased capacity  for  synthesis  of  tissue  plasminogen  activator.  As  a result there is a decrease in fi brinolysis that renders the obese patient  susceptible  to  development  of  deep  vein  thrombosis or fatal pulmonary embolism. Th is phenomenon is worsened in the perioperative period. Th e use of low-molecular-weight heparin has been advocated to decrease thromboembolic complications during this period. In calculating the dosing for heparin, some suggest that the dose be based on total body weight, since this correlates with drug clearance. Perioperative use of sequential compression stockings is also indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  risk  of  stroke  is  increased  in  obese  patients.  Studies report an association between stroke and an increased BMI and waist/hip ratio. For every 1 unit increase in above normal BMI, there is a 4% increase in the risk of ischemic stroke and a 6% increase in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Th is increased stroke risk may be related to the prothrombotic and chronic in fl ammatory state that accompanies excess adipose tissue accumulation.

MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Degenerative Joint Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoarthritis  and  degenerative  joint  disease  are  being seen  more  frequently  in  men  and  women  40  to  60  years of  age,  a  trend  that  closely  parallels  the  obesity  epidemic. Obesity leads to joint pain and arthritis of the hips, knees, and carpometacarpal joints of the hands, not only because of  mechanical  loading  of  weight-bearing  joints,  but  also because  of  the  accompanying  in fl ammatory and metabolic e ff ects of increased adipose tissue. Co-existing disorders of glucose intolerance, lipid metabolism, hyperuricemia, gout, and vitamin D de fi ciency may further contribute to the problem of  osteoarthritis  in  obese  patients.  Extra  care  must  be taken in the positioning of patients with arthritis or degenerative joint disease in the operating room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NERVOUS SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obese patients, especially those a ff ected by diabetes, may have symptoms  of  autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction  and peripheral  neuropathy.  De fi ciencies  of  essential  micronutrients such as Vitamin B 12 , thiamine, folate, trace minerals, iron, and calcium, in combination with hyperglycemia, can lead to autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Weight loss in severely obese  patients  is  associated  with  signi fi cant  improvement  in autonomic  cardiac  modulation.  Because  pressure  sores  and nerve injuries are more common in the superobese and diabetic populations, particular attention must be given to padding the extremities and protecting pressure-prone areas during surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of Obesity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Successful treatment of obesity relies on a signi fi cant degree of patient motivation. It is estimated that fewer than 20% of obese patients are su ffi ciently motivated to accept treatment. Only a ft er patients have acknowledged their weight problem

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and shown themselves capable of complying with a weightloss program (even if unsuccessful) should pharmacologic or surgical treatment be considered. Genuine patient motivation is required to achieve sustained positive results because, ultimately,  the  treatment  of  obesity  requires  a  lifelong  commitment to lifestyle alterations in the form of increased physical activity  and  decreased  caloric  intake. Th e  bene fi ts  of  weight loss  in  obesity  are  well  documented.  Medical  and  surgical weight-loss plans should be aimed at decreasing the morbidity of  obesity  rather  than  meeting  a  cosmetic  standard  of  thinness. A weight loss of only 5 to 20 kg can be associated with a decrease in systemic blood pressure and plasma lipid concentrations and better control of diabetes mellitus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst  step  in  any  weight-loss  program is  dieting.  Caloric restriction  to  500  to  1000  kcal/day  less  than  a  regular  diet promotes  weight  loss. Restricting caloric intake  beyond this amount may initially help the patient lose weight faster. However,  the  likelihood  of  long-term  adherence  to  such  a restricted diet is very low. Behavior modi fi cation therapy may be  required  to  help  patients  remain  motivated  and  adhere to  lifestyle  alterations. Th e  addition  of  exercise  programs  to dieting  programs  helps  in  maintaining  successful  long-term weight loss. Unfortunately, in most patients with severe obesity, weight loss is not maintained over time without pharmacologic or surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDICAL THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current recommendations of the National Institutes of Health and the European Union suggest adding pharmacotherapy to weight-management programs in patients with a BMI of 27 kg/m 2   or  higher  and  a  persistent  comorbid  condition  such as  hypertension  or  glucose  intolerance  and  in  patients  with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m 2  with no comorbidities. When used properly, weight-loss drugs increase by threefold to fourfold the proportion of patients achieving at least a 5% weight loss at 1 year.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs designed to control caloric intake include serotonin reuptake inhibitors (phentermine) and mixed serotonin/norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitors. Caution must be used when prescribing these drugs, since they may increase blood  pressure  and  heart  rate,  and  have  led  to  pulmonary hypertension  in  some  patients.  Fen fl uramine/phentermine ("fen-phen")  and  dexfen fl uramine,  selective  serotonin  reuptake inhibitors, were taken o ff the market in 2009 by the FDA because of  evidence  linking  the  drugs  with  cardiac  valvular disease. Sibutramine, a mixed serotonin/norepinephrine/ dopamine  reuptake  inhibitor,  was  taken  o ff the  market  in October 2010 because of evidence of a signi fi cant increase in risk of major cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke. Currently, only phentermine (an appetite suppressant related to amphetamine) is FDA approved to treat obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another class of drugs used to treat obesity includes drugs that bind gastric and pancreatic lipases in the gut and prevent the  hydrolysis  of  dietary  fat  into  absorbable  free  fatty  acids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is promotes weight loss via malabsorption of fats. Th e only FDA-approved  lipase  inhibitor  is  orlistat.  Another  category of weight-loss medications includes those drugs that increase energy  expenditure  and  may  contain  ephedrine  or  ephedra alkaloids.  Ephedra  was  o ft en  found  in  over-the-counter  diet drugs and herbal supplements. Th ese  medications can cause unexpected cardiovascular events, including severe hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, stroke, and even death. Th e FDA banned the sale of these drugs in 2004.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGICAL THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adult bariatric surgery results in signi fi cant sustained weight loss in patients who are severely obese. Bariatric surgery also improves obesity-related comorbid conditions, especially hypertension  and  diabetes.  Such  surgery  is  the  most  coste ff ective treatment for patients with a BMI of more than 40 kg/ m 2  or patients with a BMI of 35 kg/m 2  or more and signi fi cant comorbid conditions. With the recognition of the long-term bene fi ts  of  this  surgery  for  clinically  severely obese patients, bariatric surgery is performed much more o ft en now than a decade ago. In the United States bariatric surgery is performed as frequently as cholecystectomy. It appears that the mean percentage of excess weight loss a ft er Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is 68%. It is 62% for gastric banding. Patients have a 77% likelihood of resolution of diabetes and a 62% likelihood of resolution of hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current strategies for surgically assisted weight loss fall into one of  three  categories:  gastric  restriction,  intestinal  malabsorption, or combined restrictive-malabsorptive bariatric surgery (Table 16-5). Most o ft en these surgeries are performed laparoscopically. Laparoscopic techniques have the advantages of decreased pain, decreased rates of complication (i.e., pulmonary complications, thromboembolism, wound infection, hernia  development),  and  shorter  recovery  times,  and  their e ffi cacy is comparable to that of open procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Types of Bariatric Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Restrictive Bariatric Procedures. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and vertical banded gastroplasty  are  examples  of  restrictive  procedures,  in  which  a small gastric pouch with a small outlet (10 to 12 mm in diameter) is created. Th e mechanism of weight loss with this operation may be related to appetite suppression and early satiety or possibly to vagal nerve compression or reduced secretion of gastric hormones, such as ghrelin. Gastroplasty is rarely performed now because of its poor weight-loss results. Adjustable gastric  banding  is  the  most  commonly  performed  bariatric procedure  in  Europe,  Latin  America,  and  Australia.  It  has been used in the United States since 2001 and is gaining in popularity. Th e surgery entails placement of an adjustable silicone band around the upper end of the stomach, which creates a small pouch and restrictive stoma that slows the passage of food into the small intestine. Th is procedure requires no cutting of, or entry into, the stomach or small intestine and should therefore be associated with a low complication rate. Th e gastric band is adjusted a ft er surgery by injection of saline into

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 16-5 ■ Most common bariatric surgeries

<!-- PAGE=? -->
a subcutaneous port (placed at the time of surgery) to adjust the  stoma  size.  Sleeve  gastrectomy  involves  resection  of  the greater curvature of the stomach, which compromises about 75% of the stomach. Th e  smaller  gastric  reservoir  produces early satiety, and the remnant stomach secretes decreased levels of gastric hormones. Th e normal absorptive physiology of the entire small intestine is le ft intact in all of these restrictive procedures,  so  speci fi c  nutrient  de fi ciencies  are  rare  unless there is a signi fi cant change in eating habits or complications such as stomal stenosis occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malabsorptive  Bariatric  Procedures. Malabsorptive  procedures include (1) distal gastric or jejunoileal bypass, (2) biliopancreatic diversion (BPD), and (3) duodenal switch. Th ese operations typically combine gastric volume reduction with a bypass of various lengths of small intestine. A ft er creation of a gastric pouch (200 to 250 mL in volume), the small bowel is divided proximal to the ileocecal valve and connected directly to  the  gastric  pouch,  which  produces  a gastroileostomy. Th e remaining  proximal  limb  of  small  intestine  (biliopancreatic conduit) is anastomosed end to side to the distal ileum, proximal to the ileocecal valve. Th is  provides a common channel that  allows  for  mixture  of  nutrients  with  digestive  enzymes in the ileum. Th e length of the common channel determines the degree of malabsorption. Because these procedures induce weight loss  by  extensively  bypassing  the  small  intestine  and promoting  malabsorption,  they  are  associated  with  a  high incidence  of  anemia,  de fi ciency  of  fat-soluble  vitamins,  and protein-calorie  malnutrition  in  the fi rst  year  a ft er  surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of these increased risks of nutritional and metabolic complications,  these  operations  are  not  performed  as  frequently as the restrictive procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combined  Bariatric  Procedure. Th e  combined  bariatric procedure, called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), includes both  gastric  restriction  and  some  degree  of  malabsorption. It is the preferred surgical approach for clinically severe obesity. In the RYGB procedure, the surgeon creates a very small (15- to 50-mL) proximal gastric pouch that is connected to a Roux limb via an enteroenterostomy to the jejunum near the ligament of Treitz. Th e procedure bypasses the distal stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum, so there is a marked loss of absorptive surface area for nutrients, electrolytes, and bile salts. Th e RYGB procedure requires the longest operating time and postoperative hospital stay compared with other forms of bariatric surgery. However, it results in the greatest weight loss and improvement in obesity-related health issues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications  and  mortality  rates  for  bariatric  surgery depend on several factors: patient age, gender, BMI, existing comorbid conditions, procedure type and complexity, and the experience of the surgeon and surgical center. Higher mortality rates have been associated with abdominal obesity, male gender, BMI of 50 kg/m 2  or more, diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, older age, and performance of the surgery at a lower-volume bariatric  surgery  center.  Recent  improvements  in  mortality rates are likely due to the use of laparoscopic techniques and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
324

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
better  anesthesia,  monitoring,  and  perioperative  care.  Overall 30-day mortality for bariatric surgery ranges from 0.1% to 2%. Gastric banding has the lowest mortality rate. Mortality for gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy is 0.5%. Malabsorptive  operations  are  associated  with  a  higher  mortality  rate. Th e mortality of RYGB ranges from 0.5% to 1.5%. Th e most severe complications of bariatric surgery include anastomotic leaks, stricture formation, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, gastric  prolapse, and bleeding. Less common complications are wound dehiscence, hernia or seroma formation, lymphocele, lymphorrhea, and suture extrusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional  complications  are  seen  a ft er  malabsorptive and  combined  bariatric  procedures. Th ese  complications are a result of the marked reduction in vitamin and mineral uptake. Th e majority of patients can maintain a relatively normal  nutritional  status  a ft er  RYGB,  but  de fi ciencies  of  iron, vitamin B 12 , vitamin K, and folate are common. Some patients develop subclinical micronutrient de fi ciency. Taking multivitamins with mineral supplements reduces, but does not totally prevent, the development of vitamin or mineral de fi ciencies. Chronic vitamin K de fi ciency can lead to an abnormal prothrombin  time  with  a  normal  partial  thromboplastin  time. Patients who come for elective surgery with vitamin K de fi -ciency and coagulopathy respond to administration of a vitamin K analogue such as phytonadione within 6 to 24 hours. Fresh frozen plasma may be required for prothrombin time correction for emergency surgery or active bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional complications of bariatric surgery include occurrence  of  an  undesirable dumping  syndrome in  some patients.  Other  patients  experience  major  nutritional  complications. Th ree of the most clinically signi fi cant nutritional complications are (1) protein-calorie malnutrition, (2) Wernicke's encephalopathy, and (3) peripheral neuropathy. In the long term, patients are also at risk of metabolic bone disease. Pregnant women and adolescents are at higher risk of nutritional complications a ft er RYGB because of their higher physiologic  nutritional  needs.  Long-term  nutritional  follow-up  is essential  to  promote  a  healthy  life  a ft er  weight-loss  surgery. Even  when  surgery-related  mortality  is  taken  into  account, several  studies  have  shown  a  signi fi cant  survival  bene fi t  in patients  who  underwent  bariatric  surgery  compared  with those who did not. Th e survival bene fi t is speci fi cally due to a decrease in the rate of myocardial infarction, resolution of diabetes mellitus, and fewer cancer-related deaths.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protein-Calorie Malnutrition. Severe  malnutrition is the most  serious  metabolic  complication  of  bariatric  surgery. Red meat is  poorly  tolerated  a ft er  bariatric  surgery  because it is much harder to break down and pass through the small stomach outlet. If the outlet becomes plugged, vomiting will result.  If  the  patient  does  not  consume  enough  alternative protein sources, such as milk, yogurt, eggs, fi sh, and poultry, protein  malnutrition  can  develop.  Protein-calorie  malnutrition is generally more common with BPD and is very rare with vertical banded  gastroplasty. Protein-calorie malnutrition has a reported incidence of 7% to 12% in patients who have undergone BPD. Hypoalbuminemia has been reported as early as 1 year a ft er BPD. Revision of the common channel from 50 to  200  cm  in  length  has  been  shown  to  correct  the  hypoalbuminemia associated with excessive weight loss. In cases of severe  malnutrition,  enteral  or  parenteral  nutrition  therapy may be necessary. Mild to moderate cases usually respond to dietary counseling. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients prone to protein-calorie malnutrition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fat  Malabsorption. Fat-soluble  vitamin  malabsorption and fat malabsorption (evidenced by steatorrhea) are common with RYGB and BPD. Indeed, this phenomenon is the principal  means  by  which  BPD  promotes  weight  loss. Th e length of the common channel in BPD regulates the degree of fat absorption and determines the severity of malabsorption.  Evidence  has  shown  that  a  100-cm  common  channel is  better  tolerated  than  a  50-cm  channel  and  is  associated with  less  diarrhea  and  steatorrhea  and  improved  protein metabolism. Problems with fat-soluble vitamin imbalances and fat malabsorption are rarely seen with vertical banded gastroplasty.

Consideration of Bariatric Surgery in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With over 10% of children now classi fi ed as overweight or obese, the appropriateness of bariatric surgery in adolescents is  being  considered. In 2005, a National Institutes of Health consensus statement indicated that bariatric surgery in adolescents is safe and e ff ective for long-term sustained weight loss and resolution of comorbid conditions. Th e American Society for Bariatric Surgery has expanded the patient population suitable for bariatric surgery to include adolescents and possibly individuals with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 kg/m 2  who have associated comorbid conditions. Although these updated guidelines suggest that bariatric surgery be considered for adolescents, the risks and bene fi ts of this aggressive intervention must be weighed by an interdisciplinary team at an experienced bariatric surgery center.

Management of Anesthesia in Obese Patients

PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  thorough  preoperative  evaluation  is necessary  for all patients with clinically severe obesity coming for surgery. Th e focus of the history taking and physical examination should be on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and airway evaluation.  Many  of  these  patients  lead  sedentary  lifestyles, so  eliciting  symptoms  associated  with  cardiorespiratory  disease  may  be  di ffi cult.  Even  a  thorough  history  and  physical examination  with  electrocardiography  (ECG)  may  underestimate the extent of cardiovascular disease in these patients. In some cases, more extensive preoperative diagnostic testing including standard blood work, chest radiography, sleep studies, cardiac stress testing, transthoracic echocardiography, and room air arterial blood gas sampling may be necessary to fully evaluate the health status of an obese patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 16 NUTRITIONAL DISEASES: OBESITY AND MALNUTRITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
325

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthesiologist should inquire about the presence of chest pain, shortness of breath at rest or with minimal exertion, and palpitations, and the position in which the patient sleeps. Th e  most  common  symptoms  of  pulmonary  hypertension  are  exertional  dyspnea,  fatigue,  and  syncope,  which re fl ect an inability to increase cardiac output during activity. If  pulmonary  hypertension  is  suspected,  then  avoidance  of hypoxemia, nitrous oxide, and other drugs that may further worsen  pulmonary  vasoconstriction  is  warranted.  Intraoperatively, inhaled anesthetics may be bene fi cial  because they cause bronchodilation and decrease hypoxic  pulmonary vasoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms of OSA, such as snoring, apneic episodes during sleep, daytime somnolence, morning headaches, and frequent sleep arousals, should be sought. If a diagnosis of severe OSA or OHS is suspected, further evaluation may be required. Symptoms of acid re fl ux, coughing, inability to lie fl at without coughing, or heartburn may indicate GERD or delayed gastric emptying. If these symptoms are not already controlled with antacids  or  proton  pump  inhibitors,  it  may  be  necessary  to start these medications preoperatively. Prolonging the period of preoperative fasting from the standard 8 hours to 12 hours and prohibiting the intake of clear liquids starting at 8 hours preoperatively may be prudent. In patients with a history of hypertension, eliciting symptoms such as frequent headaches and changes in vision can indicate whether the blood pressure is  well  controlled.  In  those  with  uncontrolled  hypertension, referral  to  the  primary  care  doctor  for  optimization  should be considered. In diabetic patients, symptoms of claudication, peripheral  neuropathy,  renal  dysfunction,  or  retinopathy,  or an elevated hemoglobin A 1c level  should signal the possibility of advanced diabetes, poorly controlled glucose levels, and microvascular and macrovascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obese patients have unique issues that may contribute to cardiovascular,  pulmonary,  and  thromboembolic  complications. High-risk patients should be identi fi ed early to ensure optimal  management  of  co-existing  diseases  before  surgery. A look at prior anesthetic and surgical records, with special attention to induction and intubation, may help identify problems with airway management and indicate the weight of the patient at the time of the previous surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical Examination and Airway Examination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physical examination should attempt to identify signs suggestive of cardiac and respiratory disease. Signs of le ft or right ventricular failure such as increased jugular venous pressure, extra heart sounds, rales, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema may be very di ffi cult  to  elicit  in  the  morbidly  obese patient because of body habitus. Pedal edema is a very common fi nding in obese patients and may be due to right-sided heart failure, varicose veins, or extravasation of intravascular fl uid associated with decreased mobility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  detailed  assessment  of  the  upper  airway  must  be  performed to look for the following anatomic features: fat  face and  cheeks,  short  neck,  large  tongue,  large  tonsillar  size, excessive palatal and pharyngeal so ft tissue, restricted mouth opening,  limited  cervical  and/or  mandibular  mobility,  large breasts, increased neck circumference at the level of the thyroid cartilage, or a Mallampati score of 3 or higher.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  history  of  sleep  apnea  should  raise  the  possibility  of upper airway abnormalities that may predispose to di ffi culties with mask ventilation and exposure of the glottic opening during direct laryngoscopy, such as decreased anatomic space to accommodate anterior displacement of the tongue. When awake, these patients may compensate for their compromised airway anatomy by increasing the craniocervical angulation, which increases the space between the mandible and cervical  spine  and  elongates  the  tongue  and  so ft tissues  of  the neck. Th is compensation is lost when these patients become unconscious.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Studies  have  not  shown  a  statistically  signi fi cant  link between obesity per se and the likelihood of di ffi cult intubation. Rather, physical examination fi ndings such as a very thick neck or a Mallampati score higher than 3 more reliably predict the  possibility  of  a  di ffi cult  intubation.  In  selected  patients, awake endotracheal intubation using fi beroptic laryngoscopy may be the most appropriate method for securing the airway, but it is important to remember that neither clinically severe obesity nor a high BMI is an absolute indication for an awake intubation. In fact, with the recent advent of the videolaryngoscope, awake fi beroptic intubation is being performed much less frequently.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  obese  patient  should  also  be  evaluated  for  ease  of peripheral intravenous catheter placement. If severe di ffi culty with intravenous access is anticipated, then the patient should be informed of the possibility of placement of a central intravenous catheter before induction. If a patient is found to be at very high risk of intraoperative or postoperative deep vein thrombosis,  then  placement  of  an  inferior  vena  cava fi lter before surgery should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Diagnostic Tests

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECG examination may demonstrate fi ndings suggestive of right ventricular hypertrophy, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac dysrhythmias, or myocardial ischemia or infarction. It is important to keep in mind that the ECG may not always be reliable in the clinically severely obese patient because of morphologic features such as (1) displacement of the heart by an elevated diaphragm, (2) increased cardiac workload with associated cardiac hypertrophy, (3) increased distance between the heart and the recording electrodes caused by excess adipose tissue in the chest wall and possibly increased epicardial fat, and (4) the potential for associated chronic lung disease to alter the ECG. Chest radiographic examination may show signs of heart failure,  increased  vascular  markings,  pulmonary  congestion, pulmonary hypertension, hyperin fl ated lungs, or other pulmonary disease. Transthoracic echocardiography is useful to evaluate le ft and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function as well as to identify pulmonary hypertension. In cases of severe OSA, results of arterial blood gas analysis on a sample drawn with the patient breathing room air may be helpful in guiding intraoperative and postoperative ventilatory management.

Home Medications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most home medications should be continued preoperatively, with the exception of oral hypoglycemics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, anticoagulants (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel [Plavix]), and nonsteroidal antiinfl ammatory drugs. Patients taking histamine-2 receptor blockers such as famotidine, nonparticulate antacids, or proton pump inhibitors should be counseled to take these medications on the morning of surgery. Obese patients are at high risk of acute postoperative pulmonary embolism because of their chronic in fl ammatory state, so perioperative deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with  either  unfractionated  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin  is indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  continuous  positive  airway  pressure  (CPAP)  or  bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) is used at home, the patient should be advised to bring the mask on the day of surgery so that this therapy can be continued in the postoperative period. Currently, no data exist to support the preoperative initiation of CPAP or BIPAP to improve postoperative outcomes in patients with sleep apnea.

INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

Positioning

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Specially  designed  operating  tables  (or  two  regular  tables joined together) may be required for bariatric surgery. Regular operating room tables have a maximum weight limit of approximately 205 kg, but operating tables capable of holding up to 455 kg, with a little extra width to accommodate the extra girth, are now available. To transfer the patient from the stretcher to the operating table, an air transfer mattress device (e.g., HoverMatt) can be used to laterally transfer and reposition patients and minimize injury to sta ff . Some severely obese patients will require "ramping," which is a means of positioning the patient using a ramp that extends from behind the low back to the neck and allows the head to be positioned above the chest in a horizontal plane formed between the sternal notch and the external  auditory  meatus. Th is  position  allows  better  ventilatory mechanics and facilitates intubation (Figure 16-3). Particular care should be paid to protecting pressure areas (elbows, heels), because pressure sores and nerve injuries are more common in  the  superobese  and  obese  patients  with  diabetes.  Brachial plexus, sciatic, and ulnar nerve palsies have been reported in patients with increased BMI. Upper and lower limbs, because of their increased weight, have a higher likelihood of sliding o ff the operating table, which produces peripheral nerve injuries. It is desirable to keep the arms in neutral position on the arm boards so that their position can be monitored and excess pressure from tight tucking and draping can be avoided.

Th e degree of intraabdominal pressure determines the e ff ects of  pneumoperitoneum  on  venous  return,  myocardial  performance, and ventilatory status. Th ere is a biphasic cardiovascular response to increases in intraabdominal pressure. At an intraabdominal pressure of approximately 10 mm Hg, there is an increase in  venous  return,  probably  from  a  reduction  in  splanchnic sequestration of blood. Th is is associated with an increase in cardiac output and arterial pressure. Hypovolemia, however, blunts this response. Compression of the inferior vena cava occurs at intraabdominal pressures of approximately 20 mm Hg, and this results in decreased venous return from the lower body, increased renal vascular resistance, decreased renal  blood fl ow,  and decreased  glomerular fi ltration.  Concomitantly,  obese  patients manifest a disproportionate increase in systemic vascular resistance caused not only by aortic compression but also by increased secretion of vasopressin. Th ese patients have higher le ft ventricular end-systolic wall stress before pneumoperitoneum (caused by increased  end-systolic  le ft ventricular  dimensions)  and during pneumoperitoneum.  Since  higher  le ft ventricular  end-systolic wall stress is a determinant of myocardial oxygen demand, more aggressive control of blood pressure (ventricular a ft erload) may be needed in clinically severely obese patients to optimize myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Femoral venous blood fl ow can be reduced by both pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg positioning, with an associated increased risk of lower extremity  thrombosis.  High  intraabdominal  pressure  in  conjunction with placement in Trendelenburg's position increases intrathoracic pressure and may impede adequate ventilation. Moreover, absorption of carbon dioxide can worsen hypercarbia and induce acidosis, thereby increasing pulmonary hypertension.

Choice of Anesthesia

According  to  the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists (ASA) Practice Guidelines, local or regional anesthesia should be the primary anesthetic choice for obese patients undergoing surgery, with general anesthesia used only when necessary.

Placement of an epidural or peripheral nerve block can signi fi cantly aid in managing postoperative pain and reduce the need for narcotics, which decreases the incidence of postoperative respiratory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia, including spinal anesthesia, epidural anesthesia, and peripheral nerve block, may be technically diffi cult in obese patients, since landmarks are obscured by excess adipose tissue. It is estimated that the risk of a failed block is about 1.5 times higher in patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m 2  than in patients with a low BMI. Th ere is also a higher likelihood of block-related complications. Th e success rate for blocks is signi fi cantly higher when ultrasonographic guidance is used to assist in needle placement. A distinct advantage of regional anesthesia in the obese patient is the ability to limit the  amount  of  intraoperative  and  postoperative  opioid  use, which  thereby  limits  the  risk  of  respiratory  depression  and improves patient  safety  and  satisfaction.  Interestingly,  obese patients require as much as 20% less local anesthetic for spinal or epidural anesthesia than nonobese patients, presumably because  of  fatty  in fi ltration  and  vascular  engorgement  from increased intraabdominal pressure, which decreases the volume of the epidural space. It is di ffi cult to reliably predict the sensory level of anesthesia that will be achieved by neuraxial blockade in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of general anesthesia in the obese patient is not without risks. Th e anesthetic plan, including all risks, bene fi ts, and  alternatives  to  general  anesthesia,  should  be  discussed thoroughly  with  the  patient  and  surgeon  before  the  operation. Th e possible need for postoperative respiratory support via  CPAP,  BIPAP ,  or  mechanical  ventilation  should  also  be discussed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Premedication

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of anxiolytic premedications such as benzodiazepines in the obese population is controversial, and the decision to premedicate should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the risk of upper airway obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Airway Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the airway is one of the greatest challenges associated  with  general  anesthesia  in  the  obese  patient.  An emergency airway cart that provides access to rescue intubating devices such as supraglottic devices, a fl exible bronchoscope, a light wand, and resuscitation drugs should be immediately available. Th e use of an intubating laryngeal mask airway has been  shown  to  be  successful  for  tracheal intubation in  96% of  obese  patients  and  for  successful ventilation in  less  than 1  minute  in  100%  of  obese  patients.  Use  of  a  videolaryngoscope may facilitate tracheal intubation. Since the introduction of videolaryngoscopy, awake fi beroptic tracheal intubation is used much less frequently, but it remains an option for airway management in certain  patients.  For  very  high-risk  patients with extremely limited pulmonary reserve or abnormal airway anatomy, an ear, nose, and throat surgeon should be immediately  available  to  perform  an  emergency  tracheostomy  if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before intubation there must be adequate time for positioning and preoxygenation. Proper patient positioning is essential to successful intubation of the trachea. O ft en the large body habitus, particularly a large chest, short neck, or excess neck so ft tissue,  limits  placement  of  the  laryngoscope  and  glottic exposure. Successful intubation is contingent upon adequate alignment  of  the  oral,  pharyngeal,  and  laryngeal  axes,  also known as the sni ffi ng position.  To  achieve  this  position,  the obese patient may require ramping, in which a wedge-shaped device is placed behind the torso and a pillow is placed behind the head to slightly extend the neck so that the sternal notch is in line horizontally with the auditory meatus (see Figure 16-3). Adequate  preoxygenation  is  critically  important  in  obese patients, since these patients have a decreased FRC and higher oxygen consumption. Th erefore they experience desaturation much  faster  than  nonobese  patients  when  they  are  apneic. Studies have shown that when patients undergo 5 minutes of preoxygenation with an Fio 2 of 100% via CPAP at a pressure of 10 cm H 2 O, then the time that apnea can be tolerated without desaturation increases by 50%, which allows more time for direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decision to perform a rapid-sequence induction should be made on a case-by-case basis. Multiple risk factors for pulmonary  aspiration  may  be  present  in  the  obese  population: higher gastric residual volume, lower pH of gastric contents, higher intraabdominal  pressure, and  higher incidence of GERD and diabetes. However, no studies have documented an increased incidence of pulmonary aspiration solely related to an increased BMI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Ventilation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  obese  population,  several  factors  make  controlled mechanical  ventilation  problematic  in  the  operating  room. Obese patients  already  have  a  decreased  FRC  and  decreased lung oxygen reserves, and experience desaturation faster during periods of hypoventilation or apnea than do normal-weight individuals. Positioning for adequate surgical exposure (prone or Trendelenburg's position) can worsen ventilation problems by  decreasing  chest  wall  compliance.  If  pneumoperitoneum is required for surgical exposure (laparoscopic or robotic surgery), ventilation may be impaired by the increased abdominal pressure, which worsens lung compliance. Recruitment maneuvers, such as Valsalva's maneuver, can be used to prevent atelectasis. Th ere are no data to indicate which mode of ventilation is best for obese patients. PEEP improves ventilation/perfusion matching and arterial oxygenation in obese patients, but at high levels (PEEP of 15 to 20 cm H 2 O) adverse e ff ects on cardiac output and oxygen delivery o ff set these bene fi ts. Using pressurecontrolled ventilation and changing the inspiration/exhalation ratio can help limit peak airway pressure. When spontaneous ventilation  is  resumed  at  the  conclusion  of  surgery,  it  is  best to  maintain the patient in a semi-upright position and apply

pressure-support ventilation with PEEP to help reduce the risk of atelectasis. In a spontaneously breathing obese patient, the supine position is o ft en associated with hypoxia.

INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any combination of drugs can be used for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in clinically severely obese patients. However, some drugs appear to have a better pharmacokinetic pro fi le for obese patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacokinetics of Anesthetic Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e physiologic changes associated with obesity may lead to  alterations  in  the  distribution,  binding,  and  elimination of  many  drugs. Th e  volume  of  distribution  in  obese  individuals  may  be  in fl uenced by a variety of factors,  including increased  blood  volume  and  cardiac  output,  decreased  total body water (fat contains less water than other tissues), altered protein binding of drugs, and the lipid solubility of the drug being administered. Th e e ff ect of obesity on protein binding is variable. Despite the occasional presence of liver dysfunction, hepatic  clearance  of  drugs  is  usually  not  altered.  Heart  failure and decreased hepatic blood fl ow could slow elimination of drugs that are highly dependent on liver clearance. Renal clearance of drugs may increase in obese individuals because of increased renal blood fl ow and glomerular fi ltration rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e impact of obesity on dosing of injected drugs is di ffi cult to predict. Total blood volume is likely to be increased, which would tend to decrease the plasma concentration achieved following intravenous injection of a drug. However, fat has a relatively low blood fl ow, so an increased dose of drug calculated based on total body weight could result in an excessive plasma concentration. Cardiac output is increased in the obese patient, which a ff ects drug distribution and dilution in the fi rst minute a ft er administration. Because both cardiac output and plasma volume  are  increased,  an  initially  higher  dose  of  drug  may be required for loading to attain peak plasma concentration. Th e most clinically useful approach is to calculate the initial dose of drug to be injected into an obese patient based on lean body weight rather than total body weight. Lean body weight is total body weight minus fat weight (Figure 16-4). In clinically severe obesity, lean body weight is increased and accounts for 20% to 40% of excess body weight. Ideal body weight does not take into account the increase in lean body weight in severely obese  patients. Th erefore,  lean  body  weight  is  more  highly correlated with cardiac output and drug clearance and should be used for initial dosing. Subsequent doses of drugs should be based on the pharmacologic response to the initial dose. Repeated injections of a drug, however, can result in cumulative drug e ff ects and prolonged responses, re fl ecting storage of drugs in fat and subsequent release from this inactive depot into the systemic circulation as the plasma concentration of drug declines. It is important to note that oral absorption of drugs is not in fl uenced by obesity.

de fl uorination  of  volatile  anesthetics  in  obese  patients  has not  been  shown  to  result  in  hepatic  or  renal  dysfunction. Th is  increased de fl uorination observed a ft er the administration of certain volatile anesthetics to obese patients does not occur with administration of sevo fl urane. Awakening of obese patients is more prompt a ft er exposure to des fl urane or sevofl urane than a ft er administration of either iso fl urane or propofol. Th e rapid elimination of nitrous oxide is useful, but the frequent  need  for  increased  supplemental  oxygen  limits  the usefulness of nitrous oxide in obese patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia is best managed with drugs with minimal potential for accumulation in adipose tissue. Propofol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, atracurium, cisatracurium, and narcotics such as sufentanil and fentanyl are highly lipophilic  and  accumulate  in  fatty  tissue  when  administered  by infusion over a long period. Usually, highly lipophilic drugs show a signi fi cant increase in volume of distribution in obese patients, and it would seem that dosing should be based on total  body  weight.  However,  because  the  majority  of  these drugs have the potential to accumulate in adipose tissue over time, a prolonged e ff ect can be seen. An exception is remifentanil. Th is drug is also highly lipophilic; however, because it is rapidly metabolized by plasma esterases, it has limited potential for accumulation in fat tissue and is therefore favored over other  narcotics  for  intraoperative  analgesia.  Ketamine  and dexmedetomidine may also be useful anesthetic adjuncts in patients who are susceptible to narcotic-induced respiratory depression. For common anesthetic drug dosing recommendations, refer to Table 16-6.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of hydrophilic substances, such as muscle relaxants, should be based on lean body weight, because their peak plasma concentrations are independent of the volume of distribution, which is greatly increased in obese patients. Th e large volume of distribution is due to the high ratio of extracellular to intracellular fl uid, since the water content of adipose tissue is almost completely extracellular. Because the e ff ect of

this increased extracellular fl uid on neuromuscular blockade is unclear, it is recommended that neuromuscular blockers be dosed based on lean body weight and that the degree of blockade be carefully monitored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e pharmacokinetics of succinylcholine are unique. Because  the  level  of  plasma  pseudocholinesterase  and  the volume of distribution is increased, clinically severely obese patients  have  larger  absolute  succinylcholine  dose  requirements  than  normal-weight  patients. Th erefore,  to  achieve profound  neuromuscular  blockade  and  facilitate  intubation, administration  of  succinylcholine  should  be  based  on total body weight rather than lean body weight.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  extent  of  surgery  and  concomitant  comorbid  conditions should be the primary factors that determine the need for and extent of monitoring beyond routine monitoring. For surgery  performed  under  local  or  regional  anesthesia  with moderate sedation, the ASA Practice Guidelines recommend continuous  capnography  to  decrease  the  risk  of  undetected airway obstruction, which is especially prevalent in the obese population.  For  surgery  performed  under  general  anesthesia,  hemodynamic  monitoring  may  be  needed  in  selected patients. Th e technical di ffi culty of placing invasive hemodynamic monitors may be increased in this patient population. If  noninvasive blood pressure cu ff s  are  used, it is important to fi t a correctly sized cu ff . If the cu ff is too small, then blood pressure  measurements  may  be  falsely  elevated.  Alternative to  standard  blood  pressure  cu ff s  include  noninvasive  blood pressure monitoring systems that detect blood pressure in the radial artery or in the fi nger. An intraarterial catheter should be inserted if noninvasive monitoring is inadequate or if the obese  patient  has  severe  cardiopulmonary  disease.  When intravenous access is problematic, use of ultrasonography to guide  the  placement  of  peripheral  and/or  central  lines  may increase the success rate and decrease the complication rate associated  with  these  procedures.  Transesophageal  echocardiography (TEE) and pulmonary artery catheterization can be performed intraoperatively in patients with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, or other medical conditions that make continuous assessment of volume status or cardiac function necessary.  Continuous  TEE  monitoring  allows  immediate detection of  alterations  in  cardiac  function  as  well  as  accurate assessment of volume status to guide fl uid management. However, TEE monitoring requires expensive equipment and trained personnel and may not be readily available in all hospital settings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Calculation  of fl uid  requirements  in  the  obese  patient should  be  based  on  lean  body  weight  with  a  goal  of euvolemia. Achieving this goal in the obese population may be  very  di ffi cult,  however,  especially  since  there  is  a  high association  between  severe  obesity  and  diastolic  dysfunction. In patients with preexisting cardiac disease, large fl uid loads  may  not  be  tolerated  well,  and  development  of  pulmonary edema is more likely. During laparoscopic surgery, decreased urinary output does not necessarily re fl ect hypovolemia, and liberal fl uid administration may have a negative impact on overall outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although episodic arterial hypoxemia may occur any time from the immediate postoperative period to as late as 2 to 5 days a ft er surgery, no data support routine intensive care unit admission to decrease morbidity and mortality. Early episodic arterial hypoxemia may be due to perioperative opioid use. Th e  patients at highest risk for developing postoperative hypoxemia are those with a history of OSA. Th e sitting position is a useful posture to improve arterial oxygenation. Routine  administration  of  oxygen  during  the  postoperative period is controversial, because oxygen administration can increase the duration of apnea by delaying the arousal e ff ect produced by arterial hypoxemia. Th erefore, it is preferable to provide supplemental oxygen only if arterial oxygen desaturation occurs. Once the patient's saturation can be maintained at baseline levels or higher than 90% on room air  with  good  pain  control,  then  pulse  oximetry  may  be discontinued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transport

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before transport from the operating room to the recovery room, the obese patient should be fully awake and alert, sitting in a semi-upright position, receiving supplemental oxygen, and monitored by pulse oximetry. Verbal contact should be maintained throughout transport to assess wakefulness and adequacy of respiratory e ff ort.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emergence

Tracheal extubation is considered when obese patients are fully  awake  and  alert,  and  have  recovered  from  the  depressant e ff ects of the anesthetics. Although there are no speci fi c studies to guide the practice of tracheal extubation in obese patients,  certain  maneuvers  can  facilitate  better  respiratory

<!-- PAGE=? -->
mechanics before extubation. Th ese include placement in the semi-upright position (30 degrees or more head up), provision  of  pressure-support  ventilation  with  PEEP  or  CPAP until extubation, oxygen supplementation, and placement of a  nasopharyngeal  airway  to  help  maintain  airway  patency. A  history  of  OSA  or  OHS  mandates  intense  postoperative respiratory monitoring to ensure a patent upper airway and acceptable  oxygenation  and  ventilation.  In  certain  high-risk patients, placement of a tube exchanger before extubation may be prudent and is usually well tolerated even if le ft in place for several hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e notion that slow emergence of clinically severely obese patients from the e ff ects of general anesthesia re fl ects delayed release of volatile anesthetics from fat stores is not accurate. Poor total fat blood fl ow limits the delivery of volatile anesthetics for storage. Overall, recovery times are o ft en comparable in obese and lean individuals undergoing surgery that requires anesthesia for less than 4 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  opioid-induced  ventilatory  depression  is  a  concern,  a  multimodal  approach  to  postoperative  pain  control is  usually  employed. Th is  includes  use  of  techniques  that decrease narcotic requirements. Peripheral and central nerve block  with  continuous  infusion  of  local  anesthetic  with  or without  small  doses  of  opioids  is  an  e ff ective  method  for postoperative  analgesia  in  obese  patients.  Supplementation with  nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs), α 2 -receptor  agonists, N -methyl-d-aspartate  (NMDA)  receptor antagonists,  sodium  channel  blockers,  or  other  nonopioid analgesics is  highly  recommended, since these drugs do not contribute to postoperative respiratory depression. Ketorolac is  an  NSAID that has been used successfully to reduce pain in the postoperative period. Th e principal side e ff ects are gastrointestinal discomfort and the potential for increased operative site bleeding. Ketorolac is not suitable for use in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery because these patients are  at  especially  high  risk  for  development  of  gastrointestinal  bleeding.  An  intravenous  preparation  of  acetaminophen was  recently  approved  by  the  FDA.  Dosing  of  intravenous acetaminophen  for  patients  who  weigh  more  than  50  kg should be 1 g IV every 6 hours as needed, not to exceed 4 g in 24 hours. Because acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver and  excreted  in  the  urine,  dosage  should  be  decreased  in patients with liver or kidney disease. Both dexmedetomidine, a  selective α 2 -receptor  agonist,  and  clonidine,  a  less  selective α 2 -receptor  agonist,  have  been  shown  to  reduce  opioid requirements  if  administered  by  continuous  infusion  in  the perioperative  period.  Ketamine  has  been  shown  to  enhance the analgesic e ff ects of morphine by inhibiting opioid activation of NMDA receptors. Given in small doses postoperatively, ketamine can decrease pain and increase wakefulness and oxygen  saturation.  If  opioids  are  eventually  required  to  control postoperative pain, then patient-controlled analgesia is a good option. Dosages of opioids are best based on lean body weight.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory and Cardiovascular Monitoring and Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e adequacy of ventilation should be assessed and monitored for at least 24 to 48 hours postoperatively. If the patient was on CPAP or BIPAP ventilation at home, this ventilation mode should be resumed postoperatively. If the patient had not been diagnosed with sleep apnea preoperatively but experiences frequent airway obstruction and hypoxemic episodes in the recovery room, then CPAP or BIPAP can be considered. Th ese noninvasive ventilatory modes should be used very cautiously in the period immediately a ft er gastric bypass surgery, however, because some risk of stomal dehiscence is associated with their use. Respiratory monitoring in the fi rst few postoperative hours should be intensive. Any sign suggestive of respiratory fatigue or cardiovascular instability should be evaluated and  treated  immediately.  If  obese  patients  require  reintubation, it is best performed in a controlled fashion rather than in an emergent situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Discharge to an unmonitored Setting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decision about when to discharge patients to a regular hospital room or to home can be di ffi cult in obese patients. It is  considered  safe  to  discharge  a  patient  to  an  unmonitored setting (regular hospital bed or home) when pain is adequately controlled and the patient is no longer at signi fi cant  risk  of postoperative respiratory depression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates are higher in obese patients than in nonobese patients. Th is is due primarily to the presence of preexisting medical illnesses and the risk of aspiration during endotracheal intubation. Wound infection is twice as common in obese patients. Postoperative mechanical  ventilation is o ft en needed in obese patients who have a history of carbon dioxide retention and have undergone prolonged  surgery. Th e  hazards  of  OSA  and  OHS  may  extend several  days  into  the  postoperative  period. Th e  maximum decrease in Pa o 2 typically occurs 2 to 3 days postoperatively. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be di ffi cult because of increased work of breathing, decreased lung volumes, and ventilation/perfusion  mismatching. Th e  likelihood  of  deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism is increased, which emphasizes the importance of early postoperative ambulation and the potential need for prophylactic anticoagulation. Obese patients tend not to be able to mobilize their fat stores during critical illness and need to rely on carbohydrates for energy. Th is increased carbohydrate metabolism raises the respiratory quotient and accelerates protein catabolism. If these patients take nothing by mouth for a prolonged period, a protein malnutrition syndrome may develop.

MALNUTRITION AND VITAMIN DEFICIENCIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malnutrition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutrients  are  essential  for  the  maintenance  of  biochemical  pathways  that  control  systems  such  as  cardiac  function, respiration,  immune  responses,  and  cognition.  Proteins  are especially important for muscle and tissue synthesis, and their component amino acids have a wide range of biologic roles. Malnutrition results from an imbalance in nutritional intake or inadequate caloric support. It can be due to loss of appetite, overconsumption  or  underconsumption  of  nutrients  in  the diet, or malabsorption. Estimates suggest that malnourished patients have hospital stays 50% longer than well-nourished patients  and  are  at  higher  risk  of  wound  infection,  immunosuppression,  renal  dysfunction,  and  other  complications. Anemia and vitamin B12 de fi ciency further impair recovery. To minimize the risk of malnutrition, it is recommended that all patients admitted to a hospital be screened and monitored for signs of malnutrition. Biologic markers suggestive of malnutrition include serum albumin concentration of less than 3 g/dL, transferrin level of less than 200 mg/dL, and prealbumin level of less than 15 mg/dL. Cholesterol, zinc, iron, vitamin B 12 , and folic acid levels may also be signi fi cantly reduced in malnourished patients. Of all these markers, prealbumin may be the most useful, because its half-life is only 2 days and changes in  nutritional  status  can  be  detected  quite  early.  However, prealbumin levels should always be measured in conjunction with  C-reactive  protein  levels,  since  in fl ammation can raise the level of prealbumin and a ff ect interpretation of results. In the presence of low levels of both prealbumin and C-reactive protein, it is likely that the patient is malnourished. Treatment of malnutrition is aimed at balancing nutritional intake with energy needs, depending on the level of activity or stress of the patient. If nutritional therapy is necessary, then enteral feeding or parenteral nutrition can be initiated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENTERAL NUTRITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the gastrointestinal tract is functioning, enteral nutrition can be provided by means of nasogastric or gastrostomy tube feedings or by postpyloric methods, such as nasojejunal tubes  or  feeding  jejunostomy  tubes.  Continuous  infusion  is the usual method for administering enteral feedings. Th e rate, composition, and volume of the feeding solution will be individualized based on laboratory data. Th e question of when to stop postpyloric feedings in patients requiring surgery is still unclear. However, nasogastric and orogastric feedings should be stopped 8 hours before surgery and the stomach should be suctioned before the patient is taken to the operating room. Complications of enteral feedings are infrequent but include

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hyperglycemia  causing  osmotic  diuresis  and  hypovolemia. Exogenous insulin administration may be a consideration if blood  glucose  concentrations  are  elevated. Th e  osmolarity of  elemental  diets  (i.e.,  tube  feedings)  is  high  at  550  to  850 mOsm/L, and this o ft en causes diarrhea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PARENTERAL NUTRITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parenteral  nutrition  is  indicated  when  the  gastrointestinal tract is not functioning. Peripheral parenteral nutrition using an isotonic solution delivered through a peripheral vein is limited  by  osmolality  and  volume  constraints.  It  may  be  useful as a supplement to oral intake or when the anticipated need for  nutritional  support  is  less  than  14  days. Total  parenteral nutrition (TPN) is used when the daily caloric requirements exceed 2000 kcal or prolonged nutritional support is required. In such cases a catheter is inserted into a central vein to permit infusion of hypertonic solutions in a daily volume of approximately 40 mL/kg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potential complications of TPN are numerous (Table 16-7). Blood  glucose  concentrations  must  be  monitored,  because hyperglycemia  is  very  common  and  may  require  treatment with exogenous insulin. Hypoglycemia may occur if the TPN infusion  is  abruptly  discontinued,  since  the  increased  circulating endogenous concentrations  of  insulin  will  persist. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may occur because of the liberation of hydrochloric acid during the metabolism of amino acids present in most parenteral nutrition solutions. Parenteral feeding of patients with compromised cardiac function is associated with the risk of congestive heart failure from fl uid overload.  Increased  production  of  carbon  dioxide  resulting  from metabolism of large amounts of glucose may result in the need to initiate mechanical ventilation or failure to wean intubated patients.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Obesity is the most prevalent nutritional disease and is considered one of the most preventable causes of illness worldwide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Obesity leads  to  an  increased  incidence  of  glucose  intolerance, diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, coronary artery diseases, heart failure, cancer, and thromboembolic events.  A  waist/hip  ratio  higher  than  1.0  in  men  and  0.8 in women is a strong predictor of ischemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and death independent of total body fat.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Compared with the normal-weight population, the risk of premature death is doubled and the risk of death resulting from cardiovascular disease is increased fi vefold in the obese population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Bariatric surgery results in signi fi cant and sustained weight loss,  as  well  as  a  diminution  in  obesity-related  comorbid conditions. It is associated with a survival bene fi t.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Regional  anesthesia  is  the  preferred  method  of  primary anesthesia in the severely obese patient. Use of ultrasonography  in  clinical  practice  has  signi fi cantly  increased  the success rate of regional anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Airway management is one of the greatest challenges associated  with  general  anesthesia  in  obese  patients.  Mask ventilation is di ffi cult due to the presence of increased so ft tissues in the head, neck, and chest. Th e videolaryngoscope has improved the safety of tracheal intubation a ft er induction  of  anesthesia. Th erefore,  awake  intubations  are  now required less o ft en.

■ In the obese population, pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic  surgery  may  have  a  signi fi cant  deleterious impact on cardiopulmonary performance as indicated by decreased cardiac output and stroke volume, increased systemic vascular resistance, and decreased FRC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  impact  of  obesity  on  appropriate  dosing  of  intravenous anesthetic drugs is di ffi cult to predict. A useful clinical approach is to calculate the initial dose of injected drug based on lean body weight rather than total body weight.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ A  multimodal  approach  to  postoperative  pain  control  is usually  employed  to  decrease  the  risk  of  opioid-induced respiratory depression in the obese patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Current guidelines recommend screening and monitoring for signs of malnutrition in all patients admitted to the hospital.  In  situations  in  which  oral  intake  is  prohibited  and treatment of malnutrition is needed, supplementation can be provided by initiating enteral or parenteral nutrition.
