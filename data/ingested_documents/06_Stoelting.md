HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Definition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is a complex pathophysiologic state characterized by the inability of the heart to fi ll with or eject blood at a rate appropriate to meet tissue requirements. Symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue and signs of circulatory congestion and/or hypoperfusion are the clinical features of the heart failure syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidemiology and Costs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is a major health problem in the United States, a ff ecting  about  5.8  million  adults.  Each  year  an  additional 670,000 patients are diagnosed with heart failure. Heart failure is mainly a disease of the elderly, so aging of the population is contributing to its increased incidence. Th e incidence of heart failure approaches 10 per 1000 in the population aged 65 or older. Systolic heart failure is more common among middleaged men because of its association with coronary artery disease. Diastolic heart failure is usually seen in elderly women because of its association with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes a ft er menopause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is the most common Medicare hospital discharge diagnosis. More Medicare dollars are spent on the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure than on any other disease. It is estimated that the annual total direct and indirect cost of heart failure in the United States is $38 billion.

Etiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is a clinical syndrome arising from diverse causes. Th e principal pathophysiologic feature of heart failure is the inability of the heart to fi ll or empty the ventricles. Heart failure is most o ft en a result of (1) impaired myocardial contractility caused by ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy, (2) cardiac valve abnormalities, (3) systemic hypertension, (4) diseases of the pericardium, or (5) pulmonary hypertension (cor pulmonale). Th e most common cause of right ventricular failure is le ft ventricular (LV) failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FORMS OF VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure may be described in various ways: systolic or diastolic, acute or chronic, le ft sided or right sided, high output or low output. Early in the course of heart failure, the various categories may have di ff erent clinical and therapeutic implications. Ultimately, however, all forms of heart failure are characterized by high ventricular end-diastolic pressure because of altered ventricular function and neurohormonal regulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased  ventricular  systolic  wall  motion  re fl ects  systolic dysfunction, whereas diastolic dysfunction is characterized by abnormal ventricular relaxation and reduced compliance. Th ere are di ff erences in both myocardial architecture and function in systolic and diastolic heart failure, but clinical signs and symptoms cannot reliably di ff erentiate between these two entities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Causes  of  systolic  heart  failure  include  coronary  artery  disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, chronic pressure overload (aortic  stenosis  and  chronic  hypertension),  and  chronic  volume

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 6-1 Left ventricular dysfunction, regardless of cause, results in progressive remodeling of the ventricular chamber leading to dilation and a low ejection fraction. Cardiac dysrhythmias, progressive cardiac failure, and premature death are likely. Noncardiac factors such as neurohormonal stimulation, vasoconstriction, and renal sodium retention may be stimulated by left ventricular dysfunction and ultimately contribute to remodeling of the left ventricle and to the symptoms (dyspnea, fatigue, edema) considered characteristic of the clinical syndrome of congestive heart failure.

overload (regurgitant valvular lesions and high-output cardiac failure). Coronary disease typically results in regional defects in  ventricular  contraction,  which  may  become  global  over time, whereas all other causes of systolic heart failure produce global ventricular dysfunction. Ventricular dysrhythmias are common in patients with LV dysfunction. Patients with le ft bundle branch block and systolic heart failure are at high risk of sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A decreased ejection fraction, the hallmark of chronic LV systolic  dysfunction,  is  closely  related  to  the  increase  in  the diastolic  volume  of  the  LV  (Figure  6-1).  Measuring  the  LV ejection fraction via echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, or ventriculography provides the quanti fi cation necessary to document the severity of ventricular systolic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIASTOLIC HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic  heart  failure  in  patients  with  normal  or  nearnormal LV systolic function is most likely due to diastolic dysfunction.  However,  diastolic  heart  failure  may  co-exist  with systolic heart failure. Th e prevalence of diastolic heart failure is  age  dependent,  increasing  from  less  than  15%  in  patients younger than 45 years of age to 35% in those between the ages of 50 and 70 to more than 50% in patients older than 70 years. Diastolic heart failure can be classi fi ed into four stages. Class I is characterized by an abnormal LV relaxation pattern with normal le ft atrial pressure. Classes II, III, and IV are characterized by abnormal relaxation as well as reduced LV compliance resulting in an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). As a compensatory mechanism, the pressure in the le ft atrium increases so that LV fi lling can occur despite the increase in LVEDP.  Factors  that  predispose  to  decreased  ventricular distensibility  include  myocardial  edema, fi brosis,  hypertrophy,  aging,  and  pressure  overload.  Ischemic  heart  disease,

long-standing  essential  hypertension,  and  progressive  aortic stenosis are the most common causes of diastolic heart failure. In contrast to systolic heart failure, diastolic heart failure a ff ects  women more than men. Hospitalization and mortality rates are similar in patients with systolic and with diastolic heart failure. Th e major di ff erences between systolic and diastolic heart failure are presented in Table 6-1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute and Chronic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  heart  failure  is  de fi ned  as  a  change  in  the  signs  and symptoms  of  heart  failure  requiring  emergency  therapy. Chronic heart failure is present in patients with long-standing cardiac  disease.  Typically,  chronic  heart  failure  is  accompanied by venous congestion, but blood pressure is maintained. In acute heart failure due to a sudden decrease in cardiac output, systemic hypotension is typically present without signs of peripheral edema. Acute heart failure encompasses three clinical entities: (1) worsening chronic heart failure, (2) new-onset heart  failure  (such  as  that  caused  by  cardiac  valve  rupture, large myocardial infarction, or severe hypertensive crisis), and (3) terminal heart failure that is refractory to therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Left-Sided and Right-Sided Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased  ventricular  pressures  and  subsequent fl uid  accumulation  upstream  from  the  a ff ected  ventricle  produce  the clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure. In le ft -sided heart failure, high LVEDP promotes pulmonary venous congestion. Th e patient complains of dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which can evolve into pulmonary edema. Right-sided heart failure causes systemic venous congestion. Peripheral edema and congestive hepatomegaly are the most prominent  clinical  manifestations.  Right-sided  heart  failure may be caused by pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular myocardial infarction, but the most common cause is le ft -sided heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low-Output and High-Output Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e normal cardiac index varies between 2.2 and 3.5 L/min/ m 2 .  It  may  be  di ffi cult  to  diagnose  low-output  heart  failure, because a patient may have a cardiac index that is nearly normal in the resting state but shows an inadequate response to stress  or  exercise. Th e  most  common  causes  of  low-output heart  failure  are  coronary  artery  disease,  cardiomyopathy, hypertension, valvular disease, and pericardial disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Causes of high cardiac output include anemia, pregnancy, arteriovenous fi stulas,  severe  hyperthyroidism,  beriberi,  and Paget's disease. Th e ventricles fail not only due to the increased hemodynamic burden, but also due to direct myocardial toxicity (thyrotoxicosis and beriberi) or due to myocardial anoxia caused by severe and prolonged anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure is a complex phenomenon at both the clinical and cellular  levels.  Our  understanding  of  the  pathophysiology  of heart failure is in evolution. Th e initiating mechanisms of heart failure  are  pressure  overload  (aortic  stenosis,  essential  hypertension),  volume  overload  (mitral  or  aortic  regurgitation), myocardial  ischemia  or  infarction,  myocardial  in fl ammatory disease, and restricted diastolic fi lling (constrictive pericarditis, restrictive myocarditis). In the failing ventricle, various adaptive mechanisms are initiated to help maintain a normal cardiac output. Th ese include (1) increases in stroke volume according to  the  Frank-Starling  relationship;  (2)  activation  of  the  sympathetic nervous system; (3) alterations in the inotropic state, heart rate, and a ft erload; and (4) humorally mediated responses. In  more  advanced  stages  of  heart  failure,  these  mechanisms become maladaptive and ultimately lead to myocardial remodeling, which is the key pathophysiologic change responsible for the development and progression of heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Frank-Starling Relationship

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Frank-Starling  relationship  describes  the  increase  in stroke  volume  that  accompanies  an  increase  in  LV  enddiastolic  volume  and  pressure  (Figure  6-2).  Stroke  volume

increases because the tension developed by contracting muscle is greater when the resting length of that muscle is increased. Constriction of venous capacitance vessels shi ft s  blood  centrally, increases preload, and helps maintain cardiac output by the Frank-Starling relationship. Th e magnitude of the increase in  stroke  volume produced by changing the tension of ventricular  muscle fi bers  depends  on  myocardial  contractility. When myocardial contractility is decreased, as in the presence of heart failure, a lesser increase in stroke volume is achieved relative to any given increase in LVEDP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Activation of the sympathetic nervous system promotes arteriolar and venous constriction. Arteriolar constriction serves to maintain systemic blood pressure despite a decrease in cardiac output. Increased venous tone shi ft s blood from peripheral sites to the central circulation, thereby enhancing venous return and maintaining cardiac output by the Frank-Starling relationship. Furthermore, arteriolar constriction causes redistribution of blood from the kidneys, splanchnic organs, skeletal muscles, and skin to maintain coronary and cerebral blood fl ow despite an overall decrease in cardiac output. Th e decrease in renal blood fl ow activates the renin-angiotensinaldosterone  system  (RAAS),  which  increases  renal  tubular reabsorption of sodium and water and thus results in an increase in blood volume and ultimately cardiac output by the Frank-Starling  relationship. Th ese  compensatory  responses may be e ff ective in the short term, but they contribute to the deterioration of heart failure in the long term. For example, fl uid retention, increased venous return, and increased a ft erload  can  impose  more  work  on  the  failing  myocardium, increase myocardial energy expenditure, and further reduce cardiac  output  and  tissue  perfusion.  Interruption  of  this vicious circle is the purpose of the current therapeutic strategies for heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  heart  failure  is  associated  with  sympathetic activation,  a  downregulation  of β -adrenergic  receptors  is observed.  Plasma  and  urinary  concentrations  of  catecholamines are increased in patients in heart failure, and elevated levels  correlate  with  worse  clinical  outcomes.  High  plasma levels of norepinephrine are directly cardiotoxic and promote myocyte  necrosis  and  cell  death,  which  lead  to  ventricular remodeling. Th erapy with β -blockers is aimed at decreasing the deleterious e ff ects of catecholamines on the heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alterations in the Inotropic State, Heart Rate, and Afterload

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e inotropic state describes myocardial  contractility as re fl ected by the velocity of contraction developed by cardiac muscle. Th e maximum velocity of contraction is referred to as Vmax . When the inotropic state of the heart is increased, as in the presence of catecholamines, V max is increased. Conversely, Vmax is  decreased when myocardial contractility is impaired, as in heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft erload  is  the  tension  the  ventricular  muscle  must develop to open the aortic or pulmonic valve. Th e  a ft erload presented to the le ft ventricle is increased in the presence of systemic  arteriolar  constriction  and  hypertension.  Administration of vasodilating drugs can increase forward LV stroke volume in patients with heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the presence of systolic heart failure and low cardiac output, stroke volume is relatively fi xed, and any increase in cardiac output depends on an increase in heart rate. Tachycardia is  an  expected fi nding in the presence of systolic heart failure with a low ejection fraction and re fl ects activation of the sympathetic nervous system. In the presence of diastolic heart failure,  however,  tachycardia can produce a decrease in cardiac output resulting from inadequate ventricular relaxation and fi lling time. Th erefore, heart rate control is an important goal in the treatment of diastolic heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Humorally Mediated Responses and Biochemical Pathways

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As heart failure progresses, various neurohumoral pathways are  activated  to  maintain  adequate  cardiac  output  during exercise and ultimately even at rest. Generalized vasoconstriction is initiated via several mechanisms, including increased activity  of  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  and  the  RAAS, parasympathetic withdrawal, high levels of circulating vasopressin, endothelial dysfunction, and release of in fl ammatory mediators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  an  attempt  to  counterbalance  these  mechanisms,  the heart evolves into an "endocrine" organ. Th is concept emerged more than 20 years ago when the presence of a potent diuretic and vasodilator in the atria of rats was fi rst  reported.  Atrial natriuretic  peptide  (ANP)  is  stored  in  atrial  muscle  and released in response to increases in atrial pressure, such as are produced by tachycardia or hypervolemia. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secreted by both the atrial and ventricular

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
myocardium. In the failing heart, the ventricle becomes the principal  site  of  BNP  production. Th e  natriuretic  peptides promote blood pressure control and protect the cardiovascular system from the e ff ects of volume and pressure overload. Physiologic e ff ects of the natriuretic peptides include diuresis, natriuresis, vasodilation, antiin fl ammatory e ff ect, and inhibition of the RAAS and the sympathetic nervous system. Both ANP and BNP inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and fi brosis  and therefore limit remodeling. Th e response to elevated levels of endogenous natriuretic peptides is blunted over time in heart failure. However, exogenous administration of BNP can be useful in the treatment of acute heart failure. More recently, other protective neurohumoral pathways have been described. Chromogranin A and its derived peptides catestatin and vasostatin appear to counteract the negative myocardial e ff ects of excessive sympathetic stimulation seen in heart failure states.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial Remodeling

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myocardial remodeling is the result of the various endogenous mechanisms that the body uses to maintain cardiac output. It  is  the  process  by  which  mechanical,  neurohormonal,  and genetic factors change LV size, shape, and function. Th e process includes myocardial hypertrophy, myocardial dilation and wall thinning, increased interstitial collagen deposition, myocardial fi brosis,  and  scar  formation  resulting  from  myocyte death. Myocardial hypertrophy represents the compensatory mechanism for chronic pressure overload. Th e e ff ects of this mechanism are limited because hypertrophied cardiac muscle functions at a lower inotropic state than normal cardiac muscle.  Cardiac  dilation  occurs  in  response  to  volume  overload and increases cardiac output by the Frank-Starling relationship.  However,  the  increased  cardiac  wall  tension  produced by an enlarged ventricular radius is associated with increased myocardial oxygen requirements and decreased pumping e ffi -ciency.  Ischemic  injury  is  the  most  common  cause  of  myocardial  remodeling  and  encompasses  both  hypertrophy  and dilation of the le ft ventricle. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and aldosterone inhibitors (spironolactone and  eplerenone)  have  been  proven  to  promote  a  "reverseremodeling" process. Th erefore, they are indicated as fi rst-line therapy  for  heart  failure.  Several  studies  have  documented that cardiac resynchronization therapy has bene fi cial reverseremodeling e ff ects  not  only  in  patients  with  advanced  heart failure, but also in patients with milder forms of disease who exhibit wide QRS complexes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hemodynamic  consequences  of  heart  failure  include  a decreased cardiac output, increased LVEDP, peripheral vasoconstriction,  retention  of  sodium  and  water,  and  decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues with a widened arterial-venous oxygen di ff erence. LV failure results in signs and symptoms of pulmonary edema, whereas right ventricular failure results in systemic venous hypertension and peripheral edema. Fatigue and organ system dysfunction are related to inadequate cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dyspnea re fl ects increased work of breathing caused by sti ff -ness of the lungs produced by interstitial pulmonary edema. It is one of the earliest subjective fi ndings of LV failure and initially occurs only with exertion. Dyspnea can be quanti fi ed by asking the patient how many fl ights of stairs can be climbed or the distance that can be walked at a normal pace before symptoms begin. Some patients experiencing angina pectoris may interpret substernal discomfort as breathlessness. Dyspnea can be caused by many other diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), airway obstruction, anxiety,  and  neuromuscular  weakness.  Dyspnea  related  to heart failure will be linked to other supporting evidence, such as  a  history  of  orthopnea,  paroxysmal  nocturnal  dyspnea,  a third heart sound, rales on physical examination, and elevated BNP levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orthopnea re fl ects the inability of the failing LV to handle the  increased  venous  return  associated  with  the  recumbent position.  Clinically,  orthopnea  is  manifested  as  a  dry,  nonproductive cough that develops in the supine position and is relieved by sitting up. Th e orthopneic cough di ff ers from the productive morning cough characteristic of chronic bronchitis  and  must  be  di ff erentiated  from  the  cough  produced  by ACE inhibitors. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is shortness of breath that awakens a patient from sleep. Th is symptom must be  di ff erentiated  from  anxiety-provoked  hyperventilation  or wheezing resulting from accumulation of secretions in patients with  chronic  bronchitis.  Paroxysmal  nocturnal  dyspnea  and wheezing caused by pulmonary congestion (cardiac asthma) are  accompanied  by  radiographic  evidence  of  pulmonary congestion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hallmarks  of  decreased  cardiac  reserve  and  low  cardiac output  include  fatigue  and  weakness  at  rest  or  with  minimal exertion. During exercise, the failing ventricle is unable to increase its output to deliver adequate amounts of oxygen to  muscles. Th ese  symptoms, although nonspeci fi c,  are  very common in patients with heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart failure  patients  may  complain  of  anorexia,  nausea, or abdominal pain related to liver congestion or prerenal azotemia. Decreases in cerebral blood fl ow may produce confusion, di ffi culty concentrating, insomnia, anxiety, or memory de fi cits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical Examination Findings

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  classic  physical fi ndings  of  patients  with  LV  failure  are tachypnea and the presence of moist rales. Th ese rales may be con fi ned to the lung bases in patients with mild heart failure, or they may be di ff use in those with pulmonary edema. Other fi ndings of  heart  failure  include  a  resting  tachycardia  and  a third  heart  sound  (S 3 gallop  or  ventricular  diastolic  gallop).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 6 HEART FAILURE AND CARDIOMYOPATHIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
125

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is heart sound is produced by blood entering and distending a relatively noncompliant le ft ventricle. Despite peripheral vasoconstriction, severe heart failure may manifest as systemic hypotension with cool and pale extremities. Lip and nail bed cyanosis may be present. A narrow pulse pressure with a high diastolic pressure re fl ects a decreased stroke volume. Marked weight loss, also known as cardiac cachexia, is a sign of severe chronic heart failure. Weight loss is caused by a combination of factors, including an increase in the metabolic rate, anorexia, nausea,  decreased  intestinal  absorption  of  food  because  of splanchnic venous congestion, and the presence of high levels of circulating cytokines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With right-sided heart failure or biventricular failure, jugular venous distention may be present or may be inducible by pressing on the liver (hepatojugular re fl ux). Th e liver is typically the fi rst organ to become engorged with blood in the presence of right-sided or biventricular failure. Th e hepatic engorgement may be associated with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness or even jaundice in severe cases. Pleural e ff usions (usually right sided) may be present. Bilateral pitting pretibial edema is typically present with right ventricular failure and re fl ects both venous congestion and sodium and water retention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of heart failure is based on the history, physical examination fi ndings, and results of laboratory and diagnostic tests.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory Tests

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e di ff erential diagnosis of dyspnea continues to be challenging both in the urgent/emergent and in the primary care setting. Th e use of serum levels of BNP and its associated N-terminal fragment NT-proBNP as biomarkers for heart failure can help in establishing the cause of dyspnea. Plasma BNP levels below 100 pg/mL indicate that heart failure is unlikely (90% negative predictive value). BNP levels in the range of 100 to 500 pg/mL suggest an intermediate probability of heart failure. Levels higher than 500 pg/mL are consistent with the diagnosis of heart failure (90% positive predictive value). An NT-proBNP level of 300 pg/ mL appears to be a sensitive cuto ff point for detecting dyspnea of cardiac origin. Plasma levels of BNP and NT-proBNP may be a ff ected by other factors such as gender, advanced age, renal function,  obesity,  pulmonary  embolism,  and  atrial fi brillation and other cardiac tachydysrhythmias. Th erefore, the interpretation of BNP levels requires a clinical context.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  complete  metabolic  pro fi le  should  be  obtained  in  the evaluation  of  patients  with  heart  failure.  Decreases  in  renal blood fl ow may lead to prerenal azotemia characterized by a disproportionate increase in blood urea nitrogen concentration relative to serum creatinine concentration. When moderate liver congestion is present, liver enzyme levels may be mildly  elevated,  and  when  liver  engorgement  is  severe,  the prothrombin time may be prolonged. Hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, and hypokalemia may also be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrocardiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with heart failure usually have abnormalities on the 12-lead  electrocardiogram  (ECG). Th erefore,  this  test  has a low predictive value for the diagnosis of heart failure. Th e ECG may show evidence of previous myocardial infarction, LV hypertrophy, conduction abnormalities (le ft bundle branch block, widened QRS), or various cardiac dysrhythmias, especially atrial fi brillation and ventricular dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest Radiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest  radiography  (posteroanterior  and  lateral  views)  may detect  the  presence  of  pulmonary  disease,  cardiomegaly, pulmonary  venous  congestion,  and  interstitial  or  alveolar pulmonary edema. An early radiographic sign of LV failure and associated pulmonary venous hypertension is distention of the pulmonary veins in the upper lobes of the lungs. Perivascular edema appears as hilar or perihilar haze. Th e  hilus appears  large  with  ill-de fi ned margins. Kerley's  lines,  which re fl ect edematous interlobular septae in the upper lung fi elds (Kerley's A lines), lower lung fi elds (Kerley's B lines), or basilar regions of the lungs (Kerley's C lines) and produce a honeycomb pattern, may also be present. Alveolar edema produces homogeneous densities in the lung fi elds, typically in a butter fl y pattern. Pleural e ff usion and pericardial e ff usion may be observed.  Radiographic  evidence  of  pulmonary  edema  may lag  behind the clinical evidence of pulmonary edema by up to  12  hours.  Likewise,  radiographic  patterns  of  pulmonary congestion may persist for several days a ft er normalization of cardiac fi lling pressures and resolution of symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography is the most useful test in the diagnosis of heart  failure.  Comprehensive  two-dimensional echocardiography  coupled  with  Doppler fl ow  examination  can  assess whether any abnormalities of the myocardium, cardiac valves, or  pericardium  are  present. Th is  examination  evaluates  LV and RV structure and function (systolic and diastolic) as well as  valvular  function,  and  detects  the  presence  of  pericardial disease. Th is information is presented as numerical estimates of ejection fraction, LV size and wall thickness, le ft atrial size, and  pulmonary  artery  pressures  as  well  as  a  description  of anatomic structures and wall motion. Assessment of diastolic function  provides  information  regarding  LV fi lling  and  le ft atrial  pressure. A preoperative echocardiographic evaluation provides information useful in guiding perioperative management and serves as a baseline for comparison if the patient's condition changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CLASSIFICATION OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart  failure  has  been  classi fi ed  in  various  ways. Th e  most commonly used classi fi cation is that of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) and is based on the functional status of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
126

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the patient at a particular time. Functional status may worsen or  improve. Th e  classi fi cation  is  intended  for  patients  who have structural heart disease and symptoms of heart failure. Th ere are four functional classes:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class I: Ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class II: Symptoms occur with ordinary exertion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class III: Symptoms occur with less than ordinary exertion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Class IV: Symptoms occur at rest

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is classi fi cation is useful because the severity of the symptoms has an excellent correlation with quality of life and survival.  However,  the  American  College  of  Cardiology  (ACC) and  the  American  Heart  Association  (AHA)  published  the 2005  Guideline  Update  for  the  Diagnosis  and  Management of Chronic Heart Failure and introduced a new classi fi cation based  on  the  progression  of  the  disease. Th is  classi fi cation strati fi es patients into one of four disease stages:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage A: Patients  at  high  risk  of  heart  failure  but  without structural heart disease or symptoms of heart failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage C: Patients with structural heart disease with previous or current symptoms of heart failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage B: Patients  with  structural  heart  disease  but  without symptoms of heart failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stage D: Patients with refractory heart failure requiring specialized interventions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is  classi fi cation  is  meant  to  be  complementary  to  the NYHA classi fi cation and to be used in guiding therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current  therapeutic  strategies  are  aimed  at  reversing  the pathophysiologic  alterations  present  in  heart  failure  and  at interrupting  the  vicious  circle  of  maladaptive  mechanisms (Figure  6-3).  Short-term  therapeutic  goals  in  patients  with heart failure  include  relieving  symptoms of circulatory congestion, increasing tissue perfusion, and improving quality of life. However, management of heart failure involves more than symptomatic treatment. Th e processes that contributed to the LV dysfunction may progress independently of the development of symptoms. Th erefore, the long-term therapeutic goal is  to  prolong  life  by  slowing  or  reversing  the  progression  of ventricular remodeling.

Management of Chronic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current therapeutic protocols are based on the results of large, adequately powered, randomized trials and on the ACC/AHA and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic heart failure. According to these guidelines,  treatment  options  include  lifestyle  modi fi cation, patient and family education, medical therapy, corrective surgery, implantation of cardiac devices, and cardiac transplantation (Figure 6-4).

Lifestyle modi fi cations are aimed at decreasing the risk of heart disease and include smoking cessation, adherence to a healthy diet with moderate sodium restriction, weight control,

options for patients with heart failure affect the pathophysiologic mechanisms that are stimulated in heart failure. Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers decrease afterload by interfering with the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, which results in peripheral vasodilation. They also affect left ventricular hypertrophy, remodeling, and renal blood flow. Aldosterone production by the adrenal glands is increased in heart failure. It stimulates renal sodium retention and potassium excretion and promotes ventricular and vascular hypertrophy. Aldosterone antagonists counteract the many effects of aldosterone. Diuretics decrease preload by stimulating natriuresis in the kidneys. Digoxin affects the sodium-potassium-adenosine triphosphatase (Na + ,K + -ATPase) pump in the myocardial cell, increasing contractility. Inotropes such as dobutamine and milrinone increase myocardial contractility. β -Blockers inhibit the sympathetic nervous system and adrenergic receptors. They slow the heart rate, decrease blood pressure, and have a direct beneficial effect on the myocardium by enhancing reverse remodeling. Selected agents that also block α -adrenergic receptors can cause vasodilation. Vasodilator therapy such as combination therapy with hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate decreases afterload by counteracting peripheral vasoconstriction. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing improves left ventricular function and favors reverse remodeling. Nesiritide (B-type natriuretic peptide) decreases preload by stimulating diuresis and decreases afterload by vasodilation. Exercise improves peripheral blood flow by eventually counteracting peripheral vasoconstriction. It also improves skeletal muscle physiology. (Reproduced with permission from Jessup M, Brozena S.

Management of Systolic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  major  classes  of  drugs  used  for  medical  management of  systolic  heart  failure  include  inhibitors  of  the  RAAS, β -blockers, diuretics, digoxin, vasodilators, and statins. Most heart failure patients are treated with a combination of drugs. Th erapy with ACE inhibitors and β -blockers favorably in fl uences long-term outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INHIBITORS OF THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN-ALDOSTERONE SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhibition of the RAAS can be performed at several levels: by inhibiting the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, by blocking the angiotensin II receptor, or by blocking the aldosterone receptor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACE inhibitors  block  the  conversion  of  angiotensin  I  to angiotensin II. Th is decreases the activation of the RAAS and decreases  the  degradation  of  bradykinin.  Bene fi cial  e ff ects include promoting vasodilation, reducing water and sodium reabsorption,  and  supporting  potassium  conservation. Th is class of drugs has been proven to decrease ventricular remodeling and even to potentiate the reverse-remodeling phenomenon. In large clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have consistently been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients at any stage of heart failure. For this reason, they are considered the fi rst  line  of  treatment  in  heart  failure.  It  appears,  however,  that  the  African  American  population  does  not  derive as much clinical bene fi t from ACE inhibitor therapy as does the white population. Side e ff ects  of  ACE inhibitors include hypotension, syncope, renal dysfunction, hyperkalemia, and development of a nonproductive cough and/or angioedema. Treatment with ACE inhibitors should be started at low dosages to avoid signi fi cant hypotension. Th en the dosage can be gradually increased until the target dosage is reached.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As their name implies, angiotensin receptor blockers block angiotensin II receptors. Th e e ffi cacy of these drugs is similar but not superior to that of ACE inhibitors. Currently, angiotensin receptor blockers are recommended only for patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. In some patients treated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
128

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin levels may gradually return to normal due to alternative pathways of angiotensin production. Such patients may bene fi t from the addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker to their medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aldosterone Antagonists

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In advanced stages of heart failure, there are high circulating  levels  of  aldosterone.  Aldosterone  stimulates  sodium  and water  retention,  hypokalemia,  and  ventricular  remodeling. Aldosterone antagonists reverse all of these e ff ects and therefore improve the cardiovascular milieu in patients with heart failure. Th ere is strong clinical evidence showing reduced mortality and hospitalization rates with use of a low dosage of an aldosterone antagonist in patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure. More recently, eplerenone has been demonstrated to reduce the rate of death from cardiovascular events and the number of hospitalizations related to heart failure even in patients with NYHA class II heart failure. In patients being treated with aldosterone antagonists renal function and potassium levels should be monitored and the medication dosage adjusted accordingly. Currently it is recommended that aldosterone antagonists be incorporated as fi rst-line therapy in all patients with heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -BLOCKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers are used to reverse the harmful e ff ects of sympathetic nervous system activation in heart failure. Clinical trials  have  consistently  shown  that  use  of  these  drugs  reduces morbidity and the number of hospitalizations and improves both quality of life and survival. β -Blockers increase the ejection fraction and decrease ventricular remodeling. ACC/AHA guidelines  recommend  the  use  of β -blockers  as  an  integral part of the therapy for heart failure. However, caution must be used when administering β -blockers to patients with reactive airway disease, diabetic patients with frequent hypoglycemic episodes, and patients with bradydysrhythmias or heart block.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIURETICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diuretics  can  relieve  circulatory  congestion  and  its  accompanying pulmonary and peripheral edema and do so more rapidly  than  any  other  drugs.  Symptomatic  improvement  can  be noted within hours. Diuretic-induced decreases in ventricular diastolic pressure will decrease diastolic ventricular wall stress and prevent the persistent cardiac distention that interferes with subendocardial  perfusion  and  negatively  a ff ects  myocardial metabolism  and  function. Th iazide  and/or  loop  diuretics  are recommended as an essential part of the therapy for heart failure. Potassium and magnesium supplementation may be needed in patients receiving long-term treatment with diuretics to prevent cardiac dysrhythmias. Excessive dosages of diuretics may cause  hypovolemia,  prerenal  azotemia,  or  an  undesirably  low cardiac output and are associated with worse clinical outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIGITALIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Digitalis  enhances  the  inotropy  of  cardiac  muscle  and  de  creases sympathetic and RAAS activation. Th ese latter e ff ects are related to the ability of digitalis to restore the inhibitory e ff ects  of  the  cardiac  baroreceptors  on  central  sympathetic out fl ow. It is unclear whether digitalis treatment improves survival, but digoxin may impede the worsening of heart failure and result in fewer hospitalizations. Digitalis can be added to standard therapy when patients are still symptomatic despite treatment  with  diuretics,  ACE  inhibitors,  and β -blockers. Patients with the combination of atrial fi brillation and heart failure  are  another  subgroup  that  may  bene fi t  from  digoxin therapy. Caution should be used when administering this drug to elderly patients or to those with impaired renal function, since these patients are particularly prone to development of digitalis  toxicity.  Manifestations  of  digitalis  toxicity  include anorexia,  nausea,  blurred  vision,  and  cardiac  dysrhythmias. Treatment  of  toxicity  may  include  reversing  hypokalemia, treating cardiac dysrhythmias, administering antidigoxin antibodies, and/or placing a temporary cardiac pacemaker.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VASODILATORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasodilator therapy relaxes vascular smooth muscle, decreases resistance to LV ejection, and increases venous capacitance. In patients with a dilated le ft ventricle, administration of vasodilators results in increased stroke volume and decreased ventricular fi lling pressures. African Americans seem to respond very well to vasodilator therapy and show improved clinical outcomes when treated with a combination of hydralazine and nitrates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STATINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of their antiin fl ammatory and lipid-lowering e ff ects, statins have been proven to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with systolic heart failure. Promising studies suggest that patients with diastolic heart failure could derive similar bene fi ts from statin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Diastolic Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  management  of  systolic  heart  failure  is  based  on  the results of large-scale randomized trials, but the treatment of diastolic heart failure remains mostly empirical. It is generally accepted  that  the  best  treatment  strategy  for  diastolic  heart failure is prevention. ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that patients at risk of developing diastolic heart failure be preemptively treated. Unfortunately, there are no drugs that selectively improve  diastolic  distensibility.  Current  treatment  options include  consumption  of  a  low-sodium  diet,  cautious  use  of diuretics to relieve pulmonary congestion without an excessive decrease in preload, maintenance of normal sinus rhythm at  a  heart  rate  that  optimizes  ventricular fi lling,  and  correction of precipitating factors such as acute myocardial ischemia and systemic hypertension. Long-acting nitrates and diuretics  may alleviate the symptoms of diastolic heart failure but do not alter the natural history of the disease. Statin therapy early in the course of the disease may play an important role in  decreasing  ventricular  remodeling  and  reducing  disease progression. Th e general concepts of managing patients with diastolic heart failure are outlined in Table 6-2.

Surgical Management of Heart Failure

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is aimed at patients with  heart  failure  who  have  a  ventricular  conduction  delay (QRS prolongation on ECG). Such a conduction delay creates a mechanical dyssynchrony that impairs ventricular function and worsens prognosis. CRT, also known as biventricular pacing, consists  of  placement  of  a  dual-chamber  cardiac  pacemaker (right atrial and ventricular leads) with an additional lead introduced via the coronary sinus into an epicardial coronary vein and advanced until it reaches the lateral wall of the LV. With this lead in place, the heart contracts more e ffi ciently and ejects a larger cardiac output. CRT is recommended for patients with NYHA class III or IV disease with an LV ejection fraction of less than 35% and a QRS duration of 120 to 150 milliseconds. Patients undergoing CRT have fewer symptoms, better exercise tolerance, improved ventricular function, fewer hospitalizations for heart failure, and decreased mortality  compared  with  similar  patients  receiving  pharmacologic therapy  alone. Th e  reverse-remodeling  process  induced  by CRT appears to be the main determinant of improved survival in these patients. Unfortunately, this form of therapy fails to produce improvement in about one third of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Implantable cardioverter-de fi brillators (ICDs) are used for prevention of sudden death in patients with advanced heart failure.  Approximately  one  half  of  deaths  in  heart  failure patients  are  sudden  and  due  to  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Current recommendations for the use of ICDs in patients at risk of  sudden death are listed in Table 6-3. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients treated with a combination of CRT and  ICD  placement  have  fewer  hospitalizations  and  better survival rates at 2 years than patients who receive only ICD therapy. However, this advantage comes at the cost of higher device-related  complication  rates  in  the fi rst  30  days  a ft er implantation.

Part  of  the  overall  management  of  heart  failure  includes strategies  aimed  at  eliminating  the  cause  of  the  disease.  LV ischemia may be treated with percutaneous coronary interventions or coronary artery bypass surgery. Severe heart failure symptoms in the presence of correctable cardiac valve lesions may  be  alleviated  surgically.  Ventricular  aneurysmectomy may  be  useful  in  patients  with  large  ventricular  scars  a ft er myocardial infarction. Th e de fi nitive treatment for heart failure is cardiac transplantation. Currently in the United States 150,000 patients are listed as candidates for cardiac transplantation, but only 2000 hearts are available per year. Th e limited supply of donors renders this treatment unattainable for most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients in the terminal stages of heart failure may bene fi t from mechanical support of circulation, such as insertion of a pulsatile or nonpulsatile ventricular assist device (VAD) or a  total  arti fi cial  heart.  Studies  have  demonstrated  not  only increased survival but also improved quality of life in heart failure  patients  treated  with  VADs  compared  with  those treated with medical therapy alone. Th ese mechanical pumps take over either partial or total function of the damaged ventricle and facilitate restoration of normal hemodynamics and tissue blood fl ow. A VAD drains blood returning to the failed side of the heart and pumps it downstream of the failed ventricle. Th ese devices are useful in patients who require temporary ventricular assistance to allow the heart to recover its function, in patients who are awaiting cardiac transplantation ( bridge therapy ),  and in patients with advanced heart failure who are not transplant candidates ( destination therapy ). Firstgeneration le ft ventricular assist devices (LVADs) captured the entire cardiac output and ejected it, in a pulsatile fashion, into the ascending aorta as does the native le ft ventricle. To create pulsatile fl ow, the device had a complicated mechanism that included valves preventing systolic retrograde blood fl ow. As a result, the fi rst-generation LVADs were noisy, fairly large, and prone to signi fi cant complications related to mechanical pump failure and thromboembolic events. With the advent of modern  miniaturization  technology  and  the  general  acceptance by the medical community that nonpulsatile fl ow can be well tolerated, second and third generations of LVADs have been developed. Second-generation LVADs are axial fl ow pumps.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
130

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ird-generation  LVADs  are  centrifugal  electromagnetically powered  pumps. Th ese  devices  generate  nonpulsatile fl ow, are smaller and quieter, and are associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolic events. Th erefore they have become an attractive therapeutic option for an increasing number of patients with heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with fi xed  pulmonary  hypertension  requiring biventricular support for extended periods of time may bene fi t from implantation of a total arti fi cial heart as a bridge to transplantation  or  as  destination  therapy. Th e  total  arti fi cial heart is implanted in the chest in lieu of the native heart. Th is device generates pulsatile fl ow and consists of two mechanical pumps (each operating as a ventricle) with two valves apiece. Th e  total  arti fi cial  heart  represents the best option for longterm survival in this patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH IMPLANTABLE NONPULSATILE VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  more  VADs  are  being  inserted,  a  growing  number  of patients  with  VADs  will  be  undergoing  noncardiac  surgery. To provide optimal care to these patients, the anesthesiologist needs to understand the features of nonpulsatile devices and the potential causes of mishaps that can occur during anesthesia and surgery. Th e most commonly used VAD in the United States  is  the  HeartMate  II  ( Th oratec  Corporation,  Pleasanton, Calif.), a second-generation continuousfl ow device. Th e pump is implanted extraperitoneally in the le ft upper abdomen, draining blood from the LV apex via the in fl ow cannula and ejecting it into the ascending aorta via the out fl ow cannula (Figure 6-5). A drive line connects the pump to electrical  power  as  well  as  to  an  external  console,  which  displays the pump fl ows and other system information. Th e drive line crosses  the  abdomen  and  exits  the  skin  in  the  right  upper quadrant, and this is the site most likely to become infected. However, the drive line should not be prepped with povidoneiodine  solutions  because  this  leads  to  plastic  breakdown. Alternatively, the drive line can be draped out of the fi eld.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthetic considerations for patients with VADs include appropriate perioperative management of anticoagulation therapy and cardiac rhythm devices, provision of suitable  antibiotic  prophylaxis,  con fi rmation  that  the  device  is plugged into an electrical outlet, and avoidance of chest compression to prevent dislodgement of cannulae. Use of surgical electrocautery can cause electromagnetic interference with the VAD, which can a ff ect pump fl ow and induce device reprogramming. Th erefore,  bipolar  cautery  should  be  used  when feasible, or the grounding electrode of the monopolar cautery should  be  placed  so  as  to  direct  the  current  away  from  the VAD generator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic monitoring of a patient with an implantable nonpulsatile device represents a particular challenge for the anesthesiologist. Neither the noninvasive blood pressure monitor  nor  the  pulse  oximeter  will  provide  useful  information because there is no pulse. As a substitute for a pulse oximeter, a cerebral oximeter, which does not rely on pulsatile fl ow, can be used. Intermittent monitoring of oxygen saturation can also be accomplished by arterial blood gas analysis. An intraarterial catheter is required for measurement of mean blood pressure. However, because of the lack of pulsatility in the artery, placement of an arterial catheter may be very diffi cult and is usually facilitated by ultrasonographic guidance. Transesophageal echocardiography represents one of the most useful monitoring techniques for patients with VADs since it provides real-time information regarding volume status, right ventricular function, and in fl ow-out fl ow cannulae function.

ventricular failure, and increased a ft erload. Intravascular volume optimization is a major concern in patients with all types of VADs, but this is particularly important with nonpulsatile devices, because the continuous drainage of an under fi lled le ft side of the heart will eventually lead to LV suck-down. Such a situation results in a dramatic decrease in cardiac output. It can be rapidly diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography and is treated by temporarily decreasing the pump speed followed by volume expansion. Good right ventricular function is a critical aspect of optimal LV AD fl ow. Intraoperatively, factors  that  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance  (hypercarbia,  vasoconstrictor  drugs)  will  impair  right  ventricular function and thus impede blood fl ow to the le ft side  of  the heart.  Both  decreases  and  increases  in  a ft erload  can  signi fi -cantly impact LVAD fl ow. Small doses of vasopressor medications that have less impact on pulmonary vascular resistance (e.g., vasopressin) may be successfully used to counteract the decrease in a ft erload seen with general anesthesia. However, high doses of vasopressors, especially in the face of hypovolemia, will inevitably lead to a decrease in LVAD fl ow. Excellent communication among the entire perioperative team (anesthesiologist, surgeon, cardiologist, nurses, VAD personnel) is essential for good perioperative outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Acute Heart Failure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may experience acute heart failure or decompensated chronic heart failure. Anesthesiologists o ft en deal with acute heart failure in patients who undergo emergency surgery or in patients who experience cardiac decompensation during any kind of surgery. Acute heart failure therapy has three phases: the emergency phase, the in-hospital management phase, and the  predischarge  phase.  For  the  anesthesiologist,  the  emergency phase is of most interest and is the phase that is addressed here. High ventricular fi lling pressures, low cardiac output, and hypertension  or  hypotension  characterize  the  hemodynamic pro fi le  of  acute  heart  failure.  Traditional  therapies  include diuretics, vasodilators, inotropic drugs, mechanical  assist devices  (intraaortic  balloon  pump,  VAD),  and  emergency cardiac surgery. Newer therapies include calcium sensitizers, exogenous BNP, and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIURETICS AND VASODILATORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Loop  diuretics  can  improve  symptoms  rapidly,  but  at  high doses, they may have deleterious e ff ects on clinical outcomes. It may be more desirable to use a combination of a low dose of loop diuretic and an intravenous vasodilator. Nitroglycerin and nitroprusside reduce LV fi lling pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increase stroke volume. However, nitroprusside may have a negative impact on clinical outcome in patients with acute myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INOTROPIC SUPPORT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Positive inotropic drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for patients in cardiogenic shock. Th e positive inotropic e ff ect is produced via an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(cAMP), which promotes an increase in intracellular calcium levels and thereby an improvement in excitation-contraction coupling. Catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine,  and  dobutamine)  do  this  by  direct β -receptor stimulation, whereas phosphodiesterase inhibitors (amrinone, milrinone) block the degradation of cAMP. Side e ff ects of inotropic  drugs  include  tachycardia,  increased  myocardial  oxygen consumption, dysrhythmias, worsening of diastolic heart failure, and downregulation of β receptors. Long-term use of these drugs may result in cardiotoxicity and accelerate myocardial cell death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CALCIUM SENSITIZERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myo fi lament calcium sensitizers are a new class of positive inotropic drugs that increase contractility without increasing  intracellular  levels  of  calcium. Th erefore,  there  is  no signi fi cant  increase  in  myocardial  oxygen  consumption  or heart  rate  and  no  propensity  for  dysrhythmias. Th e  most widely used medication in this class is levosimendan. It is an inodilator, increasing  myocardial  contractile  strength and promoting dilation of systemic, pulmonary, and coronary arteries. It does not worsen diastolic function. Studies have shown that levosimendan may be particularly useful in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Use of levosimendan is included in the European guidelines for treatment of acute heart failure, but the drug is not yet available for use in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EXOGENOUS B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nesiritide is recombinant BNP that binds to both the A- and B-type  natriuretic  receptors.  By  inhibiting  the  RAAS  and sympathetic  tone,  this  natriuretic  peptide  promotes  arterial,  venous,  and  coronary  vasodilation,  thereby  decreasing LVEDP and improving dyspnea. It also induces diuresis and natriuresis,  has  lusitropic  properties,  and  lacks  any  prodysrhythmic e ff ects. In many ways its e ff ects are similar to those of nitroglycerin, but nesiritide generally produces less hypotension and more diuresis than nitroglycerin. Nesiritide given intravenously has been studied extensively in large clinical trials. Currently it is felt that this drug may not o ff er advantages over traditional treatments for acute heart failure and may be associated  with  worsening  renal  function  and  perhaps  even increased mortality. However, ongoing research is evaluating the use of subcutaneous BNP in patients with acute heart failure and an LVEF of less than 35%. Th e preliminary results are promising and show an increase in cardiac output, decrease in mean arterial pressure, no change in heart rate, a decrease in RAAS activity, and increased diuresis and natriuresis. An oral form of BNP is under investigation.

MECHANICAL DEVICES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  the  cause  of  acute  heart  failure  is  an  extensive  myocardial  infarction,  the  insertion  of  an  intraaortic  balloon pump should be considered. Th e  intraaortic  balloon  pump is  a  mechanical  device  inserted  via  the  femoral  artery  and positioned just below the le ft subclavian artery. Its  balloon in fl ates  in  diastole,  increasing  aortic  diastolic  blood  pressure and coronary perfusion pressure. Th e  balloon  de fl ates in  systole,  creating  a  suction  e ff ect  that  enhances  LV  ejection. Complications of intraaortic balloon pump use include femoral  artery  or  aortic  dissection,  bleeding,  thrombosis, and infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases of severe cardiogenic shock, emergency insertion  of  a  left  and/or  right  ventricular  assist  device  may be  necessary  for  survival.  Percutaneous  ventricular  assist devices  (pVADs)  have  been  developed  and  successfully inserted in patients with acute heart failure. These devices restore normal hemodynamics and therefore maintain vital organ perfusion. More importantly, these devices allow for unloading of the left side of the heart, thereby reducing LV strain and myocardial work and improving the remodeling process seen in acute heart failure. The pVADs are designed to offer temporary circulatory support in cardiogenic shock for up to 14 days as a transition to recovery or as a bridge to a definitive cardiac procedure (coronary stenting, coronary artery bypass grafting, VAD insertion, or heart transplantation). Trials comparing the efficacy of a pVAD versus an intraaortic balloon pump in patients with severe acute heart failure have demonstrated a better metabolic profile and  superior  hemodynamic  support  in  patients  receiving pVAD therapy but have failed so far to show a decrease in 30-day mortality rates with the use of a pVAD. There are two types of percutaneous devices designed for short-term circulatory  support:  the  Impella  system  (Abiomed  Inc., Danvers, Mass.) and the TandemHeart (CardiacAssist Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Impella system consists of a miniaturized axialfl ow rotary blood pump that is inserted via the femoral artery and advanced  under fl uoroscopic  or  transesophageal  echocardiographic guidance until it passes the aortic valve and sits in the LV cavity (Figure 6-6). Th e pump draws blood continuously from the LV through the distal port and ejects it into the ascending aorta through the proximal port of the device. Depending on the  type  of  system,  the  pump  can  generate cardiac outputs of up to 5 L/min. Placement of the Impella device is contraindicated in the presence of a prosthetic aortic  valve,  severe  aortic  stenosis  or  aortic  regurgitation,  or peripheral  vascular  disease.  Relative  contraindications  to insertion of the Impella system include thoracoabdominal or abdominal aortic aneurysms or an aortic dissection. In such cases the axillary artery can serve as the insertion site of the

pump. Possible complications of device use include stroke, aortic valve injury, cardiac tamponade, vascular injury with limb  ischemia,  and  infection.  Because  of  the  centrifugal nature of the pump, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia typically develop.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e TandemHeart system is a percutaneous transseptal le ft atrial-to-femoral arterial circulatory device. Th e system consists  of  an  extracorporeal  centrifugal  continuousfl ow  pump and in fl ow and out fl ow cannulae. Th e  in fl ow cannula is percutaneously placed in the femoral vein, advanced to the right atrium, and then positioned transseptally into the le ft atrium. Th e  out fl ow  cannula  is  placed  in  the  femoral  artery  (Figure 6-7).  Oxygenated  blood  is  drained  from  the  le ft atrium  via the in fl ow cannula and ejected retrograde into the abdominal aorta via the out fl ow cannula in the femoral artery. Th is system can generate cardiac outputs similar to those produced by the Impella system. However, optimal functioning of the TandemHeart depends on good right ventricular function. In situations of acute right-sided heart failure, the system can be con fi gured as  a  right-sided  V AD,  pumping  blood  from  the  right-sided atrium into the pulmonary artery. Unique complications of use of this device include paradoxical emboli, a right-to-le ft intracardiac  shunt  manifested  as  hypoxemia,  and  coronary  sinus or right atrial injury with subsequent cardiac tamponade. Th e most devastating complication is in fl ow cannula dislodgement

Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite advances in therapy, the number of heart failure deaths continues  to  increase  steadily  in  the  United  States.  Mortality during the fi rst 4 years a ft er the diagnosis of heart failure approaches  40%.  Certain  factors  have  been  associated  with a poor prognosis and include increased blood urea nitrogen and  creatinine  levels,  hyponatremia,  hypokalemia,  severely depressed ejection fraction, high levels of  endogenous BNP , very limited exercise tolerance, and the presence of multifocal premature ventricular  contractions.  In  heart  failure  patients the prognosis depends on the underlying heart disease and on the presence or absence of a speci fi c precipitating factor. If a correctable cause of heart failure can be e ff ectively eliminated, prognosis improves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation and Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of heart failure has been described as the single most important risk  factor  for  predicting  perioperative  cardiac morbidity and mortality. In the preoperative period, all precipitating  factors  for  heart  failure  should  be  sought  and aggressively treated before proceeding with elective surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients treated for heart failure are usually taking several medications that may a ff ect anesthetic management. It is generally accepted that diuretics may be discontinued on the day of  surgery.  Maintaining β -blocker therapy is essential, since many studies have shown that β -blockers reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality. Due to inhibition of the RAAS, ACE inhibitors may put patients at increased risk of intraoperative hypotension. Th is  hypotension can be treated with a sympathomimetic drug such as ephedrine, an α -agonist such as  phenylephrine,  or  vasopressin  or  one  of  its  analogues.  If ACE inhibitors are being used to prevent ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients or kidney dysfunction in diabetic patients, then stopping the medication for 1 day will not signi fi cantly  alter  these  e ff ects.  However,  if  ACE  inhibitors are  being  used  to  treat  hypertension,  discontinuing  therapy the day before or the day of surgery may result in signi fi cant hypertension.  Angiotensin  receptor  blockers  produce  profound  RAAS blockade and should be discontinued the day before  surgery.  Digoxin  therapy  can  be  continued  until  the day of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Results of recent electrolyte, renal function, and liver function  tests  and  the  most  recent  ECG  and  echocardiogram should be reviewed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All types of general anesthetics have been successfully used in patients with heart failure. However, drug dosages may need to be adjusted. Opioids seem to have a particularly bene fi cial e ff ect in heart failure patients because of their e ff ect on the δ receptor, which inhibits adrenergic activation. Positive pressure ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure may be bene fi cial in decreasing pulmonary congestion and improving arterial oxygenation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  is  based  on  the  complexity  of  the  operation. Intraarterial pressure monitoring is justi fi ed when major surgery is required in a patient with heart failure. Monitoring of ventricular fi lling and fl uid status is a more challenging task. Fluid overload during the perioperative period may contribute to the development or worsening of heart failure. Intraoperative use of a pulmonary artery catheter may help in evaluation of  optimal fl uid loading, but in patients with diastolic heart failure and poor ventricular compliance, accurate assessment of LV end-diastolic volume may be quite di ffi cult. Transesophageal echocardiography may be a better alternative, allowing monitoring of not only ventricular fi lling but also ventricular wall motion and valvular function. However, transesophageal echocardiography requires trained personnel to perform the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia is acceptable for suitable operations in heart failure patients. In fact, the modest decrease in systemic vascular  resistance  secondary  to  sympathetic  blockade  may increase  cardiac  output.  However,  the  decrease  in  systemic vascular resistance produced by epidural or spinal anesthesia is not always predictable or easy to control. Th e pros and cons of regional anesthesia must be carefully weighed in heart failure patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Special consideration must be given to patients who have undergone  cardiac  transplantation  and  now  require  other surgeries. Th ese patients are receiving long-term immunosuppressive therapy and are at high risk of infection. Strict aseptic technique  is  necessary  when  performing  any  invasive  procedure such as central line placement or neuraxial blockade. Th e transplanted heart is denervated. Th erefore, an increase in heart rate can be achieved only by administering direct-acting β -adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol and epinephrine. An increase in heart rate will not occur with administration of atropine or pancuronium. A blunted response to α -adrenergic agonists may also be observed. Th e transplanted heart increases cardiac output by increasing stroke volume. Th erefore, these patients are preload dependent and require adequate intravascular volume. However, diastolic dysfunction can be a result of  chronic  gra ft rejection;  therefore,  intraoperative  volume administration decisions must be made with the recognition that adequate preload is a requirement for optimal function of  the  transplanted  heart  but  excessive fl uid  administration incurs the risk of pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who have evidence of acute heart failure during surgery  should  be  transferred  to  an  intensive  care  unit  so  that invasive monitoring can be continued as long as needed. Pain should be aggressively treated, since its presence and hemodynamic consequences may worsen heart failure. Patients' usual medications should be restarted as soon as possible.

CARDIOMYOPATHIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  de fi nition  of cardiomyopathies used  by  the  AHA  expert consensus panel in its 2006 document entitled "Contemporary De fi nition and Classi fi cation of the Cardiomyopathies" reads as follows:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. Cardiomyopathies either are con fi ned to the heart or are part of generalized systemic disorders, o ft en leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According to the AHA classi fi cation, cardiomyopathies are divided  into  two  major  groups:  primary  cardiomyopathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and secondary cardiomyopathies. Primary cardiomyopathies are  those  exclusively  (or  predominantly)  con fi ned  to  heart muscle. Primary cardiomyopathies can be genetic, acquired, or of mixed origin. Secondary cardiomyopathies demonstrate pathophysiologic involvement of the heart in the context of a multiorgan disorder. Tables 6-4 and 6-5 list the most common cardiomyopathies. It is important to emphasize that the previously used terms ischemic cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and obliterative  cardiomyopathy no  longer  appear in  the  new  classi fi cation. Th e  following  sections  address the cardiomyopathies  most  o ft en  seen  by  an  anesthesiologist: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, peripartum  cardiomyopathy,  and  secondary  cardiomyopathies with restrictive physiology.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  (HCM)  is  a  complex  cardiac disease  with  unique  pathophysiologic  characteristics  and  a great  diversity  of  morphologic,  functional,  and  clinical  features. Th e disease can a ff ect patients of all ages and has a prevalence in the general population approaching 1 in 500. It is the most common genetic cardiovascular disease and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. Th e disease is characterized by LV hypertrophy in the absence of  any  other  cardiac  disease  capable  of  inducing  ventricular hypertrophy, such as hypertension or aortic stenosis. Th e most common form of HCM presents as hypertrophy of the septum and anterolateral free wall. Histologic features of this disease include  hypertrophied  myocardial  cells  and  areas  of  patchy myocardial scarring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pathophysiology  of  HCM  is  related  to  the  following features:  myocardial  hypertrophy,  dynamic  LV  out fl ow  tract (LVOT) obstruction, systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve causing mitral regurgitation, diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, and dysrhythmias. During systole, contraction  of  the  hypertrophied  septum  accelerates  blood fl ow through the narrow LVOT, which creates a Venturi e ff ect on the anterior lea fl et of the mitral valve and induces systolic anterior

movement of the anterior mitral valve lea fl et. Th e presence of this systolic anterior movement accentuates the dynamic LVOT obstruction and causes signi fi cant mitral regurgitation (Figure 6-8). LVOT obstruction can be present at rest or can be induced by Valsalva's maneuver. Situations that worsen LVOT obstruction are listed in Table 6-6. With HCM, diastolic dysfunction is seen more o ft en than LVOT obstruction. Th e hypertrophied myocardium has a prolonged relaxation time and a decreased compliance.  Myocardial  ischemia  is  present  in  patients  with HCM, whether or not they have coronary artery disease. Myocardial ischemia is caused by several factors, including abnormal coronary arteries, a mismatch between ventricular mass and coronary artery size, increased LVEDP that compromises coronary perfusion, decreased diastolic fi lling time, increased oxygen consumption caused by hypertrophy, and the presence of a metabolic derangement in the use of oxygen at the cellular level. Dysrhythmias in patients with HCM result from the disorganized  cellular  architecture,  myocardial  scarring,  and expanded  interstitial  matrix.  Dysrhythmias  are  the  cause  of sudden death in young adults with this cardiomyopathy.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  course  of  HCM  varies  widely.  Most  patients remain  asymptomatic  throughout  life.  Some,  however,  have symptoms of severe heart failure and others die suddenly. Th e principal  symptoms of HCM are angina pectoris, fatigue or syncope (which may represent aborted sudden death), tachydysrhythmias, and heart failure. Interestingly, lying down o ft en

relieves the angina pectoris of HCM. Presumably, the change in LV size that accompanies this positional change decreases LV out fl ow obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac physical examination may reveal a double apical impulse, gallop rhythm, and cardiac murmurs and thrills. Th e murmurs can result  from  LV  out fl ow obstruction  or  mitral regurgitation and can be confused with aortic or mitral valve disease. Th e intensity of these murmurs can change markedly with  certain  maneuvers.  For  example,  Valsalva's  maneuver, which  increases  LV  out fl ow  obstruction,  will  enhance  the systolic murmur along the le ft sternal border. Th e murmur of mitral regurgitation also intensi fi es with Valsalva's maneuver. Nitroglycerin and standing (versus lying down) also increase the loudness of these murmurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sudden  death  is  a  recognized  complication  of  HCM. Th e severity of ventricular hypertrophy is directly related to the risk of sudden death. Young individuals with massive hypertrophy, even if they have few or no symptoms, deserve consideration for an intervention to prevent sudden death. Sudden death is especially likely to occur in patients between the ages of 10 and 30 years. For this reason, there is general agreement that young patients with HCM should not participate in competitive sports. Patients with mild hypertrophy are at low risk of sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ECG typically shows signs of LV hypertrophy. In asymptomatic  patients,  unexplained  LV  hypertrophy  may  be  the only sign of the disease. Th e 12-lead ECG shows abnormalities in 75% to 90% of patients with HCM. Th ese abnormalities include high QRS voltage, ST-segment and T-wave alterations, abnormal  Q  waves  resembling  those  seen  with  myocardial infarction, and le ft atrial enlargement. Th e diagnosis of HCM should also be considered in any young patient whose ECG fi ndings  are  consistent  with  previous  myocardial  infarction, because not all patients with HCM have evidence of LV hypertrophy on their ECGs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  can  demonstrate  the  presence  of  myocardial  hypertrophy.  Ejection  fraction  is  usually  more  than 80%, which re fl ects the hypercontractile condition of the heart. Echocardiography can also assess the mitral valve apparatus and detect the presence of systolic anterior movement. Color fl ow Doppler imaging can reveal the presence of LVOT obstruction by demonstrating turbulent fl ow as well as mitral regurgitation. Pressure gradients across the LVOT can be measured. Echocardiography is also useful in evaluating diastolic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac catheterization allows direct  measurement  of the increased LVEDP and the pressure gradient between the le ft ventricle  and  the  aorta.  Provocative  maneuvers  may  be required  to  evoke  evidence  of  LVOT  obstruction.  Ventriculography characteristically shows cavity obliteration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e de fi nitive diagnosis of HCM is made by endomyocardial biopsy and DNA analysis, but these diagnostic modalities are usually reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis cannot be otherwise established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diverse  clinical  and  genetic  features  of  HCM  make  it impossible to de fi ne precise guidelines for management (  Figure 6-9). However, it is recognized that some patients are at high risk of sudden death and must be treated aggressively.

is the primary means of relieving the signs and symptoms of HCM. Surgery to remove the area of hypertrophy causing outfl ow tract obstruction is considered in the 5% of patients who have both marked out fl ow obstruction and severe symptoms unresponsive to medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers  and  calcium  channel  blockers  have  been  used extensively to treat HCM. Th e bene fi cial e ff ects of β -blockers on dyspnea, angina pectoris, and exercise tolerance are likely due to the resulting decrease in heart rate with consequent prolongation of diastole and a lengthening of the time for passive ventricular fi lling. β -Blockers  can  lessen  myocardial  oxygen requirements and decrease the dynamic out fl ow tract obstruction during exercise by blunting sympathetic nervous system activity. Similarly, calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil and diltiazem, have bene fi cial e ff ects on the symptoms of HCM because they improve ventricular fi lling and decrease myocardial  ischemia.  Patients  who  develop  congestive  heart  failure despite treatment with β -blockers or calcium channel blockers may show improvement with the addition of a diuretic. However, because of the presence of diastolic dysfunction and the requirement for relatively high ventricular fi lling pressures to achieve adequate cardiac output, diuretic administration must be done very cautiously. Patients at high risk of sudden death may require amiodarone therapy or placement of an ICD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atrial fi brillation o ft en develops in patients with HCM and is associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. Amiodarone is the most e ff ective antidysrhythmic drug for prevention of paroxysms of atrial fi brillation in these patients. β -Blockers and calcium channel blockers can control the heart rate. Long-term anticoagulation is indicated in those with recurrent or chronic atrial fi brillation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e small subgroup of patients with HCM who have both large out fl ow tract gradients ( ≥ 50 mm Hg) and severe symptoms of congestive heart failure despite medical therapy are candidates for surgery. Th ere are several surgical strategies. A pacemaker can be placed in an attempt to desynchronize the LV during contraction and thereby decrease out fl ow obstruction.  Surgical  reduction  of  the  out fl ow  gradient  is  usually achieved by removing a small amount of cardiac muscle from the  ventricular  septum  (septal  myomectomy). Surgery abolishes or greatly reduces the LVOT gradient in most patients. Intraventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressures are markedly reduced, and these changes favorably in fl uence LV fi lling and myocardial oxygen requirements. Similar results can be obtained by percutaneous cardiac catheterization  and  selective alcohol injection into the septal perforator arteries. Th is leads to ischemic injury followed by necrosis of the interventricular septum, which results in relief of the LVOT obstruction. If patients remain symptomatic despite various therapies, a prosthetic mitral valve can be inserted in an attempt to counteract the systolic anterior motion of the mitral lea fl et.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e overall annual mortality of patients with HCM is approximately  1%.  However,  the  subset  of  patients  at  high  risk  of sudden death (family  history  of  sudden  death  or  history  of malignant ventricular dysrhythmias) have a mortality rate of 5% per year. Only about one fourth of patients diagnosed with HCM will develop signs of LVOT obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with HCM is directed toward minimizing LVOT obstruction. Any drug or event that  decreases  myocardial  contractility  or  increases  preload  or  reduces  a ft erload  will improve LVOT  obstruction. Conversely, sympathetic stimulation, hypovolemia, and vasodilation worsen LVOT  obstruction  (see  Table  6-6). Intraoperatively,  patients  with  HCM  may  develop  severe hypotension, myocardial ischemia, acute heart failure, and supraventricular  or  ventricular  tachydysrhythmias.  Previously  unrecognized  HCM  may  become  manifest  intraoperatively  as  unexplained  hypotension  or  development  of  a systolic  murmur  in  association  with  acute  hemorrhage  or drug-induced vasodilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation and Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the prevalence of HCM in the general population, patients with this disorder will be seen in the operating room with regularity. Patients already diagnosed with this disease should undergo an updated cardiac evaluation before elective surgery. Such evaluation should include a 12-lead ECG and  an  echocardiogram.  Patients  taking β -blockers  or  calcium  channel  blockers  should  continue  these  medications throughout  the  perioperative  period.  For  patients  with  an ICD, the unit should be turned o ff immediately before surgery, an external de fi brillator should be readily available in the operating room, and the device should be reactivated in the recovery room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A more challenging task is detecting patients with HCM in whom the diagnosis has not yet been made. Th ese patients are o ft en young and appear healthy. Every patient should be asked preoperatively about any possible cardiac symptoms or a family history of cardiac disease or sudden death. Th e presence of a systolic murmur should raise suspicion of a possible diagnosis of HCM. If the ECG shows abnormalities, cardiologic evaluation is prudent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  with  HCM,  preoperative  administration  of medication to allay anxiety and its associated activation of the sympathetic nervous system may be advisable. Expansion of intravascular volume during the preoperative period may also be useful in preventing LVOT obstruction and minimizing the adverse e ff ects of positive pressure ventilation on the central blood volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional or general anesthesia can be selected for patients with HCM as long as the anesthesiologist is aware of the main pathophysiologic mechanisms that trigger LVOT

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
obstruction and develops an anesthetic plan tailored to those speci fi c needs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia with an intravenous drug is acceptable,  but  the  importance  of  avoiding  sudden  decreases  in systemic  vascular  resistance  and  increases  in  heart  rate  and contractility must be kept in mind. A modest degree of direct myocardial depression is acceptable. Administration of a volatile anesthetic or β -adrenergic antagonist before direct laryngoscopy can blunt the sympathetic response typically evoked by tracheal intubation. Positive pressure ventilation can significantly decrease preload and predispose a hypovolemic patient to  dynamic  LVOT  obstruction.  To  help  avoid  this,  smaller tidal volumes and higher respiratory rates should be used and positive  end-expiratory pressure should be avoided. Preload reduction  and  severe  hypotension  due  to  LVOT  obstruction  can  also  be  encountered  when  abdominal  insu ffl ation is  performed  for  laparoscopic  surgery. Th e  surgeon  should be advised about this possibility, and the abdomen should be insu ffl ated slowly and at pressures not exceeding 15 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants that have only minimal e ff ects on the systemic circulation should be used for skeletal muscle relaxation in HCM patients. Th e increased heart rate that may accompany administration of pancuronium and the histamine release associated with other neuromuscular blockers should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia should be maintained with drugs that produce mild  depression  of  myocardial  contractility  and  have  minimal e ff ects on preload and a ft erload. A volatile anesthetic in a moderate dose is o ft en used for this purpose.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive monitoring of blood pressure may be helpful. Transesophageal echocardiography during surgery and anesthesia is particularly useful in patients with HCM because of the unique pathophysiology of this disorder. Neither central venous pressure  monitoring  nor  pulmonary  artery  pressure  monitoring can diagnose LVOT obstruction or systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve lea fl et, nor do these monitoring techniques give an accurate assessment of LV fi lling in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension that occurs in response to a decrease in preload or a ft erload should be treated with an α -adrenergic agonist such as phenylephrine. Drugs with β -adrenergic agonist activity,  such  as  ephedrine,  dopamine,  and  dobutamine,  are contraindicated because the drug-induced increase in myocardial contractility and heart rate increases LVOT obstruction. Prompt replacement of blood loss and titration of intravenous fl uids is  important for maintaining preload and blood pressure.  However,  because  of  diastolic  dysfunction,  aggressive fl uid replacement may result in pulmonary edema. Vasodilators should not be used to lower blood pressure because the decrease in systemic vascular resistance will accentuate LVOT obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance  of  normal  sinus  rhythm  is  very  important, because adequate le ft ventricular fi lling  is  dependent on le ft atrial contraction. Patients who develop intraoperative supraventricular  tachydysrhythmias  should  undergo  immediate pharmacologic  or  electrical  cardioversion.  A  cardioverterde fi brillator must be readily available in the operating room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers  such  as  metoprolol  and  esmolol  are  indicated  to slow persistently elevated heart rates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parturient Patients. Pregnancy is usually well tolerated in patients with HCM despite the pregnancy-induced decrease in systemic vascular resistance and the risk of impaired venous return due to aortocaval compression. Parturient women with HCM may present major anesthetic challenges, because events such  as  labor  pain,  which  produces  catecholamine  release, and bearing down (Valsalva's maneuver) may increase LVOT obstruction. Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  regional  anesthesia increases complication rates in parturient patients with HCM undergoing  vaginal  delivery.  Epidural  anesthesia  has  been successfully  administered  to  these  patients.  Maintenance  of euvolemia or slight hypervolemia is helpful. Should hypotension unresponsive to fl uid administration occur as a result of regional anesthesia, phenylephrine should be used to increase a ft erload. Oxytocin must be administered carefully because of its vasodilating properties and compensatory tachycardia, and because of the abrupt in fl ow of large amounts of blood into the central circulation as a consequence of uterine contraction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary edema has been observed in parturient women with HCM a ft er delivery, a fi nding that emphasizes the delicate balance in fl uid requirements of these patients. Treatment of  pulmonary  edema  in  the  presence  of  HCM  may  include phenylephrine if hypotension is present and esmolol to slow the heart rate, prolong diastolic fi lling time, and decrease myocardial contractility, all of which will decrease LVOT obstruction. Diuretics, digoxin, and nitrates cannot be  used to treat pulmonary edema in this setting. Th ey worsen the situation by provoking further LVOT obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  HCM  must  be  vigilantly  monitored  in  the recovery room or intensive care unit in the immediately postoperative period. All factors that stimulate sympathetic activity, such as pain, shivering, anxiety, hypoxia, and hypercarbia, should be eliminated. As in the operating room, maintenance of euvolemia and prompt treatment of hypotension are crucial.

Dilated Cardiomyopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dilated cardiomyopathy is a primary myocardial disease characterized by LV or biventricular dilation, systolic dysfunction, and normal ventricular wall thickness. Th e etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy is unknown, but it may be genetic or associated with infection such as coxsackievirus B infection. Th ere is  a  familial  transmission  pattern  in  approximately  30%  of cases, usually autosomal dominant. Many types of secondary cardiomyopathies have the features of dilated cardiomyopathy. Th ese  include  the  cardiomyopathies  associated  with  alcohol abuse,  cocaine  abuse,  the  peripartum  state,  pheochromocytoma,  infectious  diseases  (human  immunode fi ciency  virus infection),  uncontrolled  tachycardia,  Duchenne's  muscular dystrophy, thyroid disease, chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation therapy,  hypertension,  coronary  artery  disease,  and  valvular

heart disease. African American men have an increased risk of developing dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type of cardiomyopathy, the third most common cause of heart failure, and the most common indication for cardiac transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initial manifestation of dilated cardiomyopathy is usually heart failure. Chest pain on exertion that mimics angina pectoris occurs in some patients. Ventricular dilation may be so marked that functional mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation occurs. Supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias, conduction system abnormalities, and sudden death are common. Systemic embolization is also common as a result of the formation of mural thrombi in dilated and hypokinetic cardiac chambers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ECG  o ft en  shows  ST-segment  and  T-wave  abnormalities and le ft bundle branch block. Dysrhythmias are common and include ventricular premature beats and atrial fi brillation. Chest radiography may show enlargement of all four cardiac chambers, but LV dilation is the principal morphologic feature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  typically  reveals  dilation  of  all  four chambers  but  especially  the  le ft ventricle  as  well  as  global hypokinesis. Regional wall motion abnormalities may be seen in  dilated  cardiomyopathy and do not necessarily imply the presence of coronary disease. Mural thrombi can be detected, and valvular regurgitation secondary to annular dilation is a common fi nding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory testing should be performed to eliminate other causes of cardiac dilation such as hyperthyroidism. Th e fi ndings of coronary angiography are usually normal in patients with  dilated  cardiomyopathy.  Right-sided  heart  catheterization reveals a high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, high systemic vascular resistance, and a low cardiac output. Endomyocardial biopsy is not recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  dilated  cardiomyopathy  includes  general  supportive measures such as adequate rest, weight control, consumption of a low-sodium diet, fl uid  restriction,  abstinence from tobacco and alcohol, and decreased physical activity during periods of cardiac decompensation. Cardiac rehabilitation, if possible, will improve general conditioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  medical  management  of  dilated  cardiomyopathy  is similar  to  the  medical  management  of  chronic  heart  failure. Patients  with  dilated  cardiomyopathy  are  at  risk  of  systemic and pulmonary embolization because blood stasis in the hypocontractile cardiac chambers leads to activation of the coagulation cascade. Th e risk of cardiac embolization is greatest in patients with severe LV dysfunction, atrial fi brillation, a history of thromboembolism, or echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac  thrombus.  Anticoagulation  with  warfarin  or  dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is o ft en instituted in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and symptomatic heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asymptomatic,  nonsustained  ventricular  tachycardia  is common in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, suppression of this dysrhythmia with drug therapy does not improve survival. Placement of an ICD can decrease the risk of sudden death in patients with heart failure who have survived a previous cardiac arrest (see Table 6-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dilated  cardiomyopathy  remains  the  principal  indication for  cardiac  transplantation  in  adults  and  children.  Patients most likely to bene fi t  from  a  heart  transplant  are  those  formerly vigorous persons younger than 60 years of age who have intractable symptoms of heart failure despite optimal medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic patients with dilated cardiomyopathy referred to tertiary  care  medical  centers  have  a  5-year  mortality  rate  of 50%. If  the  cardiomyopathy involves both the le ft and  right ventricles, the prognosis is even worse. Hemodynamic abnormalities that predict a poor prognosis include an ejection fraction of less than 25%, a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of more than 20 mm Hg, a cardiac index of less than 2.5 L/ min/m 2 , systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, and increased  central  venous  pressure.  Alcoholic  cardiomyopathy is largely reversible if complete abstinence from alcohol is maintained.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since dilated cardiomyopathy is a cause of heart failure, the anesthetic management of these patients is the same as that described in the heart failure section of this chapter.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia may be an alternative to general anesthesia in selected patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the need for anticoagulant therapy may limit this option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripartum Cardiomyopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a rare, dilated form of cardiomyopathy of unknown cause that arises during the peripartum period, that is, from the third trimester of pregnancy until 5 months a ft er delivery. It occurs in women with no history of heart disease. Th e estimated incidence of peripartum cardiomyopathy is 1 in 3000 to 1 in 4000 live births. Risk factors include obesity, multiparity, advanced maternal age (>30 years), multifetal pregnancy, preeclampsia, and African American ethnicity. Possible causes of peripartum cardiomyopathy include viral myocarditis, an abnormal immune response to pregnancy, and maladaptive responses to the hemodynamic stresses of pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  signs  and  symptoms of peripartum cardiomyopathy are those of heart failure: dyspnea, fatigue, and peripheral edema. However, these signs and symptoms are common in the fi nal trimester of pregnancy, and there are no speci fi c criteria for di ff erentiating  subtle  symptoms  of  heart  failure  from  normal late pregnancy. Clinical conditions that may mimic heart

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
failure, such as amniotic fl uid or pulmonary embolism, should be  excluded  when  considering  the  diagnosis  of  peripartum cardiomyopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy is based on the onset of unexplained LV dysfunction and echocardiographic documentation of a new fi nding of dilated cardiac chambers with LV systolic dysfunction during the period surrounding parturition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goal  of  treatment  is  to  alleviate  the  symptoms  of  heart failure. Diuretics, vasodilators, and digoxin can be used. ACE inhibitors  are  teratogenic  but  can  be  useful  following  delivery.  During  pregnancy,  vasodilation  is  accomplished  with hydralazine  and  nitrates.  Intravenous  immunoglobulin  may have  a  bene fi cial  e ff ect. Th romboembolic  complications  are not uncommon, and anticoagulation is o ft en recommended. Heart transplantation may be considered in patients who do not improve over time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mortality rate of peripartum cardiomyopathy ranges from 25% to 50%, with most deaths occurring within 3 months of delivery. Death is usually a result of progression of congestive heart  failure  or  sudden  death  associated  with  cardiac  dysrhythmias or thromboembolic events. Th e prognosis appears to depend on the degree of normalization of LV size and function within 6 months of delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  management  of  anesthesia  in  parturients  with  peripartum cardiomyopathy requires assessment of cardiac status and careful planning of the analgesia and/or anesthesia required for  delivery.  Regional  anesthesia  may  provide  a  desirable decrease in a ft erload.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary Cardiomyopathies with Restrictive Physiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary  cardiomyopathies  with  restrictive  physiology  are due to systemic diseases that  produce  myocardial  in fi ltration and severe diastolic dysfunction. Th e  most common of these cardiomyopathies  is  caused  by  amyloidosis.  Other  systemic diseases such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, and carcinoid may produce a similar type of cardiomyopathy. Th e diagnosis should be considered in patients who have heart failure but no evidence of cardiomegaly or systolic dysfunction. Th e condition results from increased sti ff ness of the myocardium caused by the deposition of abnormal substances. Although there is impaired diastolic function and reduced ventricular compliance, systolic function is usually normal. Cardiomyopathies with restrictive physiology must be di ff erentiated from constrictive pericarditis, which has a similar physiology. A clinical history of pericarditis makes the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis more likely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  cardiomyopathies  with  restrictive  physiology  can a ff ect both ventricles, symptoms and signs of le ft and/or right ventricular failure may be present. In advanced stages of this cardiomyopathy, all the signs and symptoms of heart failure can be present, but there is no cardiomegaly. Amyloid cardiomyopathy o ft en presents with thromboembolic complications. Atrial fi brillation is also common. Cardiac conduction disturbances are particularly common in amyloidosis and sarcoidosis.  Over  time,  this  involvement  of  the  conduction  system can lead to heart block or ventricular dysrhythmias, resulting in sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ECG  may  demonstrate  conduction  abnormalities. Th e chest  radiograph  may  show  signs  of  pulmonary  congestion and/or pleural e ff usion, but cardiomegaly is absent. Laboratory tests should be employed as needed to diagnose the systemic disease responsible for the cardiac in fi ltration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  will  demonstrate  signi fi cant  diastolic dysfunction  and  normal  systolic  function. Th e atria are enlarged because of the high atrial pressures, but the ventricles are normal in size. In cardiac amyloidosis, the ventricular mass appears speckled, a characteristic sign of amyloid deposition. Various echocardiographic criteria can di ff erentiate secondary cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology from constrictive pericarditis. Endomyocardial biopsy can elucidate the cause of the in fi ltrative cardiomyopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic  treatment  is  similar  to  that  for  diastolic  heart failure. It includes administration of diuretics to treat pulmonary and systemic congestion. Excessive diuresis may decrease ventricular fi lling pressures and cardiac output and result in hypotension and hypoperfusion. Digoxin must be used with great  caution,  because  it  is  potentially  dysrhythmogenic  in patients with amyloidosis. Th e development of atrial fi brillation with loss of the atrial contribution to ventricular fi lling may substantially  worsen  diastolic  dysfunction,  and  a  rapid ventricular response may further compromise cardiac output. Maintenance of normal sinus rhythm is extremely important. Because  stroke  volume  tends  to  be fi xed  in  the  presence  of cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology, the onset of bradycardia may precipitate acute heart failure. Signi fi cant bradycardia  or  severe  conduction  system  disease  may  require implantation  of  a  cardiac  pacemaker.  With  cardiac  sarcoidosis,  malignant  ventricular  dysrhythmias  are  common  and may  necessitate  insertion  of  an  ICD.  Anticoagulation  may be needed in patients with atrial fi brillation and/or low cardiac output. Cardiac transplantation is not a treatment option because myocardial in fi ltration will recur in the transplanted heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  prognosis of secondary cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology is very poor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy follows the same principles as that for patients with cardiac tamponade (see Chapter 7). Because stroke volume is relatively fi xed, it is important to maintain sinus rhythm and to avoid any signi fi cant decrease in the heart rate. Maintenance of venous return and intravascular fl uid volume is also necessary to maintain an acceptable cardiac output. Anticoagulant therapy will negatively in fl uence the decision to select regional anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cor Pulmonale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cor pulmonale is right ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy and/or dilation) that may progress to right-sided heart failure. Diseases that induce pulmonary hypertension such as COPD, restrictive lung disease, and respiratory insu ffi ciency of central origin (obesity-hypoventilation syndrome) cause cor pulmonale. It can also result from idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension, that is, the pulmonary hypertension that occurs in the absence of le ft -sided heart disease, myocardial disease, congenital  heart  disease,  or  any  other  clinically  signi fi cant respiratory,  connective  tissue,  or  chronic  thromboembolic disease. Th e most common cause of cor pulmonale is COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cor  pulmonale  usually  occurs  in  persons  older  than  50 years of age because of its association with COPD. Men are a ff ected fi ve times more o ft en than women.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e main pathophysiologic determinant of cor pulmonale is pulmonary  hypertension.  By  various  mechanisms,  chronic lung disease induces an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance.  Chronic  alveolar  hypoxia  (Pa o 2 <55  mm  Hg)  is  the most  important  factor  in  this  process.  Acute  hypoxia,  such as seen in exacerbations of COPD or during sleep in patients with  obesity-hypoventilation  syndrome,  causes  pulmonary vasoconstriction.  Long-standing  chronic  hypoxia  promotes pulmonary vasculature remodeling and an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance. Even mild hypoxemia may result in vascular remodeling, so it appears that other factors are also involved in the development of cor pulmonale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  of  pulmonary  hypertension,  the  right  ventricle has an increased workload, and right ventricular hypertrophy develops. Over time, right ventricular dysfunction occurs, and eventually right ventricular failure is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical manifestations of cor pulmonale may be obscured by the  co-existing  lung  disease.  Clinical  signs  occur  late  in  the course of the disease, and the most prominent is peripheral edema.  As  right  ventricular  function  deteriorates,  dyspnea increases and e ff ort-related syncope can occur. Accentuation of the pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a diastolic  murmur  due  to  incompetence  of  the  pulmonic  valve, and  a  systolic  murmur  due  to  tricuspid  regurgitation  connote severe pulmonary hypertension. Evidence of overt right ventricular failure consists of increased jugular venous pressure and hepatosplenomegaly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ECG may show signs of right atrial and right ventricular hypertrophy. Right atrial hypertrophy is suggested by peaked P  waves  in  leads  II,  III,  and  aVF  (P  pulmonale).  Right  axis deviation and a partial or complete right bundle branch block are o ft en seen with right ventricular hypertrophy. A normalappearing  ECG,  however,  does  not  exclude  the  presence  of pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiographic signs of cor pulmonale include an increase in the width of the right pulmonary artery and a decrease in pulmonary vascular markings in the lung periphery. On a lateralprojection chest radiograph, right ventricular enlargement is indicated by a decrease in the retrosternal space. However, this is a late sign.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transesophageal echocardiography  can  be  a  very  useful diagnostic tool. It can provide quantitative estimates of pulmonary artery pressure, assessment of the size and function of the right atrium and ventricle, and evaluation of the presence and severity of tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation. Transthoracic echocardiography is o ft en di ffi cult to perform in patients with COPD because the hyperin fl ated lungs impair transmission of the ultrasound waves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of cor pulmonale is geared at reducing the workload of the right ventricle by decreasing pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. If the pulmonary artery vasoconstriction has a reversible component, as is likely during an acute exacerbation of COPD, this goal can be achieved by returning the Pa o 2 , Pa co 2 , and arterial pH to normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen supplementation to maintain the Pa o 2 above 60 mm Hg (oxygen saturation of >90% by pulse oximetry) is useful in both the acute and long-term treatment of right-sided heart failure. Long-term oxygen therapy decreases the mortality of cor pulmonale and improves cognitive function and quality of life.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diuretics and digitalis may be used to treat right-sided heart failure  that  does  not  respond to correction of arterial blood gases. Diuretics must be administered very carefully, because diuretic-induced  metabolic  alkalosis,  which  encourages  carbon dioxide retention, may aggravate ventilatory insu ffi ciency by  depressing  the  e ff ectiveness  of  carbon  dioxide  as  a  stimulus to breathing. Diuresis can also increase blood viscosity and myocardial work. Digitalis can be used for treatment of atrial fi brillation, but it must be administered very cautiously because the risk of digitalis toxicity is increased in the presence of  hypoxemia,  acidosis,  and  electrolyte  imbalances.  Pulmonary vasodilators, such as sildena fi l and bosentan, have been shown to improve the symptoms of cor pulmonale and reduce right ventricular mass as well as right ventricular remodeling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  cor  pulmonale  is  progressive  despite  maximum medical  therapy,  transplantation  of  one  or  both  lungs  or  a heart-lung transplantation will provide dramatic relief of cardiorespiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  prognosis  of  patients  with  cor  pulmonale  is  dependent on  the  disease  responsible  for  initiating  pulmonary  hypertension.  Patients  with  COPD  in  whom  arterial  oxygenation can be maintained at near-normal levels and whose pulmonary hypertension is mild have a favorable prognosis. Prognosis is poor in patients with severe, irreversible pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  preparation  of  patients  with  cor  pulmonale resulting  from  chronic  lung  disease  is  directed  toward (1) eliminating and controlling acute and chronic pulmonary infection, (2) reversing bronchospasm, (3) improving clearance of airway secretions, (4) expanding collapsed or poorly ventilated alveoli, (5) maintaining hydration, and (6) correcting any electrolyte imbalances. Preoperative measurement of arterial blood gases will provide guidelines for perioperative management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of general anesthesia can be accomplished using any available method or drug. Adequate depth of anesthesia should be present before endotracheal intubation, because this stimulus can elicit re fl ex bronchospasm in lightly anesthetized patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia is typically maintained with a volatile anesthetic combined with other drugs. Volatile anesthetics are e ff ective bronchodilators.  Large  doses  of  opioids  should  be  avoided because they can contribute to prolonged postoperative ventilatory depression. Muscle relaxants associated with histamine release  should  also  be  avoided  because  of  the  adverse  e ff ect of  histamine  on  airway  resistance  and  pulmonary  vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Positive  pressure  ventilation  improves  oxygenation,  presumably  because  of  better  ventilation-perfusion  matching. Humidi fi cation of inhaled gases helps maintain hydration, liquefaction of secretions, and mucociliary function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative monitoring of patients with cor pulmonale is in fl uenced by the complexity of the surgery. An intraarterial catheter permits frequent determination of arterial blood gas concentrations  and  subsequent  adjustments  in  the  inspired concentration of oxygen. A central venous catheter or pulmonary artery catheter may be useful depending on the surgery. Trend values of right atrial pressure can provide some information about right ventricular function. Direct measurement of  pulmonary  artery  pressure  helps  determine  the  time  to treat pulmonary hypertension and the response to treatment. Transesophageal  echocardiography  is  an  alternative  method for  monitoring  right  ventricular  function  and fl uid  status. However, the need for trained personnel and expensive equipment prevents this monitoring modality from being universally available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthetic techniques can be used in appropriate situations in patients with cor pulmonale, but regional anesthesia is best avoided for operations that require high levels of sensory and motor block. Loss of function of the accessory muscles  of  respiration  may  be  very  deleterious  in  patients with  pulmonary  disease.  In  addition,  any  decrease  in  systemic vascular resistance in the presence of fi xed pulmonary hypertension can produce a very signi fi cant degree of systemic hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  respiratory  and  cardiovascular  status  of  a  patient with  cor  pulmonale  must  be  vigilantly  monitored  in  the postoperative period, and any factors that exacerbate pulmonary  hypertension,  such  as  hypoxia  and  hypercarbia, must be avoided. Oxygen therapy should be maintained as needed.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Heart failure is a complex pathophysiologic state in which the heart is unable to fi ll with or eject blood at a rate appropriate to tissue requirements. Heart failure is characterized by  speci fi c  symptoms (dyspnea and fatigue) and signs of circulatory congestion or hypoperfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In the United States 5.8 million people have heart failure, and this imposes a great fi nancial burden on the health care system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e principal pathophysiologic derangement in the development  and  progression  of  heart  failure  is  ventricular remodeling. Th e principal treatment goals in heart failure patients are avoiding or decreasing the degree of ventricular remodeling and promoting reverse remodeling. Th erapies proven to be of value in this regard include ACE inhibitors, β -blockers, aldosterone inhibitors, and CRT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e management of acute heart failure includes the use of low-dose loop diuretics in combination with vasodilators, positive inotropic drugs, exogenous BNP, and/or insertion of mechanical devices.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ HCM is  the  most  common  genetic  cardiac  disorder.  Its pathophysiology  is  related  to  the  development  of  LVOT obstruction  and  ventricular  dysrhythmias  that  can  cause sudden death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Factors  that  induce  LVOT  obstruction  in  HCM  include hypovolemia, tachycardia, an increase in myocardial contractility, and a decrease in a ft erload. Out fl ow tract obstruction  is  managed  by  maintaining  hydration,  increasing a ft erload  (phenylephrine),  and  decreasing  heart  rate  and myocardial contractility ( β -blockers and calcium channel blockers).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of cardiomyopathy and the second most common cause of heart failure. Th e treatment and anesthetic implications are similar to those for chronic heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cor pulmonale is right ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy and/or dilation) that may progress to right-sided heart failure. It is caused by diseases that promote development of pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  most important pathophysiologic determinant of the development  of  pulmonary  hypertension  and  cor  pulmonale  in  patients  with  chronic  lung  disease  is  alveolar hypoxia. Th e best available treatment to improve the prognosis in these patients is long-term oxygen therapy.
