fracture repair. Participants included previously ambulatory patients 50 years of age or older at 46 US and Canadian hospitals. Patients were randomized 1:1 to spinal or general anesthesia, stratified by sex, fracture type, and study site. Outcome assessors and investigators involved in the data analysis were masked to the treatment arm. Outcomes included survival at up to 365 days after randomization (primary); recovery of ambulation among 365-day survivors; and composite endpoints for death or new inability to ambulate and death or new nursing home residence at 365 days. Patients were included in the analysis as randomized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Results: 1,600 patients were enrolled between February 12, 2016, and February 18, 2021; 795 were assigned to spinal anesthesia, and 805 were assigned to general anesthesia. Among 1,599 patients who underwent surgery, vital status information at or beyond the final study interview (conducted at approximately 365 days after randomization) was available for 1,427 (89.2%). Survival did not differ by treatment arm; at 365 days after randomization, there were 98 deaths in patients assigned to spinal anesthesia versus 92 deaths in patients assigned to general anesthesia (hazard ratio: 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.44, P=0.59). Recovery of ambulation among patients who survived a year did not differ by type of anesthesia (adjusted odds ratio, spinal vs. general: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.14, P=0.31). Other outcomes did not differ by treatment arm.

Conclusions: Long-term outcomes were similar with spinal versus general anesthesia.

Summary Statement:

In a planned analysis of a randomized trial of general versus regional anesthesia for hip fracture surgery in older adults, there were no differences in mortality, recovery of ambulation, or other outcomes at one year.

INTRODUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal and general anesthesia are the most common options for individuals undergoing surgery on the lower extremities. 1  While spinal anesthesia has been theorized to improve survival after surgery through reductions in short-term complications, particularly among older adults, long-term differences in outcomes by anesthesia technique remain poorly characterized. 2,3

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each year, 1.5 million older adults worldwide undergo surgery to repair a fractured hip, 4 and most patients receive either spinal or general anesthesia. 5  While one randomized trial found differences in 1-year mortality according to anesthesia technique, 6  others have found no differences in survival beyond the immediate perioperative period. 7,8  Hip fractures are associated with marked decreases in long-term survival and functional independence, 9-11  but past trials have not evaluated recovery of ambulation or the need for new nursing home care after spinal versus general anesthesia. Recently, the REGAIN multicenter trial found similar rates of recovery of ambulation, survival, and return to pre-fracture residence at 60 days with either spinal or general anesthesia. 12  Outcomes related to long-term survival, recovery of ambulation, and need for new nursing home placement have not yet been reported.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We conducted a pre-planned analysis of long-term outcomes of a multicenter pragmatic randomized trial comparing spinal versus general anesthesia for hip fracture surgery. 12,13 This study aimed to examine one-year survival, recovery of ambulation over the first year

MATERIALS AND METHODS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Study design

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The REGAIN Trial was a randomized superiority trial conducted in 46 hospitals in the United States and Canada (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02507505, Principal Investigator Mark D. Neuman, registered July 24, 2015). The study design and primary outcome analyses have been described previously. 12,13  We worked with patients and stakeholders to select outcomes of importance to patients. 14  The trial protocol was published in advance of patient enrollment. 13  The Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Pennsylvania approved the protocol and was the IRB of record for 11 sites; approval at other sites was via local IRB review. 15

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Participants

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At each study hospital, staff reviewed emergency department registration and hospital admission lists, and surgical case schedules to identify adults aged 50 years or older who were scheduled to undergo surgical repair of a clinically or radiographically diagnosed femoral neck, intertrochanteric, or subtrochanteric hip fracture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Major exclusions were: the inability to walk approximately 10 feet (3m) or across a room without human assistance before fracture; the need for a concurrent procedure not amenable to spinal anesthesia; periprosthetic fracture; and contraindications to spinal anesthesia (coagulopathy; anticoagulant medications; 16,17  critical or severe aortic stenosis; infection at the injection site; or elevated intracranial pressure). Patients were also excluded if they had previously participated in the trial or were determined to be unsuitable for randomization by the surgeon or anesthesiologist. Written informed consent was obtained from the participant or, for individuals who could not provide consent, from their healthcare proxy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Randomization and masking

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consenting patients were assigned to receive spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia in a 1:1 ratio using permuted block randomization with variable block sizes. 18,19  Randomization was stratified by hospital, sex, and fracture location (femoral neck versus intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture) using a central online data management system. Site staff obtained the randomization assignment from the data management system web portal and communicated it to the treating anesthesia team immediately before the start of anesthesia care. When site personnel could not access the online system, the randomization assignment was communicated by telephone to site staff by the study principal investigator or a designated staff member. Participants, treating clinicians, and data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) members were not masked to treatment assignment. The principal investigator, co-investigators, clinical coordinating center staff, and statisticians remained masked to treatment assignment until the database was locked for analysis.

Outcomes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatments were delivered by clinical anesthesia staff at each site. For patients assigned to spinal anesthesia, providers were instructed to perform single-injection spinal anesthetics with sedation as needed for patient comfort. Conversion to general anesthesia was permitted based on clinical circumstances or patient request. For patients assigned to general anesthesia, providers were instructed to use an inhaled anesthetic agent for maintenance and an endotracheal tube, supraglottic airway, or other device for airway management. All other aspects of care, including pre-, intra-, and post-operative analgesic medications and use of peripheral nerve blocks for pain management were determined by the clinical team. Follow-up was performed by phone interviews with participants or proxy informants at approximately 60, 180, and 365 days after randomization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The primary outcome for this analysis was the number of days from randomization to death, censored at the time of the final study interview (conducted approximately 365 days after randomization) or post-randomization day 365, whichever came first. Survival status and date of death information were ascertained from site staff reports and via telephone interviews with participants or appropriate proxy informants conducted by central coordinating center staff who were masked to treatment assignment. Telephone interviews were recorded and randomly audited for quality control. For US patients whose vital status could not be otherwise ascertained, we searched the National Death Index through 2022 (the most recent year available). For subjects with partial date-of-death data (i.e., month and year only), the date of death was imputed as the 15th day of the month in which they died.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We evaluated three secondary outcomes: (1) recovery of ambulation as assessed at 60, 180, and 365 days among individuals surviving to day 365; (2) a composite of death or new inability to ambulate without human assistance at 1 year; and (3) a composite of death or residence in a nursing home or other institution at 1 year among individuals who were community-dwelling at the time of fracture. For composite endpoints, death was included to account for potential survivor bias. Ambulatory status and location of residence were ascertained via masked telephone interview as above. For the ambulatory status assessment, patients were queried regarding their ability to walk 10 feet (3m) or across a room independently or with a walker or cane but without the assistance of another person. As an exploratory outcome, we also report overall functional status at approximately 60, 180, and 365 days after randomization as collected via telephone interview using the 12-item World Health Organization Disability Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0, which assesses disability in six functional domains (cognition, mobility, self-care, social interaction, life activities, and community participation). 20  Adverse events were assessed at each follow-up interview.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Statistical analysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sample size planning for REGAIN was based on the overall study primary outcome, which was a composite of death or new inability to walk approximately 10 feet without human assistance at 60 days. We estimated that 1,600 participants would provide 80% power to detect a 0.78 relative risk for this outcome among patients assigned to spinal versus

general anesthesia at a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a 34.2% rate of this outcome in the general anesthesia arm. 21  We did not conduct separate power analyses for the long-term outcomes presented here. Our main analysis included all patients in the modified intention-to-treat population with available outcome data. The modified intentionto-treat population included all patients who underwent randomization and did not die before receiving treatment. Patients were included in the analysis according to their original treatment assignment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We compared survival time between treatment arms using Kaplan-Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazards regression model, adjusted for sex, fracture type, and country of enrollment. We assessed the proportional hazards assumption using failure-time graphs and statistical tests of zero slopes in the Schoenfeld residuals; additional models incorporating time-varying effects were considered when the proportional hazards assumption was not met. Recovery of ambulation over the first year after randomization was compared by group via logistic mixed effects regression model (generalized linear mixed model approach) using data from the 60-, 180-, and 365-day interviews. This model included all participants with at least one valid post-randomization ambulation assessment and was adjusted for sex, fracture type, country, and days since randomization at assessment. To account for withinsubject correlation, we included a random intercept term per individual with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix. For binary outcomes (death or new inability to ambulate; death or new transition to a nursing home residence), we used the Mantel-Haenszel test for differences in proportions, stratified by sex, fracture type, and country.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For our primary survival outcome, we considered the possibility of heterogeneity of treatment effects by exploring treatment-covariate interactions for six pre-specified patient characteristics (age (≥85 years versus <85 years), sex, country of enrollment, location of residence before fracture (nursing home versus community residence), reliance on assistive devices to ambulate before fracture, and fracture type. We conducted exploratory subgroup analyses for interactions with P values of 0.20 or lower using Cox models adjusted as above. Our survival analysis included all patients in the modified intention-to-treat population; to assess whether our findings may have been influenced by patterns of censoring before the end of the study, we compared characteristics of patients in each study arm who were censored prior to the final study interview due to withdrawal or loss to follow up. Additionally, we carried out a supplementary analysis via a Cox model that imputed censored failure times. 22  For censored subjects, failure times were imputed based on a model including patient age, sex, fracture type, country of enrollment, assigned arm, and comorbidities. Finally, to assess the potential impact of non-adherence to the assigned treatment on the study outcomes, we used a structural Cox model to estimate the perprotocol effect of spinal anesthesia on survival time with the assigned treatment as an instrumental variable. 23

Analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). All hypotheses were tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Data were reviewed at prespecified intervals by an independent DSMB. Analyses followed a pre-specified statistical analysis plan; this plan, plus all modifications made after initiation of analysis appear in a Supplement.

RESULTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between Feb 12, 2016, and Feb 18, 2021, we screened 22,022 patients (Appendix Figure 1). 12,915 patients were excluded based on eligibility criteria; 3,565 declined consent; 2,660 were not enrolled because of staff unavailability, and 1,282 were excluded for other reasons. Of 1,600 patients who underwent randomization, 795 were assigned to spinal anesthesia, and 805 were assigned to general anesthesia. One patient in the general anesthesia group died before receiving either treatment; this patient was not included in any study analyses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pre-randomization characteristics were similar across treatment arms (Table 1). Among 1,599 patients randomized, 527 (33%) were male, with mean age 78 years (± standard deviation 10.7). 1,377 (91%) were admitted from home or a retirement home (versus a nursing home, rehabilitation facility, or another acute care hospital) and 497 (32%) used an assistive device when ambulating more than 10 feet (3m) two weeks before fracture. As reported previously,  12  666 of 795 patients assigned to spinal anesthesia (84%) received spinal anesthesia only. Of the remaining patients in the spinal anesthesia arm, 119 (15%) received general anesthesia, with or without an initial attempt to place a spinal block. Eight patients (1%) withdrew before surgery and anesthesia type was not recorded. Of the 804 patients assigned to general anesthesia who were included in intention-to-treat analysis, 769 (96%) received general anesthesia and 28 (3%) received spinal anesthesia; 7 patients (0.9%) withdrew before surgery or did not have a recorded anesthesia type.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Among all patients, median follow up was 365 days (interquartile range 354, 365); there was no difference in the duration of follow-up between patients randomized to spinal versus general anesthesia. During the study period, 190 deaths occurred; 98 in the spinal anesthesia group and 92 in the general anesthesia group. Deaths were identified via US National Death Index search in 39 patients; for the remaining 151 patients, deaths were ascertained via telephone follow-up or site report. Vital status information at or beyond the final study interview (conducted at approximately 365 days) was available for 1,427 (89.2%) of the overall study population, including 714 of 795 (89.8%) and 713 of 804 (88.7%) patients allocated to spinal and general anesthesia, respectively (Appendix Table 1). Among these patients, 1-year mortality was 13.7% for patients in the spinal anesthesia arm and 12.9% for patients in the general anesthesia arm. Survival at up to 365 days after randomization did not differ by treatment arm (Figure 1; Table 2; hazard ratio (HR), spinal vs. general anesthesia: 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 1.44, P=0.59). Of 6 pre-specified interaction analyses, we observed a P-value for interaction of 0.2 or less for two patient characteristics: age less than 85 years versus 85 years or older and country of randomization. Adjusted hazards of death were not significantly different among these subgroups. In the model including patients 85 years or older, failure-time graphs and diagnostic tests did not verify the proportional hazards assumption; we subsequently confirmed the findings from this model by estimating the hazard ratio for death at 365 days in a Cox model that

incorporated a time-varying effect (Appendix Table 2). Diagnostic testing of other Cox models did not indicate violations of the proportional hazards assumption.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recovery of independence in ambulation over the first year after surgery did not differ among patients assigned to spinal anesthesia versus general anesthesia (adjusted odds ratio (OR), spinal vs. general: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.14, P=0.31, Appendix Table 3). At the 60day, 180-day, and 365-day interviews, death or new inability to walk occurred in 18.5% (132 of 712), 19.6% (136 of 694), and 24.1% (165 of 684) of patients assigned to receive spinal anesthesia and 18.0% (132 of 732), 18.7% (132 of 707), and 21.6% (146 of 676) of patients assigned to receive general anesthesia (Figure 2). The incidence of death or new inability to walk across study visits did not vary between treatment arms by visual inspection. The adjusted odds of dying or being newly unable to ambulate at 365 days did not differ by treatment arm (Table 3). Among patients not living in a nursing home before fracture, death or new transition to nursing home residence occurred in 119 of 584 patients assigned to spinal anesthesia (20.4%) versus 116 of 572 patients assigned to general anesthesia (20.3%; adjusted OR, spinal vs. general: 1.01, 95% CI 0.76, 1.35). Median WHODAS 2.0 scores were similar by treatment assignment across study visits (Appendix Table 4). Adverse events reported at up to 365 days were similar across treatment arms (Appendix Table 5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appendix Table 6 shows characteristics of patients without available vital status information at or beyond the 365-day interview due to loss to follow-up or study withdrawal. Sensitivity analyses imputing survival status for these patients returned results comparable to those from our main models (HR for spinal vs. general anesthesia: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.44; P=0.59). Analyses that accounted for treatment non-adherence did not differ from our main results (HR for spinal vs. general anesthesia 1.10; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.56; P=0.59).

DISCUSSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In this pre-specified secondary analysis of a pragmatic randomized trial of 1,600 adults aged 50 years and older, assignment to spinal anesthesia versus general anesthesia did not impact survival at up to 1 year after hip fracture surgery. Secondary outcomes, including recovery of ambulation over the first year after surgery, death or inability to walk without human assistance at 365 days, and death or new transition to nursing home residence at 365 days did not differ by anesthesia type.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Among older adults undergoing surgical procedures for which spinal or general anesthesia may be suitable, information on how anesthesia choices may influence survival and functional recovery over the first year after surgery can inform treatment choices by patients and clinicians. Most recent randomized trial data have not suggested major differences in short-term outcomes by anesthesia type. 12, 24  However, some differences have been noted that could plausibly affect longer-term outcomes. A recent meta-analysis found lower rates of acute kidney injury among patients randomized to spinal versus general anesthesia, 3  which could potentially impact long-term survival. A prior analysis of data from REGAIN suggested potential differences in pain and opioid use in the early postoperative period among patients who received spinal anesthesia, 25  which could possibly influence rehabilitation and recovery of ambulation.

To date, few studies have compared 1-year outcomes with spinal versus general anesthesia. A 2017 meta-analysis by Guay and colleagues 2  identified two single-center trials from the 1980s that evaluated survival at 1 year among patients assigned to spinal versus general anesthesia for hip fracture surgery and found no difference in survival by anesthesia type among a total of 726 patients enrolled across both studies. 7,8  More recently, Parker and Griffiths reported mortality at 1 year to be 20.2% with spinal anesthesia versus 12.1% with general anesthesia in a single-center randomized trial enrolling 322 hip fracture patients. 6

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The current study provides important new insights that add to and extend beyond past work in this area. Studies conducted in the 1980s predated the introduction of modern anesthesia medications and monitoring standards; the present study employed pragmatic treatment protocols to represent current standards of practice across the diverse US and Canadian hospitals in our network. We did not confirm findings from Parker and Griffith's prior trial of differences in survival at 1 year by anesthesia type; 6  this may have been due to differences in the characteristics of the patients enrolled in each study, in anesthesia techniques employed, or in postoperative care delivery across studies. In contrast to prior studies of long-term anesthesia outcomes, we evaluated outcomes of major importance to patients and families beyond survival alone, including recovery of ambulation and the need for new nursing home care 1 year after surgery. The large sample recruited for the present study also permitted additional analyses to examine for heterogeneity of treatment effects on survival outcome according to patient age and country of enrollment. These subgroup analyses did not identify significant differences in these groups according to anesthesia type.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our study has limitations. Some patients were censored before completing the final study visit due to withdrawal or loss to follow-up. Sensitivity analyses conducted to address missing data produced results similar to those of primary analyses; however, since these analyses rely on assumptions we cannot fully verify, we cannot rule out bias due to missing data. As previously reported, some patients in each group failed to receive the assigned treatment. 12  Nonetheless, our findings regarding survival remained unchanged in supplemental analyses that accounted for crossover between spinal and general anesthesia using instrumental variable analyses. As we did not obtain cause-of-death information for most decedents in our analysis, we are unable to compare differences in the cause of death between groups. One-year mortality in our sample was lower than has been reported in unselected populations of hip fracture patients, 11  which may have been due to study eligibility criteria or differences in enrollment rates between sicker versus healthier patients. While the confidence intervals reported here argue against large effects of anesthesia type on long-term outcomes, the available sample does not permit us to fully exclude the potential for more subtle effects. Finally, based on resources available for the present study, we chose to conduct ambulation and location of residence assessments by telephone at three time points over the first year after surgery; it is possible that more frequent assessments or in-person evaluations may have produced different results.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of spinal anesthesia has increased over time, 5  potentially reflecting beliefs regarding potential outcome benefits. 26  Our finding of similar outcomes at 365 days with either technique in hip fracture patients suggests that, for older surgical patients who may be candidates for either spinal or general anesthesia, treatment choices can be based on

Table 2. Effect of spinal anesthesia versus general anesthesia on survival at up to 365 days after randomization

<!-- PAGE=? -->
a. Cox proportional hazards model for death over the study period adjusted for sex, fracture type, and country. Proportional hazards assumption confirmed via examination of failure time graph and P>0.05 in test for zero slope in Schoenfeld residuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
b. We tested for interactions between treatment assignment and the following pre-specified patient characteristics on the primary outcome: age 85 years or older versus younger than 85 years; sex; country of enrollment; the need for assistive devices to ambulate prior to fracture; location of residence prior to fracture; and fracture type. Subgroup analyses were carried out only when the p-value for the interaction term was 0.20 or less.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
c. Cox proportional hazards model for death at 365 days after enrollment adjusted for sex, fracture type, and country. Failure time graphs and test for zero slope in Schoenfeld residuals did not confirm proportional hazards assumption (P=0.02); additional analyses shown in Appendix Table 1.
