Isolated systolic hypertension is increasingly being recognized as a signi fi cant independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in all decades of life. Control of systolic blood pressure is  being  encouraged,  particularly  in  elderly  patient  populations in which isolated systolic hypertension is prevalent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pulse  pressure-that  is,  the  di ff erence  between  the systolic  blood  pressure  and  diastolic  blood  pressure-is emerging as a new marker of the degree of vascular sti ff ness. Increased pulse pressure is a cardiovascular risk factor, and some  studies  have  linked  an  increased  pulse  pressure  with intraoperative hemodynamic instability and adverse postoperative outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic hypertension is characterized as essential or primary hypertension when  a  cause  for  the  increased  blood  pressure cannot be identi fi ed. It is termed secondary hypertension when an identi fi able cause is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Essential hypertension, which accounts for more than 95% of  all  cases  of  hypertension,  is  characterized  by  a  familial incidence  and  inherited  biochemical  abnormalities.  Pathophysiologic  factors  implicated  in  the  genesis  of  essential hypertension include increased sympathetic nervous system activity  in  response  to  stress,  overproduction  of  sodiumretaining hormones  and  vasoconstrictors,  high  sodium intake, inadequate dietary intake of potassium and calcium, increased renin secretion, de fi ciencies of endogenous vasodilators  such as prostaglandins and nitric oxide (NO), and the  presence  of  medical  diseases  such  as  diabetes  mellitus

SYSTEMIC HYPERTENSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An adult  is  considered  to  have  hypertension  when  the  systemic blood pressure measures 140/90 mm Hg or higher on at least two occasions a minimum of 1 to 2 weeks apart (Table 5-1). Prehypertension is de fi ned as the presence of a systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese de fi nitions are based on the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7). An updated report (JNC 8) is under development. Based on the JNC 7 de fi nitions, systemic hypertension is the most common circulatory derangement in the United States, a ff ecting about 30% of adults. Th e incidence of systemic hypertension increases progressively with age and is higher in the African American population (Figure 5-1). Hypertension is a signi fi cant risk factor for the development of ischemic heart disease (Figure 5-2) and a major cause of congestive heart

and obesity. Th e fi nal common pathway in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension is salt and water retention. Hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and obesity o ft en occur concomitantly, and an estimated 40% of patients with  hypertension  also  have  hypercholesterolemia.  Alcohol  and  tobacco  use  are  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  essential  hypertension.  Obstructive  sleep  apnea, which  is  present  in  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  adult population, causes temporary increases in blood pressure in association  with  hypoxemia,  arousal,  and  activation  of  the sympathetic nervous system. Th ere is evidence that obstructive sleep apnea leads to sustained hypertension independent of  known  confounding  factors  such  as  obesity.  Indeed,  an estimated 30% of hypertensive patients manifest obstructive sleep apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  history  of  ischemic  heart  disease,  angina  pectoris,  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy,  congestive  heart  failure,  cerebrovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or renal insu ffi ciency suggests end-organ disease resulting from chronic, poorly controlled essential hypertension. Laboratory evaluation is intended to document target organ damage and includes blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine assays to quantify renal function. Hypokalemia in the presence of essential hypertension suggests primary hyperaldosteronism. Fasting blood glucose concentration should be evaluated, because half of hypertensive patients exhibit glucose intolerance. An electrocardiogram is useful for detecting evidence of ischemic heart disease or le ft ventricular hypertrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SECONDARY HYPERTENSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary hypertension has a demonstrable cause but accounts for fewer than 5% of all cases of systemic hypertension. Renal artery stenosis leading to renovascular hypertension  is  the  most  common  cause  of  secondary  hypertension. Th is  and  other  common  causes  of  secondary  hypertension with their notable signs and symptoms are listed in Table 5-2. A more comprehensive list of causes of secondary hypertension is provided in Table 5-3.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of Essential Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  standard  goal  of  therapy  for  essential  hypertension  is to decrease systemic blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg. In the presence of concurrent diabetes mellitus or renal disease, current guidelines (JNC 7) recommend lowering the blood pressure to less than 130/80 mm Hg, but this is somewhat controversial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreasing  blood  pressure  by  lifestyle  modi fi cation  and pharmacologic therapy is intended to decrease morbidity and mortality. Treatment resulting in normalization of blood pressure  has  been  particularly  successful  in  decreasing  the  incidence of stroke. Decreasing blood pressure also decreases the morbidity and mortality associated with ischemic heart disease (Figure 5-4). It slows or prevents progression to a more severe stage of hypertension and decreases the risk of congestive heart failure and renal failure. Th e bene fi ts of antihypertensive drug therapy appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  concomitant  risk  factors  (hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, family history of hypertension, age >60 years) and evidence of target organ damage (angina pectoris, prior myocardial infarction, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy, peripheral vascular disease) are most likely to bene fi t from pharmacologic antihypertensive therapy. Patients who do not manifest clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease or target organ damage may bene fi t  from a trial of lifestyle modi fi cation and subsequent reevaluation before initiation of pharmacologic therapy.

LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lifestyle modi fi cations of proven value in lowering blood pressure include weight reduction or prevention of weight gain, moderation  of  alcohol  intake,  increase  in  physical  activity, adherence to recommendations for dietary calcium and potassium intake, and moderation in dietary salt intake. Smoking cessation is critical, because smoking is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Weight  loss  may  be  the  most  e ffi cacious  of  all  nonpharmacologic interventions in the treatment of hypertension. A 10-kg  weight  loss  decreases  the  systolic  and  diastolic  blood pressure by an average of 6.0 mm Hg and 4.6 mm Hg, respectively. Weight loss also enhances the e ffi cacy of antihypertensive drug therapy. Alcohol consumption is associated with an increase in blood pressure, and excessive use of alcohol may cause resistance to antihypertensive drugs. However, moderate alcohol ingestion has been shown to decrease overall cardiovascular risk in the general population. At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, such as brisk walking or bicycling, can lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is an inverse relationship between dietary potassium and calcium intake and blood pressure in the general population. Dietary salt restriction (such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] eating plan) is associated with small  but  consistent  decreases  in  systemic  blood  pressure (Figure 5-5). It is possible that sodium restriction is most bene fi cial in lowering blood pressure in a subset of patients with low renin activity, such as the elderly and African Americans.

Sodium  restriction  can  minimize  diuretic-induced  hypokalemia  and  may  enhance  the  control  of  blood  pressure  with diuretic therapy. Additional bene fi ts of salt restriction include protection from osteoporosis and fractures through a decrease in  urinary  calcium  excretion  and  favorable  e ff ects  on  le ft ventricular  remodeling.  Salt  substitutes  in  which  sodium  is replaced with potassium are useful for hypertensive patients who do not have renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initiation  of  drug  therapy  should  occur  in  tandem  with  lifestyle  modi fi cation.  A ft er  drug  therapy  is  started,  patients  are seen  every  1  to  4  weeks  to  titrate  the  antihypertensive  drug dose and then every 3 to 4 months once the desired degree of blood pressure control has been achieved. Use of long-acting drugs is preferable, because patient adherence and consistency of blood pressure control are superior with once-daily dosing. As reported by JNC 7, thiazide diuretics are recommended as initial  therapy  for  uncomplicated  hypertension  (Figure  5-6). Th iazide diuretics can also increase the e ffi cacy of multidrug regimens. Hypertensive patient may have other medical conditions  that  present compelling indications  for  antihypertensive  therapy  with  drugs  of  a  particular  class  (Table  5-4).  For example,  hypertension  in  patients  with  heart  failure  is  typically  treated  with  an  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB). Th ese compelling indications were identi fi ed based on the results of several outcome studies. If monotherapy is unsuccessful, a second drug, usually of a di ff erent class, is added. A large variety of antihypertensive drugs are available, and many of these drugs present unique and potentially signi fi cant advantages and side e ff ects (Table 5-5).

For patients in whom renal artery repair is not possible, blood pressure  control  may  be  accomplished  with  ACE  inhibitors alone  or  in  combination  with  diuretics.  Renal  function  and serum potassium concentration must be carefully monitored when ACE inhibitor therapy is initiated in these patients. Primary hyperaldosteronism in women can be treated with an aldosterone  antagonist  such  as  spironolactone.  Amiloride  is used to treat hyperaldosteronism in men, because spironolactone may cause gynecomastia.

Hypertensive Crises

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DEFINITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertensive crises typically present with a blood pressure of more than 180/120 mm Hg and can be categorized as either a hypertensive urgency or a hypertensive emergency, based on the  presence  or  absence  of  impending  or  progressive  target organ  damage.  Patients  with  chronic  systemic  hypertension can tolerate a higher systemic blood pressure than previously normotensive individuals  and  are  more  likely  to  experience urgencies rather than emergencies.

dissecting  aortic  aneurysm,  acute  myocardial  infarction, eclampsia,  microangiopathic  hemolytic  anemia,  or  renal insu ffi ciency)  require  prompt  pharmacologic  intervention to lower the systemic blood pressure. Encephalopathy rarely develops  in  patients  with  chronic  hypertension  until  the diastolic blood pressure exceeds 150 mm Hg. However, parturient  woman  with  pregnancy-induced  hypertension  may develop signs of encephalopathy with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg. Even in the absence of symptoms, a parturient with a diastolic blood pressure higher than 109 mm Hg is considered to have a hypertensive emergency and requires immediate treatment. Th e goal of treatment in hypertensive emergencies is to decrease the diastolic blood pressure  promptly  but  gradually.  A  precipitous  decrease  in blood pressure to normotensive levels could provoke coronary or cerebral ischemia. Typically, mean arterial pressure is  reduced by about 20% within the fi rst  hour of treatment and then more gradually over the next 2 to 6 hours to a target blood pressure of about 160/110 mm Hg if tolerated as indicated by the absence of symptomatic hypoperfusion of target organs.

HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertensive  urgencies  are  situations  in  which  the  blood pressure  is  severely  elevated,  but  the  patient  is  not  exhibiting  evidence  of  target  organ  damage. Th ese  patients  can have headache, epistaxis, or anxiety at presentation. Selected

patients  may  bene fi t  from  oral  antihypertensive  therapy, because nonadherence to the medication regimen or unavailability  of  prescribed  medications  is  o ft en the reason behind the hypertensive urgency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  choice  of  drug  for  treatment  of  a  hypertensive emergency  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  all  of  the  patient's medical conditions and the symptoms and signs at presentation (Table 5-6). Placement of an intraarterial catheter to continuously  monitor  systemic  blood  pressure  is  recommended during treatment with potent vasoactive drugs. Th e goal is to decrease the blood pressure by no more than 20% to  25%  initially  so  that  target  organ  hypoperfusion  is  prevented. For most types of hypertensive emergencies, sodium nitroprusside 0.5 to 10.0 mcg/kg/min IV is a drug of choice. Th e  immediate  onset  and  short  duration  of  action  allow e ff ective  minute-by-minute  titration  of  blood  pressure,  but sodium nitroprusside use can be complicated by lactic acidosis  and  cyanide  toxicity.  Nicardipine  infusion  is  another option and may improve both cardiac and cerebral ischemia. Th e  dopamine  (D 1 receptor-speci fi c)  agonist  fenoldopam increases renal blood fl ow and inhibits sodium reabsorption, which makes it an excellent drug in patients with renal insuffi ciency. Esmolol infusion can be e ff ective alone or in combination  with  other  drugs.  Labetalol,  an α -  and β -blocker, can also be very e ff ective in the acute treatment of malignant hypertension.

Clevidipine  (Cleviprex),  a  third-generation  dihydropyridine  calcium  channel  blocker  with  ultrashort  duration  of action  and  selective  arteriolar  vasodilating  properties  has recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Th e pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clevidipine are favorable for use of this drug in clinical situations in which tight blood pressure control is essential.

Management of Anesthesia in Patients with Essential Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite earlier suggestions that antihypertensive medications be discontinued preoperatively, it is now accepted that most drugs that e ff ectively control systemic blood pressure should be continued throughout the perioperative period to ensure optimum  blood  pressure  control.  A  summary  of  the  anesthetic management of patients with hypertension is presented in Table 5-7.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  essential  hypertension  should  determine  the  adequacy  of  blood  pressure control, and the drug therapy that has rendered the patient normotensive should be continued throughout the perioperative period.

cerebrovascular, and renal risk factor, and this, in turn, may increase surgical risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e magnitude of blood pressure changes during anesthesia  is  greater  in  hypertensive than in normotensive patients. Intraoperative hypotension may  be  particularly  problematic. Co-existing hypertension may increase the incidence of postoperative myocardial reinfarction in patients with a history of myocardial infarction as well as the incidence of neurologic complications in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. However,  intraoperative hypertension commonly  occurs  in patients  with  a  history  of  hypertension,  whether  or  not  the blood pressure is controlled preoperatively (Table 5-8). Th ere is no evidence that the incidence of postoperative complications  is  increased  in  hypertensive  patients  with  a  diastolic blood pressure as high as 110 mm Hg who undergo elective surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  no  universally  accepted  guidelines  for  postponement  of  elective  surgery  in  patients  in  whom  blood pressure control is less than optimal. A diastolic blood pressure of 100 to 115 mm Hg is most o ft en used as a criterion for postponement of elective  surgery.  In  hypertensive  patients with signs of target organ damage, postponement of an elective procedure is justi fi ed if that end-organ damage can be improved or if further evaluation of that damage could alter the  anesthetic  plan.  Of  course,  the  urgency  of  the  surgery has to be taken into account when evaluating a hypertensive surgical patient and optimizing the patient's condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is not uncommon for the blood pressure on admission to the hospital to be increased (white coat syndrome), re fl ecting patient  anxiety.  Subsequently  measured blood pressures are o ft en lower. Interestingly, the subset of patients who manifest anxiety-related  hypertension  are  likely  to  have  exaggerated pressor responses to direct laryngoscopy and are more likely than others to develop perioperative myocardial ischemia or to require antihypertensive therapy during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
End-organ damage (angina pectoris, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal insu ffi ciency) should be evaluated preoperatively. Patients with essential hypertension should be presumed to have ischemic heart disease until proven  otherwise.  Renal  insu ffi ciency  secondary  to  chronic hypertension is a marker of a widespread hypertensive disease process.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is useful to review the pharmacology and potential side e ff ects of the drugs being used for antihypertensive therapy. Many of these drugs interfere  with  autonomic  nervous  system function. Preoperatively, this  may appear as orthostatic hypotension.  During  anesthesia,  exaggerated  decreases  in blood pressure seen with blood loss, positive pressure ventilation, or changes in body position re fl ect impaired vascular compensation because of these autonomic-inhibitory e ff ects. Administration  of  vasopressors,  such  as  phenylephrine  and ephedrine, results in predictable and appropriate blood pressure responses in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another  compelling  reason  to  continue  antihypertensive therapy  throughout  the  perioperative  period  is  to  avoid  the risk of rebound hypertension should certain drugs, especially β -adrenergic  antagonists  and  clonidine,  be  abruptly  discontinued. Antihypertensive agents that act independently of the autonomic nervous system, such as ACE inhibitors, are not associated with rebound hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia may be a manifestation of a selective alteration  in  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity. Th ere  is  no evidence, however, that heart rate responses to surgical stimulation or surgical blood loss are absent in patients treated with  antihypertensive  drugs.  Decreased  anesthetic  requirements  parallel  the  sedative  e ff ects  produced  by  clonidine. Hypokalemia  (<3.5  mEq/L)  despite  potassium  supplementation  is  a  common  preoperative fi nding  in  patients  being treated with diuretics. However, this drug-induced hypokalemia does not appear to increase the incidence of cardiac dysrhythmias in the perioperative period. Hyperkalemia can be seen in patients being treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs who are also receiving potassium supplementation or have renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is a risk of hemodynamic instability and hypotension during anesthesia in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. Th ree systems exist to maintain normal blood pressure. A ft er blunting of autonomic responses by induction of general anesthesia and blunting of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by an ACE inhibitor, the only system remaining to support blood pressure is the vasopressin system, and so blood pressure is likely  to  be  volume  dependent  (Figure  5-7).  ACE  inhibitors may also decrease cardiac output by attenuating the venoconstrictor e ff ect of angiotensin on capacitance vessels. Th is will result in a decrease in venous return. Maintenance of intravascular fl uid  volume  is  crucial  during  surgery  in  patients undergoing  long-term  treatment  with  these  drugs.  Surgical procedures involving major fl uid shi ft s  have been associated

with hypotension in patients being treated with ACE inhibitors. Th is  hypotension has been responsive to fl uid infusion and  administration  of  sympathomimetic  drugs.  Hypotension  resistant  to  such  measures  may  require  administration of vasopressin or a vasopressin analogue. Careful titration of anesthetic drugs may prevent or limit the hypotension attributable  to  ACE  inhibitors.  It  may  be  prudent  to  discontinue ACE inhibitors  24  to  48  hours  preoperatively  in  patients  at high  risk  of  intraoperative  hypovolemia  and  hypotension. Th e major disadvantage of drug discontinuation is a potential loss of blood pressure control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ARBs e ff ectively  treat  hypertension  by  preventing  angiotensin  II  from  binding  to  its  receptor.  As  with  ACE  inhibitors, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by ARBs increases the potential for hypotension during anesthesia.  Hypotension requiring vasoconstrictor treatment occurs more o ft en a ft er induction of anesthesia in patients continuing ARB treatment than in those in whom treatment was discontinued on the day before surgery. In addition, the hypotensive episodes experienced by patients treated with ARBs may be refractory to management with conventional vasoconstrictors such as ephedrine and phenylephrine, which necessitates the use of vasopressin or one of its analogues. For these reasons, it is recommended that ARBs be discontinued the day before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia with rapidly acting intravenous drugs may produce signi fi cant hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation  in  the  presence  of  a  decreased  intravascular fl uid volume, as is likely in the presence of diastolic hypertension. Hypotension during induction is more pronounced in patients continuing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy up until the time of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation can produce signi fi cant hypertension in patients with essential hypertension, even if these patients had been rendered normotensive preoperatively.  Evidence  of  myocardial  ischemia  is  likely  to occur  in  association  with  the  hypertension  and  tachycardia that can accompany laryngoscopy and intubation. Intravenous induction drugs do not predictably suppress the circulatory responses evoked by tracheal intubation. Patients at high risk for developing myocardial ischemia may bene fi t from maneuvers that suppress tracheal re fl exes and blunt the autonomic responses to tracheal manipulation, such as deep inhalation anesthesia  or  injection  of  an  opioid,  lidocaine, β -blocker  or vasodilator before laryngoscopy. In addition, the duration of laryngoscopy is important in limiting the pressor response to this painful stimulus. Ensuring that direct laryngoscopy does not exceed 15 seconds in duration helps minimize blood pressure changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hemodynamic  goal  for  hypertensive  patients  during maintenance of anesthesia is to minimize wide fl uctuations in blood pressure. Management of intraoperative blood pressure lability is as important as preoperative control of blood pressure in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia can be used in hypertensive patients. However,  a  high  sensory  level  of  anesthesia  with  its  associated  sympathetic  denervation  can  unmask  unsuspected hypovolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  likely  intraoperative  blood  pressure  change  is hypertension produced by noxious stimulation, that is, light anesthesia.  Indeed,  the  incidence  of  perioperative  hypertensive episodes is increased in patients diagnosed with essential hypertension, even if the blood pressure was controlled preoperatively. Volatile anesthetics are useful in attenuating sympathetic nervous system activity responsible for these pressor responses.  Volatile  anesthetics  produce  a  dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure, which re fl ects a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and/or myocardial depression. Th ere is no evidence that one volatile anesthetic drug is preferable to another for control of intraoperative hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A nitrous oxide-opioid technique can be used for maintenance of anesthesia, although it is likely that a volatile agent will  be  needed  at  times  to  control  hypertension,  especially during  periods  of  abrupt  change  in  surgical  stimulation. Antihypertensive  medication  administered  by  bolus  or  by continuous infusion is an alternative to the use of a volatile anesthetic  for  blood  pressure  control  intraoperatively.  No speci fi c  neuromuscular  blocker  has  been  shown  to  be  best for  patients  with  hypertension.  Pancuronium  can  modestly increase  blood  pressure,  but  there  is  no  evidence  that  this pressor response is exaggerated in the presence of essential hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative Hypotension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension during maintenance of anesthesia may be  treated  by  decreasing  the  depth  of  anesthesia  and/or  by increasing  intravascular  volume.  Administration  of  sympathomimetic drugs such as ephedrine or phenylephrine may be necessary to restore vital organ perfusion pressures until the underlying cause of hypotension can be ascertained and corrected. Despite the suppressant e ff ect of many antihypertensive  drugs  on  the  autonomic  nervous  system,  extensive clinical experience has con fi rmed that the response to sympathomimetic drugs is both appropriate and predictable. Intraoperative  hypotension  in  patients  being  treated  with  ACE inhibitors or ARBs is responsive to administration of intravenous fl uids,  sympathomimetic drugs, and/or vasopressin. Cardiac rhythm disturbances that result in loss of sequential atrioventricular contraction, such as junctional rhythm and atrial fi brillation,  can  also  create  hypotension  and  must  be treated promptly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  in  patients  with  essential  hypertension  is in fl uenced  by  the  complexity  of  the  surgery.  ECG  is  particularly useful for identifying the occurrence of myocardial ischemia during periods of intense painful stimulation such as laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. Invasive monitoring  with  an  intraarterial  catheter  and  a  central  venous  or pulmonary artery catheter may be useful if extensive surgery is planned and there is evidence of le ft ventricular dysfunction or other signi fi cant end-organ damage. Transesophageal echocardiography is an excellent  technique  for  monitoring le ft ventricular function and adequacy of intravascular volume  replacement,  but  it  requires  speci fi c  equipment  and specially  trained  personnel,  and  it  may  not  be  universally available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative hypertension is common  in  patients  with essential  hypertension. Th is  hypertension  requires  prompt assessment  and  treatment  to  decrease  the  risk  of  myocardial ischemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, congestive heart failure, stroke,  and  excessive  bleeding.  Hypertension  that  persists despite adequate treatment of postoperative pain may necessitate administration of an intravenous antihypertensive medication.  Gradually,  conversion  can  be  made  to  the  patient's usual regimen of oral antihypertensive medication.

PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION

Th is section deals with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. See Chapters 2, 6, and 9 for discussion of pulmonary hypertension  associated  with  heart  or  lung  disease.  Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) used to be considered a very rare disease, but it is now noted more commonly. PAH may have an incidence of 2.4 cases per million people per year and a prevalence of 15 cases per million people (about 6 cases per million people for idiopathic PAH).

Idiopathic PAH is a devastating clinical condition, with a median period of survival a ft er  diagnosis of 2.8 years. Most patients succumb to progressive right ventricular (RV) failure. Patients with idiopathic PAH are at risk of perioperative RV failure,  hypoxemia,  and  coronary  ischemia. Th eir  risk  may be as high as 28% for respiratory failure, 12% for cardiac dysrhythmias, 11% for congestive heart failure, and 7% for overall perioperative mortality for noncardiac surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Definition, Nomenclature, and Classification

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PAH  is  de fi ned  hemodynamically  as  a  mean  pulmonary artery pressure of more than 25 mm Hg at rest with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, le ft atrial  pressure, or le ft ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15 mm Hg or less, and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of more than 3 Wood units  (Table  5-9). Th e  de fi nition  of  exercise-related  PAH  is awaiting better scienti fi c support.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e 2008 Fourth World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension produced a document updating the classi fi cation of pulmonary hypertension (Table 5-10). In the current classi fi cation, the use of the terms primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension are avoided, and the term idiopathic PAH (IPAH) is preferred. IPAH refers to sporadic cases of PAH with no familial context and no identi fi able risk factor. In the new classi fi cation the term heritable PAH replaces the term familial PAH. Most patients with heritable PAH have mutations in bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical Presentation and Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PAH o ft en presents with vague symptoms, including breathlessness, weakness, fatigue, and abdominal distention. Syncope and angina pectoris are indicative of severe limitations in cardiac output and possible myocardial ischemia. Chest pain likely re fl ects reduced coronary blood fl ow to a markedly hypertrophied right ventricle. As the cardiac output becomes fi xed and eventually falls, patients may have episodes of syncope or nearsyncope. On physical examination, the patient may exhibit a parasternal li ft , murmurs of pulmonic insu ffi ciency and/or tricuspid regurgitation, a pronounced pulmonic component of S 2 , an S 3 gallop, jugular venous distention with a large a wave in the jugular venous pulsation, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and

Right-sided heart catheterization provides a de fi nitive means to determine disease severity and to ascertain which patients can respond to vasodilator therapy. A potent vasodilator such as prostacyclin, NO, adenosine, or prostaglandin E 1 is administered. Th e result of the vasodilator test is considered positive, that is, the patient shows a response, if  PVR  and  mean pulmonary arterial pressure both decrease acutely by 20% or more.

vasoconstriction,  vascular  wall  remodeling,  and  thrombosis in  situ.  Vasoconstrictor-vasodilator response imbalance and proliferation-apoptosis imbalance play an important role in the development of PAH and are the basis for current treatment strategies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RV wall stress increases in response to the increase in a ft erload  produced  by  pulmonary  hypertension.  RV  stroke  volume and thus the volume available for le ft ventricular fi lling is reduced, which leads to a reduction in cardiac output and systemic hypotension. RV dilation in response to increased wall stress  results  in  annular  dilation  of  right-sided  heart  valves, producing  tricuspid  regurgitation  and/or  pulmonic  insuffi ciency. Th e  right  ventricle  usually  receives  coronary  blood fl ow during both systole and diastole. However, RV myocardial  perfusion  can  be  dramatically  limited  as  RV  wall  stress increases and RV systolic pressure approaches systemic systolic blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with PAH are at risk of hypoxemia because of three mechanisms: (1) as right-sided pressures increase, right-to-le ft shunting can occur through a patent foramen ovale; (2) in the presence of a relatively fi xed cardiac output, the increased oxygen extraction associated with exertion produces hypoxemia; and (3) ventilation/perfusion mismatch can result in perfusion of poorly ventilated alveoli. If hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs, overall pulmonary hypertension will be worsened.

progression  of  pulmonary  hypertension.  Anticoagulation may be recommended because of the increased risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism resulting from sluggish pulmonary blood fl ow, dilation of the right side of the heart, venous stasis,  and  limitations  in  physical  activity  imposed  by  this disease. Diuretics can be used to decrease preload in patients with  right-sided  heart  failure,  especially  when  hepatic  congestion,  ascites,  and  severe  peripheral  edema  are  present. A  sodium-restricted  diet  is  recommended,  particularly  in patients  with  RV  failure.  Routine  in fl uenza  immunizations are also recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst class of drugs to provide dramatic long-term bene fi t in patients with PAH was calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers are administered to patients who exhibit a positive response to a vasodilator trial in the cardiac catheterization  laboratory.  Nifedipine,  diltiazem,  and  amlodipine are the most commonly used calcium channel blockers for  this  purpose  and  have  been  shown  to  improve  5-year survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors produce pulmonary vasodilation and  improve  cardiac  output.  Sildena fi l  (Viagra)  administration has been associated with improved exercise capacity and reduction in RV mass, although long-term mortality bene fi ts have  not  yet  been  proven.  Tadala fi l  (Adcirca),  a  long-acting phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, is similarly well tolerated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phosphodiesterase inhibitors inhibit the hydrolysis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), reducing intracellular  calcium  concentration  and  producing  smooth  muscle relaxation. Th ey are e ff ective when given alone and can augment the e ffi cacy of inhaled NO.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INHALED NITRIC OXIDE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhaled NO in concentrations of 20 to 40 ppm can be used to treat PAH. When inhaled, NO di ff uses into vascular smooth muscle,  where  it  activates  guanylate  cyclase;  this  increases intracellular cGMP, which reduces the intracellular calcium concentration and results in smooth muscle relaxation. A ft er di ff using  into  the  intravascular  space,  NO  binds  to  hemoglobin-forming  nitrosyl  methemoglobin,  which  is  rapidly metabolized to methemoglobin and excreted by the kidneys. All  NO  is  rendered  inactive  in  the  pulmonary  circulation, which  eliminates  systemic  e ff ects.  Because  it  is  administered via inhalation, NO is preferentially distributed to wellventilated  alveoli,  causing  vasodilation  in  these  areas. Th is improves ventilation/perfusion matching and improves oxygenation. NO has been shown to increase oxygenation and lower  pulmonary  arterial  pressure  in  acute  respiratory  distress syndrome and in other conditions associated with severe pulmonary hypertension, but it has not been shown to reduce mortality in these situations.  Problems associated with NO administration  include  rebound  pulmonary  hypertension, platelet  inhibition,  methemoglobinemia,  formation  of  toxic nitrate metabolites, and the complex technical requirements for its application.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROSTACYCLINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prostacyclins  are  systemic  and  pulmonary  vasodilators  that also have antiplatelet activity. Th e  prostacyclins reduce PVR and improve cardiac output and exercise tolerance. However, complications  such  as  worsened  intrapulmonary  shunting, rebound  pulmonary  hypertension, systemic hypotension, infection, and bronchospasm can occur. Prostacyclins can be administered by continuous infusion in the short term and by a  pump  attached  to  a  permanent  indwelling  central  venous catheter  for  the  long  term,  by  inhalation,  and  by  intermittent subcutaneous injection. All prostacyclins produce a signi fi cant improvement in cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, at least in the short term, but have not yet provided evidence of sustained improvement or a decrease in mortality. Currently used prostacyclins include epoprostenol (Flolan), treprostinil (Remodulin), and iloprost (Ventavis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENDOTHELIN RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endothelin interacts with two receptors: endothelin A receptors and endothelin B receptors. Th e endothelin A receptors cause  pulmonary  vasoconstriction  and  smooth  muscle  proliferation, whereas the endothelin B receptors produce vasodilation  via  enhanced  endothelin  clearance  and  increased production  of  NO  and  prostacyclin.  Endothelin  receptor antagonists have been shown to lower pulmonary artery pressure  and  PVR;  to  improve  RV  function,  exercise  tolerance, quality of life;  and  to  reduce  mortality. Th e  only  endothelin receptor antagonist currently available for general use in the United  States  is  bosentan  (Tracleer).  Selective  endothelin receptor A antagonists are under development.

SURGICAL TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RV assist devices can be used in severe pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure. Balloon atrial septostomy is an investigational procedure that creates an atrial septal defect and allows right-to-le ft shunting of blood to decompress the right side of the heart at the expense of an expected and generally well-tolerated decrease in arterial oxygen saturation. Th is has been shown to improve exercise tolerance. Currently, this procedure  is  reserved  for  treatment  of  terminal  right-sided heart failure  and  as  a  bridge  to  cardiac  transplantation. Th e bene fi ts  of  extracorporeal  membrane  oxygenation  are  well established in children, but this modality has not found widespread  use  in  the  adult  population.  Lung  transplantation  is the only curative therapy for many types of PAH. Long-term survival is similar with single or bilateral lung transplantation.

Diuretics may be needed to control edema,  but  excessive  diuresis  may  dangerously  reduce  RV preload. Reduction of systemic vascular resistance by inhalational  anesthetics  or  sedatives  may  be  dangerous  because  of the relatively fi xed cardiac output. Hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis must be aggressively controlled because these conditions increase PVR. Maintenance of sinus rhythm is crucial. Th e atrial "kick" is necessary for adequate right and le ft ventricular fi lling.

PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION AND INDUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  PAH  who  are  not  yet receiving  long-term  therapy,  administration  of  sildena fi l  or l -arginine preoperatively may be helpful. In patients receiving  long-term  pulmonary  vasodilator  therapy,  that  therapy must be continued. Systems for inhalation of NO or prostacyclin should be available. Sedatives should be used with caution, because respiratory acidosis may increase PVR. Opioids, propofol,  thiopental,  and  depolarizing  and  nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers may all be used safely. Ketamine and etomidate  may  suppress  some  mechanisms  of  pulmonary vasorelaxation  and  should  be  avoided.  Epidural  anesthesia has been used for cesarean delivery and other suitable surgical procedures, but very close attention must be paid to intravascular volume and systemic vascular resistance in these situations. It is also important to remember that prostacyclins and NO can inhibit platelet function. If regional anesthesia is to be used, the block must be increased slowly to the required level and with invasive hemodynamic monitoring in place so cardiac parameters can be adjusted promptly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central  venous  catheterization  is  recommended,  although care must be taken in the placement of central venous and pulmonary artery catheters because disruption of sinus rhythm by  the  catheter  or  wire  can  be  a  critical  event.  Intraarterial blood pressure monitoring is also recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhalational  anesthetics,  neuromuscular  blockers,  and  opioids,  except  those  associated  with  histamine  release,  can  be used for maintenance of anesthesia. Hypotension can be corrected with norepinephrine, phenylephrine, or fl uids. A potent pulmonary vasodilator such as milrinone, nitroglycerin, NO, or prostacyclin should be available to treat severe pulmonary hypertension  should  it  develop.  During  mechanical  ventilation, fl uid balance and ventilator adjustments must be set to prevent a decrease in venous return.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  PAH  are  at  risk  of  sudden  death  in  the  early postoperative period because of worsening PAH, pulmonary thromboembolism,  dysrhythmias,  and fl uid  shi ft s. Th ese patients  must  be  monitored  intensively  in  the  postoperative period to help maintain hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation  at  acceptable  levels.  Optimal  pain  control  is an  essential  component  of  the  postoperative  care  of  these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTETRIC POPULATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e hemodynamic changes during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and the postpartum period can have a signi fi cant impact in patients with pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Forceps delivery to decrease patient e ff ort is recommended. Nitroglycerin should be immediately available at the time of uterine involution, because the return of uterine blood to the central  circulation  may  be  poorly  tolerated  in  a  parturient with PAH.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Hypertension is a signi fi cant risk factor for cardiovascular disease,  stroke,  and  renal  disease.  Tight  control  of  blood pressure has well-documented bene fi cial e ff ects. Th e goal of  antihypertensive  therapy  is  to  decrease  the  systemic blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Hypertensive  patients  coming  for  surgery  pose  management  dilemmas  for  the  anesthesiologist.  However,  the relationship between hypertension and perioperative complications is unclear, and clinical practices vary widely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Preoperative evaluation of a patient with essential hypertension  should  focus  on  the  adequacy  of  blood  pressure control, the antihypertensive drug regimen, and the presence of target organ damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Despite the prevailing desire to render patients normotensive  before  elective  surgery,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the incidence of postoperative complications is increased when hypertensive patients (diastolic blood pressure as high as 110 mm Hg) undergo elective surgery. However, hypertension associated with end-organ damage does increase surgical risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Hypotension  requiring  vasoconstrictor  treatment  occurs more o ft en a ft er induction of anesthesia in patients receiving  long-term  treatment  with  ACE  inhibitors  and  ARBs than in those in whom such treatment has been discontinued on the day before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Direct  laryngoscopy  and  endotracheal  intubation  may result in a signi fi cant increase in blood pressure in patients with  essential  hypertension,  even  in  those  patients  who have been treated with antihypertensive drugs and are rendered normotensive preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ PAH is  hemodynamically  de fi ned  as  a  mean  pulmonary artery pressure of more than 25 mm Hg at rest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Smooth muscle hyperplasia, intimal fi brosis, medial hypertrophy, obliteration of small blood vessels, and neoplastic forms  of  endothelial  cell  growth  called plexiform  lesions are all part of the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. In addition, platelet function is enhanced, and in situ thrombosis is a common fi nding.

■ NO di ff uses  into  vascular  smooth  muscle,  where  it  activates  guanylate  cyclase,  increasing  intracellular  cGMP; this reduces the intracellular calcium concentration, which results in smooth muscle relaxation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Calcium channel blockers,  prostacyclins,  NO,  endothelin receptor blockers, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are all pulmonary vasodilators that are useful in the treatment of patients  with  PAH.  All  long-term  pulmonary  vasodilator therapy  must  be  continued  throughout  the  perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In  the  perioperative  period,  the  risk  of  right-sided  heart failure or sudden death is signi fi cantly increased in patients with PAH. Th is may be due to increased RV a ft erload, inadequate  RV  preload,  hypoxemia,  hypotension,  dysrhythmias, or pulmonary thromboembolism.
