Patients with diseases a ff ecting the brain and central nervous system may undergo surgery to treat the neurologic condition or surgery unrelated to the nervous system disease. Regardless of the reason for surgery, co-existing nervous system diseases o ft en have important implications for the selection of anesthetic drugs, techniques, and monitoring methods. Concepts of cerebral protection and resuscitation assume unique importance in these patients. Th is chapter reviews these issues and also discusses various diseases of the retina and optic nerve.

CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW, BLOOD VOLUME, AND METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Generally, cerebral blood fl ow (CBF) is governed by cerebral metabolic rate,  cerebral  perfusion  pressure  (CPP ,  de fi ned as the  di ff erence  between  the  mean  arterial  pressure  [MAP] and intracranial pressure [ICP]), arterial blood carbon dioxide  (Pa co 2 )  and  oxygen  (Pa o 2 )  tensions,  the  in fl uence  of various  drugs,  and  intracranial  abnormalities.  CBF  is  normally  autoregulated,  that  is,  constant  over  a  given  range  of

perfusion pressures. In a healthy adult, CBF is approximately 50 mL/100 g brain tissue per minute over a CPP range of 50 to 150 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal cerebral metabolic rate, generally measured as rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), is 3.0 to 3.8 mL O 2 /100 g brain tissue per minute. It can be decreased by temperature reductions  and  various  anesthetic  agents  and  increased  by temperature increases and seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  and  intensive  care  management  of  neurologically impaired patients relies heavily on manipulation of intracranial volume and pressure. Th ese, in turn, are in fl uenced by cerebral blood volume (CBV) and CBF. CBF and CBV do not always change in parallel. For example, vasodilatory anesthetics  and  hypercapnia  may  produce  parallel  increases  in  CBF and  CBV.  Conversely,  moderate  systemic  hypotension  can produce a reduction in CBF but, as a result of compensatory vessel dilation, an increase in CBV . Similarly, partial occlusion of an intracranial artery such as occurs in embolic stroke may reduce  regional  CBF.  However,  vessel  dilation  distal  to  the occlusion, which is an attempt to restore circulation, can produce an increase in CBV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variations in Pa co 2 produce corresponding changes in CBF (Figure 10-1). As a guideline, CBF (normally approximately 50 mL/100 g brain tissue per minute) increases by 1 mL/100 g per minute for every 1 mm Hg increase in Pa co 2 . A similar decrease occurs during hypocarbia, so that CBF is decreased by approximately 50% when Pa co 2 is  acutely  reduced  to  20 mm Hg. Th e impact of Pa co 2 on CBF is mediated by variations in the pH of the cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) around the walls  of  arterioles.  Decreased  CSF  pH  causes  cerebral  vasodilation,  and  increased  CSF  pH  results  in  vasoconstriction. Pa co 2 can also modulate CBV . Th e extent of CBV reduction is  dependent on the anesthetic being used. In general, vasoconstricting anesthetics tend to attenuate the e ff ects of Pa co 2 on CBV.

Th e  ability  of  hypocapnia  to  acutely  decrease  CBF,  CBV , and ICP is fundamental to the practice of clinical neuroanesthesia. Concern that cerebral hypoxia due to vasoconstriction can occur when the Pa co 2 is lowered to less than 20 mm Hg has not been substantiated. Th e  ability  of  hypocapnia to decrease CBV, and thus ICP, is attenuated by the return of CSF pH  to  normal  a ft er  prolonged  periods  of  hypocapnia. Th is reduces the e ff ectiveness of induced hypocapnia as a means of long-term control of intracranial hypertension. Th is adaptive change, which re fl ects active transport of bicarbonate ions into or from the CSF, requires approximately 6 hours to return the CSF pH to normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arterial Oxygen Partial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased  Pa o 2 does  not  signi fi cantly  a ff ect  CBF  until  a threshold value of approximately 50 mm Hg is reached (see Figure  10-1).  Below  this  threshold,  there  is  abrupt  cerebral vasodilation, and CBF increases. Furthermore, the combination of arterial hypoxemia and hypercarbia exert synergistic e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral Perfusion Pressure and Cerebral Autoregulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  ability  of  the  brain  to  maintain  CBF  at  constant  levels despite changes in CPP is known as autoregulation (see Figure 10-1).  Autoregulation is an active vascular response characterized  by  (1)  arterial  constriction  when  the  blood  pressure is increased, and (2) arterial dilation in response to decreases in  systemic  blood  pressure.  For  example,  in  normotensive patients,  the  lower  limit  of  CPP  associated  with  autoregulation is believed to be approximately 50 mm Hg, although the exact  value  is  controversial.  Below  this  threshold,  cerebral blood vessels are maximally vasodilated and CBF decreases. CBF becomes directly related to CPP-that is, it becomes pressure-dependent blood fl ow. Indeed, at a CPP of 30 to 45 mm Hg, symptoms of cerebral ischemia may appear in the form of nausea, dizziness, and slow cerebration. Autoregulation of CBF also has an upper limit above which the fl ow becomes directly  proportional  to  the  CPP . Th is  upper  limit  of  autoregulation in normotensive patients is believed to be a CPP of approximately 150 mm Hg. Above this pressure, the cerebral blood vessels are maximally constricted. If CPP increases further, then CBF increases and becomes pressure dependent. Th is results in overdistention of the cerebral blood vessels, and as a result, fl uid may be forced across the blood vessel walls into the brain tissue, producing cerebral edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoregulation of CBF is altered in the presence of chronic hypertension. Speci fi cally, the autoregulation curve is displaced to the right, so that pressure dependence of CBF occurs at a higher CPP at both the upper and lower thresholds of autoregulation. Th e adaptation of cerebral blood vessels to increased blood pressure requires some time. Indeed, acute hypertension, as seen in children with acute-onset glomerulonephritis  or  in  patients  with  short-duration  pregnancy-induced

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypertension, o ft en produces signs of central nervous system dysfunction at MAP values that are well tolerated in chronically  hypertensive  patients.  Similarly,  an  acute  hypertensive response associated with direct laryngoscopy or surgery may cause a breakdown of autoregulation in previously normotensive patients. Th e lower limit of autoregulation is also shi ft ed upward in chronically hypertensive patients, so that decreases in systemic blood pressure that would be tolerated in normotensive  patients  are  not  well  tolerated  in  these  individuals. Th erefore,  rapid  lowering  of  blood  pressure  with  the  use  of a  vasodilating  drug  to  population-normal  values  in  patients who  are  chronically  hypertensive  can  precipitate  a  stroke. Gradual decreases in systemic blood pressure over time resulting from antihypertensive drug therapy can improve the tolerance of the brain to hypotension as the autoregulation curve shi ft s back toward a more normal position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoregulation  of  CBF  may  be  lost  or  impaired  under  a variety  of  conditions,  including  the  presence  of  intracranial tumors  or  head  trauma  and  the  administration  of  volatile anesthetics. Th e  loss  of  autoregulation  in  the  blood  vessels surrounding  intracranial  tumors  re fl ects  acidosis  leading  to maximum vasodilation, so that blood fl ow becomes pressure dependent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous Blood Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increases in the brain's venous blood pressure can in fl uence CBF  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Directly,  increased  brain venous pressure contributes to reductions in arterial/venous pressure gradients. Indirectly, increases in brain venous blood pressure increase CBV and ICP (see the section on intracranial pressure later), which in turn reduces CPP . If these changes in brain venous blood pressure are not compensated for by an increase in MAP, the CPP reduction will produce the expected e ff ects on CBF.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous pressure increases emanating from the central circulation-that is, central venous pressure (CVP)-are variably transmitted to the brain depending on whether the patient's position  is  horizontal  (maximal  CBV  increase)  or  head  up (minimal CBV increase). In contrast, venous blood pressure increases  emanating  from  the  neck  or  skull  base  are  more e ff ectively translated to the brain. Regardless of its origin, an increase in brain venous pressure can contribute to increased brain  bulk  during  intracranial  surgery  and  impede  the  surgeon's access to the target brain areas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Causes of increased brain venous pressure include venous sinus  thrombosis  and  jugular  compression  resulting  from improper neck positioning, such as extreme fl exion or rotation.  Superior  vena  cava  syndrome  can  cause  long-term increases in brain venous pressure. With coughing, increases in intrathoracic pressure result in transient increases in CVP . However, if a coughing or bucking patient is tracheally intubated, the glottis is stented open by the endotracheal tube, and the e ff ects of a cough or buck on CVP will be di ff erent from those in a nonintubated patient. CVP will transiently increase during  forced  exhalation,  but  transiently  decrease  during forced inhalation, which results in no meaningful change in CVP over an entire coughing or bucking cycle. In such a setting, ICP can still increase, but this increase would be due to increases  in  CBF  and  CBV  resulting  from  muscle  a ff erentmediated  stimulation  of  the  brain,  a  mechanism  shared  by succinylcholine-induced increases in ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Under  normal  physiologic  conditions,  changes  in  CMRO 2 usually lead to concomitant changes in CBF, a phenomenon known as CBF-CMRO2 coupling. In contrast, volatile anesthetics,  such  as  iso fl urane,  sevo fl urane,  and  des fl urane,  particularly when administered in concentrations greater than 0.6 to 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), are o ft en potent direct  cerebral  vasodilators  that  produce  dose-  dependent increases  in  CBF  despite  concomitant  decreases  in  cerebral metabolic oxygen requirements. Below 1 MAC, volatile anesthetics alter CBF minimally, in part because any direct e ff ects of the anesthetics are counterbalanced by CBF-CMRO 2 coupling. When volatile anesthetic-induced CMRO 2 depression is maximized, concomitant with maximal depression of cerebral  electrical  activity,  larger  dosages  of  volatile  anesthetic will  continue  to  dilate  cerebral  blood  vessels. Th is  can  lead to increases in CBF, CBV , and possibly ICP . With halothane, which at clinically relevant dosages does not induce the extent of CMRO2 depression that is seen with other volatile anesthetics  (iso fl urane,  sevo fl urane,  des fl urane),  direct  vasodilatory e ff ects predominate, which results in greater increases in CBV at  equipotent  doses  compared  with  other  commonly  used volatile agents. Th is  can lead to increased ICP , which makes halothane a less than ideal volatile anesthetic agent for neurosurgical procedures in which CBV and ICP management is critical. With all volatile anesthetics arterial hypocapnia helps to minimize increases in CBV that might accompany administration of these drugs at normocarbia. Th ese same CBV- and ICP-attenuating e ff ects can also be achieved by administration of supplemental cerebral vasoconstricting anesthetics such as thiopental or propofol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  volatile  anesthetics,  nitrous  oxide  has  less e ff ect on CBF and does not appear to interfere with autoregulation. Th e  exact  e ff ects of nitrous oxide on human cerebral hemodynamics  remain  elusive,  probably  because  of  a  wide range of interspecies di ff erences in the MAC of nitrous oxide as well as the invariable presence of other drugs used to maintain  general  anesthesia  in  human  studies. Th e  initiation  of nitrous  oxide  administration  a ft er  closure  of  the  dura  may contribute to the development of a tension pneumocephalus, since there is likely to be air in the intracranial vault following dural closure and nitrous oxide has greater solubility in air than nitrogen. Th is leads to an increase in the size and pressure of the air pocket. Clinically, tension pneumocephalus usually presents as delayed emergence from general anesthesia a ft er craniotomy.

Like the volatile anesthetics, ketamine is considered to be a cerebral vasodilator. In contrast to volatile anesthetics and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
possibly ketamine, barbiturates, etomidate, propofol, and opioids are cerebral vasoconstrictors, provided the patient is not permitted  to  develop  respiratory  depression  and  hypercapnia. Drugs that produce cerebral vasoconstriction predictably decrease CBV and ICP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Propofol  and  barbiturates  such  as  thiopental  are  potent cerebral vasoconstrictors capable of decreasing CBF, CBV , and ICP. Opioids are also cerebral vasoconstrictors, assuming that opioid-induced  ventilatory  depression  is  controlled  and  no increase in Pa co 2 is allowed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs does not meaningfully alter ICP. However, muscle relaxation may help prevent acute increases in ICP resulting from movement or coughing during direct laryngoscopy. Neuromuscular blocker-induced histamine release, as occurs with atracurium, D-tubocurarine, and metocurine, could theoretically produce cerebral vasodilation and an associated increase in CBV and ICP, particularly if large doses of these drugs are administered rapidly. Th e use of succinylcholine in the setting of increased ICP may temporarily raise ICP. Th e mechanism for this e ff ect is most likely increases in muscle a ff erent activity, a process somewhat independent of visible muscle fasciculations. Th is can lead to cerebral arousal (which can be seen on electroencephalography [EEG]) and corresponding increases in CBF and CBV. Th ese cerebral e ff ects of succinylcholine can be attenuated or prevented by prior induction of deep anesthesia with a cerebral vasoconstricting anesthetic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e intracranial and spinal vault contains neural tissue (brain and spinal cord), blood, and CSF, and is enclosed by the dura mater and bone. Th e pressure within this space is referred to as the intracranial pressure (ICP). Under normal conditions, brain tissue,  intracranial  CSF,  and  intracranial  blood  have  a combined  volume  of  approximately  1200  to  1500  mL,  and normal ICP is usually 5 to 15 mm Hg. Any increase in one component of intracranial volume must be o ff set by a decrease in  another  component  to  prevent  an  increase  in  ICP .  Normally, changes in one component are well compensated for by other components, but eventually a point can be reached at which even a small change in intracranial contents results in a large change in ICP (Figure 10-2). Th is condition is known as increased intracranial elastance. Since ICP is one of the determinants  of  CPP ,  homeostatic  mechanisms  work  to  increase MAP to help support CPP despite increases in ICP, but eventually  compensatory mechanisms can fail and cerebral ischemia will result.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factors leading to alterations in CSF fl ow or its absorption into  the  vasculature  can  o ft en lead to increased ICP. CSF is produced by two mechanisms: (1) ultra fi ltration and secretion by the cells of the choroid plexus, and (2) the passage of water, electrolytes, and other substances across the blood-brain barrier.  CSF is, therefore, a direct extension of the extracellular fl uid compartment of the central nervous system. CSF is produced at a constant rate of 500 to 600 mL/day in adults and is

FIGURE 10-2 Intracranial elastance curve depicting the impact of increasing intracranial volume on intracranial pressure (ICP). As intracranial volume increases from point 1 to point 2, ICP does not increase because cerebrospinal fluid is shifted from the cranium into the spinal subarachnoid space. Patients on the rising portion of the curve (point 3) can no longer compensate for increases in intracranial volume; the ICP begins to increase and is likely to be associated with clinical symptoms. Additional increases in intracranial volume at this point (point 3), as produced by anesthetic drug-induced increases in cerebral blood volume, can precipitate abrupt increases in ICP (point 4).

contained within the ventricular system of the brain, the central canal of the spinal cord, and the subarachnoid space, as well as the extracellular compartment of the central nervous system. CSF is absorbed from microscopic arachnoid villi and macroscopic  arachnoid  granulations  within  the  dura  mater and bordering venous sinusoids and sinuses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to note that the intracranial vault is considered to be compartmentalized. Speci fi cally, there are various meningeal barriers within the intracranial vault that functionally separate the contents: the falx cerebri (a re fl ection of dura mater  that  separates  the  two  cerebral  hemispheres)  and  the tentorium cerebelli (a re fl ection of dura mater that lies rostral to the cerebellum and marks the border between the supratentorial and infratentorial spaces). Increases in the contents of  one  region  of  brain  may  cause  regional  increases  in  ICP , and in extreme instances, the contents of that compartment can move, or herniate, into a di ff erent compartment. Various types of herniation syndromes are categorized based on the region of brain a ff ected (Figure 10-3). Herniation of cerebral hemispheric contents under the falx cerebri is referred to as subfalcine herniation. Typically, this condition leads to compression  of  branches  of  the  anterior  cerebral  artery  and  is evident on radiographic imaging as midline shi ft . Herniation of the supratentorial contents past the tentorium cerebelli is referred to as transtentorial herniation, in  which evidence of brainstem compression occurs in a rostral to caudal manner, resulting in altered consciousness, defects in gaze and a ff erent ocular re fl exes, and, fi nally, hemodynamic and respiratory compromise  followed  by  death. Th e  uncus  (i.e.,  the  medial portion  of  the  temporal  lobe)  may  herniate  over  the  tentorium  cerebelli,  which  results  in  a  subtype  of  transtentorial

FIGURE 10-3 Herniation syndromes. An increase in the contents of the supratentorial space caused by masses, edema, or hematoma can lead to (1) herniation of the cingulate gyrus under the falx, or subfalcine herniation; (2) herniation of contents over the tentorium cerebelli, or transtentorial herniation; (3) herniation of the cerebellar tonsils out through the foramen magnum; and (4) herniation of brain contents out of a traumatic defect in the cranial cavity.

herniation referred to as uncal herniation. A  speci fi c  sign  is ipsilateral oculomotor nerve dysfunction, because the oculomotor nerve is compressed against the brainstem; this results in  pupillary  dilatation,  ptosis,  and  lateral  deviation  of  the a ff ected eye, which occurs before evidence of brainstem compression  and  death.  Herniation  of  the  cerebellar  tonsils  can occur in the setting of elevated infratentorial pressure, which leads to extension of these cerebellar structures through the foramen magnum. Typical signs are those indicating medullary  dysfunction,  including  cardiorespiratory  instability  and subsequently death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonspeci fi c signs and symptoms of increased ICP include headache, nausea, vomiting, and papilledema. As ICP increases  and  cerebral  perfusion  is  limited,  decreased  levels of  consciousness and possibly coma can be observed. Acute increases in ICP may not be tolerated as well as chronic intracranial hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased  ICP  is  o ft en  diagnosed  clinically  based  on  the symptoms described earlier,  by  radiographic  means,  and  by direct measurement of ICP. Typically, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will help identify the cause of an increase in ICP . For example, a large mass or hematoma may be evident. If aqueductal stenosis is present, the third, but not fourth, ventricle is enlarged.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  methods  are  currently  available  to  measure  and monitor ICP. Th e choice of technique depends on the clinical situation.  Pressure  transducers  can  be  placed  under  aseptic  conditions into the subdural space (known as a subdural bolt ), brain parenchyma, or ventricle. Th is last technique, also known as a ventriculostomy, has the advantage that, in addition to pressure monitoring, it allows for withdrawal of CSF. Th is is a major bene fi t, since the drainage system can be organized so that CSF will only drain if the ICP is above a selected value. Such an approach allows some control over ICP . A second advantage of ventriculostomy is  that  CSF  can  be  easily obtained for laboratory analysis. A lumbar subarachnoid catheter  is  another  available  modality.  It  o ff ers  advantages  similar to those of ventriculostomy in that CSF can be withdrawn or allowed to passively drain if the ICP increases above a set value. Th e  disadvantage  of  a  lumbar  subarachnoid  catheter compared with ventriculostomy is that, because of the compartmentalization  of  the  intracranial  contents,  lumbar  CSF pressure may not accurately re fl ect ICP in all circumstances. In certain clinical settings, such as a brain tumor, there is also a  risk  of  tonsillar  herniation when CSF is drained using the lumbar subarachnoid approach.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A normal ICP waveform is pulsatile and varies with the cardiac impulse and spontaneous breathing. Th e mean ICP should remain below 15 mm Hg. Abrupt increases in ICP to as high as 100 mm Hg observed during continuous monitoring are characterized as plateau waves. During these dramatic increases in ICP, patients may become symptomatic and manifest evidence of  inadequate cerebral perfusion. Spontaneous hyperventilation or changes in mental status may occur. Anxiety and painful stimulation can initiate abrupt increases in ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methods to Decrease Intracranial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methods to decrease ICP include elevation of the head; hyperventilation;  CSF  drainage;  administration  of  hyperosmotic drugs,  diuretics,  corticosteroids,  and  cerebral  vasoconstricting anesthetics such as barbiturates and propofol; and surgical decompression. It is not possible to reliably identify the level of ICP that will interfere with regional CBF or alter cerebral function  and  well-being  in  individual  patients. Th erefore,  a frequent  recommendation  is  to  treat  any  sustained  increase in ICP that exceeds 20 mm Hg. Treatment may be indicated even when the ICP is less than 20 mm Hg if the appearance of occasional plateau waves suggests the presence of increased intracranial elastance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posture is important for ensuring optimal venous drainage from the brain. For example, elevating the patient's head to approximately 30 degrees above heart level encourages venous out fl ow  from  the  brain  and  lowers  ICP .  Extreme fl exion  or rotation of the head can obstruct the jugular veins and restrict venous out fl ow from the brain. Th e head-down position must be avoided since this position can increase ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperventilation, and hence lowering of the Pa co 2 ,  is  an e ff ective method for rapidly reducing ICP . In adults a frequent recommendation is to maintain the Pa co 2 near 30 to 35 mm Hg. Lowering the Pa co 2 more than this may not meaningfully decrease  ICP  further,  but  may  result  in  adverse  changes  in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 10 DISEASES AFFECTING THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
systemic physiology. Th e optimal Pa co 2 -related reduction in ICP is in fl uenced by whether or not the patient is receiving a vasodilating or vasoconstricting anesthetic. However, regardless of the anesthetic used, the e ff ects of hyperventilation will diminish with time and wane a ft er 6 to 12 hours. When prolonged  hyperventilation  is  discontinued,  rebound  increases in ICP are a potential problem, especially if normocapnia is rapidly restored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Draining of CSF from the lateral cerebral ventricles or the lumbar subarachnoid space decreases intracranial volume and ICP. Lumbar CSF drainage via a catheter is usually reserved for operations in which surgical exposure is di ffi cult, such as surgery  on  the  pituitary  gland  or  an  intracranial  aneurysm. Lumbar CSF drainage is not routinely used for the treatment of baseline intracranial hypertension, particularly that related to  mass  lesions,  because  of  the  fear  that  pressure  gradients induced by drainage could result in cerebral herniation. If the cause of increased ICP is chronic, shunting of CSF from an intracranial  ventricle  is  preferred.  For  long-term  treatment, CSF is typically drained to the right atrium (ventriculoatrial shunt) or the peritoneal cavity (ventriculoperitoneal shunt).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infusion of hyperosmotic drugs such as mannitol is e ff ective in decreasing ICP . Th ese drugs produce transient increases in the osmolarity of plasma, which act to draw water from tissues, including the brain. With osmotic diuretics, diuresis and a reduction in systemic blood volume, similar to that occurring  with  loop  diuretics,  are  important  secondary  e ff ects. When mannitol  or  any  other  diuretic  is  administered,  care should be taken to avoid signi fi cant hypovolemia. Excessive fl uid  losses  can  result  in  hypotension  and  jeopardize  maintenance of adequate CPP. In addition, urinary losses of electrolytes, particularly potassium, may occur, and thus careful monitoring and replacement are required. Moreover, an intact blood-brain  barrier  is  necessary  so  that  mannitol  can  exert maximum bene fi cial e ff ects on brain size. If the blood-brain barrier  is  disrupted,  these  drugs  may  cross  into  the  brain, causing cerebral edema and increases in brain size. Th e brain eventually  adapts  to  sustained  increases  in  plasma  osmolarity, so long-term use of hyperosmotic drugs results in reduced e ff ectiveness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mannitol is ideally administered in doses of 0.25 to 0.5 g/ kg IV over 15 to 30 minutes. Larger initial doses have little incremental e ff ect on ICP, but may predispose the patient to rebound increases in ICP. Hence, it is better  to  give  an  initial dose of 0.25 to 0.5 g/kg IV and, if the desired e ff ect is not achieved, either administer another dose or switch to another type of therapy. Under ideal conditions, treatment with mannitol results in removal of approximately 100 mL of water from the  brain.  A ft er  mannitol  administration,  decreases  in  ICP are seen within 30 minutes, with maximum e ff ects occurring within 1 to 2 hours. Urine output can reach 1 to 2 L within an hour a ft er  administration of mannitol. Appropriate infusion of crystalloid and colloid solutions may be necessary to prevent adverse changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations and intravascular fl uid  volume  caused  by  the  brisk  diuresis.  On the other hand, mannitol can initially increase intravascular fl uid volume, which emphasizes the need to carefully monitor patients who have limited cardiac reserve or congestive heart failure. Mannitol has direct vasodilating properties. Interestingly,  mannitol  can  transiently  contribute  to  increased  CBV and  ICP  in  individuals  with  normal  ICP ,  but  in  those  with intracranial hypertension, mannitol will not further increase ICP. Th e  duration  of  the  hyperosmotic  e ff ects  produced  by mannitol is approximately 6 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Loop diuretics, particularly furosemide, have been used to decrease ICP . Furosemide is particularly useful in patients with evidence of increased intravascular fl uid volume and pulmonary edema and in patients who, because of various co-existing diseases  such  as  congestive  heart  failure  or  nephrotic  syndrome, would not tolerate the initial increase in intravascular volume associated with mannitol use. In these patients furosemide  will  promote  diuresis  and  systemic  dehydration  and improve arterial oxygenation along with causing a concomitant  decrease  in  ICP .  Furosemide  a ff ects  plasma  osmolarity much less than mannitol, but it can also produce hypokalemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, are e ff ective in lowering ICP caused by the development of  localized  vasogenic cerebral edema around brain tumors. Th e precise mechanism of action is unknown but may involve stabilization  of  capillary  membranes  and  decreased  production of CSF. Patients with brain tumors o ft en exhibit improved neurologic status and disappearance of headache within 12 to 36 hours a ft er initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids  are  also  e ff ective  in  treating  increased  ICP  in  patients with pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension). On the other hand, corticosteroids are not e ff ective in reducing ICP in some other forms of intracranial hypertension, such as closed head injury. Corticosteroids can increase blood glucose concentration, which may adversely a ff ect outcome if ongoing cerebral ischemia is present. Because of this, corticosteroids should not be administered for the nonspeci fi c treatment of increased ICP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Barbiturates  in  high  dosages  are  particularly  e ff ective  in treating increased ICP that develops a ft er an acute head injury. Propofol may also be useful in this situation. However, patients receiving prolonged propofol infusions, particularly pediatric patients, should be monitored for drug-associated metabolic acidosis, which can be fatal.

Specific Causes of Increased Intracranial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased  ICP  is  typically  a  sign  of  an  underlying  intracranial pathologic process. Th erefore, one should seek the cause of increased ICP in addition to instituting treatment. Causes of  increased  ICP  are  many.  Tumors  can  lead  to  increased ICP either (1) directly because of their size, (2) indirectly by causing edema in normal surrounding brain tissue, or (3) by causing  obstruction  of  CSF fl ow,  as  is  commonly  seen  with tumors involving the third ventricle. Intracranial hematomas can cause increased ICP in a manner similar to mass lesions. Blood  in  the  CSF,  as  is  seen  in  subarachnoid  hemorrhage,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
224

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
may lead to obstruction of CSF reabsorption at the arachnoid villi  and granulations, and may further exacerbate increased ICP.  Infection,  such  as  meningitis  or  encephalitis,  can  lead to  edema  or  obstruction  of  CSF  reabsorption.  Some  causes of  intracranial  hypertension  not  discussed  elsewhere  in  this chapter are described in the following sections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AQUEDUCTAL STENOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stenotic central nervous system lesions that impede CSF fl ow can  lead  to  increased  ICP .  Aqueductal  stenosis,  one  of  the more common causes of obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by  congenital  narrowing  of  the  cerebral  aqueduct  that  connects the third and fourth ventricles. Obstructive hydrocephalus can present during infancy when the narrowing is severe. Lesser obstruction results in slowly progressive hydrocephalus,  which  may  not  be  evident  until  adulthood.  Symptoms of aqueductal stenosis are the same as those seen with other forms of intracranial hypertension. Seizure disorders are present in approximately one third of these patients. CT is useful to con fi rm the presence of obstructive hydrocephalus. Symptomatic aqueductal stenosis is treated by ventricular shunting. Management  of  anesthesia  for  ventricular  shunt  placement must focus on managing intracranial hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BENIGN INTRACRANIAL HYPERTENSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) is a syndrome characterized by ICP higher than 20 mm Hg, normal CSF composition, normal sensorium, and absence of local intracranial  lesions. Th is  disorder  typically  occurs  in  obese women with menstrual irregularities. CT scan indicates a normal or even small cerebral ventricular system. Headaches and bilateral  visual  disturbances  typically  occur.  Of  note,  symptoms may be exaggerated during pregnancy. Interestingly, no identi fi able cause of increased ICP is found in most patients. Th e prognosis is usually excellent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute treatment of benign intracranial hypertension includes removal of 20 to 40 mL of CSF via a needle or catheter placed in the lumbar subarachnoid space, as well as the administration of acetazolamide to decrease CSF formation. Patients  also  respond  to  treatment  with  corticosteroids. Th e principal  indication  for  treatment  is  loss  of  visual  acuity. Treatment may involve repeated lumbar punctures to remove CSF, which also facilitates measurement of ICP . Interestingly, continued leakage of CSF through the dural puncture site may be  therapeutic.  Long-term  administration  of  acetazolamide can result in acidemia, which presumably re fl ects inhibition of hydrogen ion secretion by renal tubules. Surgical therapy, most o ft en insertion of a lumboperitoneal shunt, is indicated only a ft er medical therapy has failed and the patient's vision has  begun  to  deteriorate.  Optic  nerve  sheath  fenestration  is another surgical alternative to CSF shunting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia management for lumboperitoneal shunt placement involves avoiding exacerbation of intracranial hypertension and ensuring an adequate CPP. Hypoxia and hypercarbia must be rigorously avoided. Spinal anesthesia may be bene fi -cial  in  parturient women, since continued leakage of CSF is acceptable. In the presence of a lumboperitoneal shunt, there is a theoretical possibility that local anesthetic solution injected into the subarachnoid space could escape into the peritoneal cavity, which could result in inadequate anesthesia. Th erefore, general anesthesia may be a more logical choice in this patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal pressure hydrocephalus usually presents as the triad of  dementia,  gait  changes,  and  urinary  incontinence  that develops over a period of weeks to months. Th e mechanism is  thought  to  be  related  to  compensated  but  impaired  CSF absorption from a previous insult such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, or head trauma. In most cases, however, the cause is never identi fi ed. Lumbar puncture usually reveals normal or low CSF pressure, yet CT or MRI will o ft en demonstrate large ventricles. Treatment typically involves drainage of CSF via ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRACRANIAL TUMORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intracranial tumors may be classi fi ed as primary (those arising from the brain and its coverings) or metastatic. Tumors can originate from virtually any cell type within the central nervous system. Supratentorial tumors are more common in adults and o ft en present with headache, seizures, or new neurologic de fi -cits, whereas infratentorial tumors are more common in children  and  o ft en  present  with  obstructive  hydrocephalus  and ataxia.  Treatment and prognosis depend on both the tumor type  and  location.  Treatment  may  consist  of  surgical  resection or debulking, chemotherapy, or radiation. Gamma Knife irradiation  di ff ers  from  traditional  radiation  therapy  in  that multiple radiation sources are used, and because the tumor is addressed from multiple angles, radiation to the tumor can be maximized while the radiation dose to any single area of surrounding brain tissue can be diminished. Such treatment can also be accomplished with the use of radiation produced by a linear accelerator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumor Types

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASTROCYTOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Astrocytes are the most prevalent neuroglial cells in the central nervous system and give rise to many types of infratentorial and  supratentorial  tumors.  Well-di ff erentiated  (low-grade) gliomas  are  the  least  aggressive  class  of  astrocyte-derived tumors. Th ey o ft en are found in young adults with new-onset seizures. Imaging generally shows minimal enhancement with contrast. Surgical or radiation treatment of low-grade gliomas usually results in symptom-free long-term survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pilocytic  astrocytomas  usually  a ff ect  children  and  young adults. Th ey  o ft en  arise  in  the  cerebellum  (cerebellar  astrocytoma), cerebral hemispheres, hypothalamus, or optic pathways  (optic  glioma). Th e  tumor  usually  appears  as  a contrast-enhancing,  well-demarcated  lesion  with  minimal to  no  surrounding  edema.  Because  of  its  benign  pathologic

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
characteristics, prognosis following surgical resection is generally very good. However, the location of the lesion, such as within the brainstem, may preclude resection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaplastic astrocytomas are poorly di ff erentiated, usually appear as a contrast-enhancing lesion on imaging because of disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and generally evolve into glioblastoma multiforme. Treatment involves resection, radiation, or chemotherapy. Prognosis is intermediate between that for low-grade gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glioblastoma multiforme (grade IV glioma) accounts for 30% of all  primary  brain  tumors  in  adults.  Imaging  usually reveals a ring-enhancing lesion re fl ecting central necrosis and surrounding  edema.  Because  of  microscopic  in fi ltration  of normal brain by tumor cells, resection alone is usually inadequate. Instead, treatment generally consists of surgical debulking combined with chemotherapy and radiation and is aimed at palliation, not cure. Despite treatment, life expectancy may be measured in weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OLIGODENDROGLIOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oligodendrogliomas arise from myelin-producing cells within the  central  nervous  system  and  account  for  only  6%  of  primary  intracranial  tumors.  Classically,  seizures  predate  the appearance of tumor on imaging, o ft en by many years. Calci fi cations within the tumor are common and are visualized on CT imaging. Th e  tumor  usually  consists  of  a  mixture  of both  oligodendrocytic  and  astrocytic  cells.  Treatment  and prognosis depend on the pathologic features. Initial treatment involves resection, since early in the course, the tumor typically  consists  of  primarily  oligodendrocytic  cells,  which  are radioresistant. Because of the presence of astrocytic cells, these tumors commonly behave more like anaplastic astrocytomas or glioblastoma multiforme later in their course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EPENDYMOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arising  from  cells  lining  the  ventricles  and  central  canal  of the  spinal  cord,  ependymomas  commonly  present  in  childhood and young adulthood. Th eir most common location is the fl oor of the fourth ventricle. Symptoms include obstructive hydrocephalus, headache, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia. Treatment consists of resection  and  radiation.  Tumor  in fi ltration into  surrounding  tissues  may  preclude  complete  resection. Prognosis depends on the completeness of resection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PRIMITIVE NEUROECTODERMAL TUMOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primitive  neuroectodermal  tumor  represents  a  diverse  class of tumors including retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, pineoblastoma, and neuroblastoma, all believed to arise from primitive  neuroectodermal  cells.  Medulloblastoma  is  the  most common pediatric primary malignant brain tumor and may disseminate via the CSF to the spinal cord. Th e presentation of medulloblastoma is similar to that of ependymoma. Treatment usually involves a combination of resection and radiation given the tumor's high radiosensitivity. Prognosis is very good in children if treatment leads to disappearance of both tumor on MRI and tumor cells within the CSF.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MENINGIOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meningiomas are usually extraaxial (arising outside of the brain proper),  slow-growing,  well-circumscribed,  benign  tumors arising from arachnoid cap cells, not the dura mater. Because of their slow growth, they can be very large at the time of diagnosis. Th ey can occur anywhere arachnoid cap cells exist, but are most common near the sagittal sinus, falx cerebri, and cerebral convexity. Tumors are usually apparent on plain radiographs and CT scans as a result of the presence of calci fi cations. On MRI and conventional angiography, these tumors are o ft en seen to receive their blood supply from the external carotid artery. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment. Prognosis is usually excellent. However, some tumors may be recurrent and require additional resection. Malignant meningiomas are rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PITUITARY TUMOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pituitary  adenomas  usually  arise  from  cells  of  the  anterior pituitary  gland. Th ey  may  occur  along  with  tumors  of  the parathyroid glands and pancreatic islet cells as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I. Th ese tumors are usually divided into  functional  (i.e.,  hormone-secreting)  and  nonfunctional types. Th e former usually present as an endocrinologic disturbance related to the hormone secreted by the tumor. Functional tumors are usually smaller (<1 cm in diameter) at the time of diagnosis; hence, they are o ft en called microadenomas. Macroadenomas are usually nonfunctional, present with symptoms related to their mass (i.e., headache or visual changes resulting from compression of the optic chiasm), and are larger at the time of diagnosis, usually greater than 1 cm in diameter. Panhypopituitarism may be caused by either tumor type because of  compression  of  normally  functioning  pituitary  gland  tissue.  Pituitary  tumors  may also present as pituitary  apoplexy, which is characterized by the abrupt onset of headache, visual changes, ophthalmoplegia, and altered mental status secondary to hemorrhage, necrosis, or infarction within the tumor. Th ese tumors can also invade the cavernous sinus or internal carotid artery or compress various cranial nerves, causing an array of symptoms. Treatment depends on tumor type. Prolactinomas are o ft en initially treated medically with bromocriptine.  Surgical  resection  via  the  transsphenoidal  approach  or open craniotomy can be curative for most pituitary tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACOUSTIC NEUROMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Usually the result of a benign schwannoma involving the vestibular  component of cranial nerve VIII within the internal auditory  canal,  an  acoustic  neuroma  typically  occurs  as  a single mass. However, bilateral tumors may occur as part of neuro fi bromatosis  type  2.  Common  presenting  symptoms include  hearing  loss,  tinnitus,  and  disequilibrium.  Larger tumors,  which  grow  out  of  the  internal  auditory  canal  and into the cerebellopontine angle, may cause symptoms related to compression of a cranial nerve, especially the facial nerve, or compression of the brainstem. Treatment usually consists of  surgical  resection  with  or  without radiation therapy. Surgery  generally  involves  intraoperative  cranial  nerve  monitoring with electromyography or brainstem auditory evoked

potentials.  Prognosis  is  usually  very  good;  however,  recurrence of tumor is not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM LYMPHOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central nervous system lymphoma is a rare tumor that can arise as a primary brain tumor, also known as a microglioma, or via metastatic spread from a systemic lymphoma. Primary central nervous system lymphoma can occur anywhere within the  brain  but  is  most  common  in  supratentorial  locations, especially in deep gray matter or the corpus callosum. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is thought to be associated with a variety of systemic disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome,  rheumatoid  arthritis, immunosuppressed  states,  and  infection  with  Epstein-Barr virus. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor. Diagnosis is made by imaging as well as biopsy. During biopsy, it may be reasonable to wait to administer corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, until a ft er pathologic specimens have been obtained, since these tumors may be very sensitive to steroids. Indeed, steroid-associated tumor lysis before a biopsy is performed may result in failure to obtain an adequate sample to make the diagnosis. Th e mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy (including intraventricularly delivered drugs) and wholebrain radiation. Prognosis is poor despite treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
METASTATIC TUMOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metastatic brain tumors originate most o ft en from primary sites in the lung or breast. Malignant melanoma, hypernephroma, and carcinoma of the colon are also likely to spread to the brain. Metastatic brain tumor is the likely diagnosis when more than one intracranial lesion is present. Because of abnormal angiogenesis in metastatic lesions, these tumors tend to bleed more during resection than other central nervous system tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia during tumor resection procedures can  be  challenging,  since  patients  may  be  of  any  age  and  a variety of operative positioning issues may arise. Furthermore, some procedures may be conducted with electrophysiologic monitoring, which may have implications for anesthetic drug choices and the use of muscle relaxants. Some procedures may even  be  performed  in  awake  patients  to  facilitate  resection of  a  mass  located  near  an  eloquent  region  of  brain,  such  as the motor cortex. Major goals during anesthesia include (1) maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion and oxygenation of normal brain, (2) optimizing operative conditions to facilitate resection, (3) ensuring a rapid emergence from anesthesia at the conclusion of the procedure to facilitate neurologic assessment,  and  (4)  accommodating  intraoperative  electrophysiologic monitoring if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  an  intracranial tumor is directed toward identifying the presence or absence of increased ICP . Symptoms of increased ICP include nausea and  vomiting,  altered  level  of  consciousness,  mydriasis  and decreased reactivity of pupils to light, papilledema, bradycardia, systemic hypertension, and breathing disturbances. Evidence of midline shi ft s (>0.5 cm) on CT or MRI suggests the presence of increased ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  an  intracranial  pathologic  process  may  be extremely  sensitive  to  the  central  nervous  system  depressant e ff ects of opioids and sedatives. Drug-induced hypoventilation can lead to accumulation of arterial carbon dioxide and further increase ICP . Likewise, drug-induced sedation can mask alterations in the level of consciousness that accompany intracranial hypertension. On the other hand, preoperative sedation can unmask subtle neurologic de fi cits that may not usually be apparent. Th is is thought to result from an increased sensitivity of injured neurons to the depressant e ff ects of various anesthetic and sedative agents. Considering all the potential adverse e ff ects of preoperative medication, it is prudent to use premedication very sparingly. Preoperative administration of depressant drugs should be avoided in patients with diminished levels of consciousness. In alert adult patients with intracranial tumors, benzodiazepines in small doses can provide anxiety relief without meaningfully a ff ecting ventilation. Th e decision to administer an anticholinergic drug or histamine 2 receptor antagonist is not in fl uenced by the presence or absence of increased ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia induction is typically achieved with drugs such as thiopental, etomidate, or propofol that produce a rapid, reliable onset of unconsciousness without increasing ICP . Th is can be followed by a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant to facilitate tracheal intubation. Administration of succinylcholine may be associated with a modest transient increase in ICP . Mechanical  hyperventilation  is  initiated  with  the  goal  of  decreasing Pa co 2 to about 35 mm Hg. Adequate depth of anesthesia and profound skeletal muscle paralysis should be achieved before laryngoscopy  to  avoid  the  noxious  stimulation  or  patient movement that can abruptly increase CBF, CBV , and ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Direct  laryngoscopy  should  be  accomplished  during  profound skeletal muscle paralysis as con fi rmed by a nerve stimulator. Additional doses of intravenous anesthetic drugs, lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV , esmolol, or potent short-acting opioids may help blunt the response to laryngoscopy or other forms of intraoperative stimulation such as placement of pinions or skin incision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abrupt,  sustained  increases  in  systemic  blood  pressure, particularly in areas of impaired cerebral vasomotor tone, may be  accompanied by undesirable increases in CBF, CBV , and ICP  and  precipitate  cerebral  edema.  Sustained  hypotension must also be avoided to prevent brain ischemia. Positive endexpiratory pressure has a highly variable e ff ect on ICP. Hence, it should be used with caution, and attention must be paid to changes in ICP, MAP, and CPP as a result of this intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance  of  anesthesia  in  patients  undergoing  surgical resection of supratentorial brain tumors is o ft en achieved by combining drugs of various classes, including nitrous oxide,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 10 DISEASES AFFECTING THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
227

<!-- PAGE=? -->
volatile anesthetics, opioids, barbiturates, and propofol. Although modest cerebrovascular di ff erences can be demonstrated with di ff erent combinations of drugs, there is no evidence that any particular combination is signi fi cantly di ff erent from another or superior in terms of e ff ects on ICP and shortterm patient outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  use  of  nitrous  oxide  is  controversial  if  there  is  any potential  for  venous  air  embolism  (e.g.,  in  operations  performed  with  patients  in  the  sitting  position).  Despite  theoretical concerns, however, the actual incidence of venous air embolism in sitting patients is not in fl uenced by nitrous oxide use. Once a venous air embolism has been detected, nitrous oxide use must be discontinued because of the concern that the  embolus  volume  will  expand  and  exacerbate  the  physiologic consequences of the embolus. Both nitrous oxide and potent volatile anesthetics have the potential to increase CBV and ICP as a result of direct cerebral vasodilation. However, low  concentrations  of  volatile  anesthetics  (0.6  to  1.0  MAC) may be useful  for  preventing  or  treating  increases  in  blood pressure related to noxious surgical stimulation. Administration of peripheral vasodilating drugs, such as nitroprusside or nitroglycerin,  may  increase  CBV  and  ICP  despite  accompanying decreases in systemic blood pressure. Th is, in turn, can dramatically reduce CPP, which is dependent on both MAP and ICP. For this reason, vasodilating drugs should be used only a ft er craniotomy and opening of the dura.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous  movement  by  patients  undergoing  surgical resection of brain tumors must be prevented. Such movement could  result  in  an  increase  in  intracranial  volume  and  ICP , increased  surgical  bleeding  (making  surgical  exposure  di ffi -cult), or direct injury to the head and brain from pinions or surgical  instrumentation. Th erefore,  in  addition  to  adequate depth of anesthesia, skeletal muscle paralysis is typically maintained during intracranial surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FLUID THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Relatively  iso-osmolar  solutions  (e.g.,  0.9%  sodium  chloride, lactated Ringer's solution) do not adversely a ff ect brain water or edema formation provided the blood-brain barrier is  intact,  and  they are used in modest amounts. In contrast, free water in hypo-osmolar solutions, such as 0.45% sodium chloride, is rapidly distributed throughout body water, including  brain  water,  and  may  adversely  a ff ect  ICP  management. Hyper-osmolar  solutions,  such  as  3%  sodium  chloride,  initially tend to decrease brain water by increasing the osmolarity of plasma. Regardless of the crystalloid solution selected, any solution administered in large amounts can increase CBV and ICP in patients with brain tumors. Th erefore, the rate of fl uid infusion should be titrated to maintain euvolemia, and measures should be taken to avoid hypervolemia. Intravascular fl uid volume depletion caused by blood loss during surgery should be corrected with packed red blood cells or colloid solutions supplemented with balanced salt solutions. Glucosecontaining solutions should be avoided or used with caution, since hyperglycemia in the setting of central nervous system ischemia will exacerbate neuronal injury and worsen outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  insertion  of  an  intraarterial  catheter  is  useful  for  continuous  monitoring  of  blood  pressure  and  blood  sampling as needed. Capnography can facilitate ventilation and Pa co 2 management as well as detect venous air embolism (see the section  on  the  sitting  position  and  venous  air  embolism). Continuous ICP monitoring, although not routine, can be of signi fi cant value. Nasopharyngeal or esophageal temperature is monitored to prevent hyperthermia or uncontrolled hypothermia. A bladder catheter has utility in managing perioperative fl uid balance. It is necessary if drug-induced diuresis is  planned;  if  the  patient  has  diabetes  insipidus,  syndrome of  inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, or other aberration of salt or water physiology; or if a lengthy surgical procedure is anticipated and bladder distention is a concern.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous  access  with  large-bore  catheters  should  be obtained,  given  the  likelihood  of  bleeding  and  the  need  for transfusion or rapid administration of fl uids. Central venous catheterization can be useful for both intravenous access and monitoring of fl uid status. Central venous cannulation, with the tip of a multiori fi ce catheter placed at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium, also has utility as a means to  aspirate  intracardiac  air  following  venous  air  embolism should this occur during surgery performed with the patient in the sitting position. Transesophageal echocardiography can also be useful for procedures in the sitting position to identify intravenous air and help assess cardiac function. Pulmonary artery  catheterization  should  be  considered  in  patients  with cardiac disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A peripheral nerve stimulator is helpful for monitoring the persistence  of  drug-induced  skeletal  muscle  paralysis.  One must be aware that when paresis or paralysis of an extremity is associated with the brain tumor, the paretic extremity will show  resistance  (decreased  sensitivity)  to  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants compared with a normal extremity   (Figure 10-4). Th erefore,  monitoring  of  skeletal  muscle  paralysis  on the  paretic  limb  may  provide  misleading  information.  For example, the response to nerve stimulation may be erroneously interpreted as inadequate skeletal muscle paralysis. Likewise, at  the  conclusion  of  surgery,  the  nerve  stimulator  response could be interpreted as indicating better recovery from neuromuscular blockade than actually exists. Th ese altered muscle responses to neuromuscular blockers likely re fl ect the proliferation of acetylcholine-responsive cholinergic receptors that can occur a ft er denervation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring of electrocardiographic (ECG) activity is necessary  to  detect  responses  related  to  intracranial  tumors or surgery. ECG changes can re fl ect  increased ICP or, more importantly, surgical retraction or manipulation of the brainstem  or  cranial  nerves.  Indeed,  the  cardiovascular  centers, respiratory  control  areas,  and  nuclei  of  the  lower  cranial nerves lie in close proximity in the brainstem. Manipulation of the brainstem may produce systemic hypertension and bradycardia or hypotension and tachycardia. Cardiac dysrhythmias range from acute sinus arrhythmia to ventricular premature beats or ventricular tachycardia.

FIGURE 10-4 In a surgical patient with mild residual hemiparesis after stroke, the train-of-four ratio recorded from the paretic arm (0.6) is higher than that recorded from the normal arm (0.3), which reflects resistance of the paretic arm to the effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ideally, the e ff ects of anesthetics and muscle relaxants should be dissipated or pharmacologically reversed at the conclusion of surgery. Th is facilitates immediate monitoring of neurologic status and recognition of any adverse events related to the surgery. It is important to have patients awaken with little reaction to the presence of the endotracheal tube. Intraoperative use of narcotics and other drugs that suppress tracheal re fl exes, such as lidocaine, may aid in attenuating the physiologic responses to the presence of the tube and facilitate optimal timing of extubation. However, it must be appreciated that the local anesthetic lidocaine also has general anesthetic properties and can produce central nervous system depression. If consciousness was depressed preoperatively or new neurologic de fi cits are anticipated as a result of the surgery, it may be best to delay tracheal extubation  until  return  of  airway  re fl exes  is  con fi rmed  and spontaneous ventilation is su ffi cient to prevent carbon dioxide retention. Hypothermia may be a cause of slow postoperative awakening. Other causes of delayed emergence from anesthesia include residual neuromuscular block, residual e ff ects of drugs with sedative e ff ects  (i.e.,  narcotics,  benzodiazepines,  volatile anesthetics), or a primary central nervous system event such as ischemia, hematoma, or tension pneumocephalus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Following  general  anesthesia,  a  preexisting  neurologic de fi cit  may  be  exacerbated  by  the  sedative  e ff ects  of  anesthetic drugs, which makes a subtle preoperative de fi cit appear more severe. Th is di ff erential awakening is thought to be due to increased sensitivity of injured neurons to the depressant e ff ects of anesthetic agents. O ft en, these de fi cits will disappear and neurologic function will return to its baseline state with time. Any persistent new de fi cit that does not quickly resolve must be further investigated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SITTING POSITION AND VENOUS AIR EMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniotomy to remove a supratentorial tumor is usually performed with the patient in the supine position with the head elevated 10 to 15 degrees to facilitate cerebral venous drainage. Infratentorial tumors have more unusual patient positioning requirements and may be performed with the patient in the lateral, prone, or sitting position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e sitting position deserves special attention since it has a  variety  of  implications  for  management of anesthesia. Th e sitting position is o ft en used for exploration of the posterior cranial  fossa,  and  it  may  be  employed  to  resect  intracranial tumors, clip aneurysms, decompress cranial nerves, or implant electrodes  for  cerebellar  stimulation.  In  addition,  it  may  be used for surgery on the cervical spine and posterior cervical musculature. Advantages of the sitting position include excellent surgical exposure and enhanced cerebral venous and CSF drainage, which minimizes blood loss and reduces ICP. Th ese advantages are o ff set by the decreases in systemic blood pressure  and  cardiac  output  produced  by  this  position,  and  the potential hazard of venous air embolism. For these reasons, the lateral or prone position is o ft en selected as an alternative. However, as long as no contraindication to the sitting position exists, such as a patent foramen ovale, the outcome of patients undergoing surgery in the sitting position is similar or superior to that of patients placed in other positions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  the sitting position is used, one should account for the e ff ect  of  hydrostatic  pressure  gradients  on  CPP .  Speci fi cally, CPP  should  re fl ect  correction  for  the  hydrostatic  pressure di ff erence between the heart and the brain. Th is  is  generally accomplished by measuring blood pressure via an intraarterial catheter  and  referencing  the  pressure  transducer  to  the  vertical  height  of  the  external  auditory  meatus,  which  approximates the position of the circle of Willis. Lack of correction for hydrostatic pressure may put the patient at undue risk of cerebral  hypoperfusion,  since  the  measured  systemic  blood pressure, but not necessarily the true pressure at the level of the brain, will be greater if the transducer is referenced at the level of the heart.

Venous air  embolism is  a  potential  hazard  whenever  the operative site is above the level of the heart, so that pressure in the exposed veins is subatmospheric. Although this complication is most o ft en associated with neurosurgical procedures, venous air embolism may also occur during operations involving the neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis and during open heart surgery, repair of liver and vena cava lacerations, obstetric  and  gynecologic  procedures,  and  total  hip  replacement. Patients undergoing intracranial surgery are at increased risk not  only  because  the  operative  site  is  above  the  level  of  the heart but also because veins in the skull may not collapse when cut, owing to their attachment to bone or dura. Indeed, the cut edge of cranial bone, including that associated with burr holes, is a common site for the entry of air into veins.

When  air  enters  the  right  atrium  and  ventricle,  there  is interference  with  right-sided  cardiac  output  and  blood fl ow into  the  pulmonary  artery.  Air  that  eventually  enters  the pulmonary artery may trigger pulmonary edema and re fl ex

bronchoconstriction. Death is usually secondary to an air lock in  the  right  ventricular  out fl ow tract that causes right-sided cardiac output to plummet, acute cor pulmonale to develop, and hypoxemia to occur from the combined cardiac and pulmonary insults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Small quantities of air can sometimes pass through pulmonary vessels to reach the coronary and cerebral circulations. Large quantities of air can travel directly to the systemic circulation through right-to-le ft intracardiac shunts created by a patent foramen ovale or septal defects. Th is passage of air from the right to le ft circulation is known as paradoxical air embolism. Basically a venous embolism becomes an arterial embolism. A known patent foramen ovale or other cardiac defects that could result in a right-to-le ft shunt are relative contraindications to use of the sitting position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fatal cerebral embolism subsequent to entrainment of systemic venous air has occurred even in the absence of identifi able shunts or intracardiac defects. Th is may occur because of  failure  of  contrast  echocardiography to detect an existing patent foramen ovale or septal defect. Th ere are many theoretical reasons for this failure of detection. One is that Valsalva or other provocative maneuvers are not always successful in mimicking the physiologic changes that occur during general anesthesia and true venous air embolism, and for this reason may underestimate the potential for venous air to pass from the right to the le ft circulation. Paradoxical air embolism can occur even in the absence of any detectable elevation of right atrial pressure compared with le ft atrial pressure. Th is happens as a result of small di ff erences in the timing of contraction of the  various  heart  chambers.  As  a  result,  pressure  gradients transiently  reverse,  which  makes  a  shunt  bidirectional.  An extremely  brief  right-to-le ft shunting  could  introduce  a  few air bubbles into the le ft cardiac chambers and lead to severe consequences if those bubbles were to embolize to the brain. Also, various anesthetic drugs may diminish the ability of the pulmonary circulation to fi lter out air emboli and thus facilitate the passage of venous air emboli through the pulmonary vasculature to the systemic circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  use  of  the  sitting  position  inherently  predisposes neurosurgical patients to paradoxical air embolism, because the  normal  interatrial  pressure  gradient  frequently  becomes reversed in this position. When the likelihood of venous air embolism is increased, it is useful, but not mandatory, to place a right atrial catheter before beginning surgery. Death caused by paradoxical air embolism results from obstruction of the coronary arteries by air, which leads to myocardial ischemia and ventricular fi brillation. Neurologic damage may follow air embolism to the brain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  detection  of  venous  air  embolism  is  important  for successful treatment. A Doppler ultrasonographic transducer placed over the right cardiac structures is one of the most sensitive detectors of intracardiac air. Indeed, the small amount of air detected by the transducer is o ft en clinically unimportant. However, this transducer cannot provide information regarding the volume of air that has entered the venous circulation. Transesophageal echocardiography, by comparison, is useful for both detecting and quantifying intracardiac air. A sudden decrease  in  end-tidal  Pa co 2 may  re fl ect  increased  alveolar dead space and/or diminished cardiac output resulting from air embolism. An increase in right atrial and pulmonary artery pressure can re fl ect acute cor pulmonale and correlates with abrupt decreases in end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration. Although ET co 2 changes  are  less  sensitive  indicators  of  the presence of air than the fi ndings of Doppler ultrasonography or transesophageal echocardiography, they re fl ect the size of the  venous  air  embolism.  Increased  end-tidal  nitrogen  concentration can identify and partially quantify the presence of venous air embolism. Changes in end-tidal nitrogen concentration may precede decreased end-tidal Pa co 2 or  increased pulmonary  artery  pressures.  During  controlled  ventilation, sudden attempts by the patient to initiate spontaneous breaths (gasp re fl ex) may be the fi rst indication of venous air embolism.  Hypotension,  tachycardia,  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  and cyanosis are late signs of venous air embolism. Certainly detection of the characteristic mill wheel murmur, as heard through an esophageal stethoscope, is a late sign of catastrophic venous air embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once a venous air embolism is detected, the surgeon should fl ood the operative site with fl uid, apply occlusive material to all bone edges, and attempt to identify any other sources of air entry such as perforation of a venous sinus. Aspiration of air should be attempted through the right atrial catheter. Th e ideal location for the tip of the right atrial catheter is controversial, but evidence suggests that the junction of the superior vena cava with the right atrium is preferable, because this position appears to provide the most rapid aspiration of air. Multiorifi ce right atrial catheters permit aspiration of larger amounts of air than do single-ori fi ce catheters. Because of its small lumen and slow speed of blood return, a pulmonary artery catheter is not very useful for aspirating air but may provide additional evidence  that  venous  air  embolism  has  occurred.  Administration  of  nitrous  oxide  is  promptly  discontinued  to  avoid increasing the size of any venous air bubbles. Indeed, elimination of nitrous oxide from the inhaled gases a ft er detection of a venous air embolism o ft en results in decreased pulmonary artery pressures. Pure oxygen is substituted for nitrous oxide. Direct jugular venous compression may increase venous pressure at the surgical site entraining air, but the use of positive end-expiratory pressure to accomplish this same e ff ect has not been shown to be of value.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extreme  hypotension  from  massive  air  embolism  may require support of the blood pressure using sympathomimetic drugs  with  inotropic  and  vasoconstrictive  properties.  Bronchospasm is treated with β 2 -adrenergic agonists delivered by aerosol. Although the traditional admonition is to treat venous air embolism by placing the patient in the lateral position with the right chest uppermost, this is rarely possible or safe during intracranial surgery. It is likely that attempting to attain this patient position would lose valuable time that would be better spent aspirating air and supporting the circulation.

A ft er  successful  treatment  of  small  or  modest  venous  air embolism, the surgical procedure can be resumed. However,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the  decision  to  reinstitute  administration  of  nitrous  oxide must be individualized. If nitrous oxide is not used, maintenance of an adequate depth of anesthesia requires administration  of  larger  doses  of  volatile  or  intravenous  anesthetics.  If nitrous oxide is added to the inhaled gases, it is possible that residual air in the circulation could again produce symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperbaric therapy may be useful in the treatment of both severe  venous  air  embolism  and  paradoxical  air  embolism. Transfer  of  patients  to  a  hyperbaric  chamber  in  an  attempt to decrease the size of air bubbles and improve blood fl ow is likely  to  be  helpful  only  if  the  transfer  can  be  accomplished within 8 hours.

Th e  postoperative  complications  that  may  occur  a ft er posterior  fossa  craniotomy  include  apnea  due  to  hematoma formation, tension pneumocephalus, and cranial nerve injuries. Macroglossia is also a possibility and is presumably due to impaired venous and lymphatic drainage from the tongue. Th is is sometimes associated with excessive neck fl exion and may be in fl uenced by the simultaneous use of multiple oral instruments (e.g., endotracheal tube, oral airway, esophageal stethoscope, transesophageal echocardiography probe).

DISORDERS RELATED TO VEGETATIVE BRAIN FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coma  is  a  state  of  profound  unconsciousness  produced  by drugs, disease, or injury a ff ecting the central nervous system. It  is  usually  caused  by  dysfunction  of  regions  of  the  brain that  are  responsible  for  maintaining  consciousness,  such  as the pontine reticular activating system, midbrain, or cerebral hemispheres. Th e causes of coma are many and can be divided into two groups: structural lesions (i.e., tumor, stroke, abscess, intracranial bleeding) and di ff use disorders (i.e., hypothermia, hypoglycemia,  hepatic  or  uremic  encephalopathy,  postictal state following seizures, encephalitis, drug e ff ects). Th e most common means used to assess the overall severity of coma is the Glasgow Coma Scale (Table 10-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  management  of  any  comatose  patient  involves establishing  a  patent  airway  and  ensuring  the  adequacy  of oxygenation,  ventilation,  and  circulation.  One  should  then attempt to determine the cause of coma. Th is attempt should begin with obtaining a medical history from family members or caretakers, if possible, and conducting a physical examination followed by diagnostic studies. Blood pressure and heart rate are important because they might suggest a cause such as hypothermia. Respiratory patterns can also aid in diagnosis. Irregular  breathing  patterns  may  re fl ect  an  abnormality  at  a speci fi c site in the central nervous system (Table 10-2). Ataxic breathing is characterized by a completely random pattern of tidal  volumes  that  results  from  the  disruption  of  medullary neural pathways by trauma, hemorrhage, or compression by tumors. Lesions in the pons may result in apneustic breathing characterized by prolonged end-inspiratory pauses maintained for as long as 30 seconds. Occlusion of the basilar artery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
leading to pontine infarction is a common cause of apneustic breathing. Cheyne-Stokes breathing is characterized by breaths of progressively increasing and then decreasing tidal volume (crescendo-decrescendo pattern), followed by periods of apnea lasting 15 to 20 seconds. Th is pattern of breathing may re fl ect brain injury in the cerebral hemispheres or basal ganglia, or may be due to arterial hypoxemia and congestive heart failure. In the presence of congestive heart failure, the delay in circulation time from the pulmonary capillaries to the carotid bodies

In the early stages, the diencephalon (i.e., hypothalamic region) is compressed. Small pupils are the result of interrupted sympathetic innervation from hypothalamic compression. Reflex eye movements are intact, and motor responses may be purposeful or semipurposeful (i.e., localized to painful stimuli) early in the course but may progress to decerebrate posturing in response to stimuli. During midbrain compression, oculomotor nerve dysfunction leads to loss of the pupillary response to light. As the midbrain nuclei of cranial nerves that innervate extraocular muscles (i.e., oculomotor and trochlear) become affected, there is impaired response to oculocephalic and cold caloric testing. Further, decerebrate posturing is seen at this stage. As compression progresses to affect the pons or medulla oblongata, pupils are unresponsive, response to testing of reflexes involving eye movement is absent, and the patient is generally unresponsive to stimuli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is  presumed  to  be  responsible  for  Cheyne-Stokes  breathing. Central neurogenic hyperventilation is most o ft en due to acute neurologic insults that are associated with cerebral thrombosis, embolism, or closed head injury. Hyperventilation is spontaneous and may be so severe that the Pa co 2 is decreased to less than 20 mm Hg. Th e basic neurologic examination can be the key to diagnosis and should, at a minimum, include examination of the pupils and pupillary responses to light, function of the extraocular muscles via re fl exes, and gross motor responses in the extremities (Table 10-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Under normal conditions, pupils are usually 3 to 4 mm in diameter and equal bilaterally, and react briskly to light, but approximately 20% of the general population normally have physiologic anisocoria, that is, a slight (<1 mm) di ff erence in the  diameters  of  the  pupils.  Compression  of  the  diencephalon or thalamic structures leads to small (2 mm) but reactive pupils,  probably  resulting  from  interruption  of  descending sympathetic fi bers. Unresponsive midsize pupils (5 mm) usually indicate midbrain compression. A fi xed and dilated pupil (>7 mm) usually indicates oculomotor nerve compression and can be seen in herniation as well as either anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drug intoxication. Pinpoint pupils (1 mm) usually indicate opioid or organophosphate intoxication, focal pontine lesions, or neurosyphilis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation  of  the  function  of  the  extraocular  muscles allows  testing  of  brainstem  function  via  assessment  of  the function  of  the  oculomotor,  trochlear,  and  abducens  nerves (cranial nerves III, IV , and VI). In the comatose patient, this testing can be performed by means of passive head rotation (oculocephalic re fl ex or doll's eye maneuver) or by cold water irrigation of the tympanic membrane (oculovestibular re fl ex or cold caloric testing). In unresponsive patients with normal brainstem  function,  oculocephalic  maneuvers  will  produce full conjugate horizontal eye movements. Eliciting the oculovestibular re fl ex will result in tonic conjugate eye movements toward the side of cold water irrigation of the external auditory canal. Unilateral oculomotor nerve or midbrain lesions will result in failed adduction but intact contralateral abduction.  Complete  absence  of  responses  can  indicate  pontine lesions or di ff use disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of motor responses to painful stimuli can also be helpful in localizing the cause of coma. Patients with mild to moderate di ff use brain dysfunction above the level of the diencephalon will usually react with purposeful or semipurposeful movements toward the painful stimulus. Unilateral reactions  may  indicate  unilateral  lesions  such  as  stroke  or tumor.  Decorticate  responses  to  pain  consist  of fl exion  of the elbow, adduction of the shoulder, and extension of the knee  and  ankle  and  are  usually  indicative  of  diencephalic dysfunction.  Decerebrate  responses  consist  of  extension  of the elbow, internal rotation of the forearm, and leg extension and imply more severe brain dysfunction. Patients with pontine or medullary lesions o ft en exhibit no response to painful stimuli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  cases  in  which  the  cause  of  coma  is  unknown,  useful discriminatory laboratory tests include levels of serum electrolytes  and  glucose  level  to  assess  for  disorders  of  sodium and  glucose.  Liver  and  renal  function  tests  help  to  evaluate for  hepatic  or  uremic  encephalopathy.  Drug  and  toxicology screens may help to identify exogenous intoxicants. A complete blood count and results of coagulation studies may suggest the risk of intracranial bleeding from thrombocytopenia or  coagulopathy.  CT  or  MRI  may  reveal  a  structural  cause such as tumor or stroke. A lumbar puncture can be performed if meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Outcomes for patients in comatose states depend on many factors but are usually related to the cause and extent of injury to brain tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Comatose  patients  may  be  brought  to  the  operating  suite either for treatment of the cause of the coma (e.g., burr hole drainage  of  an  intracranial  hematoma)  or  for  treatment  of injuries  related  to  the  comatose  state  (e.g.,  bone  fractures caused by a motor vehicle accident in an intoxicated patient). It is important for the anesthesia provider to be aware of the likely  cause  of  the  coma,  since  anesthetic  management  will vary depending on the cause as well as the type of planned surgery. Primary overall goals should be to safely establish an airway, provide adequate cerebral perfusion and oxygenation,

and optimize operating conditions. Careful attention should be paid to avoiding increases in ICP during stimulating events. Treatments should be instituted to decrease elevations in baseline ICP . Intracranial monitoring may be helpful. Intraarterial catheterization  is  useful  for  blood  pressure  optimization  as well as management of hyperventilation, if needed. Anesthetic agents  that  increase  ICP ,  such  as  halothane  and  ketamine, should  be  avoided,  but  other  potent  volatile  agents  such  as iso fl urane, sevo fl urane, and des fl urane, used at low doses (<1 MAC)  in  combination  with  intravenous  cerebral  vasoconstrictive anesthetics, are acceptable. Nitrous oxide should be avoided if the patient has known or suspected pneumocephalus  (e.g.,  a ft er  recent  intracranial  surgery,  basilar  skull  fracture).  Administration  of  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants helps to facilitate tracheal intubation and patient positioning; however,  succinylcholine  is  best  avoided,  since  it  may  transiently increase ICP .

Brain  death  is  de fi ned  as  the  permanent  cessation  of  total brain  function. Th e  traditional  criteria  used  to  de fi ne  brain death, which are an adaptation of the original Harvard criteria established in 1968, are as follows:

   Positive result on an apnea test indicating lack of function of the respiratory control nuclei in the brainstem. Th e  test  is  performed  by  initially  ensuring  a  Pa co 2 of 40 ± 5 mm Hg and an arterial pH of 7.35 to 7.45. Th e patient  is  then  ventilated  with  100%  oxygen  for  longer than 10 minutes. Th en, while vital signs are monitored and the trachea is insu ffl ated with 100% oxygen, mechanical ventilation is discontinued for 10 minutes. Arterial blood gas values are obtained at 5 and 10 minutes  following  the  cessation  of  mechanical  ventilation and  the  patient  is  observed  for  signs  of  spontaneous respiration.  Given  that  hypercarbia  (Pa co 2 >  60  mm Hg) is a potent stimulus for ventilation, if no respiratory activity is noted, the result of the apnea test is deemed positive.

Other con fi rmatory test results include isoelectricity demonstrated by EEG and absence of CBF as demonstrated by various techniques, including transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, cerebral angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography.

Following the establishment of the diagnosis of brain death and discussions with the immediate family, legal guardian, or next of kin, the decision is made either to withdraw arti fi cial means of support or to proceed to organ retrieval if that was the wish of the patient or is the desire of the family or legal guardian.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  major  goal  when  patients  diagnosed  with  brain  death undergo surgery for multiorgan retrieval is to attempt to optimize oxygenation and perfusion of the organs to be retrieved. It is important to be aware of the various physiologic sequelae of  brain death, because it is useful to direct management of physiologic  parameters  with  the  needs  of  the  organ  recipient, not the donor, in mind. Because of loss of central hemodynamic  regulatory  mechanisms-that  is,  the  presence  of neurogenic  shock-brain-dead  patients  are  o ft en  hypotensive.  Hypovolemia  caused  by  diabetes  insipidus,  third  space losses,  or  drugs  can  contribute  to  hypotension.  Aggressive fl uid resuscitation should be considered, with e ff orts made to avoid hypervolemia, which could lead to pulmonary edema, cardiac  distention,  or  hepatic  congestion.  Vasoconstrictive drugs  should  be  avoided  when  considering  pharmacologic treatment of hypotension. Inotropic agents are preferred for this. Dopamine and dobutamine should be fi rst-line agents for the treatment of hypotension in euvolemic patients, with lowdose epinephrine as a second-line agent. For those in whom the  heart  is  to  be  retrieved,  catecholamine  doses  should  be minimized because of the theoretical risk of catecholamineinduced cardiomyopathy. ECG abnormalities such as ST-segment and T-wave changes, as well as dysrhythmias, can occur. Possible causes include electrolyte abnormalities, loss of vagal nerve function, increased ICP , and cardiac contusion (if death was trauma related). Dysrhythmias should be treated pharmacologically or by electrical pacing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxemia can occur as a result of diminished cardiac output or multiple pulmonary factors such as aspiration, edema, contusion, or atelectasis. Inspired oxygen concentration and ventilatory  parameters  should  be  adjusted  in  an  attempt  to maintain normoxia and normocapnia. Excessive positive endexpiratory pressure should be avoided because of its e ff ect on cardiac output as well as the risk of barotrauma in the setting of possible trauma-related lung injury. Oxygen delivery to tissues should be optimized by treating coagulopathy and anemia with blood products.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes insipidus frequently occurs in brain-dead patients and, if not treated, can lead to hypovolemia, hyperosmolality, and electrolyte abnormalities that could contribute to hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias. Treatment should initially include volume replacement with hypotonic solutions titrated to  volume  status  and  electrolyte  concentrations.  In  severe cases, patients may need inotropic support, and either vasopressin (0.04 to 0.1 units/hr IV) or desmopressin (0.3 mcg/kg IV) to treat the diabetes insipidus. Because of its vasoconstrictive properties, vasopressin use should be minimized to avoid end-organ ischemia. A vasodilator such as nitroprusside may

Because  of  loss  of  temperature-regulatory  mechanisms, brain-dead patients tend to become poikilothermic and may require aggressive measures to avoid hypothermia. Although mild  hypothermia  possibly  provides  some  degree  of  organ protection, it can also result in cardiac dysrhythmias, coagulopathy, and reduced oxygen delivery to tissue, thus causing harm to the organs to be retrieved. A good rule of thumb for the management of patients for organ donation is the rule of 100s: systolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg, urine output greater than 100 mL/hr, Pa o 2 greater than 100 mm Hg, and hemoglobin level greater than 100 g/L.

CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE

Stroke is characterized by sudden neurologic de fi cits resulting from ischemia (88% of cases) or hemorrhage (12% of cases) (Table  10-4).  Ischemic  strokes  are  described  by  the  area  of the brain a ff ected and the etiologic mechanism. Hemorrhagic strokes are classi fi ed as intracerebral (15%) or subarachnoid (85%).

Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of major disability. Th e pathogenesis of stroke di ff ers among ethnic groups. Extracranial carotid artery disease  and  heart  disease-associated  embolism  more  commonly cause ischemic stroke in non-Hispanic whites, whereas intracranial thromboembolic disease is more common in African Americans. Women have lower stroke rates than men at all ages until age 75 years and older. Stroke rates are at their highest a ft er age 75. Overall, stroke-related mortality has decreased over the past several decades, probably because of better control of co-existing diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, and greater awareness of stroke and its risk factors.

Cerebrovascular Anatomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood supply to the brain (20% of cardiac output) is via two pairs of vessels: the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries (Figure 10-5). Th ese vessels join on the inferior surface  of  the  brain  to  form  the  circle  of  Willis,  which,  under ideal  circumstances,  provides  collateral  circulation  to  multiple areas of the brain. Unfortunately, all of the elements of an intact circle of Willis are present in only about a third of people. Only 20% to 25% of people have a functionally normal circle of Willis in which no component is absent or hypoplastic. Each internal carotid artery gives rise to an anterior cerebral artery and continues on to become a middle cerebral artery. Th ese vessels arising from the carotid arteries comprise the anterior circulation and ultimately supply the frontal, parietal,  and  lateral  temporal  lobes;  the  basal  ganglia;  and  most of the internal capsule. Th e vertebral arteries each give rise to a posterior-inferior cerebellar artery before converging at the level of the pons to form the basilar artery. Th e basilar artery generally gives rise to two anterior-inferior and two superior cerebellar arteries before dividing to become the paired posterior cerebral arteries. Vessels that receive their predominant blood supply from this vertebral-basilar system comprise the posterior circulation and typically supply the brainstem, occipital lobes, cerebellum, medial portions of the temporal lobes, and most of the thalamus. Th e anterior and posterior circulations  communicate via the posterior communicating artery,

Acute Ischemic Stroke

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who experience the sudden onset of neurologic dysfunction or describe neurologic signs and symptoms evolving over minutes to hours are most likely experiencing a stroke. A transient ischemic attack is a sudden vascular-related focal neurologic de fi cit that resolves promptly (within 24 hours). A transient  ischemic attack is  not  considered  a  separate  entity but rather evidence of an impending ischemic stroke. Stroke represents a medical emergency, and the prognosis depends on the time elapsed from the onset of symptoms to thrombolytic intervention if thrombosis is the cause of the symptoms. Patients who receive early treatment to restore cerebral perfusion have better outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic hypertension is the most signi fi cant risk factor for acute ischemic stroke, and long-term treatment of systolic or diastolic hypertension dramatically reduces the risk of a fi rst stroke. Cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, excessive alcohol consumption, and increased serum homocysteine concentrations are also associated with increased risk of acute ischemic stroke.

Acute ischemic stroke most likely re fl ects embolism occurring  as  a  result  of  a  cardiac  cause,  for  example,  atrial fi brillation,  ventricular  akinesis  following  myocardial  infarction, dilated  cardiomyopathy,  valvular  heart  disease,  large  vessel atherothromboembolism  (from  atherosclerotic  narrowing, especially at major arterial branch points such as the carotid bifurcation), or small vessel occlusive disease (lacunar infarction). Patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus or systemic hypertension  are  most  likely  to  experience  acute  ischemic stroke resulting from small vessel occlusive disease. Echocardiography is useful for evaluating the presence of anatomic or vascular anomalies that could result in embolization.

Aspirin is o ft en recommended as initial therapy in patients with an acute ischemic stroke and for the prevention of recurrent stroke.  Intravenous  recombinant  tissue  plasminogen  activator  is  used  in  patients  who  meet  speci fi c  eligibility  requirements and in whom treatment can be initiated within 3 hours of the onset of acute symptoms. Direct infusion of thrombolytic drugs (prourokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen

activator) into occluded blood vessels is a potential alternative or adjunctive therapy to intravenous administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Despite advances in the treatment  of  acute  ischemic  stroke,  most  patients  will  have residual neurologic dysfunction. Th e initial stroke severity is a strong predictor of outcome, and early evidence of recovery is a good prognostic sign.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the airway, oxygenation, ventilation, systemic blood pressure, blood glucose concentration, and body temperature  are  part  of  the  overall  medical  management  of acute ischemic stroke. In the most critically ill stroke patients, cerebral edema and increased ICP may complicate the clinical course. Th e expanding infarction may cause focal or diffuse  mass  e ff ects  that  typically  peak  2  to  5  days  following stroke onset. Large hemispheric strokes may be characterized by malignant  middle  cerebral  artery  syndrome, in  which  the edematous infarcted tissue causes compression of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries and results in secondary infarctions.  Similarly,  infarction  of  the  cerebellum  may  result  in basilar artery compression and brainstem ischemia. Mortality rates for both middle cerebral artery syndrome and infarction of the cerebellum approach 80%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  decompression  has  a  role  in  a  small  number  of stroke  patients.  Craniotomy  with  cerebellar  resection  is  a lifesaving  intervention  for  acute  cerebellar  stroke  because it  prevents  secondary  brainstem  and  vascular  compression. Malignant middle cerebral artery syndrome may be amenable to treatment with hemicraniectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory  function  must  be  evaluated  promptly  in  all stroke patients. Ventilatory drive is usually intact except a ft er medullary  or  massive  hemispheric  infarction. Th e  ability  to protect  the  lungs  against  aspiration  may  be  impaired  in  the acute setting, so that endotracheal intubation is necessary. In most patients, however, supplemental oxygen administration without endotracheal intubation is su ffi cient to maintain arterial oxygen saturation at more than 95%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of adequate blood pressure is critically important, because blood fl ow to ischemic regions is dependent on CPP. Systemic hypertension is common at the time of initial stroke presentation, and rapid lowering of blood pressure can impair  CBF  and  worsen  the  ischemic  injury.  Hypertension o ft en gradually decreases during the fi rst few days following an acute stroke. Antihypertensive drug therapy such as small intravenous  doses  of  labetalol  may  be  used  when  necessary to maintain the systemic blood pressure at less than 185/110 mm Hg in an attempt to lessen myocardial work and irritability. Appropriate intravascular volume replacement in patients with acute stroke improves cardiac output and cerebral perfusion.  Hypervolemic  hemodilution  may  be  considered  in an attempt to increase CBF while decreasing blood viscosity without causing a signi fi cant decrease in oxygen delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycemia  appears  to parallel poor  outcomes  in patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke. During periods of  cellular  hypoxia  or  anoxia,  as  occur  with  stroke,  glucose is  metabolized to lactic acid, which results in tissue acidosis and increased tissue  injury.  Normalization  of  blood  glucose concentration is recommended, using insulin when appropriate. Parenteral administration of glucose should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Based  on  animal  data,  hypothermia  may  improve  outcome following acute ischemic stroke as a result of its ability  to  decrease  neuronal  oxygen  demands,  cerebral  edema, and neurotransmitter toxicity. Th ere are few human studies evaluating the e ff ectiveness of hypothermia for the reduction of morbidity and mortality from acute stroke. Use of hypothermia in this  setting  continues  to  be  controversial.  However, it is certain that fever must be avoided in patients with acute stroke. Even a mild increase in body temperature can be deleterious. Normothermia should be maintained in acute ischemic stroke patients using antipyretics or cooling blankets as necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylaxis  to  prevent  deep  vein  thrombosis  is  initiated early in the treatment of patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke. Heparin 5000 units SC every 12 hours is the most common intervention. Patients with acute hemorrhage who cannot be given heparin are treated with pneumatic compression stockings.

Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  hemorrhagic  stroke  results  from  either  intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intracerebral  hemorrhage  is  four  times  more  likely  than ischemic  stroke  to  cause  death.  It  is  notably  a  problem  in African  Americans.  Acute  hemorrhagic  stroke  cannot  be reliably distinguished from ischemic stroke based on clinical  criteria  alone.  A  noncontrast  CT  evaluation  is  needed to  detect  the  presence  of  bleeding. Th e  estimated  volume of extravasated blood and the level of consciousness are the two most reliable predictors of outcome. Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage o ft en deteriorate clinically as cerebral edema  worsens  during  the fi rst  24  to  48  hours  following the acute bleed. Late hematoma evacuation is ine ff ective in decreasing mortality. Th e e ffi cacy of earlier surgical evacuation of a hematoma to decrease ischemic injury and edema to  the  surrounding  tissue  remains  unclear.  Intravenous administration  of  recombinant  activated  factor  VII  within 4 hours of onset of symptoms has been shown not only to decrease hematoma volume, but possibly to improve clinical outcome. Intraventricular hemorrhage is a particularly ominous form of intracranial hemorrhage because the blood will occlude CSF drainage. Prompt ventricular drainage should be performed to treat any signs of hydrocephalus. Sedation (with propofol infusion, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines), with  or  without  drug-induced  skeletal  muscle  paralysis,  is o ft en  helpful  in  managing  patients  who  require  endotracheal  intubation.  An  ICP  monitor  is  o ft en  recommended for  patients  who  are  obtunded.  Blood  pressure  management in patients who experience intracerebral hemorrhage is  controversial  because  there  is  concern  about  decreasing CPP in those with increased ICP.

SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE AND INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage most  commonly results  from  rupture  of  an  intracranial  aneurysm.  Various pathologic conditions such as hypertension, coarctation of the aorta, polycystic kidney disease, fi bromuscular dysplasia, and the occurrence of cerebral aneurysms in fi rst-degree relatives are associated with the presence of cerebral aneurysms. Th e risk of aneurysm rupture depends on the size of the aneurysm, with a 6% risk of rupture during the fi rst year in aneurysms of  at  least  25  mm  in  diameter.  Other  risk  factors  for  rupture include hypertension, cigarette smoking, cocaine abuse, female sex, and use of oral contraceptives.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may also have unruptured aneurysms. A common presentation of an unruptured aneurysm is the development of a new focal neurologic de fi cit. Th e cause of this new de fi -cit may be either a mass e ff ect from an expanding aneurysm that compresses normal neurologic structures or small emboli to the distal cerebral circulation from a thrombus contained within  the  aneurysm.  Headache  caused  by  mass  e ff ect  can occur. New-onset seizures can indicate an unruptured aneurysm and are thought to result from the formation of a glial scar (gliosis) in brain parenchyma adjacent to the aneurysm. Unruptured aneurysms may also be identi fi ed incidentally on cerebral imaging performed for unrelated reasons. Th e annual risk of rupture of an aneurysm depends on its diameter. For aneurysms smaller than 10 mm in diameter, the annual risk of rupture is approximately 0.05%, and for those larger than 10  mm  in  diameter,  annual  rupture  risk  is  1%.  Aneurysm diameter is not static; thus, although smaller aneurysms may be  followed  with  serial  imaging,  larger  aneurysms  are  o ft en considered for surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis  of  subarachnoid  hemorrhage  is  based  on clinical symptoms ("worst headache of my life") and CT demonstration of subarachnoid blood. MRI is not as sensitive as CT for detecting acute hemorrhage, especially with thin layers  of  subarachnoid  blood,  although  this  technique  may  be useful  for  demonstrating  subacute  or  chronic  subarachnoid hemorrhage or infarction a ft er CT fi ndings have returned to normal.  In  addition  to  severe  headache,  the  rapid  onset  of photophobia, sti ff neck, decreased level of consciousness, and focal  neurologic  changes  suggest  subarachnoid  hemorrhage. Prompt establishment of the diagnosis followed by treatment of the aneurysm can decrease morbidity and mortality. Two of the most common methods used to grade the severity of subarachnoid  hemorrhage  are  the  Hunt  and  Hess  classi fi cation and  the  World  Federation  of  Neurologic  Surgeons  grading system (Table 10-6). Th ese grading systems are useful because they  help  predict  severity  and  outcome  and  can  be  used  as metrics to evaluate the e ffi cacy of various therapies.

a ft er  the  hemorrhage  and  have  been  attributed  to  catecholamine release. Th is same catecholamine release may result in cardiac dysrhythmias and may also be responsible for producing  pulmonary  edema.  Echocardiography  has  demonstrated temporary  depression  of  myocardial  contractility,  independent  of  coronary  artery  disease,  in  patients  with  subarachnoid  hemorrhage.  Of  note,  apical  cardiac  function  may  be preserved, a phenomenon attributed to the paucity of sympathetic innervation at the cardiac apex.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage involves localizing the aneurysm with conventional or magnetic resonance angiography  and  surgically  excluding  the  aneurysmal  sac  from the intracranial circulation while preserving its parent artery. Outcome  is  optimal  when  surgical  treatment  is  performed within the fi rst 72 hours a ft er bleeding. Placing a clip across the neck of the intracranial aneurysm is the most de fi nitive surgical treatment. For larger or fusiform aneurysms that lack a de fi nitive neck, surgical options include wrapping the exterior of the aneurysm or aneurysm trapping. In aneurysm trapping a clip is placed on the artery both proximal and distal to the aneurysm a ft er the artery distal to the aneurysm has been bypassed, usually by means of the super fi cial temporal artery. Endovascular  techniques  that  involve  placing  so ft metallic coils  in  the  lumen  of  an  aneurysm may be an alternative to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
surgical therapy but may not be an option for the treatment of all aneurysms, speci fi cally those with a large neck or those that lack a neck. Because of the immense morbidity and mortality associated with surgical treatment of basilar tip aneurysms, endovascular treatment is preferred in this situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is o ft en delayed in patients with severe symptoms such as coma. In these patients, other options, including interventional radiographic procedures, may be used. Anticonvulsants are administered should seizure activity occur. Systemic blood pressure is controlled, in recognition that hypertension increases  the  risk  of  rebleeding.  Hydrocephalus  is  common a ft er subarachnoid hemorrhage and is treated with ventricular drainage. Any change in mental status must be promptly evaluated by CT to look for signs of rebleeding or hydrocephalus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Following subarachnoid hemorrhage with or without surgical or endovascular treatment of the aneurysm, an important goal is prevention of vasospasm (intracranial arterial narrowing) and its consequences. Development of vasospasm can be triggered by many mechanisms, the most important of which is the contact of free hemoglobin with the abluminal surface of cerebral arteries. Not surprisingly, the incidence and severity of vasospasm correlate with the amount of subarachnoid blood seen on CT. Vasospasm typically occurs 3 to 15 days a ft er subarachnoid hemorrhage. For this reason, daily transcranial Doppler ultrasonographic examinations may be performed to detect vasospasm. If vasospasm is identi fi ed, triple H therapy ( h ypertension, h ypervolemia, passive h emodilution) is initiated. Colloid and crystalloid therapy can be used, and pressor support may be needed. Administration of nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, has been shown to improve outcome when initiated on the fi rst day and continued for 21 days a ft er subarachnoid hemorrhage, which presumably re fl ects a protective e ff ect from the consequences of vasospasm. Th is bene fi t  of  nimodipine  occurs  without  angiographic  evidence  of vessel luminal enlargement. Cerebral angiographic techniques can also be employed to dilate vasospastic arteries mechanically (via balloons) or chemically (via intraarterial administration of papaverine).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e goals of anesthesia during intracranial aneurysm surgery are  to  limit  the  risk  of  aneurysm  rupture,  prevent  cerebral ischemia, and facilitate surgical exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e goal during the induction of anesthesia is to prevent any increase in the transmural pressure of the aneurysmal sac, which  could  increase  the  risk  of  aneurysm  rupture. Th erefore,  signi fi cant  increases  in  systemic  blood  pressure  must be avoided. In those patients with cerebral aneurysms without increased ICP and in those with unruptured aneurysms, it  is  reasonable  to  avoid  excessive decreases in  ICP  before dural opening so as not to decrease the tamponading force on the external surface of the aneurysm. Hyperventilation then should  be  avoided.  Patients  who  have  increased  ICP  before surgery present a challenge because they may not tolerate a decrease in MAP to protect against aneurysm rupture without  developing  cerebral  ischemia.  Patients  with  vasospasm also present a quandary because systemic hypertension may improve fl ow through vasospastic vessels but may increase the risk  of  aneurysm  rebleeding.  Aneurysm clipping during the period in which the patient is at high risk of vasospasm is associated  with  increased  mortality. Th erefore,  in  patients  with vasospasm who require anesthetic care, CPP should be kept elevated to maintain blood fl ow through vasospastic arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  of  the  blood  pressure  via  an  intraarterial catheter  is  desirable  to  ensure  the  adequacy  of  blood  pressure control during direct laryngoscopy and at other times of noxious  stimulation.  Prophylaxis  against  signi fi cant  hypertension during direct laryngoscopy may be accomplished by administration of esmolol, lidocaine, propofol, barbiturates, or short-acting opioids. Loss of consciousness is achieved with intravenous administration of thiopental, propofol, or etomidate.  Nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs  are most o ft en selected to facilitate endotracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Placement of a CVP catheter may be useful because of the likely presence of hypovolemia, the large intraoperative fl uid shi ft s associated with osmotic and loop diuretics, the potential for  intraoperative  aneurysm  rupture,  and  the  need  for fl uid resuscitation.  A  pulmonary  artery  catheter  or  transesophageal echocardiography may be considered when patients have known cardiac disease. Electrophysiologic monitoring (EEG, somatosensory or motor-evoked potentials) may be helpful to identify  intraoperative  cerebral  ischemia,  but  its  complexity during this surgery limits its routine use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goals  of  anesthesia  maintenance  include  providing  a depth of anesthesia appropriate to the level of surgical stimulation,  facilitating  surgical  exposure  through  optimal brain relaxation, maintaining CPP, reducing transmural pressure in the aneurysm during clipping of the aneurysm, and prompt awakening of the patient at the end of the procedure to permit immediate neurologic assessment. Drugs, fl uid, and blood must be immediately available to manage resuscitation should the aneurysm rupture intraoperatively. Th e risk of intraoperative rupture is approximately 7%, and rupture most commonly occurs during the late stages of surgical dissection. Anesthetic management of rupture consists of aggressive volume resuscitation to maintain normovolemia combined with controlled hypotension  (e.g.,  with  nitroprusside)  to  temporarily  limit hemorrhage and permit the neurosurgeon to gain control of the aneurysm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If temporary clipping of the feeding vessel is used to gain control of a ruptured aneurysm, the systemic blood pressure can be returned to normal or even slightly elevated levels to improve collateral blood fl ow while the vessel is obstructed by the occlusion clip.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia is typically maintained with volatile anesthetics (iso fl urane, des fl urane, sevo fl urane) with or without the addition of nitrous oxide, which may be supplemented with intermittent  (fentanyl)  or  continuous  (remifentanil)  infusion  of opioids. Alternatively, a total intravenous anesthetic technique (propofol  and  short-acting  opioid)  can  be  used.  Cerebral vasoconstricting anesthetics such as barbiturates and propofol help reduce brain volume and, in the case of barbiturates and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
possibly propofol, may provide some degree of neuronal protection against ischemia. Muscle paralysis is critical to prevent movement during aneurysm clipping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In view of the current trend toward earlier surgical intervention in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm, it is likely that many patients will have brain edema. Th erefore, optimization of brain relaxation is an important part of anesthetic maintenance, and combinations of lumbar CSF drainage, mild hyperventilation, administration of  loop  and/or  osmotic  diuretics,  and  proper  positioning  to facilitate cerebral venous drainage can help to optimize surgical exposure. Intraoperative fl uid administration is guided by blood  loss,  urine  output,  and  measurement  of  cardiac fi lling pressures. Normovolemia is the goal, which is best achieved by intravenous  administration  of  balanced  salt  solutions.  Intravenous  solutions  containing  glucose  are not recommended because of fear of exacerbating neuronal injury. Current best evidence suggests no bene fi t to intraoperative hypothermia in patients  undergoing aneurysm clipping. However, hyperthermia must be avoided because it increases CMRO 2 and CBV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditionally,  drug-induced  controlled  hypotension  has been used to decrease transmural pressure in the aneurysm and  thereby  decrease  the  risk  of  aneurysm  rupture  during microscopic  isolation  and  clipping.  Controlled  hypotension is used less o ft en now than before because of concerns about the  impairment of autoregulation that follows subarachnoid hemorrhage, unpredictable cerebrovascular responses to drug-induced  hypotension,  and  the  risk  of  global  ischemia. As an alternative to drug-induced hypotension, regional controlled hypotension produced by placing a vascular clamp on the  parent  artery  supplying  the  aneurysm  provides  protection against aneurysm rupture without incurring the risk of global cerebral ischemia. Ideally, temporary occlusion of the parent artery does not exceed 10 minutes. If longer periods of occlusion are needed, the administration of metabolism-suppressing anesthetics, particularly barbiturates, might provide protection against regional cerebral ischemia and infarction. However, the utility and e ffi cacy of this intervention remains controversial. During temporary clamping of the feeding vessel, systemic blood pressure should be maintained toward the higher end of the normal blood pressure range to encourage collateral circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At  the  conclusion  of  the  surgical  procedure,  prompt emergence  from  anesthesia  is  desirable  to  facilitate  immediate neurologic evaluation of the patient. Th e use of shortacting  inhaled  and  intravenous  anesthetic  drugs  makes prompt awakening more likely. However, incremental doses of  antihypertensive  drugs  such  as  labetalol  or  esmolol  may be  needed  as  the  patient  emerges  from  anesthesia.  Lidocaine may be administered intravenously to suppress airway re fl exes  and  the  response  to  the  presence  of  the  endotracheal tube. Tracheal extubation immediately a ft er surgery is acceptable and encouraged in patients who are awake with adequate spontaneous ventilation and protective upper airway  re fl exes.  Patients  who  were  obtunded  preoperatively are  likely  to  require  continued  intubation  and  mechanical ventilation  during  the  postoperative  period.  Patients  who experience  intraoperative  rupture  of  an  intracranial  aneurysm may recover slowly and bene fi t from postoperative airway and ventilatory support.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic status is assessed at frequent intervals in the postanesthesia care unit or intensive care unit. Patients may manifest delayed emergence from anesthesia or focal neurologic de fi cits a ft er  intracranial  aneurysm  resection,  and  it  may  be  di ffi cult to  distinguish  between  drug-induced  causes  (e.g.,  di ff erential awakening) and surgical causes (e.g.,  ischemic  or  mechanical brain injury). Th e appearance of a new focal de fi cit should raise suspicion of a surgical cause, since anesthetic drugs would be expected to cause primarily global e ff ects. Inequality of pupils that  was  not  present  preoperatively  is  also  likely  to  re fl ect  a surgical  event.  CT  or  angiography  may  be  necessary  if  the patient does not awaken promptly. Successful surgical therapy may be followed by delayed neurologic de fi cits (hours to days later) resulting from cerebral vasospasm. Th is, in turn, requires aggressive therapy, including hypertension, hypervolemia, passive hemodilution, or invasive radiographic interventions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthetic goals for patients undergoing angiographically guided cerebral aneurysm coil placement are similar to those for patients undergoing aneurysm clip placement. Typically, coil placement procedures are performed using sedation or general anesthesia. Th e principal advantage of sedation is that intraprocedural neurologic assessment can be performed. However, patient movement during the procedure poses the risk of aneurysm rupture or coil dislodgment resulting in coil embolization. For this reason, general anesthesia is preferred during coil placement. Anesthetic goals include ICP control, maintenance  of  adequate  cerebral  perfusion  without  excessive  hypertension, and facilitation of a rapid postprocedural assessment of neurologic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arteriovenous Malformation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal collections of blood vessels in which multiple direct arterial-to-venous connections exist without intervening capillaries. Th ere is also no neural tissue within the nidus. AVMs typically represent highfl ow, low-resistance shunts, with vascular intramural pressure being less than systemic arterial pressure. Th us,  rupture  does not  appear  to  be  clinically  associated  with  acute  or  chronic hypertension. Th ese malformations are believed to be congenital and commonly present in adulthood as either hemorrhage or new-onset seizures. Th e exact cause of AVM-associated seizures is unknown but has been attributed to either steal (e.g., shunting  of  blood  away  from  normal  brain  tissue  toward  the  lowresistance AVM) or gliosis due to hemosiderin deposits from previous hemorrhage. Most AVMs are supratentorial. AVMs are associated with a 4% to 10% incidence of cerebral aneurysm. AVMs presenting in the neonatal or childhood period usually involve  the  vein  of  Galen,  and  presenting  symptoms  include hydrocephalus or macrocephaly and prominence of forehead veins, as well as evidence of a high-output cardiac state or heart failure. Diagnosis is made by either MRI or angiography.

Before the advent of focused, high-dose radiation and selective cerebral angiography, treatment of AVMs was associated with a high morbidity and mortality. Currently, treatment may involve  a  combination  of  surgical  resection,  highly  focused (Gamma Knife) irradiation,  and/or  angiographically  guided embolization.  With  smaller  AVMs,  patients  may  respond completely to radiation or embolization therapy. With larger AVMs, however,  these  two  techniques  are  typically  used  as adjunctive therapy before surgery to decrease the size of the AVM nidus and reduce both the complexity and risks of surgery. Prognosis and perioperative outcome can be estimated using the Spetzler-Martin AVM grading system, which classifi es the AVM based on three features (Table 10-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other types  of  intracranial  AVMs  include  venous  angiomas, cavernous angiomas, capillary telangiectasias, and arteriovenous fi stulas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VENOUS ANGIOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous angiomas or malformations consist of tu ft s  of  veins. O ft en,  they  are  occult  lesions  found  during  cerebral  angiography or MRI performed to evaluate other disease states. Rarely will a venous angioma present as either hemorrhage or new-onset seizures. Th ese are lowfl ow, low-pressure lesions and usually contain intervening brain parenchyma within the nidus; they are therefore treated only if bleeding or intractable seizures occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CAVERNOUS ANGIOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cavernous  angiomas,  also  known  as cavernous  hemangiomas or cavernomas, are benign lesions consisting of vascular channels without large feeding arteries or large veins. Brain parenchyma is not found within the nidus of the lesion. Th ese lowfl ow,  well-circumscribed  lesions  o ft en  present  as  newonset seizures but occasionally manifest as hemorrhage. Th ey may be seen on CT or MRI scans and typically appear as a fl ow void on cerebral angiographs. Treatment involves surgical resection of symptomatic lesions. Th ey do not respond to irradiation nor are they amenable to embolization, since they are angiographically silent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CAPILLARY TELANGIECTASIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Capillary telangiectasias are lowfl ow, enlarged capillaries and are probably one of the least understood vascular lesions in the central nervous system. Th ey are angiographically silent and di ffi cult to diagnose antemortem. Th e risk of hemorrhage is low except for lesions occurring in the brainstem. Th ey are o ft en found incidentally at autopsy and are o ft en associated with other disorders, including Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome and Sturge-Weber syndrome. Th ese lesions are not treatable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ARTERIOVENOUS FISTULA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arteriovenous fi stulas  are  direct  communications  between arteries  and  veins  without  an  intervening  nidus  of  smaller blood vessels. Th ey commonly occur between meningeal vessels within the dura mater or between the carotid artery and venous sinuses  within  the  cavernous  sinus.  Some  arteriovenous fi stulas are thought to occur spontaneously. Many others are associated with a previous traumatic injury or, in the case of carotid-cavernous fi stulas, with previous (presumably silent) rupture of an intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm. Dural arteriovenous fi stulas commonly present with pulsatile tinnitus  or  headache.  An  occipital  bruit  can  be  appreciated in 24% of these cases since the occipital artery is a common arterial feeder of an arteriovenous fi stula. Treatment options include angiographically guided embolization or surgical ligation. Surgical treatment is associated with a risk of rapid and signi fi cant blood loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with carotid-cavernous arteriovenous fi stulas o ft en have orbital or retro-orbital pain, arterialization of the conjunctiva,  or  visual  changes.  Diagnosis  is  made  by  magnetic resonance or conventional angiography. Embolization is usually an e ff ective treatment option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical resection of lowfl ow vascular malformations such as venous angiomas and cavernous angiomas is generally associated  with  fewer  intraoperative  and  postoperative  complications  than  resection  of  highfl ow vascular  lesions  such  as AVMs and arteriovenous fi stulas. AVMs o ft en involve multiple feeding and draining vessels, unlike arteriovenous fi stulas,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
240

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
which involve a single feeding and a single draining vessel, so surgical resection of AVMs can pose great clinical challenges during resection and postoperative care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperatively,  a  patient  with  an  intracranial  vascular malformation  should  be  evaluated  for  evidence  of  cerebral ischemia or increased ICP. Th e  nature  of  the  malformation, including size, location, mechanism of venous drainage, presence of associated aneurysms, and any prior treatment, should be elicited, since these factors may help in anticipating perioperative complications. Medications, including antiepileptic drugs if the patient has a concurrent seizure disorder, should be administered preoperatively. Patients who underwent preoperative  angiography  may  experience fl uid  and  electrolyte abnormalities secondary to the administration of hypertonic contrast material.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to standard monitoring, an intraarterial catheter  may  be  placed  before  induction  of  anesthesia.  Blood pressure  control  throughout  anesthesia,  surgery,  and  the postoperative period is critical, since hypotension may result in  ischemia  in  hypoperfused  areas  and  hypertension  may increase the risk of rupture of an associated aneurysm, exacerbate intraoperative bleeding, or worsen intracranial hypertension. For embolization or surgical resection of a vascular malformation in an eloquent region of brain, monitored anesthesia care is an attractive option. In cases requiring general anesthesia, a hemodynamically stable induction is desirable, although  AVMs-unlike  cerebral  aneurysms-are  unlikely to hemorrhage during anesthesia induction, even with moderate  increases  in  blood  pressure. Th iopental,  propofol,  and etomidate are all e ff ective and safe induction agents. Muscle relaxation  should  be  accomplished  with  a  nondepolarizing neuromuscular  blocking  agent,  since  succinylcholine  may induce further increases in ICP as well as cause hyperkalemia if motor de fi cits are present. Techniques to blunt the hemodynamic responses to stimulating events such as laryngoscopy, pinion  placement,  and  incision  should  be  used  as  needed. Th ese may include the administration of lidocaine, esmolol, or nitroprusside or deepening of the anesthetic state with either higher  concentrations  of  volatile  anesthetics,  small  doses  of intravenous anesthetics, short-acting opioids, or intravenous lidocaine.

Given the  risk  of  severe  and  rapid intraoperative hemorrhage, especially with AVMs and arteriovenous fi stulas, adequate intravenous access is essential. Further, central venous access may be useful in some cases to monitor volume status or to allow rapid administration of large volumes of fl uids or blood products. Monitoring via a pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography can be useful in patients with cardiac disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  cases  of  large  or  highfl ow  vascular  malformations, frequent  communication  with  the  surgeon  is  of  paramount importance, because impressions of the lesions and the surgical and anesthetic requirements for safe resection may change during the operation. Th is  is  due,  in  part,  to  somewhat  less than de fi nitive  imaging assessment preoperatively or changing surgical requirements during various stages of resection of a large, complex lesion. Hemodynamic stability, optimal surgical conditions, and rapid emergence from anesthesia at the end of surgery are appropriate goals when selecting anesthetic maintenance medications. Both intravenous and volatile anesthetic-based techniques are appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotonic  and  glucose-containing  solutions  should  be avoided, since the former can exacerbate cerebral edema and the  latter  can  worsen  the  outcome  of  neurologic  ischemia. Mild hyperventilation (Pa co 2 of  30  to  35  mm Hg) will help facilitate  surgical  exposure.  Lumbar  CSF  drainage  may  also help to decrease intracranial volume and improve exposure. Cerebral  edema  can  be  a  signi fi cant  problem  during  AVM treatment. Because AVMs represent highfl ow, low-resistance vascular  lesions,  as  arterial  feeders  are  ligated  during  resection or embolization, blood fl ow is directed toward the surrounding brain tissue. Th ese surrounding blood vessels may have experienced a chronic reduction in vascular resistance to compete with the AVM, so development of cerebral edema is quite possible. Treatment of cerebral edema may include moderate hyperventilation as a temporizing measure, administration of diuretics such as mannitol and furosemide, and blood pressure reduction. In extreme cases, high-dose barbiturate or propofol anesthesia or temporary craniectomy with postoperative ventilatory support may be useful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  patients  respond  quite  well  to  surgical  resection, and emergence from anesthesia should be smooth and rapid. Agents such as β -adrenergic antagonists as well as lidocaine or nitroprusside can be used to control short-term hypertension during emergence. Prompt neurologic assessment should follow emergence.

Moyamoya Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressive stenosis of intracranial vessels with the secondary development of an anastomotic capillary network is the hallmark of moyamoya disease. Moyamoya is  the  Japanese term for "pu ff of smoke" and refers to the angiographic fi nding of a cluster of small abnormal blood vessels. Th ere seems to be a  familial  tendency  toward  the  development  of  this  disease, but  it  may  be  seen  following  head  trauma  or  in  association with other disorders such as neuro fi bromatosis, tuberous sclerosis,  and fi bromuscular  dysplasia.  A ff ected  arteries  have  a thickened intima and a thin media. Since similar pathologic fi ndings may be found in other organs, central nervous system abnormalities  may  be  manifestations  of  a  systemic  disease. Intracranial  aneurysms  occur  with  increased  frequency  in those with moyamoya disease. Symptoms of ischemia, such as transient ischemic attacks and cerebral infarcts, are common initial fi ndings  in  children,  whereas  hemorrhagic  complications are usually the presenting symptoms in adults. Th e diagnosis is typically made by conventional or magnetic resonance angiography, which demonstrates a cluster of small abnormal blood vessels. Conventional MRI and CT imaging will show a tissue void or hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical treatment is  aimed  at  decreasing  ischemic  symptoms and usually consists of a combination of vasodilators and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anticoagulants. Surgical options include direct anastomosis of the super fi cial temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery (also known as an extracranial-intracranial bypass ) or other indirect revascularization  procedures,  which  may  be  combined  with an  extracranial-intracranial  bypass. Th ese  techniques  include laying the temporalis muscle directly on the brain surface and suturing the super fi cial temporal artery to the dura mater. Even with treatment, the overall prognosis is not good. Only about 58% of patients ever attain normal neurologic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative assessment of the patient with moyamoya disease should involve documentation of preexisting neurologic de fi -cits,  a  history  of  hemorrhage, or the concurrent presence of an intracranial aneurysm. Anticoagulant or antiplatelet drug therapy should be discontinued, if possible, to avoid bleeding complications intraoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goals  of  induction  and  maintenance  of  anesthesia include (1) ensuring hemodynamic stability, because hypotension could lead to ischemia in the distribution of the abnormal vessels  and  hypertension  may  cause  hemorrhagic  complications;  (2)  avoiding  factors  that  lead  to  cerebral  or  peripheral vasoconstriction, such as hypocapnia or phenylephrine, which can compromise blood fl ow in the feeding or recipient vessels; and (3) facilitating a rapid emergence from anesthesia so that neurologic function can be assessed. In addition to standard monitoring, intraarterial catheterization is essential to rapidly assess changes in blood pressure. If possible, this should be done before induction of anesthesia to help ensure a hemodynamically stable induction sequence. Central venous catheterization is not essential, but can be useful to guide fl uid management and  can  also  provide  access  for  administering  vasoactive agents  or  blood  products.  Any  intravenous  induction  agent can be used safely. Inhalational induction with sevo fl urane is an  option  for  children.  Succinylcholine  should  be  used  with caution in patients with preexisting neurologic de fi cits resulting  from  the  risk  of  hyperkalemia.  Hemodynamic  responses to stimulating events should be blunted. A volatile anestheticbased technique may have the theoretical advantage of enhancing cerebral vasodilation. Excessive hyperventilation should be avoided because of its cerebral vasoconstrictive e ff ect. Hypovolemia should be treated with colloid or crystalloid solutions. Dopamine and ephedrine are reasonable options for the pharmacologic treatment of hypotension because they will avoid the adverse e ff ects on the cerebral vasculature that can result from the use of a pure vasoconstrictor. Anemia should be avoided to prevent ischemia in already compromised brain regions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  complications  include  stroke,  seizure,  and hemorrhage. Any of these may present as delayed awakening or a new neurologic de fi cit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of disability and death in young adults in the United States. Brain injury may result from both closed head injury and penetrating injuries caused by bullets or other foreign objects. Associated injuries, including cervical spine injury and thoracoabdominal trauma, frequently accompany acute head injury. Brain injury can be further exacerbated by systemic conditions related to trauma, including hypotension and hypoxia related to excessive bleeding, pulmonary contusion, aspiration, or adult respiratory distress syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial  management  of  patients  with  acute  head  injury includes immobilization of the cervical spine, establishment of  a  patent  airway,  protection  of  the  lungs  from  aspiration of  gastric  contents,  and  maintenance  of  brain  perfusion  by treatment of hypotension. Th e most useful diagnostic procedure, in terms of simplicity and rapidity, is CT, which should be performed as soon as possible. CT has greatly facilitated identi fi cation of epidural or subdural hematomas. Routine CT may not be needed in patients with minor head trauma who meet the following criteria: no headache or vomiting, younger than 60 years of age, no intoxication, no de fi cits in short-term memory, no physical evidence of trauma above the clavicles, and no seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  not  unusual  for  patients  with  traumatic  brain  injury who  initially  are  in  stable  condition  and  awake  or  in  light coma  to  deteriorate  suddenly.  Delayed  hematoma  formation or cerebral edema is o ft en responsible for these changes. Uncontrolled brain swelling that is not responding to conventional management may also cause sudden neurologic deterioration. Delayed secondary injury at the cellular level is an important contributor to brain swelling and subsequent irreversible brain damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Glasgow Coma Scale provides a reproducible method for assessing the seriousness of brain injury and for following neurologic status (see Table 10-1). Head injury patients with scores of less than 8 are by de fi nition in coma, and approximately 50% of these patients die or remain in vegetative states. Th e type of head injury and patient age are important determinants of outcome when Glasgow Coma Scale scores are low. For example, patients with acute subdural hematoma have a poorer prognosis than do patients with di ff use brain contusion injury.  Mortality  in  children  with  severe  head  injury  is lower than that in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative management of patients with acute head trauma must consider the risks of ongoing injury to the brain as well as co-existing injuries a ff ecting organs and structures other than the brain. CBF is usually initially reduced and then gradually increases with time. Factors contributing to poor outcome in head injury patients are increased ICP and MAPs of less than 70 mm Hg. Normal autoregulation of CBF is o ft en impaired in  patients  with  acute  head  injury,  but  carbon  dioxide  reactivity  is  usually  preserved.  Control  of  increased  ICP  with mannitol or furosemide is indicated, and in some patients craniectomy may be necessary. Hyperventilation, although e ff ective  in  controlling  ICP ,  may  contribute  to  cerebral  ischemia in patients with head injury, and for this reason, the common

<!-- PAGE=? -->
242

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
recommendation  is  to avoid  hyperventilation as  a  routine treatment. Barbiturate coma may be useful in some patients to  control  intracranial  hypertension  when  other  measures have failed. In adults, induced mild hypothermia in patients with acute head injury has not been shown to improve outcome. Administration of hypertonic saline and mannitol may decrease brain volume. Associated lung injuries may impair oxygenation and ventilation in these patients and necessitate mechanical  ventilation.  Neurogenic  pulmonary  edema  may also  contribute  to  acute  pulmonary  dysfunction. Th e  exact mechanism  of  neurogenic  pulmonary  edema  is  unknown, but it may be related to hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system resulting in alterations in Starling forces in the lung that ultimately result in pulmonary edema. Coagulopathy occurs in head injury patients and may be enhanced by hypothermia  and  the  need  for  massive  blood  transfusion. Disseminated intravascular  coagulation  can  occur  following severe head injury and is perhaps related to the release of brain thromboplastin into the systemic circulation. Brain thromboplastin is known to activate the coagulation cascade. Replacement of clotting factors may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with traumatic brain injury may require anesthesia for neurosurgical interventions such as hematoma drainage, decompressive  craniectomy  for  cerebral  edema,  or  spinal stabilization. Anesthesia may also be required for the treatment  of  a  variety  of  nonneurologic  problems  such  as  the repair  of  limb  fractures  and  intraabdominal  injuries.  Management of anesthesia must include e ff orts to optimize CPP, minimize  the  occurrence  of  cerebral  ischemia,  and  avoid drugs and techniques that could increase ICP. CPP should be maintained above 70 mm Hg if possible, and hyperventilation  should not be  used  unless  it  is  needed  as  a  temporizing  measure  to  control  ICP .  During  surgical  evacuation of  acute  epidural  or  subdural  hematomas,  systemic  blood pressure  may  decrease  precipitously  at  the  time  of  surgical decompression and require aggressive management. Patients with  severe  head  injury  may  experience  impaired  oxygenation  and  ventilation  that  complicates  management  during the  intraoperative  period.  Adequate fl uid  resuscitation  and replacement are important. Hypertonic crystalloid solutions, such as 3% saline, increase the plasma osmotic pressure and thus remove water from the brain's interstitial space. Hypotonic crystalloid solutions are avoided because they decrease plasma osmotic pressure and increase cerebral edema. Glucose-containing solutions must be avoided unless speci fi cally indicated, such as for the treatment of laboratory-diagnosed hypoglycemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  in  hemodynamically  stable  condition,  induction of anesthesia with intravenous induction drugs and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is acceptable. Fiberoptically guided intubation or tracheostomy should be considered in patients for  whom  there  is  concern  either  that  tracheal  intubation via direct laryngoscopy cannot be performed safely or that a neurologic de fi cit  may  be  further  exacerbated  (e.g.,  in  cases of cervical spine fracture) and in patients who already show evidence  of  airway  compromise.  In  moribund  patients,  the establishment of a safe and e ff ective airway takes priority over concerns  about  anesthetic  drug  selection,  since  drugs  may not be needed. One must be aware of the possibility of hidden extracranial injuries (e.g., bone fractures, pneumothorax) that may lead to problems such as extensive blood loss or perturbations in ventilation and circulation. Maintenance of anesthesia o ft en includes continuous infusions of intravenous drugs or  low-dose  volatile  anesthetics  with  the  goal  of  optimizing CPP and preventing increases in ICP . Nitrous oxide should be avoided because of the risk of pneumocephalus and concern for nonneurologic injuries such as pneumothorax. Low-dose sevo fl urane may be desirable because of its relatively minimal impairment of cerebral autoregulation, although low-dose isofl urane is also a good choice. If acute brain swelling develops, correctable  causes  such  as  hypercapnia,  arterial  hypoxemia, hypertension, and venous obstruction must be considered and corrected  if  present.  Intraarterial  monitoring  of  blood  pressure is very useful, but time constraints may limit the use of CVP or pulmonary artery catheter monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE PERIOD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During the postoperative  period,  it  is  common  to  maintain skeletal  muscle paralysis to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Continuous monitoring of ICP is also useful in many patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematoma formation can result from head trauma. Typically, four  major  types  of  intracranial  hematomas  are  described based on their location: epidural, subarachnoid, subdural, and intraparenchymal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EPIDURAL HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural  hematoma  results  from  arterial  bleeding  into  the space between the skull and the dura. Th e cause is usually a tear  in  a  meningeal  artery,  and  this  may  be  associated  with a  skull  fracture.  Classically,  patients  experience  loss  of  consciousness  in  association  with  the  head  injury,  followed  by return of consciousness and a variable lucid period. Hemiparesis, mydriasis, and bradycardia then suddenly develop a few hours  a ft er  the  head  injury,  re fl ecting  uncal  herniation  and brainstem compression. If an epidural hematoma is suspected, treatment entails prompt drainage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRAUMATIC SUBARACHNOID HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood in the subarachnoid space most commonly follows rupture of an intracranial aneurysm. However, it can also be seen a ft er trauma and is usually caused by bleeding from cortical blood vessels. It has been found in up to 40% of patients who have moderate or severe head injury. Th ese lesions can evolve over  time  because  of  further  bleeding.  Like  subarachnoid

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 10 DISEASES AFFECTING THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hemorrhage associated with aneurysm rupture, these hematomas  are  also  associated  with  the  development  of  cerebral vasospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SUBDURAL HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subdural  hematoma  results  from  laceration  or  tearing  of bridging  veins  that  bleed  into  the  space  between  the  dura and arachnoid. Examination of CSF reveals clear fl uid, since subdural  blood  does  not  typically  have  access  to  the  subarachnoid  CSF.  Diagnosis  of  a  subdural  hematoma  is  confi rmed by CT. Head trauma is the most common cause of a subdural hematoma. Patients may view the causative head trauma as trivial or may even have forgotten it. Th is presentation is especially prevalent in elderly patients. Occasionally, subdural  hematoma  formation  is  spontaneous,  such  as  in patients receiving hemodialysis or those being treated with anticoagulants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of a subdural hematoma characteristically evolve gradually over several days (in contrast to epidural hematomas) because the hematoma is due to slow venous bleeding. Headache is a universal complaint. Drowsiness and obtundation are characteristic fi ndings, but the magnitude of these changes may fl uctuate from hour to hour. Lateralizing neurologic signs eventually occur, manifesting as hemiparesis, hemianopsia, or language disturbances. Elderly patients may have unexplained progressive dementia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conservative  medical  management  of  subdural  hematomas  may  be  acceptable  for  patients  whose  condition  stabilizes,  but surgical evacuation of the clot is desirable in most patients. Th e prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is poor if  coma develops. Most subdural hematomas can be drained via burr holes; the procedure can be performed under either general anesthesia, local anesthesia, or monitored anesthesia care. If the subdural hematoma is particularly large, is chronic, or consists of clotted blood, drainage may require craniotomy. Because  a  subdural  hematoma  is  usually  caused  by  venous bleeding,  normocapnia  is  desirable  following  evacuation  of the hematoma to allow for a larger brain volume, which may help to tamponade any sites of venous bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAPARENCHYMAL HEMATOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An abnormal collection  of  blood  located  within  the  brain tissue  proper  is  referred  to  as  an intraparenchymal  hematoma. Th ese lesions can be di ffi cult to treat because of their location  and  because  they  o ft en  acutely  increase  in  size. Conservative management is usually initiated unless the size or rate of growth of the hematoma is likely to cause brain herniation.

CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital  anomalies  of  the  central  nervous  system  result from defects in the development or architecture of the nervous system. O ft en a hereditary pattern is responsible. Pathologic processes may be di ff use or may involve only those neurons that are anatomically and functionally related.

Chiari's Malformation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chiari's malformation refers  to  a  group  of  disorders consisting of congenital displacement of the cerebellum. A Chiari I malformation consists of downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils over the cervical spinal cord, whereas a Chiari II malformation is downward displacement of the cerebellar vermis. Th is is o ft en associated with a meningomyelocele. Chiari III malformations are extremely rare and represent displacement of the cerebellum into an occipital encephalocele.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of Chiari I malformation can appear at any age. Th e most common complaint is occipital headache, o ft en extending into the shoulders and arms, with corresponding cutaneous dysesthesias. Pain is aggravated by coughing or moving  the  head.  Visual  disturbances,  intermittent  vertigo, and ataxia are prominent symptoms. Signs of syringomyelia are present in approximately 50% of patients with this disorder. Chiari II malformations usually present in infancy with obstructive  hydrocephalus plus lower brainstem and cranial nerve dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Chiari's  malformation  consists  of  surgical decompression  by  freeing  of  adhesions  and  enlargement  of the foramen magnum. Management of anesthesia must consider the possibility of increases in ICP as well as signi fi cant intraoperative  blood  loss,  especially  in  the  case  of  Chiari  II malformations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tuberous Sclerosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tuberous  sclerosis  (Bourneville's  disease)  is  an  autosomal dominant  disease  characterized  by  mental  retardation,  seizures, and facial angio fi bromas. Pathologically, tuberous sclerosis  can  be  viewed  as  a  condition  in  which  a  constellation of  benign  hamartomatous  lesions  and  malformations  occur in  virtually  every  organ  of  the  body.  Brain  lesions  include cortical tubers and giant cell astrocytomas. Cardiac rhabdomyoma, although rare, is the most common benign cardiac tumor associated with tuberous sclerosis. Both echocardiography and MRI are useful for detecting cardiac tumors. An association of Wol ff -Parkinson-White syndrome with tuberous sclerosis has been described. Co-existing angiomyolipomas and cysts of the kidney may result in renal failure. Oral lesions such as nodular tumors, fi bromas, or papillomas may be  present  on  the  tongue,  palate,  pharynx,  and  larynx. Th e prognosis for patients with tuberous sclerosis depends on the organ systems involved and ranges from no symptoms to lifethreatening complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia management must consider the likely presence of mental retardation and a seizure disorder requiring antiepileptic  drugs.  Upper  airway  abnormalities  must be identi fi ed preoperatively.  Cardiac  involvement  may  be  associated  with intraoperative cardiac dysrhythmias. Impaired renal function may have implications when selecting drugs that depend on renal clearance mechanisms. Although experience is limited, these patients seem to respond normally to inhaled and intravenous drugs, including opioids.

Von Hippel-Lindau Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a familial disease transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene with variable penetrance. It is  characterized  by  retinal  angiomas,  hemangioblastomas, and central nervous system (typically cerebellar) and visceral tumors.  Although  these  tumors  are  benign,  they  can  cause symptoms resulting from pressure on surrounding structures or bleeding. Th e incidence of pheochromocytoma, renal cysts, and renal cell carcinoma is increased in this syndrome. Th ese patients  may  require  intracranial  surgery  for  resection  of hemangioblastomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  von  HippelLindau disease must consider the possible presence of a pheochromocytoma. Preoperative treatment with antihypertensive drugs is indicated if a pheochromocytoma is identi fi ed. Th e possibility  of  spinal  cord  hemangioblastomas  may  limit  the use of spinal anesthesia, although epidural anesthesia has been described  for  cesarean  section.  Exaggerated  hypertension, especially  during  direct  laryngoscopy  or  sudden  changes  in the intensity of surgical stimulation, may require intervention with esmolol, labetalol, sodium nitroprusside, or a combination of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurofibromatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuro fi bromatosis is due to an autosomal dominant mutation. Both  sexes  are  equally  a ff ected.  Expressivity  is  variable,  but penetrance of the  trait  is  virtually  100%.  Manifestations  are categorized as classic (von Recklinghausen's disease), acoustic, or segmental.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diversity of  clinical  features  of  neuro fi bromatosis emphasizes  the  protean  nature  of  this  disease  (Table  10-8). One feature common to all cases is progression of the disease over time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Café au lait spots (abnormal cutaneous pigmentation) are present in almost every a ff ected individual. Six or more spots larger  than  1.5  cm  in  diameter  are  considered  diagnostic  of neuro fi bromatosis.  Café  au  lait  spots  are  usually  present  at birth and continue to increase in number and size during the fi rst decade of life. Th ey can vary in size from 1 mm to more than 15 cm. Th e  distribution of the spots is random, except

<!-- PAGE=? -->
that very few are present on the face. Although they have an adverse cosmetic e ff ect, café au lait spots pose no direct threat to health.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuro fi bromas nearly always involve the skin, but they can also  occur  in  the  deeper  peripheral  nerves  and  nerve  roots and in or on viscera or blood vessels innervated by the autonomic nervous system. Th ese neuro fi bromas may be nodular and discrete or di ff use with extensive interdigitations into surrounding tissues.  Although  neuro fi bromas are histologically benign,  functional  compromise  and  cosmetic  dis fi gurement may result from their presence. Th e airway may be compromised when neuro fi bromas develop in the laryngeal, cervical, or mediastinal regions. Neuro fi bromas may be highly vascular. Pregnancy or puberty can lead to increases in their number and size.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intracranial  tumors  occur  in  5%  to  10%  of  patients  with neuro fi bromatosis  and  account  for  a  major  portion  of  the morbidity and mortality of this disease. Th e bilateral presence of acoustic neuromas in patients with café au lait spots establishes the diagnosis of neuro fi bromatosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital  pseudoarthrosis-that  is,  a  spontaneous  fracture that progresses to nonunion-is commonly encountered in neuro fi bromatosis. Th e tibia is involved most o ft en, with the radius the next most frequent site. Typically only a single site is involved in any one patient. Th e severity of pseudoarthrosis ranges from an asymptomatic radiographic presentation to a severe  nonunion requiring limb amputation. Kyphoscoliosis occurs in approximately 2% of patients with neuro fi bromatosis.  Cervical and thoracic vertebrae are most o ft en involved. Paravertebral  neuro fi bromas  are  o ft en present, but their role,  if  any,  in  the  development of kyphoscoliosis is unclear. Untreated, kyphoscoliosis o ft en progresses, leading to cardiorespiratory and neurologic compromise. Short stature is a recognized feature of neuro fi bromatosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is an increased incidence of cancer in patients with neuro fi bromatosis.  Commonly  associated  cancers  include neuro fi brosarcoma,  malignant  schwannoma,  Wilms'  tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrine  disorders  can  be  associated  with  neuro fi bromatosis. Th ese include pheochromocytoma,  disturbances in  sexual  development,  medullary  thyroid  carcinoma,  and hyperparathyroidism. Pheochromocytomas occur with a frequency of less than 1% in adults with neuro fi bromatosis and are not seen in children with neuro fi bromatosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intellectual  impairment  occurs  in  about  40%  of  patients with  neuro fi bromatosis.  Mental  retardation  is  less  frequent than  learning  disabilities. Th e  intellectual  handicap  is  usually apparent by school age and does not progress over time. Seizures may complicate neuro fi bromatosis and may be idiopathic or re fl ect the presence of intracranial tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  neuro fi bromatosis  consists  of  drug  therapy as needed to treat symptoms, such as antiepileptic drugs, and appropriately  timed  surgery.  Surgical  removal  of  cutaneous neuro fi bromas is reserved for those lesions that are particularly dis fi guring or cause functional problems. Progressive kyphoscoliosis  is  best  treated  with  surgical  stabilization.  Nervous

system involvement or associated endocrine dysfunction may also require surgery.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with neuro fi bromatosis includes  consideration  of  the  many  clinical  presentations  of this  disease. Th e  possible  presence  of  a  pheochromocytoma should  be  considered  during  the  preoperative  evaluation. Signs  of  increased  ICP  may  re fl ect  expanding  intracranial tumors.  Airway  patency  may  be  jeopardized  by  expanding laryngeal neuro fi bromas. Patients with neuro fi bromatosis and scoliosis  are  likely  to  have  cervical  spine  defects  that  could in fl uence positioning for direct laryngoscopy and the subsequent surgical procedure. Responses to muscle relaxants are variable. Th ese patients have been described as both sensitive and resistant to succinylcholine and sensitive to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Selection of regional anesthesia must consider  the  possible  future  development  of  neuro fi bromas involving  the  spinal  cord.  Epidural  analgesia  is  an  e ff ective method for producing analgesia during labor and delivery.

Alzheimer's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder. It is the most common cause of dementia in patients older than 65 years of age and the fourth most common cause of diseaserelated death in patients older than age 65. Di ff use amyloidrich senile plaques and neuro fi brillary tangles are the hallmark pathologic fi ndings. Th ere  are  also  changes  in  synapses  and in  the  activity  of  several  major  neurotransmitters,  especially involving acetylcholine and central nervous system nicotinic receptors. Two types of Alzheimer's disease have been described: early onset and late onset. Early-onset Alzheimer's disease usually presents before age 60 and appears to be due to missense mutations in several genes. Th ese mutations have an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease usually develops a ft er age 60, and genetic factors appear to play a relatively minor role in the risk of developing this disorder. In both forms of the disease, patients typically develop progressive cognitive impairment that can consist of problems with memory as well as apraxia, aphasia, and agnosia. De fi nitive  diagnosis  is  usually  made  on  postmortem  examination. Th e  antemortem  diagnosis  of  Alzheimer's  disease  is  one  of exclusion. Th ere is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, and treatment focuses on control of symptoms. Pharmacologic options include cholinesterase inhibitors such as tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. Drug therapy should be combined with nonpharmacologic therapy including caregiver education and family support. Even with treatment, the prognosis for patients with Alzheimer's disease is poor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  Alzheimer's  disease  may  come  for  a  variety of surgical interventions that are common in the elderly population. Patients are  o ft en confused and sometimes uncooperative,  which  makes  monitored  anesthesia  care  or regional anesthesia challenging. Th ere is no one single anesthetic technique or drug that is ideal in this group of patients. Shorter-acting sedative-hypnotic drugs, anesthetic agents, and narcotics are preferred since they allow a more rapid return to  baseline  mental  status.  One  should  be  aware  of  potential drug interactions, especially prolongation of the e ff ect of succinylcholine and relative resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants resulting from the use of cholinesterase inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parkinson's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown cause. Increasing age is the single most important risk factor in the development of this disease. However, association between Parkinson's disease and manganese exposure in  welders and a variety of genetic associations has recently been identi fi ed. Th ere is a characteristic loss of dopaminergic fi bers normally present in the basal ganglia, and as a result, regional dopamine concentrations are depleted. Dopamine is presumed to inhibit the rate of fi ring of the neurons that control the extrapyramidal motor system. Depletion of dopamine results in diminished inhibition of these neurons and unopposed stimulation by acetylcholine.

Th e classic triad of major signs of Parkinson's disease consists  of  skeletal  muscle  tremor,  rigidity,  and  akinesia.  Skeletal  muscle  rigidity fi rst  appears  in  the  proximal  muscles  of the  neck. Th e  earliest  manifestations  may  be  loss  of  associated arm swings when walking and absence of head rotation when turning the body. Th ere is facial immobility manifested by infrequent blinking and by a paucity of emotional expressions. Tremors are characterized as rhythmic, alternating fl exion and extension of the thumbs and other digits (pill-rolling tremor). Tremors are more prominent during rest and tend to disappear during voluntary movement. Seborrhea, oily skin, diaphragmatic  spasms,  and  oculogyric  crises  are  frequent. Dementia and depression are o ft en present.

Treatment of Parkinson's disease is designed to increase the concentration of dopamine in the basal ganglia or to decrease the  neuronal  e ff ects of  acetylcholine.  Replacement  therapy  with  the  dopamine  precursor  levodopa  combined  with administration  of  a  decarboxylase  inhibitor,  which  prevents peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and optimizes the amount of levodopa available to enter the central nervous system, is the standard medical treatment. Indeed, levodopa is the most e ff ective treatment for Parkinson's disease, and early treatment with this drug prolongs life. Levodopa is associated with a number of side e ff ects, including dyskinesias and psychiatric disturbances. Th e increased myocardial contractility and heart rate seen in treated patients may re fl ect increased levels of circulating dopamine converted from levodopa. Orthostatic hypotension may be prominent in treated patients. Gastrointestinal  side  e ff ects  of  levodopa  therapy  include  nausea  and

vomiting, most likely caused by stimulation of the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone.

Amantadine, an antiviral agent, is reported to help control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Th e mechanism for its e ff ect is not fully understood. Th e type B monoamine oxidase inhibitor selegiline can also help control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease by inhibiting the catabolism of dopamine in the central nervous system. Selegiline has an advantage over nonspeci fi c  monoamine oxidase  inhibitors  because  it  is  not associated with the occurrence of tyramine-related hypertensive crises.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  treatment  of  Parkinson's  disease  is  reserved  for patients  with  disabling  and  medically  refractory  symptoms. Stimulation of the various nuclei within the basal ganglia via an implanted deep brain stimulating device can relieve or help to  control  tremor.  Pallidotomy  is  associated  with  signi fi cant improvement in levodopa-induced dyskinesias, although the improvement may be short-lived. Fetal tissue transplantation for treatment of Parkinson's disease is based on the demonstration that implanted embryonic dopaminergic neurons can survive in recipients. Th e e ff ectiveness of this treatment is not currently known.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deep brain stimulator placement is o ft en done in an awake patient. However, in certain circumstances, such as in patients with developmental delay or those with severe claustrophobia, the procedure is performed under general anesthesia. Th e procedure begins with placement of a rigid head frame, followed by MRI to allow for coordinate determination relative to fi duciary markers on the head frame. Th e deep brain electrode is then advanced through a burr hole, o ft en with microelectrode recordings taken, since speci fi c nuclei di ff er in their spontaneous fi ring patterns. Th e target tissue is then stimulated via the electrode to determine if clinical symptoms abate. Following successful brain lead placement, a generator pack is implanted below  the  clavicle  or  in  the  abdomen.  Of  note,  deep  brain stimulation is currently under investigation for treatment of a variety of other disorders, such as Hallervorden-Spatz disease, depression, and eating disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with Parkinson's disease requires an understanding of how this disease is treated. Th e elimination half-time of levodopa and the dopamine it produces is brief, so interruption of drug therapy for more than 6 to 12 hours can result in an abrupt loss of therapeutic e ff ects. Abrupt drug withdrawal can also lead to skeletal muscle rigidity, which can interfere with ventilation. Th erefore, levodopa therapy, including the usual morning dose on the day of surgery, must be continued throughout the perioperative period. Oral levodopa can be administered approximately 20 minutes before induction of anesthesia, and the dose may be repeated intraoperatively and postoperatively via an orogastric or nasogastric tube as needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  possibility  of  hypotension  and  cardiac  dysrhythmias must  be  considered,  and  butyrophenones  (e.g.,  droperidol, haloperidol)  must  be  available  to  antagonize  the  e ff ects  of dopamine in the basal ganglia. Acute dystonic reactions following administration of alfentanil might indicate an opioidinduced decrease in central dopaminergic transmission. Th e use of ketamine is controversial because of the possible provocation of exaggerated sympathetic nervous system responses, but ketamine has been administered safely to patients treated with levodopa. Th e  choice of a muscle relaxant is not in fl uenced by the presence of Parkinson's disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  undergoing  deep  brain  stimulator  implantation may  have  been  told  by  the  surgeon  to  refrain  from  taking the  usual  morning  dose  of  levodopa  to  facilitate  the  return of  tremors  and  enhance  sensitivity  in  detecting  the  e ffi cacy of deep brain stimulation during the procedure. If that is the case,  then  establishment  of  intravenous  access  may  prove challenging in an extremity with a signi fi cant tremor. Patients should receive minimal sedation during lead placement to prevent interference with microelectrode recordings and clinical assessment. Since γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a common neurotransmitter involved in the normal circuitry of the basal ganglia,  anesthetic  agents  with  signi fi cant  e ff ects  on  GABA, such as propofol and benzodiazepines, can alter the characteristic microelectrode recordings of speci fi c nuclei and should be avoided. Sedative agents such as opioids and dexmedetomidine are more satisfactory alternatives. Excessive sedation should be avoided not only to minimize di ffi culty obtaining neurologic assessments, but more importantly to avoid respiratory depression in a patient in whom there is little access to the airway because of the presence of a head frame. A variety of airway management devices (e.g., fi beroptic bronchoscope, laryngeal mask airway) should be readily available should airway compromise become an issue intraoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lead placement can be a long procedure, so care should be taken to position the patient properly and comfortably. Propper  padding should be placed at sites that may be prone to pressure injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e procedure is performed with the patient in the sitting position, so there is a risk of air embolism. Precordial Doppler ultrasonographic  monitoring  can  help  identify  air  entrainment. If venous air embolism and oxygen desaturation occur, the patient should not be  encouraged to take a deep breath, because  this  can  lower  intrathoracic  pressure  and  cause  the entrainment  of  even  more  air.  Instead,  the  surgeon  should fl ood the fi eld  with  saline  and  attempt  to  identify  and  treat the site of air entrainment. In more severe cases, the patient should be placed supine and hemodynamic support instituted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other  potential  complications  of  deep  brain  stimulation placement include hypertension, seizures, and bleeding. Hypertension should be treated to avoid increasing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Seizures o ft en spontaneously abate, but  very  small  doses  of  a  barbiturate,  propofol,  or  a  benzodiazepine may be required to terminate their activity despite the  potentially  suppressive  e ff ect  of  administration  of  these drugs on microelectrode recordings. Th e e ff ect of these drugs on ventilatory drive must also be appreciated and minimized. A  sudden  alteration  of  consciousness  could  indicate  intracranial  hemorrhage.  Hemorrhage  would  require  aggressive

Hallervorden-Spatz Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hallervorden-Spatz disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the basal ganglia. It follows a slowly progressive course from its onset during late childhood to death in approximately 10  years.  No  speci fi c  laboratory  tests  are  diagnostic  for  this condition,  and  no  e ff ective  treatment  is  known.  Dementia, dystonia  with  torticollis,  and  scoliosis  are  commonly  present.  Dystonic posturing o ft en disappears with the induction of  general anesthesia. However, skeletal muscle contractures and  bony  changes  that  accompany  this  chronic  disease  can cause immobility of the temporomandibular joint and cervical spine, even in the presence of deep general anesthesia or druginduced skeletal muscle paralysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  must  consider  the  possibility that these patients may not be able to be positioned optimally for tracheal intubation. Noxious stimulation caused by attempted  awake  tracheal  intubation  can  intensify  dystonia, so  an  inhalation  induction  with  maintenance  of  spontaneous ventilation is a common choice. Administration of succinylcholine  is  potentially  dangerous,  since  skeletal  muscle wasting and di ff use axonal changes in the brain that involve upper motor neurons could accentuate the release of potassium. However, safe use of succinylcholine has been reported. Required skeletal muscle relaxation is best provided by deep general anesthesia or administration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Emergence from anesthesia is predictably accompanied by return of dystonic posturing.

Huntington's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Huntington's disease is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by marked atrophy of the caudate nucleus and, to a lesser degree, the putamen and globus pallidus.  Biochemical  abnormalities  include  de fi ciencies  in the basal ganglia of acetylcholine (and its synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase) and GABA. Selective loss of GABA can decrease inhibition of the dopamine nigrostriatal system. Huntington's  disease  is  transmitted  as  an  autosomal  dominant trait, but its delayed appearance at 35 to 40 years of age interferes  with  e ff ective  genetic  counseling.  Identi fi cation  of the genetic defect may be useful for disease risk prediction in those who have inherited the defective gene.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations  of  Huntington's  disease  consist  of  progressive  dementia  combined  with  choreoathetosis.  Chorea is  usually  considered  the fi rst  sign  of  Huntington's  disease. Th is  is  the  reason  for  the  former  designation of this disease as Huntington's  chorea. Behavioral  changes  such  as  depression, aggressive outbursts, and mood swings may precede the onset of involuntary movements by several years. Involvement of  the  pharyngeal  muscles  makes  these  patients  susceptible to pulmonary aspiration. Th e disease progresses over several years, and accompanying mental depression makes suicide a frequent cause of death. Th e duration of Huntington's disease from clinical onset to death averages 17 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Huntington's  disease  is  symptomatic  and  is directed at decreasing the choreiform movements. Haloperidol and other butyrophenones may be administered to control the chorea and emotional lability associated with the disease. Th e most useful therapy for controlling involuntary movements is drugs that interfere with the neurotransmitter e ff ects of dopamine either by antagonizing dopamine (haloperidol, fl uphenazine) or by depleting dopamine stores (reserpine, tetrabenazine).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Experience in the management of anesthesia in patients with Huntington's chorea is too limited to allow recommendation of speci fi c anesthetic drugs or techniques. Preoperative sedation using butyrophenones such as droperidol or haloperidol may be helpful in controlling choreiform movements. Th e increased likelihood of pulmonary aspiration must be considered. Use of nitrous oxide and volatile anesthetics is acceptable. Th iopental, succinylcholine, and mivacurium have been administered without  adverse  e ff ects,  but  decreased  plasma  cholinesterase activity with prolonged responses to succinylcholine has been observed. It has been suggested that these patients may be sensitive to the e ff ects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Torticollis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Torticollis is thought to result from disturbances in basal ganglia function. Th e most common mode of presentation is spasmodic contraction of nuchal muscles, which may progress to involvement of limb and girdle muscles. Hypertrophy of the sternocleidomastoid  muscles  may  be  present.  Spasm  may involve the muscles of the vertebral column, leading to lordosis, scoliosis, and impaired ventilation. Treatment is not very e ff ective, but bilateral anterior rhizotomy at C1 and C3, with a sectioning of the spinal accessory nerve, may be attempted. Th is  operation may cause postoperative paralysis of the diaphragm, resulting in respiratory distress. Selective peripheral denervation of a ff ected cervical  musculature is another surgical  option. Th ere  are  no  known  problems  in fl uencing  the selection of anesthetic drugs, but spasm of nuchal muscles can interfere  with  maintenance  of  a  patent  upper  airway  before institution of skeletal muscle paralysis. Awake tracheal intubation may be necessary if chronic skeletal muscle spasm has led to fi xation of the cervical vertebrae. Surgery may be performed with the patient in the sitting position. If so, anesthetic considerations related to use of the sitting position and the potential for venous air embolism will come into play.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e sudden appearance of torticollis a ft er administration of anesthetic drugs has been reported. Administration of diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV produces a dramatic reversal of this drug-induced torticollis.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nonin fl ammatory diseases of the central nervous system are caused by transmissible slow-acting infectious protein pathogens known as prions. Prions di ff er from viruses in that they lack RNA and DNA and fail to produce a detectable immune reaction. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are diagnosed on the basis of clinical and neuropathologic fi ndings, including the presence of di ff use or focal clustered small round vacuoles that may become con fl uent. Familial progressive subcortical gliosis and some inherited thalamic dementias may also be spongiform encephalopathies. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) is a transmissible spongiform  encephalopathy  that  occurs  in  animals.  Infectivity  of skeletal muscles, milk, and blood has not been detected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CJD  is the most common  transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, with an estimated incidence of one case per million worldwide. Transmission of the prion and the development of clinical disease are still poorly understood. In fact, a signi fi cant proportion of the population are probably carriers of the CJD prion, but most do not develop clinical disease. Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with CJD have a family history of the disease, so both infectious and genetic factors probably play a role in disease development. Th e time interval between infection and development of symptoms is measured in months to years. Th e disease develops by accumulation of an abnormal protein thought to act as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Th is prion protein is encoded by a speci fi c gene, and sporadic and random mutations result in variants of CJD. Rapidly progressive dementia with ataxia and myoclonus suggests the diagnosis, although con fi rmation usually requires brain biopsy because there are no reliable noninvasive diagnostic tests. Alzheimer's disease poses the most di ffi cult di ff erential diagnosis. Unlike in toxic and metabolic disorders, myoclonus is rarely present at the onset of CJD, and seizures, when they occur, are a late phenomenon. No vaccines or treatments are e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Universal  infection  precautions  are  recommended  when caring  for  patients  with  CJD,  but  other  precautions  are  not necessary. Handling of CSF calls for special precautions (use of double gloves and protective glasses, specimen labeling as "infectious"), since CSF has been the only body fl uid shown to result in transmission to primates. Performance of biopsies and autopsies requires similar precautions. Th e main risk of transmitting CJD is during brain biopsy for diagnostic con fi rmation of the disease. Instruments used should be disposable or should be decontaminated by soaking in sodium hypochlorite or autoclaving.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Human-to-human transmission has occurred inadvertently in association with surgical procedures (corneal transplantation, stereotactic procedures with previously used electrodes, procedures  with  contaminated  neurosurgical  instruments, and human cadaveric dura mater transplantation). Transmission also has been attributed to treatment with human-derived growth hormone and gonadotropic hormones. Although the injection  or  transplantation  of  human  tissues  may  result  in transmission of infectious prions, the hazards of transmission through human blood are debatable, since this disease is not observed more frequently in individuals with hemophilia than in the general population. Nevertheless, transfusion of blood from individuals known to be infected is not recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  includes  the  use  of  universal infection precautions, disposable equipment, and sterilization of any reusable equipment using sodium hypochlorite. Surgery in patients known or suspected to be infected might be better performed at the end of the day to allow thorough cleansing of equipment and the operating room before the next use. Th e number of personnel participating in anesthesia and surgery is kept to a minimum, and all should wear protective gowns, gloves, and face masks with transparent visors to protect the eyes. Since a proportion of the general population are probably carriers of the prion thought to cause CJD and both infectious and genetic factors play a role in the development of clinical symptoms, the likelihood of developing CJD a ft er coming in contact with a CJD prion is probably very low. However, standard precautionary measures still should be taken.

Multiple Sclerosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease a ff ecting the central nervous system that seems to occur in genetically susceptible persons. Th ere is a high rate of concordance among twins and an increased risk in individuals who have a fi rst-degree relative  with  the  disease. Th ere  are  also  geographic  associations  with  this  disease,  which  reaches  its  highest  incidence in northern Europe, southern Australia, and North America. However, no clear genetic, environmental, or infectious causes have yet been identi fi ed. Th ere is also no clear understanding of the immunopathogenic processes that determine the sites of tissue damage in the central nervous system, the variations in natural history, and the severity of disability caused by this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathologically, multiple sclerosis is characterized by diverse combinations  of  in fl ammation,  demyelination,  and  axonal damage  in  the  central  nervous  system. Th e  loss  of  myelin covering  the  axons  is  followed  by  formation  of  demyelinative  plaques.  Peripheral nerves are not a ff ected by multiple sclerosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical manifestations of multiple sclerosis re fl ect its multifocal involvement. Th e course may be subacute, with relapses followed by remissions, or the course may be chronic and progressive.  Manifestations of multiple sclerosis re fl ect  the  sites of  demyelination  in  the  central  nervous  system  and  spinal cord.  For  example,  in fl ammation  of  the  optic  nerves  (optic neuritis)  causes  visual  disturbances,  involvement  of  the  cerebellum leads to gait disturbances, and lesions of the spinal cord cause limb paresthesias and weakness as well as urinary incontinence and impotence. Optic neuritis is characterized by diminished visual acuity and defective pupillary reaction to  light.  Ascending  spastic  paresis  of  the  skeletal  muscles  is o ft en prominent. Intramedullary disease of the cervical cord is  suggested  by  an  electrical  sensation  that  runs  down  the back into  the  legs  in  response  to fl exion of  the  neck  (Lhermitte's sign). Typically, symptoms develop over the course of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 10 DISEASES AFFECTING THE BRAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
a few days, remain stable for a few weeks, and then improve. Because remyelination probably does not occur in the central nervous  system,  remission  of  symptoms  most  likely  results from  correction  of  transient  chemical  and  physiologic  disturbances that have interfered with nerve conduction in the areas  of  demyelination.  Increases  in  body  temperature  can also  cause  exacerbation  of  symptoms  due  to  further  alterations in nerve conduction in regions of demyelination. Th ere is an increased incidence of seizure disorders in patients with multiple sclerosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  course of multiple sclerosis is characterized by exacerbations  and  remissions  at  unpredictable  intervals  over  a period  of  several  years.  Symptoms  eventually  persist  during  remissions,  leading  to  severe  disability  from  visual  failure,  ataxia,  spastic  skeletal  muscle  weakness,  and  urinary incontinence. However, in some patients the disease remains benign, with infrequent, mild episodes of demyelination, followed by prolonged remissions. Th e onset of multiple sclerosis a ft er 35 years of age is typically associated with slow disease progression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be established with di ff erent degrees of con fi dence-that is, probable or de fi niteon  the  basis  of  clinical  features  alone  or  clinical  features  in combination with oligoclonal immunoglobulin abnormalities in the CSF, prolonged latency of evoked potentials re fl ecting slowing  of  nerve  conduction  resulting  from  demyelination, and signal changes in white matter seen on cranial MRI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No  treatment  is  curative  for  multiple  sclerosis,  so  treatment is directed at symptom control and slowing of disease progression. Corticosteroids, the principal treatment for acute relapses  of  multiple  sclerosis,  have  immunomodulatory  and antiin fl ammatory  e ff ects  that  restore  the  blood-brain  barrier,  decrease  edema,  and  possibly  improve  axonal  conduction.  Treatment  with  corticosteroids  shortens  the  duration of a relapse and accelerates recovery, but whether the overall degree of recovery or progression of the disease is altered is not known. Interferonβ is the treatment of choice for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Th e most common side  e ff ect  of  interferonβ therapy  is  transient  in fl uenza-like symptoms for 24 to 48 hours a ft er injection. Slight increases in  serum  aminotransferase  concentrations,  leukopenia,  or anemia  may  be  present,  and  co-existing  depression  may  be exaggerated. Glatiramer acetate is a mixture of random synthetic  polypeptides  synthesized  to  mimic  myelin  basic  protein. Th is  drug  is  an  alternative  to  interferonβ and  is  most useful in patients who become resistant to interferonβ treatment  caused  by  serum  interferonβ -neutralizing  activity. Mitoxantrone is  an  immunosuppressive  drug  that  functions by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation. Because of severe cardiac toxicity, its use is limited to patients with rapidly progressive multiple sclerosis. Azathioprine is a purine analogue that depresses both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Treatment with this drug may decrease the rate of relapses in multiple sclerosis but has no e ff ect on the progression of disability. Azathioprine is considered when patients show no response to therapy with interferonβ or glatiramer acetate. Low-dose methotrexate  is  relatively  nontoxic  and  inhibits  both  cellmediated and humoral immunity due to its antiin fl ammatory e ff ects. Patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis may bene fi t from treatment with this drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with multiple sclerosis must consider the impact of surgical stress on the natural progression of the disease. Regardless of the anesthetic technique or drugs selected for use during the perioperative period, it is possible that symptoms and signs of multiple sclerosis will be exacerbated postoperatively. Th is may be due to factors such as infection and fever. Any increase in body temperature, even of as little as 1° C, can cause an exacerbation of multiple sclerosis. It is possible that increased body temperature results in complete  block  of  conduction  in  demyelinated  nerves. Th e unpredictable  cycle  of  clinical  exacerbations  and  remissions that  are  inherent  in  multiple  sclerosis  might  lead  to  erroneous conclusions that there are cause-and-e ff ect relationships between disease severity and drugs or events occurring during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e changing and unpredictable neurologic presentation of patients with multiple sclerosis during the perioperative period must be appreciated when regional anesthetic techniques are selected. Indeed, spinal anesthesia has been implicated in postoperative exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, whereas exacerbations of the disease a ft er epidural anesthesia or peripheral nerve blockade have not been described. Th e mechanism by which spinal anesthesia might di ff er in this regard from epidural anesthesia is unknown, but it might involve local anesthetic neurotoxicity. Speci fi cally, it is speculated that the demyelination associated with multiple sclerosis renders the spinal cord more susceptible to the neurotoxic e ff ects of local anesthetics. Epidural anesthesia may carry less risk than spinal anesthesia because the concentration of local anesthetics in the white matter of the spinal cord is lower than a ft er spinal anesthesia. Nevertheless, both epidural anesthesia and spinal anesthesia have been used in parturient women with multiple sclerosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia is the most frequently used technique in patients with multiple sclerosis. Th ere are no unique interactions  between multiple sclerosis and the drugs used to provide general anesthesia, and there is no evidence to support use of one inhaled or injected anesthetic drug over another. When  selecting  muscle  relaxants,  one  should  consider  the possibility of exaggerated release of muscle potassium, causing hyperkalemia, following administration of succinylcholine to these patients. Prolonged responses to the paralyzing e ff ects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants would be consistent with co-existing  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  decreased  skeletal muscle mass. However, resistance to the e ff ects of nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  has  been  observed,  which  perhaps re fl ects the proliferation of extrajunctional cholinergic receptors characteristic of upper motor neuron lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroid  supplementation  during  the  perioperative period may be indicated in patients being treated long term with  these  drugs.  E ff orts  must  be  made  to  recognize  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
250

<!-- PAGE=? -->

prevent even a modest increase in body temperature, since this change may exacerbate symptoms. Periodic neurologic evaluation during the postoperative period is useful for detection of exacerbations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postpolio Sequelae

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Poliomyelitis is caused by an enterovirus that initially infects the reticuloendothelial system. In a minority of patients, the virus  enters  the  central  nervous  system  and  preferentially targets  motor  neurons  in  the  brainstem  and  anterior  horn of the spinal cord. Th e worldwide incidence of poliomyelitis has  signi fi cantly  decreased  since  the  institution  of  vaccination  against  this  disease.  Because  poliomyelitis  is  so  rare  at this time in the United States, a clinician will see patients with postpolio  sequelae  much  more  commonly  than  those  with acute  polio.  Postpolio  sequelae  manifest  as  fatigue,  skeletal muscle weakness, joint pain, cold intolerance, dysphagia, and sleep and breathing problems (i.e., obstructive sleep apnea), which presumably re fl ect neurologic damage from the original poliovirus infection. Poliovirus may damage the reticular activating system; this accounts for the fact that these individuals may exhibit exquisite sensitivity to the sedative e ff ects of anesthetics as well as delayed awakening from general anesthesia. Sensitivity  to  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  is  common. Severe back pain following surgery may be due to co-existing skeletal  muscle  atrophy  and  scoliosis.  Postoperative  shivering may be profound, since these individuals are very sensitive to cold. Postoperative pain perception may be abnormal, possibly because of poliovirus damage to endogenous opioidsecreting cells in the brain and spinal cord. Outpatient surgery may not be appropriate for many postpolio patients since they are at increased risk of complications, especially those related to respiratory muscle weakness and dysphagia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SEIZURE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seizures  are  caused  by  transient,  paroxysmal,  and  synchronous discharge of groups of neurons in the brain. Seizure is one of the most common neurologic disorders and may occur at any age. More than 10% of the population will experience a seizure at some time during their lives. Clinical manifestations depend on the location and number of neurons involved in the seizure discharge and its duration. Transient abnormalities of brain function, such as occur with hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperthermia, and drug toxicity, typically result in a single  seizure.  Treatment  of  the  underlying  disorder  is  usually curative. Epilepsy is de fi ned as recurrent seizures resulting from  congenital  or  acquired  factors  (e.g.,  cerebral  scarring) and a ff ects approximately 0.6% of the population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seizures are grossly classi fi ed based on two factors: loss of consciousness and focus of seizure activation. Simple seizures involve no loss of consciousness, whereas altered levels of consciousness are seen in complex seizures. Partial seizures appear to originate from a limited population of neurons in a single hemisphere,  whereas  generalized  seizures  appear  to  involve di ff use activation of neurons in both cerebral hemispheres. A partial  seizure  may  initially  be  evident  in  one  region  of  the body  and  may  subsequently  become  generalized,  involving both hemispheres, a process known as the jacksonian march.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MRI is the preferred method for studying brain structure in patients with epilepsy. Standard EEG is used to identify the location(s) of seizure foci as well as to characterize their electrical properties. Th e use of videography in addition to EEG allows simultaneous documentation of electrical and clinical seizure activity. Electrocorticography, in which electrodes are surgically placed directly on the cerebral cortex, not only permits more accurate focus identi fi cation but also allows mapping of electrical events in relation to identi fi able brain surface anatomy, a feature that is valuable during surgical resection. Stimulation  of  various  electrocorticographic  electrodes  can also  help  identify  eloquent  brain  areas  before  seizure  focus resection, so that those areas can be avoided during surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seizures are treated with antiepileptic drugs, starting with a single  drug  and  achieving  seizure  control  by  increasing  the dosage as necessary. Drug combinations may be considered when monotherapy fails. Changes in drug dosage are guided by clinical response (antiseizure e ff ects vs. side e ff ects) rather than  by  serum  drug  concentrations.  Monitoring  of  serum drug levels is usually not necessary for patients who are experiencing adequate seizure control without evidence of toxicity.  E ff ective antiepileptic drugs appear to decrease neuronal excitability  or  enhance  neuronal  inhibition.  Drugs  e ff ective for  the  treatment  of partial seizures  include  carbamazepine, phenytoin, eslicarbazepine, and valproate. Generalized seizure disorders  can  be  managed  with  carbamazepine,  phenytoin, valproate, barbiturates, gabapentin, levetiracetam, or lamotrigine. Except for gabapentin, all of the useful antiepileptic drugs are metabolized in the liver before undergoing renal excretion. Gabapentin appears to undergo no in vivo  metabolism  and is  excreted unchanged by the kidneys. Carbamazepine, phenytoin,  and  barbiturates  cause  enzyme  induction,  and  longterm treatment with these drugs can alter the rate of their own metabolism as well as that of other drugs. Pharmacokinetic and  pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  are  considerations in patients being treated with antiepileptic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dose-dependent neurotoxic e ff ects are the most common adverse e ff ects  of  antiepileptic  drugs.  All  antiepileptic  drugs can cause depression of cerebral function with symptoms of sedation.

Phenytoin  has  many  side  e ff ects,  including  hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias, gingival hyperplasia, and aplastic anemia.  It  is  associated  with  various  cutaneous  manifestations, including  erythema  multiforme  and  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome. Extravasation  or  intraarterial  injection  of  phenytoin can  induce  signi fi cant  vasoconstriction  resulting  in  purple glove  syndrome,  which  can  lead  to  skin  necrosis,  compartment syndrome, and gangrene.

Valproate  produces  hepatic  failure  in  approximately  1  in every 10,000 recipients. Th e mechanism of this hepatotoxicity is unknown, but it may represent an idiosyncratic hypersensitivity reaction. Pancreatitis has also been observed during valproate therapy. Long-term use of valproate is associated with increased surgical bleeding, especially in children. Th e mechanism is currently unknown but might involve a combination of thrombocytopenia and valproate-induced decreases in von Willebrand factor and factor VIII.

Carbamazepine can cause diplopia, dose-related leukopenia, and hyponatremia (which is usually clinically unimportant) as well as alterations in the hepatic metabolism of various drugs.

Adverse hematologic reactions associated with antiepileptic drugs range from mild anemia to aplastic anemia and are most  commonly  associated  with  the  use  of  carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate.

Surgical Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical treatment of seizure disorders is considered in patients whose seizures do not respond to antiepileptic drugs or who cannot tolerate the side e ff ects of pharmacologic therapy. Surgery  is  now  being  performed  much  earlier  than  in  the  past, particularly in young patients, to avoid social isolation resulting from medication side e ff ects and persistent seizures. Partial seizures may respond to resection of a pathologic region within the brain such as a tumor, hamartoma, or scar tissue. Corpus callosotomy may help to prevent the generalization of partial seizures to the opposite hemisphere. Finally, hemispherectomy is sometimes needed for persistent catastrophic seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In preparation for surgery, the seizure focus is fi rst located by imaging and functional studies. MRI is the imaging modality of choice, especially for detection of mesial temporal sclerosis,  a  common  cause  of  complex  partial  seizures.  Nuclear medicine-based modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), may demonstrate alterations in metabolism or abnormal blood fl ow in regions of the brain. Video-EEG monitoring can assist in correlating electrical activity and clinical manifestations of seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrocorticography, as mentioned earlier, involves placement of electrodes either as a grid directly on the brain surface or deeper within the brain. Electrocorticography o ff ers many advantages  over  surface  EEG  recordings,  such  as  increased precision in seizure focus determination, the ability to monitor deep regions of cortex, and the ability to stimulate regions of  brain  to  map  eloquent  regions.  Electrocorticography  can be performed during the same surgical procedure as cortical resection  or  electrodes  can  be  placed  during  one  procedure and the patient allowed to return on a di ff erent day for seizure focus resection. In the latter case, video monitoring and mapping with grids in place can increase the accuracy of identifying the speci fi c seizure focus for resection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A more conservative surgical approach to medically intractable seizures involves the implantation of a le ft vagal  nerve stimulator. Th e le ft side is chosen because the right vagal nerve usually has signi fi cant cardiac innervation, which could lead to severe bradyarrhythmias. Th e  mechanism by which vagal nerve stimulation produces its e ff ects is unclear. Patients tolerate this treatment well except for the occurrence of hoarseness in some cases, which re fl ects the vagal innervation of the larynx.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Status Epilepticus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Status epilepticus is a life-threatening condition that manifests as continuous seizure activity or two or more seizures occurring in sequence without recovery of consciousness between them.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e goal of treatment of status epilepticus is prompt establishment  of  venous  access  and  subsequent  pharmacologic suppression  of  seizure  activity  combined  with  support  of the  airway,  ventilation,  and  circulation.  Hypoglycemia  can be  ruled  out  as  a  cause  within  minutes  using  rapid  bedside glucose assessment techniques. If hypoglycemia is present, it can be corrected by intravenous administration of 50 mL of 50% glucose solution. Routine glucose administration before con fi rmation of hypoglycemia is potentially dangerous, since hyperglycemia can exacerbate brain injury. Tracheal intubation  may  be  needed  to  protect  the  airway  and/or  optimize oxygen delivery and ventilation. Muscle relaxants should be avoided if muscle movement, rather than electrophysiologic monitoring, is the principal method for assessing therapy e ff ectiveness. Administration of an antiepileptic anesthetic, such as propofol or thiopental,  will  temporarily  halt  seizure  activity during tracheal intubation. Monitoring of arterial blood gas levels and pH may be useful for con fi rming the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation. Metabolic acidosis is a common sequela  of  ongoing  seizure  activity.  Intravenous  administration of sodium bicarbonate may be needed to treat extreme acid-base abnormalities. Hyperthermia occurs frequently during status epilepticus and necessitates active cooling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with seizure disorders includes  considering  the  impact  of  antiepileptic  drugs  on organ function and the e ff ect of anesthetic drugs on seizures. Sedation produced by antiepileptic drugs may have additive e ff ects  with  that  produced  by  anesthetic  drugs,  and  enzyme induction by antiepileptic drugs may alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anesthetic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  selecting  anesthetic  induction  and  maintenance drugs, one must consider their e ff ects on central nervous system electrical activity. Methohexital administration can activate  epileptic  foci  and  has  been  recommended  as  a  method for  delineating  these  foci  during  electrocorticography  in patients undergoing surgical treatment of epilepsy. Alfentanil, ketamine,  en fl urane,  iso fl urane,  and  sevo fl urane  can  cause

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
epileptiform spike-and-wave EEG activity in patients without a history of seizures, but they are also known to suppress epileptiform and epileptic activity. Seizures and opisthotonos have been observed in rare cases a ft er propofol anesthesia, which suggests  caution  when  administering  this  drug  to  patients with known seizure disorders. In selection of muscle relaxants, the central nervous system-stimulating e ff ects of laudanosine, a proconvulsant metabolite of atracurium and cisatracurium, may  merit  consideration.  Various  antiepileptic  drugs,  speci fi cally phenytoin and carbamazepine, shorten the duration of  action  of  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants through both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic means. Topiramate may be the cause of unexplained metabolic acidosis, given its ability to inhibit carbonic anhydrase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  seems  reasonable  to  avoid  administering  potentially epileptogenic  drugs  to  patients  with  epilepsy.  Instead,  thiobarbiturates, opioids, and  benzodiazepines  are  preferred. Iso fl urane, des fl urane, and sevo fl urane seem to be acceptable choices  in  patients  with  seizure  disorders.  Regardless  of  the anesthetic drugs used, it is important to maintain treatment with the preoperative antiepileptic drugs throughout the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  intraoperative  electrocorticography,  monitoring is aimed at identifying interictal epileptiform activity, that is, the characteristic patterns of electrical activity that occur in the  time  between  seizures.  Many  anesthetic  agents,  such  as benzodiazepines, volatile anesthetics, and anesthetic doses of barbiturates and propofol, can signi fi cantly suppress epileptiform  activity,  which  renders  electrocorticographic  monitoring  di ffi cult  or  impossible.  During  the  monitoring  period, anesthesia should be managed with agents such as narcotics, nitrous  oxide,  droperidol,  diphenhydramine,  and  possibly dexmedetomidine. If epileptiform activity remains suppressed or is inadequate for analysis, high-dose short-acting opioids (e.g., alfentanil 50 mcg/kg as an intravenous bolus), or small intravenous boluses of methohexital (0.3 mg/kg) or etomidate (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) can serve to enhance epileptiform activity. Careful attention to maintaining muscle paralysis during this part of the procedure is important. When the preoperative discussion is held and informed consent is obtained, the patient should be made aware that anesthetic techniques used to  improve the quality of electrophysiologic recordings may also increase the risk of awareness during anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite general anesthesia and muscle relaxation, patients may still exhibit seizure activity. Th is may manifest as unexplained abrupt changes in heart rate and blood pressure with or without overt clonic movement, depending on the degree of  muscle  paralysis.  Increases  in  carbon  dioxide  production from increased brain and muscle metabolism will be re fl ected in  an  increased  end-tidal  carbon  dioxide  concentration  and may result in patient respiratory e ff orts. Seizures can be terminated by the administration of a barbiturate, propofol, or a benzodiazepine that is titrated to seizure cessation. Seizures can also be rapidly terminated by the direct application of cold saline to the brain surface. Th is is a very useful technique in procedures  performed  in  awake  patients,  because  it  avoids the use of drugs that could potentially produce somnolence, hypoventilation, airway obstruction, or apnea.

NEURO-OCULAR DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders  involving  the  visual  system  discussed  in  this  section are limited to those a ff ecting the retina, optic nerve, and intracranial optic system. Degenerative diseases involving this part of the visual system include Leber's optic atrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, and Kearns-Sayer syndrome. Th e most common cause of new-onset blindness during the postoperative period is  ischemic  optic  neuropathy.  Other  causes  of  postoperative visual defects are cortical blindness, retinal artery occlusion, and ophthalmic vein obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leber's Optic Atrophy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leber's optic atrophy, or Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, is characterized by degeneration of the retina and atrophy of the optic nerves culminating in blindness. Th is disorder was the fi rst human disorder for which a mitochondrial pattern of inheritance was de fi nitively described. Th is rare disorder usually presents as loss of central vision in adolescence or early adulthood and is o ft en associated with other neuropathologic conditions, including multiple sclerosis and dystonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinitis Pigmentosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinitis pigmentosa refers to a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of inherited retinopathies characterized by degeneration  of  the  retina. Th ese  debilitating  disorders  collectively  represent  a  common  form  of  human  visual  handicap, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 3000. Examination of the retina shows areas of pigmentation, particularly in the peripheral regions. Vision is lost from the periphery of the retina toward the center until total blindness occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kearns-Sayer Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kearns-Sayer syndrome is characterized by retinitis pigmentosa  associated  with  progressive  external  ophthalmoplegia, typically  manifesting  before  20  years  of  age.  Cardiac  conduction abnormalities, ranging from bundle branch block to complete atrioventricular heart block, are common. Complete heart block can occur abruptly, leading to sudden death. Generalized degeneration of the central nervous system has been observed. Th is fi nding  and  the  o ft en  increased  concentration of protein in the CSF suggest a viral etiology. Although Kearns-Sayer syndrome is rare, it is possible that patients with this disorder will require anesthesia for insertion of implantable cardiac pacemakers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia requires a high index of suspicion for, and preparation to treat, third-degree atrioventricular heart  block.  Transthoracic  pacing  capability  must  be  available. Experience is too limited to recommend speci fi c drugs for  induction  and  maintenance  of  anesthesia.  Presumably,

FIGURE 10-6 Blood supply to retina and optic nerve. Note the greater supply to the anterior portion of the optic nerve via the central retinal artery.

Ischemic Optic Neuropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ischemic  optic  neuropathy  should  be  suspected  in  patients who complain of visual loss during the fi rst  week  following surgery of any form. Ischemic injury to the optic nerve can result in loss of both central and peripheral vision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e optic nerve can be functionally divided into an anterior and a posterior segment based on di ff erences in blood supply (Figure 10-6). Blood supply to the anterior portion is derived from both the central retinal artery and small branches of the ciliary artery. In contrast, blood supply to the posterior segment of the optic nerve is derived from small branches of the ophthalmic and central retinal arteries. Baseline blood fl ow to the posterior segment of the optic nerve is signi fi cantly less than that to the anterior segment. Because of this di ff erence, ischemic events in the anterior and posterior segments of the optic nerve are associated with di ff erent risk factors and physical fi ndings. However, the prognosis, in terms of improvement of vision, is poor in either case. If ischemic optic neuropathy is  suspected,  urgent  ophthalmologic  consultation  should  be obtained so that other treatable causes of perioperative blindness can be ruled out.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANTERIOR ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  visual  loss  associated  with anterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy is  due  to  infarction  within  the  watershed  perfusion zones between the small branches of the short posterior ciliary arteries. Th e  usual  presentation  is  a  sudden,  painless,  monocular visual de fi cit varying in severity from a slight decrease in visual acuity to blindness. Asymptomatic optic disk swelling may be the earliest sign. A congenitally small optic disk is o ft en present. Th e prognosis varies, but the most common outcome is minimal recovery of visual function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e nonarteritic form of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is more likely than the arteritic form to manifest during the postoperative period. It is usually attributed to decreased oxygen delivery to the optic disk in association with hypotension and/or anemia. Th is  form  of  visual  loss  has  been  associated with  hemorrhagic  hypotension  (e.g.,  from  gastrointestinal hemorrhage), anemia, cardiac surgery, head and neck surgery, cardiac arrest, and hemodialysis. It may also occur spontaneously. Arteritic anterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy,  which  is less  common  than  the  nonarteritic  form,  is  associated  with in fl ammation  and  thrombosis  of  the  short  posterior  ciliary arteries. Th e diagnosis is con fi rmed by demonstration of giant cell  arteritis  on  a  biopsy  sample  from  the  temporal  artery. High-dose corticosteroids are used to treat arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and to provide prophylaxis against disease manifestation in the contralateral eye.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTERIOR ISCHEMIC OPTIC NEUROPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posterior  ischemic  optic  neuropathy  presents  as  acute  loss of vision and visual fi eld defects similar to those in anterior ischemic  optic  neuropathy.  It  is  presumed  to  be  caused  by decreased oxygen delivery to the posterior portion of the optic nerve between the optic foramen and the point of entry of the central retinal artery. Spontaneous occurrence is less frequent than with anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. However, posterior ischemic optic neuropathy is more common than anterior ischemic optic neuropathy as a cause of visual loss in the perioperative period. Th ere may be no abnormal ophthalmoscopic fi ndings initially, which re fl ects retrobulbar involvement of the optic nerve. Mild disk edema is present a ft er a few days, and CT of the orbits  may  reveal  enlargement  of  the  intraorbital optic nerve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  etiology  of postoperative  ischemic  optic  neuropathy appears  to  be  multifactorial  and  may  include  hypotension, anemia,  congenital  absence  of  the  central  retinal  artery, altered  optic  disk  anatomy,  air  embolism,  venous  obstruction, and infection. It has been described following prolonged spine surgery performed in the prone position, cardiac surgery, radical neck dissection, and hip arthroplasty. Associated nonsurgical, but potentially contributory, factors include cardiac arrest, acute treatment of malignant hypertension, blunt

trauma, and severe anemia. It has been hypothesized that the risk of posterior ischemic optic neuropathy may be reduced by avoiding anemia, hypotension, excessive fl uid administration, and excessive use of vasopressors, but such speculation has not been proven.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cortical Blindness

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cortical blindness may follow profound hypotension or circulatory arrest/cardiac arrest as a result of hypoperfusion and infarction of watershed areas in the parietal or occipital lobes. Th is form of blindness has been observed a ft er many di ff erent kinds of surgical procedures, such as cardiac surgery, craniotomy, laryngectomy, and cesarean section, and can result from air  or  particulate  emboli  during  cardiopulmonary  bypass. Cortical blindness is characterized by loss of vision but retention  of  pupillary  reactions  to  light  and  normal fi ndings  on funduscopic examination. Patients may not be aware of focal vision loss, which usually improves with time. Th e presence of abnormalities in the parietal or occipital lobes on CT or MRI scans con fi rms the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinal Artery Occlusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central retinal artery occlusion presents as painless monocular blindness. It is due to occlusion of a branch of the retinal artery. Visual fi eld defects are o ft en severe initially but, unlike with ischemic optic neuropathy, improve with time. Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals a pale edematous retina. Unlike ischemic  optic  neuropathy,  central  retinal  artery  occlusion is  o ft en  caused  by  emboli  from  an  ulcerated  atherosclerotic plaque  in  the  ipsilateral  carotid  artery.  Many  retinal  artery occlusions are due to emboli during open heart surgery, and these  resolve  promptly.  Vasospasm  or  thrombosis  may  also cause central retinal  artery  occlusion  following  radical  neck surgery  complicated  by  hemorrhage  and  hypotension. Th e condition  can  also  occur  following  intranasal  injection  of α -adrenergic agonists. Stellate ganglion block improves vision in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ophthalmic Venous Obstruction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstruction  of  venous  drainage  from  the  eyes  may  occur intraoperatively when patient positioning results in external pressure on the orbits. Placement in the prone position and use  of  headrests  during  neurosurgical  procedures  require careful  attention  to  ensure  that  the  eyeballs  and  orbits  are free  from  external  compression.  Ophthalmoscopic  examination reveals  engorgement of the veins and edema of the macula.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Major  goals  when  providing  anesthesia  care  for  patients undergoing neurologic surgery include maintenance of  adequate  cerebral  oxygen  delivery,  optimization  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
operative  conditions,  and  facilitation  of  a  rapid,  smooth emergence from anesthesia to allow for immediate assessment of neurologic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In the perioperative period, factors a ff ecting CBF include Pa o 2 and  Pa co 2 ,  systemic  blood  pressure,  cerebral  autoregulation, cerebral venous pressure, and various drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Major techniques to decrease ICP include head elevation, hyperventilation,  CSF  drainage,  and  administration  of hyperosmotic  drugs,  diuretics,  corticosteroids,  and  cerebral vasoconstrictors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Venous  air  embolism  can  occur  in  a  variety  of  circumstances, most commonly in patients who are placed in the sitting  position.  Techniques  available  to  monitor  for  the entrainment of air include precordial Doppler ultrasonography,  transesophageal  echocardiography,  and  measurement of end-tidal oxygen and nitrogen content. Treatment includes discontinuation of nitrous oxide administration, fl ooding of the surgical fi eld with fl uid, aspiration of air via a central venous catheter, and hemodynamic support.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Succinylcholine  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients with neurologic diseases because of its potential to produce a transient increase in ICP and because of the risk of hyperkalemia in the setting of denervating diseases that cause an upregulation of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction.
