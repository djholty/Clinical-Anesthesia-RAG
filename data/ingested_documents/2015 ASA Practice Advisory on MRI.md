Practice Advisory on Anesthetic Care for Magnetic Resonance Imaging

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An Updated Report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Anesthetic Care for Magnetic Resonance Imaging

<!-- PAGE=? -->
P RACTICE  advisories  are systematically developed reports  that  are  intended  to  assist  decision-making in areas of patient care. Advisories provide a synthesis and analysis  of  expert  opinion,  clinical  feasibility  data,  open forum commentary, and consensus surveys. Practice advisories developed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) are not intended as standards, guidelines, or absolute requirements and their use cannot guarantee any specific outcome. They may be adopted, modified, or rejected according to clinical needs and constraints and are not intended to replace local institutional policies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practice advisories are not supported by scientific literature to the same degree as standards or guidelines because of the lack of sufficient numbers of adequately controlled studies. Practice advisories are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This document updates the 'Practice Advisory on Anesthetic Care for Magnetic Resonance Imaging,' adopted by the ASA in 2008 and published in 2009.*

Methodology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A. Definition of Anesthetic Care for MRI and High-risk Imaging

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This  Advisory  defines  anesthetic  care  for  magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) as moderate sedation, deep sedation, monitored anesthesia care, general anesthesia, or ventilatory and critical care support. High-risk imaging refers to imaging in patients with medical or health-related risks, imaging with equipment-related risks, and procedure-related risks such as MRI-guided surgery, minimally  invasive  procedures  ( e.g. ,  focused  ultrasound  and radiofrequency ablation), or cardiac and airway imaging studies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 What	other	guideline	documents	are	available	on	this	topic?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o		 This	 Practice	 Advisory	 updates	 the	 'Practice	 Advisory	 on Anesthetic	Care	for	Magnetic	Resonance	Imaging:	A	Report	 by	 the	 American	 Society	 of	 Anesthesiologists	 Task Force	on	Anesthetic	Care	for	Magnetic	Resonance	Imaging'	adopted	by	the	American	Society	of	Anesthesiologists in	2008	and	published	in	2009. 1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Why	was	this	Practice	Advisory	developed?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o		 In	October	2013,	the	Committee	on	Standards	and	Practice Parameters	elected	to	search	for	new	evidence	to	determine if	recommendations	in	the	existing	practice	advisory	continue to	be	supported	by	current	evidence.	The	resultant	Practice Advisory,	presented	in	this	issue,	includes	an	update	of	the scientific	literature	and	additional	explanatory	information.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 How	does	this	statement	differ	from	existing	guidelines?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o		 This	updated	American	Society	of	Anesthesiologists	Advisory differs	 from	 the	 existing	 advisory	 because	 it	 provides	 new evidence	obtained	from	recent	scientific	literature	as	well	as additional	information.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o		 New	 evidence	 presented	 includes	 acknowledgment	 that the	Food	and	Drug	administration	has	approved	a	magnetic resonance	imaging	conditional	implantable	cardiac	pacing generator	and	lead	system,	which	is	commercially	available, and	will	require	increased	awareness	among	providers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o		 Consistent	 with	 current	 guidelines	 published	 by	 the American	College	of	Radiologists,	categories	of	various levels	of	magnetic	resonance	imaging	facilities	have	been eliminated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o		 The	 updated	American	Society	of	Anesthesiologists	Practice	 Advisory	 differs	 from	 documents	 published	 by	 other organizations	by	focusing	specifically	on	anesthetic	care	of patients	 in	 the	 magnetic	 resonance	 imaging	 environment, whereas	 other	 organizations'	 guidelines	 are	 focused	 on broader	safety	issues	in	that	environment.

B. Purpose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The MRI suite is a hazardous location because of the presence of a very strong static magnetic field, high-frequency electromagnetic  (radiofrequency)  waves,  and  a  time-varied (pulsed) magnetic field. Secondary dangers of these energy sources include high-level acoustic noise, systemic and localized heating, and accidental projectiles. There may be significant challenges to anesthetic administration and monitoring capabilities due to static and dynamic magnetic fields as well as radiofrequency energy emissions. Direct patient observation may be compromised by noise, darkened environment, obstructed line of sight, and other characteristics unique to this environment ( e.g. , distractions). Unlike a conventional operating room, the MRI environment frequently requires the  anesthesiologist  to  assume  broader  responsibility  for immediate patient care decisions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The purposes of this updated Advisory are to: (1) promote patient and staff safety in the MRI environment, (2) prevent  the  occurrence  of  MRI-associated  accidents,  (3) promote optimal  patient  management  and  reduce  adverse patient outcomes associated with MRI, (4) identify potential equipment-related hazards in the MRI environment, (5) identify  limitations  of  physiologic  monitoring  capabilities in the MRI environment, and (6) identify potential health hazards ( e.g. , high decibel levels) of the MRI environment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C. Focus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This updated Advisory focuses on MRI settings where anesthetic  care  is  provided.  Four  zones  within  the  MRI  suite have been identified, with ascending designations indicating increased hazard areas. 4,5 These areas within the MRI suite are categorized as zones I-IV (appendix 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
D. Application

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This updated Advisory is intended for use by anesthesiologists or other individuals working under the supervision of an anesthesiologist and applies to anesthetic care performed, supervised,  or  medically  directed  by  anesthesiologists  or to  moderate  sedation  care  supervised  by  other  physicians. Because the safe conduct of MRI procedures requires close collaboration and prompt coordination between anesthesiologists, radiologists, MRI technologists, and nurses, some responsibilities  are  shared  among  the  disciplines.  When shared  responsibilities  are  described  in  this  Advisory,  the intent  is  to  give  the  anesthesiologist  a  starting  point  for participating in the allocation and understanding of shared responsibilities.  The  Advisory  may  also  serve  as  a  resource for other physicians and healthcare professionals ( e.g. , technologists, nurses, safety officers, hospital administrators, biomedical engineers, and industry representatives).

receive minimal sedation (anxiolysis) in order to complete the scan or procedure safely and comfortably.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
E. Task Force Members and Consultants

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  2013,  the  ASA  Committee  on  Standards  and  Practice Parameters requested that scientific evidence for this Advisory be updated. The update consists of an evaluation of literature that includes new studies obtained after publication of the original Advisory.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The original Advisory was developed by an ASA-appointed Task Force of 13 members. These individuals included 10 anesthesiologists in private and academic practice from various geographic areas of the United States, a radiologist, and two consulting methodologists from the ASA Committee on Standards and Practice Parameters.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Task Force developed the original Advisory by means of a seven-step process. First, they reached consensus on the criteria for evidence. Second, a systematic review and evaluation was performed on original published research studies from peer-reviewed journals relevant to MRI safety. Third, a panel of expert consultants was asked to: (1) participate in opinion surveys on the effectiveness of various MRI safety strategies  and  (2)  review  and  comment  on  a  draft  of  the Advisory  developed  by  the  Task  Force.  Fourth,  opinions about  the  Advisory  were  solicited  from  a  random  sample of  active  members  of  the  ASA.  Fifth,  the Task  Force  held an open forum at two major national meetings† to solicit input on its draft recommendations. Sixth, the consultants were surveyed to assess their opinions on the feasibility of implementing this Advisory. Seventh, all available information was used to build consensus within the Task Force to create the final document. A summary of recommendations is found in appendix 2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
F. Availability and Strength of Evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparation  of  this  update  used  the  same  methodological process as was used in the original Advisory to obtain new scientific evidence. Opinion-based evidence obtained from the original Advisory is reported in this update. The  protocol  for  reporting  each  source  of  evidence is described below.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Scientific  Evidence. Scientific  evidence  used  in  the  development  of  this  updated  Advisory  is  based  on  cumulative findings from literature published in peer-reviewed journals. Literature  citations  are  obtained  from  PubMed  and  other healthcare  databases,  direct  Internet  searches,  Task  Force members,  liaisons  with  other  organizations,  and  manual searches of references located in reviewed articles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Findings from the aggregated literature are reported in the  text  of  the  Advisory  by  evidence  category,  level,  and direction. Evidence  categories  refer specifically to the strength  and  quality  of  the research  design of  the  studies. Category A evidence represents results obtained from randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  and  Category  B evidence  represents  observational  results  obtained  from

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nonrandomized study designs or RCTs without pertinent controls.  When  available,  Category  A  evidence  is  given precedence over Category B evidence in the reporting of results. These evidence categories are further divided into evidence  levels.  Evidence  levels  refer  specifically  to  the strength and quality of the summarized study findings ( i.e. , statistical findings, type of data, and the number of studies reporting/replicating the findings) within the two evidence categories. For this document, only the highest level of evidence is included in the summary report for each intervention, including a directional designation of benefit, harm, or equivocality for each outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category  A: RCTs  report  comparative  findings  between clinical  interventions  for  specified  outcomes.  Statistically significant  ( P <  0.01)  outcomes  are  designated  as  either beneficial  (B)  or  harmful  (H)  for  the  patient;  statistically nonsignificant findings are designated as equivocal (E).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 1: The literature contains a sufficient number of RCTs to conduct meta-analysis,‡ and meta-analytic findings from these aggregated studies are reported as  evidence.  No  meta-analyses  were  conducted  for this Advisory.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level  2:  The  literature  contains  multiple  RCTs,  but the number of RCTs is not sufficient to conduct a viable meta-analysis for the purpose of this updated Advisory.  Findings  from  these  RCTs  are  reported as evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 3: The literature contains a single RCT, and findings from this study are reported as evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category B: Observational studies or RCTs without pertinent comparison  groups  may  permit inference of  beneficial  or harmful relationships among  clinical interventions and outcomes. Inferred findings are given a directional designation of beneficial (B), harmful (H), or equivocal (E). For studies that report statistical findings, the threshold for significance is P < 0.01.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 1: The literature contains observational comparisons ( e.g. ,  cohort,  case-control  research  designs)  between clinical interventions for a specified outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 2: The literature contains observational studies with associative statistics ( e.g. , relative risk, correlation, and sensitivity/specificity).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 3: The literature contains noncomparative observational studies with descriptive statistics ( e.g., frequencies and percentages).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Level 4: The literature contains case reports.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
‡  All  meta-analyses  are  conducted  by  the  ASA/CSPP  methodology group. Meta-analyses from other sources are reviewed but not included as evidence in this document.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
§  When an even number of responses are obtained, the median value is determined by calculating the arithmetic mean of the two middle values. Ties are calculated by a predetermined formula.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Insufficient  Literature: The lack of  sufficient  scientific evidence  in  the  literature  may  occur  when  the  evidence is  either  unavailable  ( i.e. ,  no  pertinent  studies  found) or  inadequate.  Inadequate  literature  cannot  be  used  to assess relationships among clinical interventions and outcomes because such literature does not permit a clear interpretation of findings due to methodological concerns ( e.g. ,  confounding in study design or implementation) or does  not  meet  the  criteria  for  content  as  defined  in  the 'Focus' of the Advisory.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opinion-based Evidence. The  original  Advisory  contained formal survey information collected from expert consultants and a random sample of members of the ASA. Additional information  was  obtained  from  open-forum  presentations and  other  invited  and  public  sources.  All  opinion-based evidence  relevant  to  each  topic  ( e.g. ,  original  survey  data, original  open-forum  testimony,  Internet-based  comments, letters, and editorials) is considered in the development of this Advisory. However, only the findings obtained from formal surveys are reported.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opinion  surveys  were  developed  by  the  Task  Force  to address  each  clinical  intervention  identified  in  the  document. Identical surveys were distributed into two groups of respondents: expert consultants and ASA members.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Expert Opinion: Survey responses from Task Force-appointed expert consultants are reported in summary form in the text. A complete listing of consultant survey responses is reported in table 1 in appendix 3.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Membership  Opinion: Survey  responses  from  a  random sample of members of the ASA and, when appropriate, responses  from  members  of  other  organizations  with expertise  in  the  selected  topics  of  interest  are  reported in  summary  form  in  the  text.  A  complete  listing  of ASA member survey responses is reported in table 2 in appendix 3.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Survey responses are recorded using a 5-point scale and summarized based on median values. §

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Strongly  Agree: Median  score  of  5  (at  least  50%  of  the responses are 5)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Agree: Median score of 4 (at least 50% of the responses are 4 or 4 and 5)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advisories

<!-- PAGE=? -->
I. Education

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MRI safety education includes, but is not limited to, the following topics: (1) MRI magnet hazards in zones III and IV, (2) challenges and limitations of monitoring, and (3) longterm health hazards.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Literature Findings. There is insufficient published evidence to evaluate the effect of education regarding magnet hazards, monitoring  limitations,  or  long-term  health  hazards  associated  with  MRI.  One  observational  study  examined  the potential long-term health hazards of pregnant MRI workers  and  pregnant  non-MRI workers and found no significant difference in the relative risk of early delivery, low birth weight, or spontaneous abortions ( Category B2-E evidence ). 6 Survey Findings. The consultants  and  ASA  members strongly  agree  that  all  anesthesiologists  should  have  general  safety  education  on  the  unique  physical  environment of the MRI scanner. The ASA members agree and the consultants strongly agree that all anesthesiologists should have specific education regarding the features of individual scanners within their institution. The ASA members agree and the consultants strongly agree that anesthesiologists should work in collaboration with radiologists, technologists, and physicists within their institutions to develop safety training programs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advisory Statements for Education

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 All anesthesiologists should have general safety education on the unique physical environment of the MRI scanner  and  specific  education  regarding  the  specific features of individual scanners within their institution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Education should emphasize safety for entering zones III  and  IV ,  with  special  emphasis  on  hazards  in  this environment and effects on monitoring capabilities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Education should address potential health hazards ( e.g. , high decibel levels and high intensity magnetic fields) and necessary precautions to deal with the specific field strength and the safety of the MRI scanners within their institutions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Education  should  include  information  regarding  ferromagnetic  items  ( e.g. , stethoscopes, pens, wallets, watches, hair clips, name tags, pagers, cell phones, credit cards, and batteries) and implantable devices ( e.g. , spinal cord stimulators and implanted objects) that should not be brought into zones III and IV of the MRI suite or should be brought in with caution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Anesthesiologists  should  work  in  collaboration  with radiologists,  technologists,  and  physicists  within  their institutions to ensure that the above topics are included in their safety training programs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesiology 2015; 122:495-520

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Education should include how to safely respond to code blue situations in zones III and IV, and this information should be integrated into protocols for the designated code blue team.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
II. Screening of Anesthetic Care Providers and Ancillary Support Personnel

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  MRI  medical  director  or  designated  technologist  is responsible for access to zones III and IV. Screening of all individuals  entering  zone  III  is  necessary  to  prevent  accidental incursions of ferromagnetic materials or inadvertent exposure of personnel with foreign bodies or implanted ferromagnetic items.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Literature Findings. The literature is insufficient to evaluate whether the screening of anesthesia care providers and ancillary support personnel improves safety in the MRI suite. Survey Findings. The ASA members agree and the consultants strongly agree that the anesthesiologist should work in collaboration with the MRI medical director or designee to ensure that all anesthesia team personnel entering zone III or IV have been properly screened.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advisory Statements for Screening of Anesthetic Care Providers and Ancillary Support Personnel

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The anesthesiologist should work in collaboration with the MRI medical director or designee ( e.g. , safety officer) to ensure that all anesthesia team personnel entering zone III  or  IV  have been screened for the presence of ferromagnetic materials, foreign bodies, or implanted devices.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
III. Patient Screening

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patient screening consists of determining patient and equipment-related risks for adverse outcomes associated with MRI procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patient-related Risks

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risks  related  to  the  patient  may  include  age-related  risks, health-related  risks,  and  risks  from  foreign  bodies  located in or on the patient or implanted ferromagnetic items. Agerelated risks apply to neonates or premature infants and elderly patients. Health-related risks include, but are not limited to: (1) need for intensive or critical care, (2) impaired respiratory function ( e.g. ,  tonsillar hypertrophy and sleep apnea), (3) changes in level of sedation, muscle relaxation, or ventilation, (4) hemodynamic instability and vasoactive infusion requirements, or (5) comorbidities that may contribute to adverse MRI effects ( e.g. , burns or temperature increases in patients with obesity or peripheral vascular disease). Foreign bodies include  nonmedical  ferromagnetic  items  imbedded in the patient ( e.g. , eyeliner tattoos and metallic intraocular fragments) or attached to the patient ( e.g. ,  pierced jewelry and magnetic dental keepers). Implanted ferromagnetic items may include items such as aneurysm clips, prosthetic heart valves, or coronary arterial stents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Literature  Findings. One  comparative  study  reports  that neonates  undergoing  MRI  demonstrate  increased  fluctuations  in  heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  and  oxygen  saturation levels compared with neonates not undergoing an MRI ( Category B1-H evidence ). 7 Two observational studies report that premature neonates can experience heart rate fluctuations, decreases in oxygen saturation, and increases in temperature during  MRI  ( Category  B3-H  evidence ). 8,9 One  case  report indicates that a child with a history of prior cardiac arrest experienced  a  cardiac  arrest  during  MRI  ( Category  B3-H evidence ). 10 Four  observational  studies 11-14 and  two  case reports 15,16 indicate that patients with impaired renal function are at risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis after gadolinium administered for MRI ( Category B3/4-H evidence ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Case reports indicate that exposure of iron filings to the magnetic field may result in hemorrhage 10,17 and exposure of eyeliner tattoos may result in image artifacts, burns, swelling, or puffiness 10,18-20 ( Category B4-H evidence ). Numerous observational studies and case reports indicate interactions with the magnetic field ( e.g. , movements, displacements, and image artifacts) and increases in temperature during MRI for ferromagnetic items such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prosthetic  heart  valves,  intravenous  infusion  pumps,  coronary  arterial  stents,  and  implanted  dental  magnet  keepers ( Category B3/4-H evidence ). 21-46

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Survey  Findings. Both  the  consultants  and  ASA  members strongly agree that, for every case, the anesthesiologist should communicate  with  the  patient  and  radiologist  or  referring physician to determine whether the patient has a high-risk medical condition. In addition, they both strongly agree that if  the  patient  presents  with  a  high-risk  medical  condition, the anesthesiologist should collaborate with all participants, including the referring physician, radiologist, and technologist, to determine how the patient will be managed during the MRI procedure. Both the consultants and ASA members agree that, for patients with acute or severe renal insufficiency, the anesthesiologist should not administer gadolinium because of the elevated risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Equipment-related Risks

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patient equipment-related risks include, but are not limited to:  (1)  physiologic  monitors,  (2)  invasive  monitors  ( e.g. , intravascular catheters), (3) intubation equipment, (4) oxygenation  and  ventilation  equipment,  and  (5)  pacemakers, implanted cardiodefibrillators, and other implanted devices ( e.g. , deep brain stimulators, vagal or phrenic nerve stimulators, and middle-ear or cochlear implants).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Literature  Findings. One  case  report  notes  that  cardiac monitor leads interfered with an MRI scan ( Category B4-H evidence ). 10 One  observational  study  and  one  case  report indicate that fire or burns occurred beneath or near cardiac monitor electrodes ( Category B3/4-H evidence ). 47,48 Five case reports note that burns occurred from the looping of a temperature probe or pulse oximetry cables ( Category B4-H evidence ). 49-53 One  observational  study  reports  ferromagnetic components in ventilators, 54 and three case reports describe projectile nitrous oxide or oxygen tanks 55-57 ( Category B3/4H  evidence ). Additional observational studies and  case reports  indicate  interactions  of  pacemakers  or  implanted cardioverter defibrillators with MRI scanning including, but not limited to, pacing artifacts, reed switch closure, generator  movement  or  displacement,  alterations  of  pacing  rate, and temperature increases ( Category B3/4-H evidence ). 10,58-87 Two  observational  studies  report  palpitations,  rapid  heart rate, and discomfort at the pacemaker pocket after MRI. 78,88 Finally,  two cases of cardiac arrest are reported in patients with pacemakers during or after an MRI scan; in one case, the patient died ( Category B4-H evidence ). 10,60

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Three  observational  studies  report  image  artifacts  when MRI is performed on patients with neurostimulators, infusion pumps, implantable spinal fusion stimulators, or cochlear implants ( Category B3-H evidence ). 89-91 Six observational studies report increased temperatures in patients with deep brain stimulators, neurostimulators, or spinal cord stimulators, 92-97 and three report displacement of leads, pulse generators, or other  components  of  deep  brain  stimulators  or  middle  ear prostheses during MRI scans ( Category B3-H evidence ). 98-100 Survey Findings. Both the consultants and ASA members agree that, for every case, the anesthesiologist should communicate with the radiologist or referring physician to determine whether the patient requires equipment that may pose a risk during the scan. In addition, they agree that anesthesiologists  should  determine  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of the equipment needed by the patient during the procedure for  each  MRI  location.  Further,  the  consultants  and  ASA members strongly agree that anesthesiologists should work with their institutions to properly identify and label anesthesia-related equipment according to convention for each MRI scanner. The ASA members agree and the consultants strongly agree that care should be taken to assure that anesthesia equipment does not interfere with image acquisition or  quality.  Both  the  consultants  and  ASA  members  agree that, in general, MRI should not be performed on patients with implanted electronic devices. Finally, both the consultants and ASA members strongly agree that, when MRI is considered essential by the referring physician and consulting radiologist, a plan for managing patients with implanted electronic  devices  during  the  scan  should  be  developed  in collaboration with the referring physician, medical director or on-site radiologist, and other appropriate consultants.

 The  anesthesiologist  should  communicate  with  the technologist to ensure that the patient has been screened for  the  presence  of  foreign  bodies on the patient ( e.g. , pierced jewelry and rings) before entering zone III.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 If a patient presents with a high-risk medical condition, the anesthesiologist should collaborate with all participants, including the referring physician, radiologist, and technologist, to determine how the patient will be managed during the MRI procedure. Anticipated changes in level of sedation, muscle relaxation, or ventilation may also place a patient in a high-risk situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with acute or severe renal insufficiency, the anesthesiologist should not administer gadolinium because of the elevated risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. ║

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Anesthesiologists  should  work  with  their  institutions to properly identify and label anesthesia-related equipment according to convention (safe, unsafe, or conditional) for each MRI scanner.#

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 For each MRI location, anesthesiologists should determine  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  the  equipment needed by the patient during the procedure. In addition,  care  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  equipment does not interfere with image acquisition or quality.

# Equipment is categorized as safe, unsafe, or conditional for use in the MRI environment. MRI 'safe' equipment is identified by the American Society for Testing and Materials as having no ferromagnetic parts or radiofrequency interference. MRI 'unsafe' equipment is  identified  as  having  ferromagnetic  parts  or  being  affected  by radiofrequency interference. MRI 'conditional' equipment may be safe in certain locations of the suite depending on gauss line locations,  but  cannot  be  identified  as  having  no  ferromagnetic  parts (see American Society for Testing and Materials Practice Standards F2503, F2119, and F2052, www.astm.org).

 Other implanted electronic devices also pose a hazard in the MRI environment. These devices and associated wiring may transfer energy during the MRI scan, causing tissue damage, malfunction of the device, image artifacts, and device displacement. MRI may be performed on a limited  basis  for  patients  with  certain  implanted  electronic devices ( e.g. ,  deep brain stimulators, vagal nerve stimulators, phrenic nerve stimulators, wire-containing thermodilution catheters, or cochlear implants). In consultation  with  the  referring  physician,  the  radiologist responsible for the procedure, and the neurosurgeon, the anesthesiologist should ensure that the presence of the device has been noted and determined to be MRI safe/ conditional before imaging of these patients.

IV. Preparation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparation  consists  of  determining  and  implementing  an individualized  anesthetic  plan  before  the  MRI  procedure begins.  In  addition  to  the  anesthetic  plan,  preparation includes a plan for optimal positioning of equipment and personnel in the MRI suite during the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Literature  Findings. The  literature  is  insufficient  to  determine  whether  active  preparation  or  pre-MRI  planning reduces  the  frequency  of  adverse  events.  One  case  report indicates that misinformation about the type of aneurysm clip resulted in intracerebral hemorrhage and death, and a second case report indicates that a lack of communication among physicians caring for a pacemaker patient resulted in the death of the patient ( Category B4-H evidence ). 34,101

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Survey  Findings. Both  the  consultants  and  ASA  members strongly agree that, for every case, the anesthesiologist should prepare, with support personnel, a plan for providing optimal  anesthetic  care  within  the  special  environment  of  the MRI suite. They both strongly agree that the anesthesiologist should communicate with the radiology personnel to determine the requirements of the scan. The ASA members agree and the consultants strongly agree that the anesthesiologist should collaborate with the magnetic resonance (MR) technologist and/or facility biomedical engineer to determine and demarcate the optimal and safe location of movable equipment  in  relation  to  the  gauss  lines  within  the  MRI  suite. They both strongly agree that, because line of sight within the bore will vary depending on the facility, the anesthesiologist should choose a location or position for optimal patient observation  and  vigilance  during  delivery  of  care,  whether in zone III or IV. Finally, they both strongly agree that the anesthesiologist should prepare a plan for rapidly summoning additional personnel in the event of an emergency.

Advisory Statements for Preparation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For every case, the anesthesiologist should prepare, with support  personnel,  a  plan  for  providing  optimal  anesthetic  care  within  the  special  environment of the MRI suite. In addition to addressing the medical needs of the patient, features of the plan should include (1) requirements of the scan and personnel needs, (2) positioning of equipment, (3) special requirements or unique issues of patient or imaging study, (4) positioning of the anesthesiologist and the patient, and (5) planning for emergencies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The anesthesiologist should communicate with the radiology personnel to determine the requirements for the scan ( e.g. , duration of the scan, position of the patient or area of the body in the scanner, positioning of receiver coils, and need for periods of paused respiration). The anesthesiologist should communicate with other anesthesia team members regarding individual roles for anesthetic care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The  anesthesiologist  should  collaborate  with  the  MR technologist  and/or  facility  biomedical  engineer  to determine  and  demarcate  the  optimal  and  safe  location of movable equipment in relation to the gauss lines within the MRI suite.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because line of sight within the bore will vary depending on the facility, the anesthesiologist should choose a location or position for optimal patient observation and vigilance during delivery of care, whether in zone III or IV . In particular, anesthesiologists should have (1) a clear line of sight of the patient and physiologic monitors, whether by direct observation or by video camera, (2) anesthetic delivery  equipment  located  for  optimal  control  of  anesthetic depth and rapid intervention, and (3) access to hospital information  systems  integral  to  patient  care.  In  preparing for positioning, the anesthesiologist should take into account potential electromagnetic and auditory hazards.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Anesthesiologists  should  prepare  a  plan  for  rapidly summoning  additional  personnel  in  the  event  of  an emergency. Because the MRI suite is frequently located in  an  isolated  area  of  the  facility,  the  anesthesiologist should ensure that (1) emergency equipment and drugs are immediately accessible, (2) emergency communication ( e.g. , phone or code button) is immediately available, and (3) an evacuation plan is in place, including an  appropriate  location  outside  the  scan  room  (zone IV)  for  resuscitation.  This  location  should  be  complete with physiologic monitors, oxygen, suction, and other  appropriate  resuscitation  equipment.  Monitoring requirements, airway management, and emergency preparedness  are  additional  features  that  should  be included in the preparation and planning for an MRI scan and are addressed in section V below.

Features of safe patient management during MRI procedures include (1) monitoring, (2) anesthetic care, (3) airway management, and (4) management of emergencies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Safe monitoring conditions include (1) the use of MRI safe/ conditional monitors, (2) remote monitoring, and (3) compliance with ASA standards. 102

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Literature  Findings. Three  observational  studies  indicate that  the  use  of  MRI  compatible  monitoring  equipment resulted in no radiofrequency interference, interruptions in scanning,  or  artifacts  ( Category  B3-B  evidence ). 103-105 Five observational  studies  demonstrate  that  remote  monitoring for heart rate, blood pressure, auscultation, respiration, and chest wall movement can be performed safely and effectively ( Category B3-B evidence ). 104,106-109 One observational study reported that compliance with the ASA 'Standards for Basic Anesthesia Monitoring can be obtained, provided that the monitoring  equipment  is  properly  tested  before  an  MRI ( Category B3-E evidence ).' 110

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Survey Findings. The consultants and ASA members both strongly  agree  that  MRI  patients  should  be  monitored  in a  manner  consistent  with  the  ASA  'Standards  for  Basic Anesthesia  Monitoring.'  In  addition,  they  both  strongly agree that (1) anesthesiologists should be familiar with the expected limitations of available monitoring equipment, (2) the anesthesiologist should make sure that all monitors used in zone IV are safe/conditional for the scan, and (3) a monitor should be available to view vital signs from zone III when the anesthesia care provider is not in zone IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advisory Statements for Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 MRI patients should be monitored in a manner consistent with the ASA 'Standards for Basic Anesthesia Monitoring.'  Anesthesiologists  should  be  familiar  with  the expected limitations of available monitoring equipment. The Task Force notes that information from electrocardiograms may be limited due to superimposed voltages from blood flow in the high magnetic field ( e.g. , ST segment interpretation may be unreliable, even with highly filtered monitors).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The anesthesiologist should make sure that all monitors used in zone IV are safe/conditional for the scan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A monitor should be available to view vital signs from zone III when the anesthesia care provider is not in zone IV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Additional care should be taken in positioning electrocardiogram and other monitor leads to eliminate burns, even with nonferromagnetic leads.

Anesthetic Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Literature  Findings. Observational  studies  report  a  high rate  of  success  in  imaging  of  moderately  sedated  patients ( Category  B3-B  evidence ). 111-118 However,  imaging  failures or  motion  artifacts  may  still  occur  ( Category  B3-H  evidence ). 119-122 Observational studies report a high rate of successful imaging in patients receiving deep sedation or light anesthesia, with low rates of motion artifacts ( Category B3-B evidence ). 123-127 One RCT reports equivocal findings for scan

repeats when light anesthesia is compared with general anesthesia ( Category A3-E evidence ). 128 Observational studies and case reports also indicate that respiratory depression, oxygen desaturation, bronchospasm, drowsiness, agitation, and vomiting may occur with moderate sedation or light anesthesia ( Category  B3/4-H  evidence ). 103,112,118-120,122,123,125-127,129-145 The Task Force believes that automated apnea monitoring (by detection of exhaled carbon dioxide or other means) may decrease risks during both moderate and deep sedation. Survey Findings. Both the consultants and ASA members strongly agree that, in general, because MRI is a nonpainful procedure, lighter levels  of  anesthesia  may  be  appropriate, recognizing that institutional circumstances, patient characteristics, and anesthesiologist preference may warrant more aggressive  airway  management  and  deeper  anesthetic  levels.  They  both  strongly  agree  that  anesthesiologists  should ensure that patients who receive moderate or deep sedation are monitored in a manner consistent with their institution's protocol for monitoring similarly sedated patients elsewhere in  the  facility.  In  addition,  they  both  strongly  agree  that equipment and drugs for anesthetic care in the MRI suite should mirror what is available in the operating room. Both the consultants and ASA members are equivocal that, when an MRI safe/conditional anesthesia machine is not available, inhalation anesthetics may be administered from an anesthesia machine inside zone III via an elongated circuit through a wave guide. Finally, both the consultants and ASA members agree that, if total intravenous anesthesia is used, it should be administered by using: (1) MRI safe/conditional pumps in zone IV, (2) traditional ( i.e. , MRI unsafe) pumps in zone III with intravenous tubing passed through a wave guide, or (3) periodic bolus injections in either zone III or IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Advisory Statements for Anesthetic Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Although lighter levels of anesthesia may be appropriate during an MRI scan, the anesthesiologist should be aware that  these  lighter  levels  may  result  in  airway  complications ( e.g. , laryngospasm, coughing, or other airway compromise)  that  may  necessitate  interruption  of  the  scan for urgent treatment and alteration of anesthetic depth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Anesthesiologists should ensure that patients who receive moderate or deep sedation are monitored in a manner consistent with their institution's protocol for monitoring similarly sedated patients elsewhere in the facility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Monitoring of exhaled carbon dioxide should be considered for all patients receiving deep sedation and for patients whose ventilation cannot be directly observed during moderate sedation.‡‡ The Task Force cautions that, because ventilation and oxygenation are separate though related physiological processes, monitoring oxygenation by pulse oximetry is not a substitute for monitoring ventilatory function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Equipment and drugs for anesthetic care in the MRI suite should mirror what is available in other anesthetizing locations including: (1) an integrated anesthesia machine, medical gases, and waste anesthesia gas disposal or gas scavenging, when inhalational anesthesia is administered, (2) suction, (3) adequate electrical outlets and lighting, and (4) storage areas for equipment and drugs.  The  Task  Force  recognizes  that  physical  plant variability exists among institutions. §§

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Equipment used in the MRI suite should be appropriate for the age and size of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 MRI  safe/conditional  anesthesia  machines  are  always preferred for use in an MRI facility. ║║ However, when an  MRI  safe/conditional  anesthesia  machine  is  not available, inhalational anesthetics can be administered from an anesthesia machine inside zone III via an elongated  circuit  through  a  wave  guide.##  Although  this method of anesthetic delivery was commonplace before the  commercial  manufacture  of  MRI  safe/conditional anesthesia machines, this practice is inherently cumbersome and may be prone to more possibilities for mishaps than the use of an anesthesia machine specifically designed for the MRI environment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Alternatively, if total intravenous anesthesia is used, it should  be  administered  by  using:  (1)  MRI  safe/conditional  pumps  in  zone  IV,  (2)  traditional  ( i.e. ,  MRI unsafe)  pumps  in  zone  III  with  intravenous  tubing passed through a wave guide, or (3) periodic bolus injections in either zone III or IV. Although an anesthesia machine may not be required for the administration of total intravenous anesthesia, there must be equipment immediately available for the administration of positive pressure ventilation with oxygen.

Both the consultants and ASA members strongly agree that, if the patient is at risk for airway compromise, more aggressive airway management should be instituted because the patient's airway may be less accessible when the patient is in the scanner. Both the consultants and ASA members strongly agree that (1) complex airway management  ( e.g. ,  fiberoptic  intubation)  should  be  performed in a controlled environment outside zone IV, (2) alternative airway devices should be immediately available in the MRI suite,  and  (3)  suction  equipment  should  be  immediately accessible to the patient's airway at all times.

Management of Emergencies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emergencies in the MR suite include (1) medical emergencies ( e.g. , cardiopulmonary arrest) and (2) environmental emergencies ( e.g. , quench, fire, and projectiles). The remote location of the scanner within the facility may delay response of support personnel or availability of equipment during an emergency. Literature Findings. The literature is  insufficient  regarding the  management  of  medical  emergencies  ( e.g. ,  cardiopulmonary arrest) or quench in the MR suite. One case report indicates that a fire occurring on the patient was managed by  extinguishing  the  flames,  discontinuing  the  scan,  and immediately removing the patient from the bore ( Category B4 evidence ). 48 Two case reports of projectile nitrous oxide or oxygen tanks indicate that the emergency was managed by removing patients from zone IV and instituting a controlled quench ( Category B4 evidence ). 56,57

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Survey Findings. Both the consultants and ASA members strongly agree that when a patient has a medical emergency in the MRI scanner, the following should occur: (1) initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), when needed, while immediately removing the patient from zone IV, (2) call for help, and (3) transport the patient to a previously designated safe location in proximity to the MRI suite. In addition, they both strongly agree that the designated safe location should contain  the  following  resuscitation  equipment:  (1)  a  defibrillator,  (2)  vital  signs  monitors,  and  (3)  a  code  cart  that includes resuscitation drugs, airway equipment, oxygen, and suction.  The  consultants  and  ASA  members both strongly agree that when a fire occurs in the MRI suite, team members should perform their preassigned fire management tasks as quickly as possible, in accordance with the ASA Practice Advisory for the Prevention and Management of Operating Room Fires. 146 The ASA members agree and the consultants strongly agree that, when a quench occurs, team members should  perform  their  institution's  protocol  in  reaction  to this  occurrence.  In  addition,  the  ASA  members  agree  and the consultants strongly agree that, when a quench occurs, if  possible  (1)  immediately  remove  the  patient  from  zone IV and (2) immediately administer oxygen to the patient. Finally,  both  the  consultants  and  ASA  members  agree that, since powerful static magnetic fields may persist after a  quench or fire, emergency response personnel should be restricted from entering zone IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 A controlled quench may be necessary in order to remove the  patient  from  the  bore.  A  quench  occurs  when  a superconducting magnet turns resistive and catastrophically releases all of the stored energy as heat, boiling off the stored cryogens as gas. The most common cause of quench is an intentional shutdown of the magnet for a life-threatening emergency. Quench may also be the consequence of an unintentional shutdown. If not properly vented, a quench can result in the complete dissipation of oxygen in zone IV, risking hypoxia to the patient and MRI personnel. In addition, entrance to zone IV may not be possible due to high pressure caused by escaping gases, making it impossible to open the door into zone IV . When a quench occurs, team members should perform their institution's protocol in reaction to this occurrence. If possible, immediately remove the patient from zone IV and immediately administer oxygen to the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Powerful static magnetic fields may persist after a quench, and therefore, the usual precautions apply when entering  zone  IV .  Emergency  response  personnel  should  be restricted from entering zone IV during any environmental emergency because of the persistent magnetic field.

Appendix 1. Zone Definitions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Zone I

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This region includes all areas that are freely accessible to the general public. This area is typically outside the MR environment itself and is the area through which patients, healthcare personnel, and other employees of the MR site access the MR environment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Zone II

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This  area  is  the  interface  between  the  publicly  accessible uncontrolled zone I and the strictly controlled zone III (see below). Typically, the patients are greeted in zone II and are not free to move throughout zone II at will, but rather are under the supervision of MR personnel. It is in zone II that the answers to MR screening questions, patient histories, and medical insurance questions are typically obtained.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Zone III

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This area is the region in which free access by unscreened nonMR personnel or ferromagnetic objects or equipment can result in  serious  injury  or  death  as  a  result  of  interactions  between the individuals or equipment and the MR scanner's particular environment. These interactions include, but are not limited to, those with the MR scanner's static and time varying magnetic fields. All access to zone III is to be strictly restricted, with access to regions within it (including zone IV; see below) controlled by, and entirely under the supervision of, MR personnel.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Zone IV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This area is synonymous with the MR scanner magnet room itself. Zone IV, by definition, will always be located within zone III as it is the MR magnet and its associated magnetic field, which generates the existence of zone III.

 For every case, the anesthesiologist should communicate with  the  patient,  referring  physician,  and  radiologist  to determine whether the patient:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Presents with a high-risk medical condition ( e.g. , neonatal status or prematurity; intensive or critical care status; impaired respiratory function; hemodynamic instability and vasoactive infusion requirements; or comorbidities such as obesity and peripheral vascular disease).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Requires equipment ( e.g. , physiologic or invasive monitors; intubation, oxygenation, or ventilation equipment).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Has been screened for implanted devices ( e.g. , pacemakers, cardioverter defibrillators, or nerve stimulators).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Has been screened for implanted ferromagnetic items ( e.g. , surgical clips and prosthetic heart valves).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Has been screened for the presence of imbedded foreign bodies ( e.g. , orbital iron filings and eyeliner tattoos).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The anesthesiologist should communicate with the technologist to ensure that the patient has been screened for the presence of foreign bodies on the patient ( e.g. , pierced jewelry, rings) before entering zone III.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  a  patient  presents  with  high-risk  medical  condition, the  anesthesiologist  should  collaborate  with  all  participants, including the referring physician, radiologist, and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
technologist, to determine how the patient will be managed during the MRI procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Anticipated  changes in level of sedation, muscle relaxation, or ventilation may also place a patient in a highrisk situation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  patients  with  acute  or  severe  renal  insufficiency, the  anesthesiologist  should  not  administer  gadolinium because  of  the  elevated  risk  of  nephrogenic  systemic fibrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesiologists  should  work  with  their  institutions  to properly identify and label anesthesia-related equipment according to convention (safe, unsafe, or conditional) for each MRI scanner.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 For  each  MRI  location,  anesthesiologists  should  determine the safety and effectiveness of the equipment needed by the patient during the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Care should be taken to assure that the patient's equipment does not interfere with image acquisition or quality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Cardiac  pacemakers  and  implantable  cardioverter-defibrillators are generally contraindicated for MRI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   When MRI is considered essential by the referring physician and consulting radiologist, a plan for managing these patients during the scan should be developed in collaboration  with  the  ordering  physician,  medical director,  or  on-site  radiologist  and  other  appropriate consultants  ( e.g. ,  the  patient's  pacemaker  specialist  or cardiologist, the diagnostic radiologist, and the device manufacturer).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 MRI may be performed on a limited basis for patients with  certain  implanted  electronic  devices  ( e.g. ,  deep brain stimulators, vagal nerve stimulators, phrenic nerve stimulators, wire-containing thermodilution catheters, or cochlear implants).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   In consultation with the referring physician, the radiologist responsible for the procedure, and the neurosurgeon, the anesthesiologist should ensure that the presence of the device has been noted and determined to be MRI safe/conditional before imaging of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
IV. Preparation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 For every case, the anesthesiologist should prepare, with support personnel, a plan for providing optimal anesthetic care within the special environment of the MRI suite.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   In addition to addressing the medical needs of the patient, features of the plan should include (1) requirements of the scan and personnel needs, (2) positioning of equipment, (3) special requirements or unique issues of patient or imaging study, (4) positioning of the anesthesiologist and the patient, and (5) planning for emergencies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The anesthesiologist should communicate with the radiology personnel to determine the requirements for the scan

<!-- PAGE=? -->
( e.g. , duration of the scan, position of the patient or area of the body in the scanner, positioning of receiver coils, and need for periods of paused respiration).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The  anesthesiologist  should  communicate  with  other anesthesia  team  members  regarding  individual  roles  for anesthetic care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The anesthesiologist should collaborate with the MR technologist and/or facility biomedical engineer to determine and demarcate the optimal and safe location of movable equipment in relation to the gauss lines within the MRI suite.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The  anesthesiologist  should  choose  a  location  or  position for optimal patient observation and vigilance during delivery of care, whether in zone III or IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Anesthesiologists should have (1) a clear line of sight of the patient and physiologic monitors, whether by direct observation or by video camera, (2) anesthetic delivery equipment  located  for  optimal  control  of  anesthetic depth and rapid intervention, and (3) access to hospital information systems integral to patient care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   In preparing for positioning, the anesthesiologist should take into account potential electromagnetic and auditory hazards.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Anesthesiologists should prepare a plan for rapidly summoning additional personnel in the event of an emergency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   The  anesthesiologist  should  ensure  that  (1)  emergency equipment and drugs are immediately accessible,  (2) emergency communication ( e.g. ,  phone or code button) is immediately available, and (3) an evacuation plan is in place, including an appropriate location outside the scan room (zone IV) for resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 This location should be complete with physiologic monitors, oxygen, suction, and other appropriate resuscitation equipment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
V. Patient Management during MRI

<!-- PAGE=? -->
•	 Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   MRI  patients  should  be  monitored  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  ASA  'Standards  for  basic  anesthesia monitoring.'

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   The anesthesiologist should be familiar with the expected limitations of available monitoring equipment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Information from electrocardiograms may be limited due to  superimposed  voltages  from  blood  flow  in  the  high magnetic  field  ( e.g. ,  ST  segment  interpretation  may  be unreliable, even with highly filtered monitors).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   The anesthesiologist should make sure that all monitors used in zone IV are safe/conditional for the scan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   A monitor should be available to view vital signs from zone III when the anesthesia care provider is not in zone IV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Additional care should be taken in positioning electrocardiogram and other monitor leads to eliminate burns, even with nonferromagnetic leads.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Anesthetic care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Although  lighter  levels  of  anesthesia  may  be  appropriate  during  an  MRI  scan,  the  anesthesiologist  should be aware that these lighter levels may result in airway complications ( e.g. ,  laryngospasm, coughing, or other airway  compromise)  which  may  necessitate  interruption of the scan for urgent treatment and alteration of anesthetic depth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Institutional  circumstances,  patient  characteristics,  and anesthesiologist preference may warrant more aggressive airway management and deeper anesthetic levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Anesthesiologists should  ensure that patients  who receive  moderate or deep sedation are monitored in a manner consistent with their institution's protocol for monitoring similarly sedated patients elsewhere in the facility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Monitoring  of  exhaled  carbon  dioxide  should  be  considered for all patients receiving deep sedation and for patients whose ventilation cannot be directly observed during moderate sedation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Monitoring oxygenation by pulse oximetry is not a substitute for monitoring ventilatory function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Equipment and drugs for anesthetic care in the MRI suite should  mirror  what  is  available  in  other  anesthetizing locations including: (1) an integrated anesthesia machine, medical gases, and waste anesthesia gas disposal or gas scavenging, when inhalational anesthesia is administered, (2) suction, (3) adequate electrical outlets and lighting, and (4) storage areas for equipment and drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Equipment used in the MRI suite should be appropriate for the age and size of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   MRI  safe/conditional  anesthesia  machines  are  always preferred for use in an MRI facility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 When an MRI safe/conditional anesthesia machine is not available,  inhalational  anesthetics  can  be  administered from an anesthesia machine inside zone III via an elongated circuit through a wave guide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 If total intravenous anesthesia is used, it should be administered by using (1) MRI safe/conditional pumps in zone IV, (2) traditional ( i.e. ,  MRI unsafe) pumps in zone III with intravenous tubing passed through a wave guide, or (3) periodic bolus injections in either zone III or IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Although an anesthesia machine may not be required for the administration of total intravenous anesthesia, there must be equipment immediately available for the administration of positive pressure ventilation with oxygen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Airway management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   The  anesthesiologist  should  have  an  advance  plan  in place to deal with instrumentation of the airway and common  airway  problems  ( e.g. ,  obstruction,  secretions, laryngospasm, apnea, and hypoventilation) when patients are in an MRI environment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   If  the  patient  is  at  risk  for  airway  compromise,  more aggressive  airway  management ( e.g. ,  use  of  a  tracheal tube  or  laryngeal  mask  airway),  should  be  instituted because the patient's airway may be less accessible when the patient is in the scanner.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Complex  airway  management  ( e.g. ,  fiberoptic  intubation) should be performed in a controlled environment outside zone IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Alternative airway devices should be immediately available in the MRI suite.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Suction equipment should be immediately accessible to the patient's airway at all times.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VI. Management of Emergencies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 When a patient has a medical emergency ( e.g. , cardiopulmonary arrest) in the MRI scanner, the following should occur: (1) immediately remove the patient from zone IV while initiating CPR, if indicated, (2) call for help, and (3) transport the patient to a previously designated safe area for resuscitation that is not in zone IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   This  location  should  be  as  close  to  zone  IV  as  possible so as not to delay resuscitation efforts and should contain the following resuscitation equipment: a defibrillator,  vital  signs  monitors,  and  a  code  cart  that includes resuscitation drugs, airway equipment, oxygen, and suction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 When  a  fire  occurs  in  the  MRI  suite,  team  members should perform their preassigned fire management task as quickly as possible, in accordance with the ASA practice advisory for the prevention and management of operating room fires.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   If  a  team  member  cannot  rapidly  perform  his  or  her task in the predetermined order, other team members should perform their tasks without waiting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   When a team member has completed a preassigned task, he or she should help other members perform tasks that are not yet complete.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 In  the  case  of  projectile  emergencies,  team  members should perform their institution's protocol in reaction to this occurrence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   If  possible,  immediately remove the patient from zone IV and discontinue the scan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   If  the  patient  is  injured,  proceed  with  medical  emergency management as indicated above.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   A controlled quench may be necessary in order to remove the patient from the bore.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 When a quench occurs, team members should perform their  institution's  protocol  in  reaction  to  this  occurrence. If possible: (1) immediately remove the patient from zone IV and (2) immediately administer oxygen to the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
††† Unless otherwise specified, outcomes for the listed interventions refer to the occurrence of safety-based outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
o   Powerful static magnetic fields may persist after a quench, and therefore, the usual precautions apply when entering zone IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Emergency response personnel should be restricted from entering  zone  IV  during  any  environmental  emergency because of the persistent magnetic field.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VII. Postprocedure Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 The  anesthesiologist  should  collaborate  with  the  radiologist  and  other  staff  in  the  postprocedure  care  of  the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Patients  receiving  sedation  or  anesthesia  within  the MRI  suite  should  have  access  to  postanesthetic  care consistent with that provided in other areas of the institution,  including  transport  to  other  recovery  rooms, dedicated  intensive  care,  or  recovery  areas  within  the MRI suite.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 In all situations, intensive care and recovery areas should include  access  to  vital  sign  monitors,  oxygen,  suction, resuscitation equipment, and trained personnel.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  should  be  provided  oral  and  written  discharge instructions.

For the literature  review,  potentially  relevant  studies  were identified via electronic and manual searches of the literature. The updated searches covered a 7-yr period from 2008 through 2014. Over 200 new citations that addressed topics related to the evidence linkages were identified. These articles were reviewed and those meeting the appropriate criteria as outlined in the 'Focus' section above were combined with pre-2009 articles used in the original Advisory, resulting in a total of 183 articles that contained direct linkagerelated evidence. A complete bibliography used to develop these Guidelines, organized by section, is available as Supplemental  Digital  Content  2,  http://links.lww.com/ALN/ B99. No evidence linkage contained enough studies with well-defined  experimental  designs  and  statistical  information to conduct a quantitative analysis ( i.e. , meta-analysis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For the original Advisory, interobserver agreement among Task Force members and two methodologists was established by interrater reliability testing. Agreement levels using a κ statistic for two-rater agreement pairs were as follows: (1) type of study design, κ = 0.49 to 0.85; (2) type of analysis, κ = 0.54 to 0.93; (3) evidence linkage assignment, κ = 0.77 to 1.00; and (4) literature inclusion for database, κ = 0.78 to 1.00. Three-rater chance-corrected agreement values were (1) study design, Sav = 0.65, Var (Sav) = 0.009; (2) type of analysis, Sav = 0.69, Var (Sav) = 0.010; (3) linkage assignment, Sav = 0.85, Var (Sav) = 0.004; and (4) literature database  inclusion,  Sav  =  0.85,  Var  (Sav)  =  0.013.  These values represent moderate to high levels of agreement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
B. Consensus-based Evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For the original Advisory, consensus was obtained from multiple sources, including (1) survey opinion from consultants who were selected based on their knowledge or expertise in MRI, (2) survey opinions solicited from active members of the  ASA,  (3)  testimony  from  attendees  of  a  publicly  held open forum at two national anesthesia meetings, (4) Internet commentary, and (5) Task Force opinion and interpretation. The survey rate of return was 63% (n = 50 of 79) for the consultants, and 989 surveys were received from active ASA members. Results of the surveys are reported in tables 1 and 2 and in the text of the Advisory.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  consultants  were  asked  to  indicate  which,  if  any, of the evidence linkages would change their clinical practices if the Advisory was instituted. The rate of return was 29% (n = 23 of 79). The percent of  responding  consultants expecting a change in their practice associated with each linkage topic was as follows: (1) education, 30%; (2) screening of anesthesia care providers and ancillary support personnel, 13%; (3) patient screening, 26%; (4) preparation, 13%; (5) patient management during MRI: monitoring, 4%; (6) patient management during MRI: anesthetic care,  0%;  (7)  patient  management  during  MRI:  airway, 0%;  (8)  patient  management  during  MRI:  emergencies, 13%; and (9) postprocedure care, 9%. Seventy-four percent  indicated  that  their  clinical  practice  will  not  need new  equipment,  supplies,  or  training  in  order  to  implement the Practice Advisory. Eighty-five percent indicated that  the  Advisory  would  not  require  ongoing  changes  in their  practice  which  will  affect  costs.  Ninety-five  percent of the respondents indicated that the Advisory would have no effect on the amount of time spent on a typical case, and 5% indicated that there would be a 10-min increase in the amount spent on a typical case with the implementation of this Advisory.

| 14. Anesthesiologists should be familiar with the expected limitations of available monitoring equipment                                                                                             | 978 | 71.9*  | 27.8   | 0.2       | 0.0               | 0.1      |
| 15. The anesthesiologist should make sure that all monitors used in zone IV are safe/ conditional for the scan                                                                                       | 977 | 68.3*  | 27.7   | 2.4       | 1.3               | 0.3      |
| 16. A monitor should be available to view vital signs from zone IV when the anesthesia care provider is not in zone IV                                                                                | 976 | 71.6*  | 24.7   | 3.5       | 0.1               | 0.1      |

| 17. In general, because MRI is a nonpainful procedure, lighter levels of anesthesia may be appropriate, recognizing that institutional circumstances, patient preference, and anesthesiologist preference may warrant more aggressive airway management and deeper anesthetic levels | 976 | 53.3*  | 43.3   | 1.6       | 1.2               | 0.5      |
