Preamble

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesiology is a dynamic specialty of medicine that fosters continuous improvements in anesthetic care for patients undergoing surgical and obstetric procedures in Canada. This document is reviewed annually and revised periodically.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The following recommendations are aimed at providing basic guidelines to anesthetic practice. They are intended as a framework for reasonable and acceptable patient care and should be interpreted as such to allow for some degree of flexibility in different circumstances. Each section of the Guidelines is subject to revision as warranted by the evolution of technology and practice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1 Basic Principles

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In this document, the term anesthesiologist is used to designate all licensed medical practitioners with privileges to administer anesthetics. An anesthetic is the deliberate performance of any procedure to render a patient temporarily insensitive to pain or to the external environment so that a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure can be performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
These Guidelines are intended to apply to all anesthesiologists in Canada. The independent practice of anesthesia is a specialized field of medicine, and as such, it should be practiced by physicians with appropriate training in anesthesia. The only route to specialist recognition in anesthesia in Canada is through the certification process of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. The Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society (CAS) acknowledges the fact that remote communities often lack the population base to support a specialist

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overview The Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia Revised Edition 2021 (the Guidelines) were prepared by the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society (CAS), which reserves the right to determine their publication and distribution. The Guidelines are subject to revision and updated versions are published annually. The Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia Revised Edition 2021 supersedes all previously published versions of this document. Although the CAS encourages Canadian anesthesiologists to adhere to its practice guidelines to ensure high-quality patient care, the CAS cannot guarantee any specific patient outcome. Anesthesiologists should exercise their own professional judgement in determining the proper course of action for any patient's circumstances. The CAS assumes no responsibility or liability for any error or omission arising from the use of any information contained in its Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia.

anesthesiology practice. In these communities, appropriately trained family physicians may be required to provide anesthesia services. In communities with the clinical volume to support full-time anesthesiologists, fellowshipcertified anesthesiologists should provide these services. All anesthesiologists must continue their education in the practice of anesthesia, pain management, perioperative care, and resuscitation and participate in a structured maintenance of competence program (e.g., Royal College MOC).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2 Organization of Anesthetic Services

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The department of anesthesia should be properly organized, directed, and integrated with other departments in the organization or facility, and it should include all facility staff members who provide anesthetic services to patients for surgical, obstetric, diagnostic, and therapeutic purposes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The department should be staffed appropriately, bearing in mind the scope and nature of the services it provides, and it should strive to ensure that these services are available as required by the healthcare facility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The chief of the department should be a physician who has obtained certification or appropriate training in anesthesia. This individual should be appointed in the same manner as other chiefs of clinical departments and should be a member of the senior medical administrative bodies for the facility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.1 Responsibilities of the Chief of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To be aware of the current CAS Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia, the requirements of the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation, and the requirements of the provincial licensing authority as they relate to anesthesia;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To ensure that written policies with respect to the practice of anesthesia are established and enforced;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To evaluate the qualifications and abilities of the physicians providing anesthetic care as well as other health professionals providing ancillary care-this includes, but is not restricted to, recommending clinical privileges for physicians with anesthetic responsibilities and annually reviewing these privileges;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To employ a systematic approach for monitoring the quality of anesthetic care provided by members of the department of anesthesia throughout the healthcare facility;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring quality of care may include, but need not be restricted to, the use of chart audits, clinical

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
indicator and outcome monitoring, adverse event reporting systems, morbidity and mortality conferences, and critical incident case reviews. The extent of quality improvement activities will vary depending on the departmental and health facility resources available to the chief. For effective quality improvement, it is strongly encouraged that all department members should actively participate in any such activities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To ensure that records are kept for all anesthetic procedures-these records should allow for evaluation of all anesthetic care in the facility;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To carry out such other duties as the governing body of the facility may delegate to ensure safe anesthetic care;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To promote institutional compliance with applicable Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Standards (Appendix 1); and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To coordinate liaison between the departments of anesthesiology, biomedical engineering, and information management services.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.2 Privileges in Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All physicians applying for privileges in anesthesia should demonstrate satisfactory completion of specialist postgraduate training in anesthesia or family practice anesthesia training. The standard is training in university programs approved by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. International medical graduates approved for licensure by provincial regulatory bodies should demonstrate training equivalent to the Canadian standard. Family physicians practicing anesthesia should demonstrate satisfactory completion of an accredited postgraduate program with at least one year of training.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Special areas of anesthetic care may have specific concerns. The department of anesthesia in each institution may determine privileges in pediatric anesthesia according to the pediatric population it serves, the child's age, the presence of comorbidities, the physician's specific training and experience in pediatric anesthesia, and the complexity of the procedure involved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physicians with anesthetic privileges should possess the knowledge and technical and non-technical skills necessary for the practice of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Knowledge and technical skills include the ability:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To provide preanesthetic evaluation of the patient and determine the appropriate anesthetic management;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To render the patient insensible to pain for the performance of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, surgical operations, and obstetric procedures;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To monitor and support the vital organ systems during the perioperative period;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
99

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To provide immediate postanesthetic management of the patient;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To provide resuscitation and intensive care when indicated; and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To provide relief from acute and chronic pain. Nontechnical skills include:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Task management: planning and preparing, prioritizing, providing and maintaining standards, and identifying and utilizing resources;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Teamwork: coordinating activities with team members, exchanging information, using authority and assertiveness, assessing capabilities, supporting others, and supporting the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Situational awareness: anticipating, gathering information, recognizing, and understanding, and;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decision-making: identifying options, balancing risks and selecting options, and re-evaluating.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.3 Fitness to Practice

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The provision of anesthesia care requires anesthesiologists to have a high level of expertise, sound judgment, and the ability to recognize and respond to changing clinical situations despite sometimes adverse personal physical circumstances. Anesthesia departments must recognize that fit anesthesia practitioners provide optimal patient care. Anesthesia departments are therefore obligated to develop policies that ensure, as far as possible, that practitioners are healthy and fit to undertake their duties of practice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A variety of factors impair health and fitness for duty, including adverse physical conditions, mental impairment, and fatigue. All these factors impair fitness and the ability to recognize and respond appropriately to often rapidly changing clinical circumstances. Many studies have shown that fatigue impairs judgement and psychomotor performance in a manner similar to drugs or alcohol. Shifting circadian rhythms, aging, and lack of sleep reinforce such problems; a fatigue-induced lack of recognition of these problems can compound the potential for errors in such circumstances. Physical impairment, illness, and severe stress can have similar detrimental effects on performance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia departments and individual anesthesiologists have a responsibility to organize their working duties such that illness and fatigue do not regularly affect clinical duties. Individual rosters must allow adequate rest between working shifts, and daily rosters should allow appropriate breaks for physiological needs, nutrition, and mental fitness. Operating room scheduling should avoid requiring anesthesiologists to undertake non-emergency procedures during unfavourable hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No specific prescription for working shifts and daily rosters can be appropriate for every working situation. Large departments have flexibility to incorporate short shifts and individual leave, while small departments may not have such freedom. Nevertheless, this important area of professional practice must receive ongoing consideration and attention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.4 Residents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Residents in anesthesia are registered medical practitioners who participate in the provision of anesthesia services both inside and outside the operating room as part of their training. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and provincial and local regulatory authorities require that a responsible attending staff anesthesiologist must supervise all resident activities. The degree of this supervision must consider the condition of each patient, the nature of the anesthetic service, and the experience and capabilities of the resident (increasing professional responsibility). At the discretion of the supervising staff anesthesiologist, residents may provide a range of anesthetic care with minimal supervision. In all cases, the supervising attending anesthesiologist must remain readily available to give advice or assist the resident with urgent or routine patient care. Whether supervision is direct or indirect, close communication between the resident and the responsible supervising staff anesthesiologist is essential for safe patient care. Each anesthesia department teaching anesthesia residents should have policies regarding the activities and supervision of residents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.5 Ancillary Personnel

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The healthcare facility must ensure that ancillary personnel are available as assistants to the anesthesiologist. Such assistants must be available at all times and places where anesthetic services are provided. Ancillary personnel should have the competencies to meet the specific needs of subspecialty areas of anesthesia, reflecting on the need for specific skills in areas such as specialty pediatric anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is recommended that facilities have a formally designated anesthesia assistant with specific training in anesthesia assistance. The department of anesthesia and the appropriate administrative bodies must approve the scope of practice for anesthesia assistants working in a specific institution. Furthermore, anesthesia assistants like other employed health professionals, must be covered by the facility's liability insurance. Duties and tasks delegated to anesthesia assistants must be consistent with existing governmental regulations, the policies and guidelines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
100

<!-- PAGE=? -->
G. Dobson et al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
established by professional regulatory agencies, and the policies of the local facility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An institution without formal anesthesia assistants must provide other paramedical personnel to assist the anesthesiologist. The tasks that these assistants may perform must be clearly defined. An anesthesiologist must only delegate or assign those tasks for which such personnel have approval or accreditation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3 Anesthetic Equipment and Anesthetizing Location

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An anesthetic must be administered in an appropriate facility. All necessary equipment, including emergency equipment, life support systems, medications, and supplies must be readily available. It is strongly recommended that a cognitive aid manual be made available at all anesthetizing locations in support of the management of critical perioperative emergencies. The contents of the manual should be regularly reviewed, updated as required, and periodically practiced as a team.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The healthcare facility, in consultation with the department of anesthesia, is responsible for the design and maintenance of preoperative, postoperative, and anesthetizing locations, as well as the purchase, maintenance, and disposal of anesthetic and ancillary equipment and supplies. The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and other standards development organizations have published standards and guidance documents for the design, construction, and renovation of healthcare facilities and for the risk management, basic safety, and essential performance of medical equipment (Appendix 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.1 Responsibilities of the Healthcare Facility

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The healthcare facility must ensure that:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The operating rooms, anesthetizing locations, and perioperative care locations comply with at least the minimum design and construction requirements of the national, provincial, and local building, plumbing, electrical, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), fire, and security codes at the time of construction or renovation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical gas and vacuum systems, waste anesthetic gas scavenging systems, terminal units, head walls, low pressure connecting assemblies, and pressure regulators meet the requirements of the CSA and are certified by a CSA-approved testing agency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen concentrators that comply with CSA requirements are an acceptable substitute for bulk oxygen supply systems. When such concentrators are installed, users must be aware that:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The facility medical oxygen supply may deliver a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) that varies from 0.93 to 0.99;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen analyzers must be calibrated against 100% O2 (FiO2 0.99) and room air or equivalent (FiO2 0.21);

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The use of low-flow (less than one litre total fresh gas flow) anesthetic techniques may result in the accumulation of inert gas (argon) and the dilution of nitrous oxide and oxygen in the circuit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is compliance with all safety regulations and best practice with respect to the storage, preparation, identification, labelling, disposal, and use of medical gases, medications, and related materials.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General medication safety recommendations include, but need not be restricted to:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identifying an anesthesia department lead designated to cooperate with pharmacy to promote medication safety best practice. In recognition of the increased risk of medication errors related to medication brand substitutions and look-alike packaging, departments and pharmacies should consider strategies to reduce this risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Requesting that pharmacy staff notify anesthesia staff, with as much notice as possible, of upcoming medication supplier, packaging, or concentration changes such that anesthesia staff can be alerted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Standardization of drug trays across all locations and during product transitions. Medications with different supplier brands and packaging for a medication should not be mixed in the same anesthesia cart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medication substitutions, particularly of a different concentration, should be labelled with highly visible warning labels when any new medication is introduced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Look-alike medications should be physically separated in the anesthesia carts as much as is possible and identified with warning labels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cautioning physicians and technical support staff that replacement of unopened medications back into anesthesia carts is risky because medication may be put in the incorrect location.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
101

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reporting any medication-related adverse events through local adverse event reporting systems or CAIRS or both.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Through cooperation between the departments of anesthesia and pharmacy, there are policies developed and enforced for the safe handling, storage, and disposal of controlled medications (e.g., opioids) in the operating rooms and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) that are consistent with the law, with any regulatory authority requirements, and established best practice principles. The goals of such policies should be to limit access of unauthorized personnel to controlled medications to minimize the risk of controlled medication diversion, and to establish robust documentation procedures that can be audited, while also protecting patient safety by still permitting anesthesia providers immediate access to any medications required for patient care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Best practice principles support a variety of specific strategies to achieve these goals. The CAS does not endorse any one specific strategy or policy but strongly recommends that all available options be considered. Robust systems and procedures must be implemented. Due consideration should be given to any limitation in resources available to implement specific security systems and procedures within a facility, particularly for smaller facilities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations include, but need not be restricted to:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Storing controlled substances in a secure lockable safe or locked drawer when the OR is unattended by anesthesia personnel (e.g., between cases).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Never leaving controlled substances (including those drawn up into syringes or bags) unattended in any location.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Emptying the contents of syringes and bags containing controlled substances before disposal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adopting disposal and/or destruction systems to dispose of controlled substance waste.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consideration of a requirement that controlled substance waste be returned to the pharmacy and be subjected to random analysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Periodic audits of a healthcare provider's controlled substance utilization records and their anesthesia records.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Consideration of the implementation of automated anesthesia cabinets or automated medication dispensing cabinets (e.g. PyxisTM)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The operating room, labour and delivery, postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and regional block areas, for example, should all be recognized as high risk areas for controlled medication diversion and therefore must be subject to heightened security, surveillance, and auditing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If general anesthesia is provided using an electronic anesthetic system (gas machine), it must comply with CAN/CSAC22.2 No. 60601-2-13. An alternate means of ventilation (e.g., manual bag and mask resuscitator) must be immediately available with each

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The equipment, supplies, and appropriate assistance necessary for the safe performance of invasive procedures are provided. Diagnostic equipment, such as, but not limited to nerve stimulators, ultrasound, image intensifiers, and x-ray, should be available to the anesthesiologist as required. For the placement of central venous and arterial catheters, dedicated ultrasound capability must be provided by the facility. The use of real-time ultrasound guidance for elective internal jugular central venous catheter placement is strongly recommended when the anesthesia provider has training and experience with the technique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A cardiac arrest cart containing emergency resuscitation equipment including a manual resuscitator, a defibrillator complying with current Canadian Heart and Stroke Association Guidelines, and appropriate medications and intravenous equipment is immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Equipment appropriate for resuscitating infants and children must be immediately available in any location where sedation or anesthesia involving children is performed. It should also be available in any location receiving pediatric patients who might require resuscitation, such as the emergency department. This equipment must be able to support bag-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, fluid administration, temperature monitoring, and advanced cardiac life support. A length-based pediatric emergency tape kit (e.g., Broselow TM ) may facilitate the conduct of resuscitation for providers who infrequently manage pediatric resuscitations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If Malignant Hyperthermia triggering agents are used, a ''Malignant Hyperthermia Kit'' complying with the recommendations of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States must be immediately available (Appendix 4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ''Difficult Airway Kit'' for difficult or failed airway management is immediately available. Facilities that care for children must have specialized pediatric airway equipment immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Facilities that care for children should have specialized pediatric equipment. Wherever

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
G. Dobson et al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
obstetric anesthesia is performed, a separate area for newborn assessment and resuscitation must be provided. This area must include designated oxygen, suction apparatus, electrical outlets, a source of radiant heat, and equipment for neonatal airway management and resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Personal protection devices, including N95 masks, face masks, and means of disposal of hazardous and infectious wastes and sharps are provided. Surgical, diagnostic, therapeutic, and esthetic settings must have plume scavenging systems complying with CSA Z305.13-09.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infusion pump systems with a drug library, appropriate soft and hard limits for each medication, and enabled alarms for the delivery of medications by continuous intravenous infusion are available as required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen supplies for transport of perioperative patients must be provided. The use of transport oxygen cylinders capable of providing an audible low-pressure alarm is strongly recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Qualified personnel conduct regular inspections and maintenance of all anesthetic and ancillary equipment. The facility administration and the department of anesthesia must retain records indicating conformity to regulations and inspection and maintenance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia providers must ensure that potentially infectious materials or agents are not transferred from one patient to another. Special attention in this regard should be given to syringes, infusion pump administration sets, and multi-dose drug vials.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Training on the safe use of all anesthesia equipment should be provided to all anesthesia department members prior to use. Attendance at these sessions should be documented. These training sessions should be repeated as necessary for new or established department members.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.2 Waste Gases

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations for reducing occupational exposure to waste anesthetic gases:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dilution ventilation at the rate of 20 exchanges per hour must be provided in all anesthetizing locations where volatile anesthetic gases or nitrous oxide (N2O) are used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recirculation of exhaust air must not be permitted during the hours when operations may be in progress, and it is not recommended at any other time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wherever an anesthetic delivery system is used, a scavenger must be provided to capture anesthetic gases

<!-- PAGE=? -->
that might be released from the anesthetic circuit or ventilator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A maintenance program must be established in each healthcare facility to detect and repair leakage from the anesthetic delivery system and to maintain the effectiveness of the waste anesthetic scavenging unit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The healthcare facility must be responsible for conducting regular monitoring of exposure to waste anesthetic gases. The monitoring protocol should include individuals and the air flow patterns of the rooms being assessed. When N2O is used in the operating room, N2O monitoring is a suitable representation for the assessment of adequacy of scavenging.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4 The Preanesthetic Period

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The department of anesthesia should establish policies regarding preanesthetic assessment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The primary goal of preanesthetic assessment is to obtain the information required to plan anesthetic management. Accordingly, a physician who is knowledgeable about anesthetic management for the proposed diagnostic or therapeutic procedure should document all aspects of the patient's medical and surgical history, findings on physical examination, and laboratory investigations that are relevant to anesthetic management. The patient's history should include past and current medical problems, current and recent drug therapy, unusual reactions or responses to drugs, and any problems or complications associated with previous anesthetics. A family history of adverse reactions associated with anesthesia should also be obtained. Information about the anesthetic that the patient considers relevant should also be documented. An American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification (Appendix 2) should be recorded for each patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In appropriate cases, the availability of an ''Advance Care Plan'' (representation agreement, advanced directive, ''living will'', ''do not resuscitate'' directive, etc.) should be ascertained, and its applicability to the proposed intervention should be determined and documented on the anesthetic assessment record.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The surgeon may request consultation with an anesthesiologist. Medical consultations should be obtained when indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative anesthetic assessment or consultation may take place in an outpatient clinic before admission for the operative procedure. Indications for pre-admission assessment include the presence of significant medical problems (comorbidities), the nature of the proposed

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
103

<!-- PAGE=? -->
diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, and patient request. A parent/guardian must be present if the patient is a child or not competent to provide informed consent. All patients should be informed that arrangements will be made to meet with an anesthesiologist if they wish to discuss anesthetic management before admission to the facility. The preoperative assessment clinic should also allow nursing and other healthcare personnel to assess the patient. The attending anesthesiologist is responsible for performing a final preanesthetic assessment in the immediate preoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4.1 Preoperative Testing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory testing should not be performed on a routine basis but should be obtained only when results will change perioperative management. Laboratory investigations should be performed when indicated by the patient's medical status, drug therapy, and the nature of the proposed procedure. Routine laboratory blood testing, electrocardiograms, and chest radiographs are not recommended for asymptomatic patients having low-risk surgery. Examples of low-risk surgery include, but are not restricted to, cataract surgery, minor breast surgery, superficial procedures, and many minor ambulatory procedures. For more detailed definitions of low-risk surgery and for other recommendations related to preoperative testing, visit Choosing Wisely on the CAS website and the associated Internet links.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4.2 Fasting Policies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fasting policies should vary to account for age and preexisting medical conditions and should apply to all forms of anesthesia, including procedural sedation (see Appendix 6). 1 Emergent or urgent procedures should be undertaken after considering the risk of delaying surgery vs the risk of aspiration of gastric contents. The type and amount of food ingested should be considered in determining the duration of fasting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before elective procedures, the minimum duration of fasting should be:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eight hours after a large meal of solids particularly containing protein (e.g., meat) or fatty foods

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Six hours after a light meal (e.g., non-fatty meal such as toast)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Six hours after ingestion of infant formula, non- human milk, or expressed breast milk fortified with additions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Four hours after ingestion of breast milk

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two hours after ingestion of clear fluids for adults

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One hour after ingestion of clear fluids for infants and children

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless contraindicated, adults and children should be encouraged to drink clear fluids (including water, pulp-free juice, complex carbohydrate beverages, and black tea or coffee up to two hours before elective surgery. Pediatric patients should also be encouraged to consume clear fluids, as defined, up to one hour before elective procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conditions that delay gastric emptying require individual patient assessment. These guidelines may be modified at the discretion of the physician.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Premedication, when indicated, should be ordered by the anesthesiologist. Orders should be specific as to dose, time, and route of administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An H2 receptor antagonist (oral or intravenous) is recommended for all women presenting for Cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thirty mL of oral sodium citrate (0.3 molar) is recommended prior to an emergent Cesarean delivery if general anesthesia is planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
See Section 7.3 for fasting guidelines specific to patients in active labour.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4.3 Additional Regulations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Provincial legislation or facility bylaws may dictate additional regulations governing the conduct of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5 The Anesthetic Period

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.1 Preparation for Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before beginning anesthesia, the anesthesiologist must ensure that

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An explanation of the planned anesthetic procedure, including recognized risks and alternative techniques, has been provided and documented;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An adequate review of the patient's condition has been performed;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All equipment that is expected to be required is available and in working order, including the equipment required for supporting core temperature management (patient core temperature 36-37 /C176 C);

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A reserve source of oxygen under pressure is available;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All drugs and agents that are expected to be required are correctly identified-user-applied drug labels should conform to the CSA Standard CAN/CSAZ264.3-98 (R2005) (Appendix 1);

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If Luer neuraxial connectors are used, both sides of all Luer connections must be labelled. Consideration should be given to the use of neuraxial connectors complying with ISO 80369-6:2016-small bore connectors for neuraxial application (e.g., NRFit /C210 connectors) subject to availability from equipment suppliers; and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The manufacturers' recommendations concerning the use, handling, and disposal of anesthetic equipment and supplies have been considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.2 Airway Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Airway management, particularly of the difficult airway, contributes to a significant proportion of anesthesia related morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
105

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The appropriate management of those patients who have a predicted, or an unanticipated difficult intubation, a failed airway, where bag-mask ventilation or supraglottic device placement may be difficult, or who require a surgical airway is critical for patient safety. This includes, but need not be restricted to, adequate airway assessment, equipment (e.g., difficult airway carts, videolaryngoscopes, bronchoscopes), training and simulation, support personnel and the use of protocols and cognitive aids to optimize difficult airway management. The CAS does not endorse any one specific protocol, algorithm, or cognitive aid for difficult and failed airway management but strongly recommends that readers refer to Appendix 4 for up to date publications related to this topic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.3 Delegation of Patient Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthesiologist's primary responsibility is to the patient receiving care. The anesthesiologist or an anesthesia assistant supervised by the anesthesiologist must remain with the patient at all times throughout the conduct of all general and major regional, anesthetics and for procedural sedation until the patient is transferred to the care of personnel in an appropriate care unit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the attending anesthesiologist leaves the operating room temporarily, he/she must delegate care of the patient to another anesthesiologist, a resident in anesthesia, or an anesthesia assistant. When the attending anesthesiologist delegates care to a resident in anesthesia or an anesthesia assistant, the attending anesthesiologist remains responsible for the anesthetic management of the patient. Before delegating care of the patient to an anesthesia assistant, the anesthesiologist must ensure that the patient's condition is stable and that the anesthesia assistant is familiar with the operative procedure and the operating room environment and equipment. The attending anesthesiologist must remain immediately available when care is delegated to an anesthesia assistant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An anesthesiologist may briefly delegate routine care of a stable patient to a competent person who is not an anesthesia assistant only under the most exceptional circumstances, e.g., to provide life-saving emergency care to another patient. That person's only responsibility would be to monitor the patient during the anesthesiologist's absence and to keep the anesthesiologist informed until he/ she returns. In this situation, the anesthesiologist remains responsible for the care of the patient and must inform the operating room team.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An intraoperative handover of care between two anesthesiologists should be documented in the anesthesia record and follow a structured protocol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is unacceptable for one anesthesiologist to simultaneously administer general anesthesia, major regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural, or other), or deep procedural sedation (see Appendix 6) 1 for concurrent diagnostic or therapeutic procedures on more than one patient. Nevertheless, it may be appropriate in specific circumstances for one anesthesiologist to supervise more than one patient where only minimal to moderate sedation is administered, provided an appropriately trained, qualified, and accredited individual approved by the department of anesthesiology, and the healthcare institution is in constant attendance with each patient receiving care. In an obstetric unit, however, it is acceptable to supervise more than one patient receiving regional analgesia for labour. Due care must be taken to ensure that a suitably trained person adequately observes each patient following an established protocol. When an anesthesiologist is providing anesthetic care for an obstetric delivery, a second appropriately trained person should be available to provide neonatal resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is unacceptable for a single physician to administer an anesthetic, including deep procedural sedation, and simultaneously perform a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, except for procedures done with only infiltration of local anesthetic and/or minimal sedation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.4 Patient Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The only indispensable monitor is the presence, at all times, of a physician or an anesthesia assistant who is under the immediate supervision of an anesthesiologist and has appropriate training and experience. Mechanical and electronic monitors are, at best, aids to vigilance. Such devices assist the anesthesiologist to ensure the integrity of the vital organs and, in particular, the adequacy of tissue perfusion and oxygenation. Monitoring equipment must be used as intended by the manufacturer and approved by Health Canada for the specific application.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The healthcare facility is responsible for the provision and maintenance of monitoring equipment that meets current published equipment standards.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The chief of anesthesia is responsible for advising the healthcare facility regarding the procurement of monitoring equipment and for establishing policies for monitoring to help ensure patient safety.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthesiologist is responsible for monitoring the patient receiving care and for ensuring that appropriate monitoring equipment is available and working correctly. A preanesthetic checklist (Appendix 3 or equivalent) must be completed prior to initiation of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cautious dosing, vigilant monitoring, and the appropriate reversal of neuromuscular blocking drugs are all essential for patient safety. Neuromuscular monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
106

<!-- PAGE=? -->
G. Dobson et al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
must be utilized when neuromuscular blocking agents are administered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring guidelines for standard patient care apply to all patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or procedural sedation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.5 Required Monitoring Equipment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring equipment is classified as follows:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Required: These monitors must be in continuous use throughout the administration of all anesthetics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exclusively available for each patient: These monitors must be available at each anesthetic work station so that they can be used with no delay.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediately available: These monitors must be available to facilitate their use without undue delay.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The following monitoring equipment is required:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulse oximeter;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Apparatus to measure blood pressure, either directly or noninvasively;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrocardiography;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuromuscular blockade monitor when neuromuscular blocking drugs are used;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Capnography for general anesthesia and to assess the adequacy of ventilation for moderate or deep procedural sedation; and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Agent-specific anesthetic gas monitor, when inhalational anesthetic agents are used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The following monitoring equipment must be exclusively available for each patient:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Apparatus to measure temperature;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stethoscope;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appropriate lighting to visualize an exposed portion of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The following monitoring equipment must be immediately available:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spirometer to measure tidal volume;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manometer to measure endotracheal tube cuff pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Equipment for invasive hemodynamic monitoring if indicated (e.g., arterial, central venous).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthesiologist must remain constantly vigilant, understanding that brief interruptions in continuous monitoring may be unavoidable and there are certain circumstances in which a monitor may fail.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Audible and visual alarms for oximetry and capnography should not be indefinitely disabled during the conduct of an anesthetic except during unusual circumstances. The variable pitch, pulse tone, and lowthreshold alarm of the pulse oximeter and the capnograph apnea alarm must give an audible and visual warning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.6 Perioperative Temperature Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring patient core temperature is strongly recommended during cases of general and neuraxial regional anesthesia lasting 30 min or longer. In the absence of surgical or patient indications for intraoperative hypothermia, active patient warming systems, control of the operating room ambient temperature, and other methods, should be used to target a central core temperature of 36-37 /C176 C.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.7 Patient Positioning

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patient positioning for procedures requiring anesthesia is an operating room team responsibility and demands a high level of attention to avoid complications. It is recognized, however, that positioning-related complications can still occur despite best practice and vigilance. Risks related to patient positioning will vary and depend on the type and duration of surgery, the specific position utilized, and patient factors such as BMI and other comorbidities. Therefore, the considerations and planning for positioning best practice should be discussed by the surgical team ideally before anesthesia induction, for example during part 1 of the Surgical Safety Checklist. All members of the team, including the anesthesiologist, should be encouraged to voice concerns related to any aspect of positioning (e.g., specific risk factors and availability, condition and appropriateness of OR tables and other positioning equipment), and strategies to mitigate these risks should be considered. Patient positioning should be documented and also rechecked regularly by the anesthesiologist to be sure positioning conditions remain ideal. Patients should be informed preoperatively of any specific risks that may be associated with the position planned for their procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.8 Records

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All monitored physiologic variables should be charted at intervals appropriate to the clinical circumstances. Heart rate and blood pressure should be recorded at least every five minutes. Oxygen saturation must be monitored continuously and should be recorded at frequent intervals, at a minimum of every five minutes, for all patients. End-tidal carbon dioxide concentration must be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
107

<!-- PAGE=? -->
monitored continuously and recorded at frequent intervals if the trachea is intubated or a supraglottic device is in situ. Reasons for deviation from these charting guidelines should be documented in the anesthetic record. Monitors, equipment, and techniques, as well as time, dose, and route of all drugs and intravenous fluids should be recorded. All other relevant intraoperative anesthesia care and events, including unexpected or adverse events, should also be recorded.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The patient health record should include the patient's level of consciousness, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate as first determined in the PACU. These recommendations apply to both manually created (handwritten) and electronic anesthesia information management system (AIMS) created anesthesia records. At present, there are no practice standards for what additional data (e.g., gas analysis, ventilator, and respiratory data) that can potentially be collected by an AIMS charting system should become part of a patient's permanent health record.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AIMS have been shown to have potential benefits over handwritten records in several key areas, including improved legibility, precision and reliability of anesthesia records, providing searchable data for quality improvement, outcome and performance reporting and translational research, enhanced medication safety and tracking and real-time clinical decision support for users. The anesthesia patient safety literature supports the use of AIMS. Importantly, AIMS maintain a longitudinal patient database so historical patient encounters should be easily retrievable for review and this should be considered an important feature of any system. The CAS does not promote or endorse any one specific vendor or product but acknowledges that there may be potential benefits of a well designed and implemented AIMS over manually charted records where facility and anesthesia department resources permit the consideration of an AIMS. Ideally it should be implemented and supported in cooperation with the facility information technology department including communication with other facility electronic patient databases wherever possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
6 The Postanesthetic Period

<!-- PAGE=? -->
6.1 Recovery Facility

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A PACU must be available in any facility that provides anesthetic services. Administrative policies to coordinate medical and nursing care responsibilities must be enforced in accordance with facility bylaws.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The department of anesthesia should have overall medical administrative responsibility for the PACU. There should be a PACU policy manual approved by appropriate medical, nursing, and administrative authorities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthesiologist should accompany the patient to the PACU, communicate necessary information to the PACU nurse(s) as part of a structured handover of care protocol, and write appropriate orders. Continuous monitoring of patients is recommended during the perioperative period appropriate to the clinical situation. If clinically indicated, supplemental oxygen, portable pulse oximetry, and other appropriate monitoring devices should be applied during transport to the PACU or intensive care unit. If supplemental oxygen is applied during transport or in PACU to patients who are intubated it is strongly recommended that it only be provided using devices approved for that specific application to minimize any risk of barotrauma. The anesthesiologist should delegate care to the PACU nurse only when assured that nursing staff may safely observe and care for the patient. The anesthesiologist or designated alternate is responsible for providing anesthetic-related care in the PACU. Discharge from the PACU is the responsibility of the anesthesiologist; this responsibility may be delegated in accordance with facility policy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental oxygen and suction must be available for every patient in the PACU. Emergency equipment for airway management, resuscitation, and life support must be available in the PACU. Equipment for management of the difficult airway must be immediately available to the PACU. The monitoring used in the PACU should be appropriate to the patient's condition, and a full range of monitoring devices should be available. Monitor alarms should be enabled with alarm settings appropriate to the condition and age of the patient. The use of continuous pulse oximetry is required in the initial phase of recovery. Capnography is required for intubated and deeply sedated patients and is recommended for unconscious patients with in situ supraglottic airway devices. An apnea monitor is recommended for preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 50 weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An accurate record of the immediate recovery period must be maintained. This must include a record of vital signs together with other aspects of treatment and observation. The recovery record must form a part of the permanent medical record. Any complications that bear any relation to the anesthetic should be recorded either on the recovery record or on the progress notes on the patient's chart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In some circumstances, it may be considered acceptable to transfer a patient directly to other care units or to bypass the PACU if the appropriate level of care is available in another unit in the facility and the suitability of the patient for this transfer is documented on the anesthetic record.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
G. Dobson et al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
6.2 Discharge of Patients After Day Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Discharge of patients after day surgery must utilize a formal care plan approved by the institution and be documented in the patient care notes. Patients should meet the facility discharge to home criteria using a validated assessment tool. (e.g., Post Anesthetic Discharge Scoring System). Specific written instructions should include management of pain and postoperative complications, and both routine and emergency follow-up. The patient should be advised regarding the additive effects of alcohol and other sedative drugs, the danger of driving or operating other hazardous machinery during the postoperative period (most commonly 24 hr postoperatively), and the necessity for attention by a competent adult during the postoperative period (most commonly 24 hr postoperatively).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7 Guidelines for Obstetric Regional Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia services for parturients include obstetric analgesia for labour-for both uncomplicated and complicated deliveries-or for operative deliveries. All guidelines regarding provision of anesthesia for other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures also apply to the provision of obstetric anesthesia. The guidelines in this section pertain to epidural and spinal analgesia during labour. The term ''regional analgesia'' includes epidural, spinal, and combined spinal-epidural analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
These guidelines are reviewed annually by the Obstetric Anesthesia Section of CAS and updated as indicated. Each facility may choose to develop additional guidelines or policies for specific situations in which obstetric regional analgesia is provided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Under the direction of an anesthesiologist, some aspects of monitoring and management of obstetric regional analgesia may be delegated to other healthcare personnel. Each facility should ensure that such other personnel receive the same training, certification, continuing education, and recertification in obstetric regional analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.1 Initiation of Obstetric Regional Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before introducing obstetric regional analgesia, the facility should have appropriate monitoring protocols in place. These protocols should outline the types of monitoring required and the frequency of monitoring. In addition, they should clearly state how to manage common problems and emergencies and indicate whom to contact if assistance is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstetric regional analgesia should be provided only by physicians with training, facility privileges, and licence to provide these services. This includes trainees with appropriate supervision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional analgesia should be initiated and maintained only in locations where appropriate resuscitation equipment and drugs are immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Informed consent should be obtained and documented in the medical record.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous access must be established before initiating regional analgesia, and it should be maintained throughout the administration of regional analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthesiologist should be immediately available until analgesia is established and the patient's vital signs are stable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.2 Maintenance of Regional Anesthesia During Labour

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous Epidural Infusions (CEI), Programmed Intermittent Epidural Bolus (PIEB), and PatientControlled Epidural Analgesia (PCEA) of low dose diluted epidural local anesthetics (e.g., bupivacaine £ 0.125% or ropivacaine £ 0.16%) with or without adjuncts (e.g., opioids) are associated with a very low incidence of significant complications. Consequently, it is not necessary for an anesthesiologist to remain present or immediately available during maintenance of CEI or PIEB with or without PCEA provided that:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
there are appropriate protocols for management of patients receiving CEI, PIEB, and PCEA; and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the anesthesiologist can be contacted for the purpose of obtaining advice and direction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When initial and top-up bolus epidural local anesthetics are administered, the anesthesiologist must be immediately available to intervene appropriately recognizing that these techniques can cause immediate life-threatening complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Individual departments of anesthesiology should establish their own policies regarding the appropriate availability of an anesthesiologist to manage the potential complications of regional analgesia for labour and delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Safety systems must be in place to secure epidural local anesthetic mixtures and supplies containing controlled substances (e.g., opioids) to minimize the risk of diversion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.3 Oral Intake During Labour

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastric emptying of solids is delayed during labour and opioid analgesics may further delay gastric emptying.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
109

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Therefore, parturients should generally be discouraged from ingesting solid foods when in active labour. In contrast to solid food, clear fluids are emptied relatively rapidly from the stomach during labour. Therefore, in general, women should be permitted clear fluids as desired during active labour. Individual facilities should develop protocols regarding the intake of solids and clear fluids by women in active labour.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8 Guidelines for Acute Pain Management Using Neuraxial Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When neuraxial analgesia is managed by anesthesiologists, the incidence of side effects is no higher than when alternative techniques of pain management are used. Accordingly, when its use is appropriate, neuraxial analgesia should be managed by anesthesiologists.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For the purposes of these guidelines, neuraxial analgesia is defined as intrathecal or epidural administration of opioids and/or local anesthetics for treatment of postoperative pain or other acute pain problems. These guidelines are to provide anesthesiologists with the principles of management to maximize the benefit-risk ratio of providing neuraxial analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.1 Administrative and Educational Policies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The department of anesthesia should establish an acute pain service that is responsible for:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Developing policies and procedures for neuraxial analgesia. Participation of other departments (e.g., nursing, pharmacy, surgery, and materials management) should be sought as needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liaison with the surgical departments. Surgeons need to understand the criteria for patient selection, the effects of neuraxial analgesia on the normal postoperative course and on the presentation of postoperative complications, and the implications of other therapies, such as prophylactic anticoagulation, on neuraxial analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Education and certification of nurses. A standardized educational program-with initial training, certification, and ongoing maintenance of competence-should be established for nurses caring for patients receiving neuraxial analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nursing personnel should understand:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The risk of respiratory depression, including delayed respiratory depression when hydrophilic opioids are used;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment and management of respiratory depression;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment of motor and sensory blockade;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment and management of hypotension in patients receiving neuraxial analgesia; and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of the rare but catastrophic complications of epidural hematoma or abscess.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.2 Policies for Drug Administration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each facility should use a limited number of standard solutions. A preprinted order sheet listing the standard solutions for the facility is strongly recommended. Before any solution that is not standard in the facility is dispensed, the anesthesiologist should verify the order with nursing and pharmacy personnel and discuss its indications and all concerns relating to its use with the nurses responsible for administering the drug and monitoring the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The risk of errors due to incorrect route of drug injection must be minimized. For continuous infusions or PCEA, the use of unique tamper-proof pumps that are distinct from the pumps used for intravenous fluid or drug administration is strongly recommended. The tubing between neuraxial analgesia infusion pumps and catheters should not have ports that could permit unintentional injection of intravenous drugs (see section 5.1-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparation of solutions should follow a standardized procedure. All analgesic drug solutions should be labeled with the composition of the solution (opioid, local anesthetic, or both) and its intended route of administration. For epidural administration, this should include the date and time of preparation and the name of the individual who prepared it.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.3 Patient Monitoring and Management of Adverse Events

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients receiving neuraxial analgesia should be in a room equipped with oxygen and suction. Resuscitation drugs and equipment must be immediately available. Before initiating neuraxial analgesia, intravenous access must be secured, and after discontinuing neuraxial analgesia, intravenous access must be maintained for the expected duration of drug effects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural catheter dressings should permit examination for catheter movement and daily inspection of the catheter entry site for any signs of infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Standardized policies for patient management should be established. The parameters to be assessed, frequency of assessments, documentation, and procedures for management of complications should be specified. Adequate nursing personnel must be available to assess and manage patients receiving neuraxial analgesia. Monitoring should continue after discontinuation of neuraxial analgesia until its effects have dissipated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
110

<!-- PAGE=? -->
G. Dobson et al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An anesthesiologist must be readily available to advise nursing personnel on such issues as dose titration and management of adverse effects. Each facility with an acute pain service should ensure that an anesthesiologist is available to attend directly to patients receiving neuraxial analgesia within an appropriate time depending on the clinical situation. Each facility should also specify procedures for emergent management of any lifethreatening complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other drugs, particularly benzodiazepines or parenteral opioids, may cause severe respiratory depression in patients receiving neuraxial analgesia. For this reason, other physicians should not order sedatives or analgesics for any patient receiving neuraxial analgesia. The acute pain service should direct analgesic and sedative therapy until the effects of neuraxial analgesia have dissipated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.4 Epidurals and Anticoagulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with epidural catheters may receive prophylactic low-dose anticoagulant therapy if appropriate precautions are taken:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To minimize the risk of epidural hematoma, catheter insertion and removal and the timing of anticoagulant administration must be coordinated so that no clinically significant anticoagulant effect is present at these times.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients receiving neuraxial analgesia is appropriate, but concurrent administration of these drugs or other antiplatelet medication and an anticoagulant may increase the risk of epidural hematoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Where neuraxial analgesia is used for prolonged postoperative pain management, every effort should be made to avoid lower extremity motor blockade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nursing staff should be aware of the signs and symptoms of epidural hematoma. Any change in neurologic status or new-onset back pain must be investigated immediately.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If full anticoagulation is indicated in a patient with an epidural catheter, the anesthesiologist should be consulted so that catheter removal and initiation of alternative analgesic management are accomplished before anticoagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9 Guidelines for the Practice of Anesthesia in Remote Locations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The basic principles, training requirements, techniques, equipment, and medications used for the practice of anesthesia in remote locations are as outlined in other sections of these Guidelines. They apply equally to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anesthesia care, including procedural sedation (see Appendix 6) delivered by anesthesiologists in any operating room or out-of-operating room locations both within a hospital facility and outside of a hospital facility (e.g., offices, clinics).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.1 Anesthesia Care delivered in a Non-Hospital Medical/Surgical/Dental Facility

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.1.1 Patient Selection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The physical status of patients should be classified using the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) score. Typically, only patients with ASA classifications of I and II should be considered for procedures. Patients with ASA III classification may be accepted under certain circumstances but only at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Caution should be exercised when booking patients with a known difficult airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.1.2 Preoperative Considerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The patient must have had a recent and documented health history, physical examination including an airway examination, and any appropriate laboratory investigations. This may be carried out by another physician (e.g., proceduralist) but it is strongly recommended that there be a screening process that is developed and supported by the anesthesia leadershipproviding services. The duration of fasting should be consistent with section 4.2 Fasting Guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.1.3 Conduct of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The anesthetic and recovery facilities must conform to facility standards established by the CSA (see Appendix 1) and all CAS guidelines established for patient care. The patient should be discharged home from the facility using a validated scoring system for fitness to discharge (e.g., Post Anesthetic Discharge Scoring System). Patients should be provided with written instructions for the preoperative and postoperative periods.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.2 Anesthesia Care delivered Outside of an Operating Room within a Hospital or in a Non-Hospital Facility

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The demand for the delivery of anesthesia care services outside of an operating room (e.g., endoscopy, interventional radiology, cardiac catheterization) is growing because of technological advances and the growth in the availability of less invasive, yet potentially

painful, procedures. The delivery of anesthesia care in these remote procedural units can present unique challenges to the anesthesia care team (e.g., patients may have an ASA status of III-IV and have significant comorbidities) and they may be some distance from the operating rooms and support staff or outside of a hospital facility. Procedural units where anesthesiologists have been asked to provide care should comply with the same CSA standards (Appendix 1), equipment guidelines (see section 3.0), and general CAS guidelines as an operating room to the greatest extent possible. This includes, but need not be restricted to, patient selection and assessment, preprocedural testing, fasting guidelines, equipment and electrical outlets, oxygen and suction, ventilation and scavenging if inhalational agents will be utilized, medications and equipment required for resuscitation, patient monitoring, the recovery facility and anesthesia support personnel. Any location outside of an operating room where anesthesiologists provide care must be approved by the anesthesia leadership of the facility. Appropriately trained and experienced anesthesia support personnel, for example an Anesthesia Assistant (see section 2.5) or other staff with experience supporting anesthesia should be present or immediately available to assist the anesthesiologist in remote locations. It is not appropriate to rely solely on procedural unit staff to support anesthesia unless they have had training and experience in the direct support of the delivery of anesthesia care and are approved by anesthesia leadership. There must be reliable two-way communication available to call for assistance and support of the anesthesia provider as it may be required.

Guide d'exercice de l'anesthe ´sie de la SCA E ´ dition re ´vise ´e 2021

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Re ´sume ´ Le Guide d'exercice de l'anesthe ´sie, version re ´ vise ´ e 2021 (le Guide), a e ´ te ´ pre ´pare ´ par la Socie ´te ´ canadienne des anesthe ´siologistes (SCA), qui se re ´serve le droit de de ´ cider des termes de sa publication et de sa diffusion. Le Guide est soumis a ` re ´vision et des versions mises a ` jour sont publie ´es chaque anne ´e. Le Guide d'exercice de l'anesthe ´sie, version re ´ vise ´ e 2021, remplace toutes les versions pre ´ce ´ demment publie ´es de ce document. Bien que la SCA incite les anesthe ´siologistes du Canada a ` se conformer a ` son guide d'exercice pour assurer une grande qualite ´ des soins dispense ´s aux patients, elle ne peut garantir les re ´ sultats d'une intervention spe ´cifique. Les anesthe ´siologistes doivent exercer leur jugement professionnel pour de ´ terminer la me ´thode d'intervention la mieux adapte ´e a ` l'e ´ tat de leur patient. La SCA n'accepte aucune responsabilite ´ ou imputabilite ´ de quelque nature que ce soit de ´ coulant d'erreurs ou d'omissions ou de l'utilisation des renseignements contenus dans son Guide d'exercice de l'anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pre ´ambule

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'anesthe ´siologie est une spe ´cialite ´ dynamique de la me ´decine qui encourage les progre `s constants en matie `re de soins anesthe ´siques pour les patients subissant des interventions chirurgicales et obste ´tricales au Canada. Le pre ´sent guide est revu annuellement et re ´ vise ´ de fac¸on pe ´riodique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les recommandations suivantes ont pour objectif de proposer des lignes directrices de base touchant l'exercice de l'anesthe ´sie. Leur but est de constituer un cadre pour la prestation de soins aux patients qui soient raisonnables et acceptables, et c'est ainsi qu'elles devraient e ˆ tre interpre ´te ´es, ce qui permet une certaine flexibilite ´ selon les circonstances. Chaque partie du Guide peut faire l'objet de re ´vision au besoin, selon l'e ´volution de la technologie et de la pratique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1 Principes de base

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dans le pre ´sent document, le mot anesthe ´siologiste est utilise ´ pour de ´signer toute personne qui a un permis d'exercer la me ´decine avec privile `ge d'administrer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
l'anesthe ´sie. L'anesthe ´sie est la re ´ alisation de ´libe ´re ´e de toute intervention visant a ` rendre un patient temporairement insensible a ` la douleur ou a ` l'environnement externe dans le but d'exe ´cuter une intervention diagnostique ou the ´rapeutique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le pre ´sent Guide s'adresse a ` tous les anesthe ´siologistes du Canada. L'exercice inde ´pendant de l'anesthe ´sie est une spe ´cialite ´ me ´dicale et, a ` ce titre, elle doit e ˆtre exerce ´e par des me ´decins ayant une formation approprie ´e en anesthe ´sie. Le processus de certification du Colle `ge royal des me ´decins et chirurgiens du Canada constitue la seule voie de reconnaissance comme spe ´cialiste en anesthe ´sie au Canada.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La Socie ´te ´ canadienne des anesthe ´siologistes (SCA) reconna ˆ ı t que la population dans les collectivite ´s e ´loigne ´es n'est souvent pas suffisamment nombreuse pour justifier une pratique d'anesthe ´siologie spe ´cialise ´e. Dans ces collectivite ´s, des me ´decins de famille ayant rec ¸u une formation ade ´quate pourraient e ˆtre appele ´s a ` dispenser les services d'anesthe ´sie. Dans les communaute ´s ou' le volume clinique est suffisamment important pour justifier l'emploi d'anesthe ´siologistes a ` temps plein, des anesthe ´siologistes ayant comple ´te ´ leur spe ´cialisation devraient offrir ces services. Tous les anesthe ´siologistes doivent poursuivre une formation continue dans la pratique de l'anesthe ´sie, de la prise en charge de la douleur, des soins pe ´riope ´ratoires et de la re ´animation, et participer a ` un programme structure ´ de maintien des compe ´tences (par ex., MDC du Colle `ge royal).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2 Organisation des services d'anesthe ´sie

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie devrait e ˆtre organise ´, dirige ´ et inte ´gre ´ de fac ¸on approprie ´e aux autres de ´partements de l'organisme ou de l'e ´tablissement, et devrait regrouper tous les membres du personnel de l'e ´tablissement qui assurent des soins anesthe ´siques aux patients, aussi bien a ` des fins chirurgicales, obste ´tricales, diagnostiques ou the ´rapeutiques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compte tenu de l'ampleur et de la nature des services offerts, le de ´partement devrait comporter le personnel ne ´cessaire et s'efforcer d'assurer que ces services soient disponibles comme l'e ´tablissement de soins de sante ´ le requiert.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le chef du de ´partement devrait e ˆtre un me ´decin certifie ´ en anesthe ´sie ou encore posse ´dant une formation ade ´quate en anesthe ´sie. Cette personne devrait e ˆtre nomme ´e de la me ˆme manie `re que les autres chefs de de ´partements cliniques et devrait faire partie des entite ´s administratives me ´dicales supe ´rieures de l'e ´tablissement.

2.1 Responsabilite ´s du chef du de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conna ˆ ı tre les directives du pre ´sent Guide d'exercice de l'anesthe ´sie de la SCA ainsi que les exigences du Conseil canadien d'agre ´ment des services de sante ´ et celles du Colle `ge des me ´decins de la province en ce qui a trait a ` l'anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Veiller a ` ce que, en matie `re d'exercice de l'anesthe ´sie, des directives e ´crites soient e ´tablies et suivies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
e ´ valuer la compe ´tence et les capacite ´s des me ´decins qui dispensent les soins anesthe ´siques ainsi que celles des autres professionnels de la sante ´ qui assurent les services de soutien - ce qui comprend, sans cependant s'y limiter, les recommandations touchant les privile `ges cliniques accorde ´s aux me ´decins qui exercent l'anesthe ´sie et la re ´vision annuelle de tels privile `ges.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoir recours a ` une approche syste ´matique pour surveiller la qualite ´ des soins anesthe ´siques offerts par les membres du de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie a ` la grandeur de l'e ´tablissement de soins de sante ´.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La surveillance de la qualite ´ des soins peut comprendre, sans cependant s'y limiter, le recours a ` des ve ´rifications de dossiers, la surveillance d'indicateurs et de suivis cliniques, les syste `mes de surveillance des e ´ ve `nements inde ´sirables, des confe ´rences sur la morbidite ´ et la mortalite ´, et la re ´ vision des cas d'incidents critiques. L'e ´tendue des activite ´s d'ame ´lioration de la qualite ´ variera selon les ressources de ´partementales et institutionnelles mises a ` la disposition du chef de de ´partement. Pour une ame ´lioration efficace de la qualite ´, tous les membres du de ´partement sont fortement encourage ´s a ` prendre une part active a ` de telles activite ´s.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Veiller a ` conserver un dossier pour toute proce ´dure d'anesthe ´sie. Ces dossiers doivent permettre de proce ´der a ` l'e ´valuation de l'ensemble des soins anesthe ´siques dans l'e ´tablissement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
S'acquitter de toute autre ta ˆche que la direction de l'e ´tablissement pourrait lui confier pour assurer des soins anesthe ´siques se ´curitaires.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Promouvoir la conformite ´ aux normes applicables de l'Association canadienne de normalisation (CSA) au sein de l'e ´tablissement (Annexe 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coordonner la liaison entre le de ´partement d'anesthe ´siologie et les services de ge ´nie biome ´dical et de gestion de l'information.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.2 Privile `ges d'exercice en anesthe ´sie

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tous les me ´decins qui demandent le privile `ge d'exercer l'anesthe ´sie devraient avoir comple ´te ´ avec succe `s une formation postdoctorale spe ´cialise ´e en anesthe ´sie ou une formation a ` l'anesthe ´sie en pratique de me ´decine de famille. La norme est une formation dans l'un des programmes universitaires approuve ´s par le Colle `ge royal des me ´decins et chirurgiens du Canada. Les diplo ˆme ´s en me ´decine en provenance d'autres pays et dont la licence a e ´ te ´ approuve ´e par les organismes de re ` glementation provinciaux devraient avoir comple ´te ´ une formation e ´ quivalente a ` la norme canadienne. Les me ´decins de famille pratiquant l'anesthe ´sie doivent avoir comple ´te ´ avec succe `s un programme postdoctoral spe ´cifique comprenant au moins un an de formation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.3 Certains domaines spe ´cifiques des soins anesthe ´siques

<!-- PAGE=? -->
peuvent avoir des pre ´occupations qui leur sont propres. Le de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie de chaque institution peut de ´terminer les privile `ges en anesthe ´sie pe ´diatrique, selon la population pe ´diatrique que l'institution dessert, l'a ˆge de l'enfant, la pre ´sence de comorbidite ´s, la formation spe ´cifique du me ´decin et son expe ´rience en anesthe ´sie pe ´diatrique, ainsi que la complexite ´ de l'intervention en question.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les me ´decins qui obtiennent le privile `ge d'exercer l'anesthe ´sie devraient posse ´der les connaissances ainsi que les habilete ´s techniques et non techniques indispensables a ` la pratique de l'anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ces connaissances et ces compe ´tences techniques comprennent la capacite ´ de :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Effectuer une e ´valuation pre ´anesthe ´sique du patient et de ´cider de la prise en charge anesthe ´sique approprie ´e;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rendre le patient insensible a ` la douleur pour la pratique des interventions diagnostiques et the ´rapeutiques, ainsi que des interventions chirurgicales et obste ´tricales;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitorer et soutenir les fonctions vitales des organes en pe ´riode pe ´riope ´ratoire;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assurer la prise en charge postanesthe ´sique imme ´diate du patient;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pratiquer des manœuvres de re ´animation et procurer des soins intensifs lorsqu'indique ´s; et

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Procurer le soulagement de la douleur aigue ¨ et chronique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les compe ´tences non techniques comprennent :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La gestion des ta ˆches : planification et pre ´paration, priorisation, prestation et maintien des normes, et identification et utilisation des ressources;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le travail en e ´quipe : coordination des activite ´s avec les membres de l'e ´quipe, e ´change des informations, usage de l'autorite ´ et de l'affirmation de soi, e ´valuation des capacite ´s, soutien aux autres, et respect de la Liste de

<!-- PAGE=? -->
contro ˆle de la se ´ curite ´ chirurgicale de l'Organisation mondiale de la sante ´;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La conscience situationnelle : anticipation, re ´colte des informations, identification et compre ´hension; et

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La prise de de ´cision : identification des options, e ´ valuation des risques et choix des options, re ´ e ´valuation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.4 Aptitude a ` la pratique

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La prestation de soins anesthe ´siques requiert que l'anesthe ´siologiste posse `de un niveau e ´ leve ´ d'expertise, un bon jugement et la capacite ´ de reconna ˆ ı tre des situations cliniques changeantes et d'y re ´ agir et ce, malgre ´ des circonstances physiques personnelles parfois de ´favorables. Les de ´partements d'anesthe ´sie doivent e ˆtre conscients que des praticiens en anesthe ´sie en sante ´ fournissent des soins optimaux aux patients. Par conse ´quent, les de ´partements d'anesthe ´sie ont l'obligation de mettre au point des politiques qui garantissent, dans la mesure du possible, que les praticiens soient en bonne sante ´ et aptes a ` remplir les obligations lie ´es a ` leur pratique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plusieurs facteurs peuvent affecter ne ´gativement la sante ´ et l'aptitude au travail, notamment les maladies physiques, les troubles mentaux et la fatigue. Tous ces facteurs alte `rent la sante ´ et l'aptitude a ` reconna ˆ ı tre des circonstances cliniques e ´ voluant souvent tre `s rapidement et a ` y re ´agir de fac ¸on adapte ´e. De nombreuses e ´tudes ont de ´montre ´ que la fatigue alte ´rait le jugement et la performance psychomotrice de fac ¸on semblable aux drogues ou a ` l'alcool. Des rythmes circadiens irre ´guliers, le vieillissement et le manque de sommeil aggravent de tels proble `mes; une non-reconnaissance de ces proble `mes, cause ´e par la fatigue, peut augmenter la probabilite ´ de commettre des erreurs dans de telles circonstances. Un handicap physique, la maladie et un stress important peuvent avoir des effets ne ´fastes semblables sur la performance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.5 La responsabilite ´ incombe aux de ´partements

<!-- PAGE=? -->
d'anesthe ´sie et aux anesthe ´siologistes en tant qu'individus d'organiser leurs ta ˆches professionnelles de telle sorte que la maladie et la fatigue n'affectent pas re ´gulie `rement leurs ta ˆches cliniques. Les listes de garde de chacun doivent permettre un repos adapte ´ entre les quarts de travail, et les listes quotidiennes doivent allouer des pauses adapte ´es afin de respecter les besoins physiologiques, la nutrition et l'aptitude mentale de chaque anesthe ´siologiste. La planification des salles d'ope ´ration devrait e ´viter d'exiger que les anesthe ´siologistes entreprennent des interventions non urgentes pendant des heures de ´favorables.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aucune recommandation spe ´cifique concernant les quarts de travail et la liste de garde quotidienne ne peut e ˆ tre adapte ´e a ` toutes les situations de travail. Les grands de ´partements disposent de la flexibilite ´ ne ´cessaire a ` inte ´grer des quarts de travail courts et des conge ´s personnels, alors que les de ´partements plus petits pourraient ne pas jouir de cette liberte ´. Toutefois, ce domaine important de l'exercice professionnel doit faire l'objet d'une attention et d'une conside ´ration constantes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.6 Re ´sidents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les re ´sidents en anesthe ´sie sont des me ´decins autorise ´s qui participent a ` la prestation des soins anesthe ´siques tant en salle d'ope ´ration qu'a ` l'exte ´rieur de celle-ci dans le cadre de leur formation. Le Colle `ge royal des me ´decins et chirurgiens du Canada et les organismes de re `glementation provinciaux et locaux exigent qu'un anesthe ´siologiste responsable supervise toutes les activite ´s des re ´ sidents. Le degre ´ de supervision doit prendre en conside ´ration l'e ´tat de chaque patient, la nature des soins anesthe ´siques, ainsi que l'expe ´rience et les capacite ´s du re ´sident (responsabilite ´ professionnelle croissante). A' la discre ´tion de l'anesthe ´siologiste superviseur, les re ´ sidents peuvent fournir une gamme de soins anesthe ´siques sous un minimum de supervision. Dans tous les cas, l'anesthe ´siologiste superviseur doit demeurer promptement disponible afin de prodiguer des conseils ou d'assister le re ´ sident lors de soins urgents ou de routine. Que la supervision soit directe ou indirecte, une communication e ´ troite entre le re ´ sident et l'anesthe ´siologiste superviseur est essentielle pour garantir des soins se ´ curitaires aux patients. Chaque de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie qui enseigne aux re ´ sidents en anesthe ´sie doit avoir des politiques en place concernant les activite ´s et la supervision des re ´sidents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.7 Personnel de soutien

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'e ´tablissement de soins de sante ´ doit s'assurer de la disponibilite ´ de personnel de soutien pour remplir un ro ˆle d'assistance aupre `s de l'anesthe ´siologiste. Cette assistance doit e ˆ tre disponible en tout temps et en tout lieu ou' des services d'anesthe ´sie sont offerts. Le personnel de soutien doit posse ´der les compe ´tences ne ´cessaires a ` re ´ pondre aux besoins spe ´cifiques des domaines de surspe ´cialite ´ de l'anesthe ´sie, ce qui se re ´ percute sur le besoin de compe ´tences spe ´cifiques dans des domaines tels que l'anesthe ´sie spe ´cialise ´e en pe ´diatrie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On recommande aux e ´tablissements de disposer d'un assistant en anesthe ´sie formellement de ´signe ´ qui aura rec ¸u une formation spe ´cifique en assistance en anesthe ´sie. Le de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie et les autorite ´s administratives

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
115

<!-- PAGE=? -->
compe ´tentes doivent approuver l'e ´tendue des ta ˆches des assistants en anesthe ´sie travaillant dans un e ´tablissement en particulier. En outre, les assistants en anesthe ´sie, tout comme les autres professionnels de la sante ´ employe ´s par l'e ´tablissement, doivent e ˆ tre prote ´ge ´s par l'assuranceresponsabilite ´ de l'e ´tablissement. Les responsabilite ´s et les ta ˆches de ´le ´gue ´es aux assistants en anesthe ´sie doivent e ˆ tre conformes aux re ` glements gouvernementaux en vigueur, aux politiques et lignes directrices e ´ dicte ´es par les organismes de re `glementation de la profession, et aux politiques de l'e ´tablissement local.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un e ´ tablissement ne disposant pas d'assistants en anesthe ´sie en bonne et due forme doit mettre a ` disposition de l'anesthe ´siologiste du personnel parame ´dical afin de l'assister. Les ta ˆches incombant a ` ces assistants doivent e ˆ tre clairement de ´finies. Un anesthe ´siologiste ne doit leur de ´le ´guer ou impartir que les ta ˆches pour lesquelles ils ont e ´te ´ autorise ´s ou approuve ´s.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3 Mate ´riel d'anesthe ´sie et lieux convenant a ` l'anesthe ´sie

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'anesthe ´sie doit se pratiquer dans un e ´ tablissement adapte ´. Tout le mate ´riel ne ´cessaire, y compris le mate ´riel d'urgence, les syste `mes de soutien des fonctions vitales, les me ´dicaments et les autres fournitures, doit e ˆtre a ` porte ´e de main. Il est fortement recommande ´ qu'un manuel de listes de contro ˆle et d'aides cognitives soit disponible dans tous les lieux ou ` l'anesthe ´sie est pratique ´e afin de soutenir la prise en charge des urgences pe ´riope ´ratoires critiques. Le contenu de ce manuel devrait e ˆ tre re ´ vise ´ et mis a ` jour re ´ gulie `rement selon les besoins et re ´ pe ´te ´ de fac ¸on pe ´riodique en e ´quipe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'e ´tablissement de soins de sante ´, en consultation avec le de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie, est responsable de l'ame ´nagement et de l'entretien des lieux servant aux soins pre ´ope ´ratoires, postope ´ratoires et anesthe ´siques, ainsi que de l'achat, de l'entretien et du traitement apre `s utilisation du mate ´riel et des fournitures servant a ` l'anesthe ´sie et aux autres fonctions connexes. L'Association canadienne de normalisation (CSA) et d'autres organismes d'e ´laboration de normes ont publie ´ des normes et des recommandations se rapportant a ` la conception, la construction et la re ´ novation des e ´ tablissements de sante ´, ainsi que concernant la gestion du risque, la se ´ curite ´ de base et les performances essentielles du mate ´riel me ´dical (Annexe 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3.1 Responsabilite ´s de l'e ´tablissement de sante ´

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Il incombe a ` l'e ´tablissement de soins de sante ´ de veiller a ` l'application des mesures suivantes :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les salles d'ope ´ration, d'anesthe ´sie et de soins pe ´riope ´ratoires doivent respecter au minimum les exigences minimales d'ame ´nagement et de construction des codes nationaux, provinciaux et locaux concernant la charpente, la plomberie, l'e ´lectricite ´, le CVC (chauffage, ventilation et climatisation), la protection incendie et les codes de se ´ curite ´ au moment de leur construction ou de leur re ´ novation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les syste `mes d'e ´vacuation des gaz me ´dicaux et de vidange, les syste `mes de re ´ cupe ´ration des gaz anesthe ´siques, les unite ´s terminales, les murs de soutien, les raccordements a ` basse pression et les re ´ gulateurs de pression doivent e ˆ tre conformes aux exigences de la CSA et porter le sceau d'approbation d'une agence de ve ´rification reconnue par la CSA.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les concentrateurs d'oxyge `ne conformes aux normes de la CSA sont un substitut acceptable a ` l'oxyge `ne fourni par un syste `me central. Lorsque de tels concentrateurs sont installe ´s, il faut savoir :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Que l'approvisionnement d'oxyge `ne me ´dical de l'e ´tablissement peut dispenser une fraction d'oxyge `ne inspire ´e (FiO2) variant entre 0,93 et 0,99;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Que les analyseurs d'oxyge `ne doivent e ˆtre calibre ´s avec de l'O2 a ` 100 % (soit FiO2 0,99) et a ` l'air ambiant ou l'e ´quivalent (soit FiO2 0,21);

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Que l'utilisation de techniques anesthe ´siques a ` faible de ´bit (moins d'un litre de gaz frais total) peut entra ˆ ı ner une accumulation de gaz inerte (argon) et la dilution du protoxyde d'azote dans le circuit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'entreposage, la pre ´paration, l'identification, l'e ´tiquetage, l'e ´limination et l'utilisation des gaz me ´dicaux, des me ´dicaments et du mate ´riel affe ´rent doivent e ˆ tre conformes a ` toutes les re `gles de se ´curite ´.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les recommandations concernant la se ´curite ´ des me ´dicaments comprennent, sans ne ´cessairement s'y limiter :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'identification d'une personne-ressource de ´signe ´e au sein du de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie qui coope `re avec la pharmacie afin de promouvoir les meilleures pratiques en matie `re de se ´curite ´ des me ´dicaments. Afin de tenir compte du risque accru d'erreurs me ´dicamenteuses lie ´es aux substitutions des me ´dicaments de marque et aux emballages similaires, les de ´partements et les pharmacies devraient e ´ laborer des strate ´gies pour re ´duire ces risques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
116

<!-- PAGE=? -->
G. Dobson et al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La demande que la pharmacie informe le personnel d'anesthe ´sie, dans les meilleurs de ´lais possibles, de tout changement de fournisseur me ´dical, d'emballages ou de concentrations afin que le personnel d'anesthe ´sie soit vigilant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La standardisation des plateaux de me ´dicaments dans tous les emplacements et pendant les transitions de produits. Les me ´dicaments provenant de diffe ´rents fabricants et dont les emballages diffe `rent ne devraient pas e ˆ tre me ´lange ´s sur un me ˆme chariot d'anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lors de toute introduction de nouveau me ´dicament, les substitutions de me ´dicaments, particulie `rement a ` des concentrations diffe ´rentes, devraient e ˆ tre e ´ tiquete ´es a ` l'aide d'e ´tiquettes de mise en garde particulie `rement visibles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les me ´dicaments ayant une ressemblance visuelle devraient e ˆ tre, autant que possible, se ´pare ´s dans les chariots d'anesthe ´sie et identifie ´s a ` l'aide d'e ´tiquettes de mise en garde.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les me ´decins et le personnel de soutien technique doivent e ˆ tre mis en garde que la remise de me ´dicaments non ouverts dans le chariot d'anesthe ´sie est risque ´e parce que les me ´dicaments pourraient e ˆ tre dispose ´s au mauvais emplacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tout e ´ve ´nement inde ´sirable lie ´ a ` un me ´dicament doit e ˆ tre rapporte ´ via les syste `mes locaux de surveillance des e ´ve ´nements inde ´sirables ou via le CAIRS (syste `me de de ´claration des incidents en anesthe ´sie), ou les deux.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Des re `gles doivent e ˆtre e ´labore ´es et applique ´es via une collaboration entre les services d'anesthe ´sie et de pharmacie pour la manipulation, le stockage et l'e ´limination se ´ curitaires des me ´dicaments contro ˆle ´s (p. ex., les opio ¨ ı des) dans les salles d'ope ´ration et dans les unite ´s de soins post-anesthe ´sie; ces re `gles doivent e ˆ tre en conformite ´ avec les lois, les exigences des agences de re ´glementation et re ´ pondre aux principes des meilleures pratiques. Les objectifs de telles politiques doivent e ˆ tre de limiter l'acce `s du personnel non autorise ´ aux me ´dicaments contro ˆle ´s, de limiter le risque de de ´tournement des me ´dicaments contro ˆle ´s, de mettre en place des proce ´dures strictes de documentation permettant leur ve ´rification, tout en prote ´geant e ´ galement la se ´ curite ´ des patients en permettant aux prestataires d'anesthe ´sie d'avoir un acce `s imme ´diat a ` tout me ´dicament ne ´cessaire aux soins des patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les principes des meilleures pratiques pro ˆnent diverses strate ´gies spe ´cifiques pour atteindre ces objectifs. La SCA ne pre ´conise pas une strate ´gie ou politique spe ´cifique en particulier mais recommande fortement que toutes les options disponibles soient envisage ´es. Des syste `mes et proce ´dures fiables doivent e ˆtre mis en œuvre. Une attention particulie `re doit e ˆ tre porte ´e a ` toute restriction des ressources disponibles pour mettre en œuvre des syste `mes et interventions de se ´curite ´ spe ´cifiques au sein d'un e ´ tablissement, particulie `rement dans les plus petits e ´ tablissements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les recommandations comprennent, sans ne ´cessairement s'y limiter:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
l'entreposage des substances contro ˆle ´es dans un coffrefort verrouillable et se ´ curitaire ou dans un tiroir verrouille ´ lorsqu'il n'y a pas de personnel d'anesthe ´sie en SOP (par ex., entre deux cas);

<!-- PAGE=? -->
le fait de ne jamais laisser de substances contro ˆle ´es

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(y compris celles pre ´pare ´es dans des seringues ou des sacs) sans surveillance, quel que soit le lieu;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
la vidange du contenu des seringues et sacs contenant des substances contro ˆle ´es avant de les jeter;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
l'adoption de syste `mes d'e ´limination et/ou de destruction pour se de ´barrasser des substances

<!-- PAGE=? -->
contro ˆle ´es inutilise ´es;

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Par exemple, les salles d'ope ´ration, d'accouchement, de re ´ veil et de blocs re ´gionaux devraient toutes e ˆtre reconnues comme des zones a ` risque e ´ leve ´ de de ´tournement de me ´dicaments contro ˆle ´s; par conse ´quent, elles devraient faire l'objet d'une se ´ curite ´, d'une surveillance et de contro ˆles accrus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
En cas d'anesthe ´sie ge ´ne ´rale, les syste `mes d'anesthe ´sie e ´ lectroniques doivent re ´ pondre a ` la norme CAN/CSA - C22.2 N8 60601-2-13. Une autre me ´thode de ventilation (par ex. un ballon manuel et un masque de re ´ animation) doit e ˆ tre a ` porte ´e de main a ` co ˆ te ´ de chaque appareil d'anesthe ´sie. Les stations de travail doivent disposer d'au moins un analyseur d'oxyge `ne, un moniteur de la pression des voies ae ´riennes, un syste `me d'e ´vacuation des gaz anesthe ´siques re ´siduels et un appareil de succion trache ´ale puissant avec un

dispositif supple ´mentaire de succion. En cas d'utilisation de vaporisateurs, ceux-ci doivent utiliser un dispositif de remplissage spe ´cifique a ` chaque agent afin de garantir le remplissage par le bon agent. S'il y a un ventilateur, il doit e ˆ tre muni d'une alarme de basse pression ou de de ´connexion. Autant que possible, l'utilisation de faibles de ´bits de gaz d'anesthe ´sie est recommande ´e pour faciliter l'utilisation efficiente des agents anesthe ´siques inhale ´s et pour minimiser l'impact environnemental des agents rejete ´s a ` l'exte ´rieur. Le de ´bit global minimum de gaz ne ´cessaire variera en fonction de l'agent inhale ´ et du contexte clinique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le mate ´riel, les fournitures et l'aide ne ´cessaires a ` l'exe ´cution se ´ curitaire de proce ´dures invasives sont disponibles. Des appareils de diagnostic, tels que, entre autres, les neurostimulateurs, les appareils d'e ´chographie, les amplificateurs d'image et les appareils de radiographie, devraient e ˆ tre a ` la disposition de l'anesthe ´siologiste au besoin. Des dispositifs d'e ´chographie de ´die ´s doivent e ˆ tre mis a ` disposition par l'e ´tablissement pour l'installation de cathe ´ters veineux centraux et arte ´riels. Le recours a ` l'e ´choguidage en temps re ´el pour le positionnement non urgent d'un cathe ´ter veineux central jugulaire interne est fortement recommande ´ lorsque le personnel qui administre l'anesthe ´sie posse `de la formation et l'expe ´rience avec cette technique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un « chariot de re ´animation » comprenant le mate ´riel ne ´cessaire a ` une re ´animation d'urgence, y compris un dispositif de re ´animation manuelle, un de ´fibrillateur respectant les Lignes directrices actuelles de la Fondation canadienne des maladies du cœur, les me ´dicaments adapte ´s et les dispositifs intraveineux, doit e ˆtre a ` porte ´e de main.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le mate ´riel ne ´cessaire a ` la re ´animation des enfants et des nourrissons doit e ˆtre imme ´diatement disponible en tout lieu ou ` une se ´dation ou une anesthe ´sie est pratique ´e sur des enfants. Il doit e ˆ tre e ´ galement disponible en tout lieu recevant des patients pe ´diatriques susceptibles de ne ´cessiter une re ´animation, tel que le service des urgences. Ce mate ´riel doit faciliter une ventilation au masque, une intubation endotrache ´ale, l'administration de solute ´s, le monitorage de la tempe ´rature et la conduite d'une re ´ animation cardiorespiratoire avance ´e. Une trousse d'urgence pe ´diatrique a ` code couleur base ´e sur la taille de l'enfant (p. ex., Breslow TM ) peut faciliter la re ´ alisation d'une re ´ animation pe ´diatrique par des praticiens peu habitue ´s a ` prendre en charge cette population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
En cas d'utilisation d'agents de ´clencheurs d'hyperthermie maligne, une « Trousse d'hyperthermie maligne » respectant les lignes directrices de l'Association d'hyperthermie maligne des E ´ tats-Unis doit e ˆtre a ` porte ´e imme ´diate (Annexe 4).

Une « Trousse pour voies ae ´riennes difficiles » sera a ` porte ´e imme ´diate pour la prise en charge des voies ae ´riennes difficiles ou lors d'un e ´chec d'intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les e ´ tablissements qui prennent soin d'enfants doivent disposer d'e ´quipements pour voies ae ´riennes pe ´diatriques spe ´cialise ´s a ` porte ´e imme ´diate. Dans tous les endroits ou ` l'on pratique l'anesthe ´sie obste ´tricale, un endroit spe ´cifique re ´ serve ´ a ` l'e ´valuation et a ` la re ´ animation du nouveau-ne ´ doit e ˆ tre pre ´vu. Cet endroit doit e ˆ tre pourvu de sources d'oxyge `ne, d'appareils de succion et de prises de courant de ´die ´s, ainsi que d'une source de chaleur radiante et de mate ´riel ne ´cessaire a ` la prise en charge des voies ae ´riennes et a ` la re ´animation ne ´onatale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Des dispositifs de protection personnelle, y compris des masques N95, des masques faciaux et des moyens d'e ´limination des de ´chets dangereux et infectieux ainsi que des objets aiguise ´s, sont a ` porte ´e de main. Les environnements chirurgicaux, diagnostiques, the ´rapeutiques et esthe ´tiques doivent disposer de syste `mes d'aspiration de fume ´e respectant la norme CSA Z305.13-09.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les syste `mes de pompes de perfusion avec une bibliothe `que de me ´dicaments, les limites relatives et absolues pour chaque me ´dicament ainsi que l'activation des alarmes pour l'administration des me ´dicaments en perfusion intraveineuse continue sont disponibles pour re ´pondre aux besoins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une alimentation en oxyge `ne doit e ˆtre fournie pour le transport des patients pe ´riope ´ratoires. L'utilisation de cylindres de transport d'oxyge `ne qui peuvent e ´mettre une alarme audible lorsque la pression est faible est fortement recommande ´e.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le personnel compe ´tent inspecte et entretient re ´ gulie `rement tout le mate ´riel d'anesthe ´sie et connexe. L'administration de l'e ´tablissement et le de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie conserveront les documents attestant de la conformite ´ aux re ` glements, des inspections et de l'entretien.

3.2 Gaz re ´siduels

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommandations visant a ` diminuer l'exposition professionnelle aux gaz anesthe ´siques re ´siduels :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une ventilation par dilution assurant 20 renouvellements par heure doit e ˆ tre disponible dans toutes les salles d'anesthe ´sie dans lesquelles des gaz anesthe ´siques volatils ou du N2O sont utilise ´s.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La recirculation de l'air vicie ´ ne sera pas permise durant les heures d'activite ´ de la salle d'ope ´ration et n'est pas recommande ´e en toute autre pe ´riode.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Partout ou ` un syste `me d'administration de gaz anesthe ´siques est utilise ´, un syste `me d'e ´vacuation doit e ˆ tre mis en place afin de recueillir les gaz anesthe ´siques qui peuvent s'e ´chapper du circuit d'anesthe ´sie ou du ventilateur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un programme d'entretien doit e ˆtre mis en place dans chaque e ´tablissement de soins de sante ´ afin de de ´tecter et de re ´parer toute fuite du syste `me de distribution des gaz anesthe ´siques et de veiller au bon fonctionnement du syste `me d'e ´vacuation des gaz anesthe ´siques re ´ siduels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'e ´tablissement de sante ´ sera responsable d'effectuer une surveillance re ´ gulie `re de l'exposition aux gaz anesthe ´siques re ´ siduels. Le protocole de surveillance devrait inclure les individus et la distribution de l'e ´coulement de l'air dans les salles e ´value ´es. Lorsque le N2O est utilise ´ en salle d'ope ´ration, la surveillance du N2O constitue une fac ¸on acceptable de ve ´rifier l'efficacite ´ du syste `me d'e ´vacuation des gaz.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4 La pe ´riode pre ´anesthe ´sique

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie devrait formuler les politiques concernant l'e ´valuation pre ´anesthe ´sique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le principal objet de l'e ´valuation pre ´anesthe ´sique est d'obtenir les renseignements requis pour planifier la prise en charge anesthe ´sique. Par conse ´quent, un me ´decin bien informe ´ quant a ` la prise en charge anesthe ´sique pour la proce ´dure diagnostique ou the ´rapeutique propose ´e devrait documenter tous les aspects des ante ´ce ´dents me ´dicochirurgicaux du patient, le bilan de l'examen physique et les re ´sultats des analyses de laboratoire pertinents a ` la prise

<!-- PAGE=? -->
en charge anesthe ´sique. Les ante ´ce ´dents du patient devraient inclure les proble `mes me ´dicaux passe ´s et actuels, la prise de me ´dicaments re ´ cente et actuelle, les re ´ actions ou re ´ ponses inhabituelles aux me ´dicaments et tous les proble `mes et complications associe ´s aux anesthe ´sies administre ´es ante ´rieurement. Il y a lieu de conna ˆ ı tre e ´galement les ante ´ce ´dents familiaux de re ´actions inde ´sirables associe ´es a ` l'anesthe ´sie. Tout renseignement concernant l'anesthe ´sie que le patient juge pertinent de signaler devrait e ´ galement e ˆ tre note ´. Il convient enfin d'inscrire au dossier me ´dical de chaque patient le code de classification de l'American Society of Anesthesiologists (Annexe 2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dans les cas adapte ´s, la disponibilite ´ d'un « Plan de soins avance ´s » (accord de repre ´sentation, directive pre ´alable, « testament biologique », directive « ne pas re ´ animer », etc.) doit e ˆ tre ve ´rifie ´e et son applicabilite ´ a ` l'intervention propose ´e de ´termine ´e et documente ´e au dossier d'e ´valuation anesthe ´sique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le chirurgien peut solliciter une consultation avec un anesthe ´siologiste. Les consultations me ´dicales devraient e ˆ tre obtenues lorsque cela est indique ´.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le bilan ou la consultation anesthe ´sique pre ´ope ´ratoire peut avoir lieu en clinique externe avant l'admission pour l'ope ´ration. Les indications concernant l'e ´valuation pre ´alable a ` l'admission comprennent l'existence de proble `mes me ´dicaux importants (comorbidite ´s), la nature de la proce ´dure diagnostique ou the ´rapeutique propose ´e, et la demande du patient. La pre ´sence d'un parent/tuteur le ´gal est ne ´cessaire si le patient est un enfant ou n'est pas apte a ` fournir un consentement e ´claire ´. Tous les patients devraient e ˆ tre informe ´s que des dispositions seront prises pour rencontrer un anesthe ´siologiste s'ils souhaitent s'entretenir de leur prise en charge anesthe ´sique avant leur admission a ` l'e ´tablissement. La clinique d'e ´valuation pre ´ope ´ratoire devrait e ´galement permettre au personnel infirmier et aux autres membres du personnel de sante ´ d'e ´valuer le patient. L'anesthe ´siologiste en charge du patient est responsable de l'e ´valuation pre ´anesthe ´sique finale durant la pe ´riode pre ´ope ´ratoire imme ´diate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4.1 Examens pre ´ope ´ratoires

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les examens de laboratoire ne devraient pas e ˆtre re ´alise ´s sur une base re ´ gulie `re mais uniquement lorsque les re ´ sultats modifieront la prise en charge pe ´riope ´ratoire. Les analyses de laboratoire devraient e ˆtre re ´alise ´es lorsque l'e ´tat du patient, le traitement me ´dicamenteux et la nature de l'intervention propose ´e les justifient. Les tests sanguins de laboratoire, les e ´ lectrocardiogrammes et les radiographies du poumon de routine ne sont pas recommande ´s chez les patients asymptomatiques subissant une chirurgie a ` faible risque.

4.2 Lignes directrices concernant le jeu ˆne

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les re `gles concernant le jeu ˆne devraient varier en fonction de l'a ˆge du patient et de ses ante ´ce ´dents me ´dicaux et s'appliquer a ` toutes les formes d'anesthe ´sie, incluant la se ´ dation proce ´durale (voir Annexe 6). 1 Les interventions tre `s urgentes ou urgentes doivent e ˆtre re ´alise ´es apre `s avoir examine ´ les risques qu'entra ˆ ı nerait leur report comparativement au risque d'aspiration du contenu de l'estomac. Le type et la quantite ´ de nourriture absorbe ´e doivent e ˆtre pris en conside ´ration pour de ´terminer la dure ´e du jeu ˆne.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avant une intervention non urgente, la dure ´e minimale du jeu ˆne devait e ˆtre de :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Huit heures apre `s un repas copieux comportant des aliments solides, particulie `rement s'il contenait des prote ´ines (par ex. de la viande) ou des aliments gras;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Six heures apre `s un repas le ´ger (par ex. repas faible en gras tel une tartine);

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Six heures apre `s l'ingestion de lait maternise ´, de lait non humain ou de lait maternel tire ´ et fortifie ´ avec des adjuvants;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Quatre heures apre `s l'ingestion de lait maternel;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deux heures apre `s l'ingestion de liquides clairs pour un adulte;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une heure apre `s l'ingestion de liquides clairs pour les nourrissons ou les enfants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sauf contre-indication, il convient d'encourager les adultes et les enfants a ` boire des liquides clairs (eau, jus sans pulpe, boissons a ` base de sucres complexes et the ´ ou cafe ´ noir) jusqu'a ` deux heures avant une chirurgie non urgente. Les patients pe ´diatriques devraient e ´galement e ˆtre encourage ´s a ` boire des liquides clairs, tels que de ´finis, jusqu'a ` une heure avant une chirurgie non urgente.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
recommandations peuvent e ˆ tre modifie ´es a ` la discre ´tion du me ´decin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lorsqu'elle est indique ´e, la pre ´me ´dication devrait e ˆ tre ordonne ´e par l'anesthe ´siologiste. Les ordonnances doivent spe ´cifier la dose, le moment et la voie d'administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un antagoniste des re ´cepteurs H2 (par voie orale ou intraveineuse) est recommande ´ pour toutes les femmes devant subir un accouchement par ce ´sarienne.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trente (30) mL de citrate de sodium (0,3 molaire) sont recommande ´s avant un accouchement par ce ´sarienne urgent si l'on planifie une anesthe ´sie ge ´ne ´rale.

La proce ´dure anesthe ´sique pre ´vue a e ´te ´ explique ´e au patient, y compris les risques reconnus et les techniques alternatives, et on a documente ´ cette explication;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une e ´ valuation adapte ´e de l'e ´tat du patient a e ´ te ´ re ´ alise ´e;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tout le mate ´riel qu'on pre ´voit ne ´cessaire est accessible et en bon e ´tat de fonctionnement, y compris le mate ´riel ne ´cessaire au maintien de la tempe ´rature centrale (tempe ´rature centrale du patient 36-37 /C176 C);

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On a acce `s a ` une source de re ´serve d'oxyge `ne sous pression;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tous les me ´dicaments et agents qu'on pre ´voit ne ´cessaires sont correctement identifie ´s -les e ´ tiquettes de me ´dicament appose ´es par l'usager doivent e ˆtre conformes a ` la norme de la CSA CAN/ CSA - Z264.3-98 (R2005) (Annexe 1);

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Si des connecteurs Luer neuraxiaux sont utilise ´s, les deux co ˆte ´s des raccords Luer doivent e ˆtre e ´tiquete ´s. Il faut envisager l'utilisation de connecteurs neuraxiaux conformes a ` la norme ISO 80369-6:2016 -connecteurs de petit diame `tre interne pour application neuraxiale (raccords NRFit /C210 ) en fonction des disponibilite ´s des fournisseurs de mate ´riel; et

On a tenu compte des indications du fabricant quant a ` l'utilisation, a ` la manipulation et a ` la disposition de l'e ´quipement et du mate ´riel d'anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.2 Prise en charge des voies ae ´riennes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La prise en charge des voies ae ´riennes, particulie `rement en cas de voies ae ´riennes difficiles, contribue significativement a ` la morbidite ´ et a ` la mortalite ´ lie ´es a ` l'anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une prise en charge adapte ´e des patients dont l'intubation est difficile, de manie `re pre ´vue ou impre ´vue, chez lesquels l'intubation a e ´choue ´, lorsqu'une ventilation au masque ou le positionnement d'un dispositif supraglottique pourrait e ˆ tre difficile, ou qui ne ´cessitent des voies ae ´riennes chirurgicales, est essentielle a ` la se ´ curite ´ des patients. Cette prise en charge comprend, sans ne ´cessairement s'y limiter, une e ´valuation adapte ´e des voies ae ´riennes, du mate ´riel (par ex. chariots pour les voies ae ´riennes difficiles, vide ´olaryngoscopes, bronchoscopes), une formation et des exercices de simulation approprie ´s, du personnel de soutien et le recours aux protocoles et listes de contro ˆle ade ´quats afin de prendre en charge au mieux des voies ae ´riennes difficiles. La SCA ne recommande pas un protocole, un algorithme ou une liste de contro ˆle en particulier pour la prise en charge des voies ae ´riennes difficiles ou lors d'un e ´ chec d'intubation, mais elle encourage fortement les lecteurs a ` se re ´ fe ´rer a ` l'Annexe 4 pour acce ´der aux publications les plus re ´ centes sur le sujet.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.3 De ´le ´gation des soins aux patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'anesthe ´siologiste est avant tout responsable du patient qu'il a sous ses soins. L'anesthe ´siologiste ou un assistant en anesthe ´sie supervise ´ par l'anesthe ´siologiste doit demeurer constamment aux co ˆte ´s du patient pour toute la dure ´e d'une anesthe ´sie ge ´ne ´rale, re ´ gionale majeure et intraveineuse monitore ´e, jusqu'a ` ce que le patient ait e ´ te ´ confie ´ aux soins du personnel de l'unite ´ de soins compe ´tente.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Si l'anesthe ´siologiste traitant quitte temporairement la salle d'ope ´ration, il doit confier les soins du patient a ` un autre anesthe ´siologiste, a ` un re ´sident en anesthe ´sie ou a ` un assistant en anesthe ´sie. Lorsque l'anesthe ´siologiste traitant de ´le `gue les soins a ` un re ´ sident en anesthe ´sie ou a ` un assistant en anesthe ´sie, il demeure responsable de la prise en charge anesthe ´sique du patient. Avant de de ´le ´guer les soins du patient a ` un assistant en anesthe ´sie, l'anesthe ´siologiste doit s'assurer que l'e ´tat du patient est stable et que l'assistant en anesthe ´sie est familier avec l'intervention chirurgicale ainsi qu'avec l'environnement

<!-- PAGE=? -->
et le mate ´riel de la salle d'ope ´ration. L'anesthe ´siologiste traitant doit demeurer imme ´diatement disponible lorsque les soins sont de ´le ´gue ´s a ` un assistant en anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un anesthe ´siologiste peut brie `vement confier les soins courants d'un patient dont l'e ´tat est stable a ` une personne compe ´tente qui n'est pas un assistant en anesthe ´sie qu'en cas de circonstances particulie `rement exceptionnelles, pour se porter par exemple au secours d'un autre patient dont la vie est en danger. L'unique responsabilite ´ de cette personne devrait e ˆ tre de surveiller le patient en l'absence de l'anesthe ´siologiste et de tenir l'anesthe ´siologiste informe ´ jusqu'a ` son retour. Dans de telles circonstances, l'anesthe ´siologiste demeure responsable des soins prodigue ´s au patient et se doit de tenir l'e ´quipe de la salle d'ope ´ration au courant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le transfert perope ´ratoire des soins entre deux anesthe ´siologistes doit e ˆtre note ´ au dossier d'anesthe ´sie et se conformer a ` un protocole structure ´.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Il est inacceptable qu'un anesthe ´siologiste administre simultane ´ment une anesthe ´sie ge ´ne ´rale, une anesthe ´sie re ´ gionale majeure (rachidienne, pe ´ridurale ou autre) ou une se ´ dation proce ´durale profonde (voir Annexe 6) 1 pour des interventions diagnostiques ou the ´rapeutiques concomitantes pratique ´es sur plus d'un patient a ` la fois. Toutefois, il peut e ˆ tre admis, dans des circonstances particulie `res, qu'un anesthe ´siologiste supervise plus d'un patient chez lequel une se ´ dation minime a ` mode ´re ´e est administre ´e, a ` condition qu'un individu ayant rec ¸u une formation ade ´quate, qualifie ´, accre ´dite ´ et approuve ´ par le service d'anesthe ´siologie et l'e ´tablissement de sante ´, soit constamment pre ´sent aupre `s de chaque patient recevant des soins. Il sera par contre admis, dans un service d'obste ´trique, de surveiller simultane ´ment plus d'une patiente a ` laquelle est administre ´e une analge ´sie re ´ gionale pour le travail. Chaque parturiente devra cependant e ˆtre surveille ´e ade ´quatement par une personne compe ´tente, suivant un protocole e ´ tabli. Lorsqu'un anesthe ´siologiste dispense des soins anesthe ´siques en vue d'un accouchement, une deuxie `me personne du ˆ ment forme ´e doit se tenir pre ˆte a ` intervenir pour pratiquer la re ´ animation ne ´onatale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Il est inacceptable qu'un seul me ´decin administre une anesthe ´sie y compris la se ´ dation proce ´durale profonde simultane ´ment a ` la re ´ alisation d'une proce ´dure diagnostique ou the ´rapeutique, exception faite des interventions re ´ alise ´es par seule infiltration d'anesthe ´siques locaux et/ou une se ´dation minimale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.4 Monitorage du patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le seul moniteur indispensable est la pre ´sence, a ` tous les instants, d'un me ´decin ou d'un assistant en anesthe ´sie place ´ sous la supervision imme ´diate d'un anesthe ´siologiste et

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
122

<!-- PAGE=? -->
G. Dobson et al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
de ´tenant la formation et l'expe ´rience approprie ´es. Les moniteurs me ´caniques et e ´lectroniques ne sont, au mieux, que des aides a ` la vigilance. Ces appareils aident l'anesthe ´siologiste a ` s'assurer de l'inte ´grite ´ des organes vitaux et, en particulier, de la perfusion et de l'oxyge ´nation satisfaisantes des tissus. Le mate ´riel de monitorage doit e ˆ tre utilise ´ comme pre ´vu par le fabricant et approuve ´ par Sante ´ Canada pour l'application spe ´cifique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Il incombe a ` l'e ´tablissement de soins de sante ´ de fournir et d'entretenir un e ´quipement de monitorage qui respecte les normes en vigueur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Il incombe au chef du de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie de conseiller l'e ´tablissement de soins de sante ´ au sujet de l'acquisition de l'e ´quipement de monitorage et d'e ´tablir les normes de monitorage qui aideront a ` assurer la se ´curite ´ du patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Il incombe a ` l'anesthe ´siologiste de monitorer le patient qui est sous ses soins et de s'assurer que l'e ´quipement de monitorage approprie ´ soit disponible et fonctionne correctement. Une feuille de ve ´rification pre ´anesthe ´sique (Annexe 3 ou e ´quivalent) doit e ˆtre remplie avant l'amorce de l'anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une posologie prudente, un monitorage vigilant et la neutralisation ade ´quate des bloqueurs neuromusculaires sont des e ´le ´ments essentiels a ` la se ´curite ´ des patients. Un monitorage neuromusculaire doit e ˆ tre utilise ´ lors de l'administration de bloqueurs neuromusculaires. Les directives de monitorage pour les soins standard aux patients s'appliquent a ` tous les patients recevant une anesthe ´sie ge ´ne ´rale, une anesthe ´sie re ´ gionale ou une se ´ dation intraveineuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.5 Mate ´riel de monitorage requis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le mate ´riel de monitorage est cate ´gorise ´ comme suit :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Requis : Ces moniteurs doivent e ˆ tre utilise ´s sans interruption pendant toute la dure ´e de l'administration de toute anesthe ´sie.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accessible en exclusivite ´ pour chaque patient : Ces moniteurs doivent e ˆ tre accessibles a ` chaque poste de travail d'anesthe ´sie, de sorte qu'ils puissent e ˆtre utilise ´s sans de ´lai.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ` porte ´e imme ´diate : Ces moniteurs doivent e ˆ tre accessibles afin de faciliter leur utilisation sans de ´lai indu.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le mate ´riel de monitorage suivant est requis :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un saturome `tre;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un appareil permettant de mesurer la tension arte ´rielle, directement ou sans effraction;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un e ´lectrocardiographe;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un moniteur de bloc neuromusculaire lors de l'utilisation de bloqueurs neuromusculaires;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un capnographe, pour l'anesthe ´sie ge ´ne ´rale et pour e ´ valuer le caracte `re ade ´quat de la ventilation pour une se ´dation mode ´re ´e ou une se ´ dation proce ´durale profonde; et

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un moniteur de gaz anesthe ´siques spe ´cifique a ` l'agent, lorsque des agents anesthe ´siques par inhalation sont utilise ´s.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le mate ´riel de monitorage suivant doit e ˆtre accessible en exclusivite ´ pour chaque patient :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un appareil pour mesurer la tempe ´rature;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un stimulateur des nerfs pe ´riphe ´riques, lors de l'utilisation de bloqueurs neuromusculaires;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un ste ´thoscope -pre ´cordial, œsophagien ou paratrache ´al; et

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un e ´ clairage suffisant pour visualiser une partie expose ´e du patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le mate ´riel de monitorage suivant sera a ` porte ´e imme ´diate :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un spirome `tre pour mesurer le volume respiratoire;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un manome `tre pour mesurer la pression du ballonnet du tube endotrache ´al.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le mate ´riel pour un monitorage he ´modynamique invasif si indique ´ (p. ex., ligne arte ´rielle, cathe ´ter veineux central).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'anesthe ´siologiste doit demeurer vigilant en tout temps, e ´ tant conscient que de bre `ves interruptions du monitorage continu peuvent e ˆtre ine ´vitables et que, dans certaines circonstances, un moniteur pourrait faire de ´faut. Les alarmes audibles et visuelles du saturome `tre et du capnographe ne devraient pas e ˆtre de ´sactive ´es inde ´finiment pendant le de ´roulement d'une anesthe ´sie, sauf en cas de circonstances inhabituelles. L'alarme a ` tonalite ´ variable, celle des pulsations cardiaques et l'alarme de seuil infe ´rieur du saturome `tre ainsi que l'alarme d'apne ´e du capnographe doivent e ´mettre un signal audible et visible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
5.6 Prise en charge pe ´riope ´ratoire de la tempe ´rature

Le monitorage de la tempe ´rature centrale du patient est fortement recommande ´ pendant les cas d'anesthe ´sie ge ´ne ´rale et d'anesthe ´sie re ´ gionale neuraxiale d'une dure ´e de 30 min ou plus. En l'absence d'indications chirurgicales ou lie ´es au patient concernant une hypothermie perope ´ratoire, des syste `mes de re ´chauffement du patient actifs, le contro ˆle de la tempe ´rature ambiante en salle d'ope ´ration et d'autres me ´thodes devraient e ˆ tre utilise ´s pour cibler une tempe ´rature centrale de 36-37 /C176 C.

5.7 Positionnement du patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le positionnement du patient pour les interventions ne ´cessitant une anesthe ´sie est une responsabilite ´ de l'ensemble de l'e ´quipe de la salle d'ope ´ration et requiert un niveau tre `s e ´ leve ´ d'attention afin d'e ´viter toute complication. Il est entendu, cependant, que les complications lie ´es au positionnement peuvent tout de me ˆme survenir malgre ´ l'application des meilleures pratiques et d'une haute vigilance. Les risques associe ´s au positionnement du patient varieront et de ´pendront du type et de la dure ´e de la chirurgie, de la position spe ´cifique utilise ´e, et de facteurs lie ´s au patient tels que l'IMC et d'autres comorbidite ´s. Par conse ´quent, les conside ´rations et la planification du positionnement selon les meilleures pratiques devraient faire l'objet de discussions au sein de l'e ´quipe chirurgicale. Dans l'ide ´al, ces discussions doivent avoir lieu avant l'induction de l'anesthe ´sie, par exemple au cours de la premie `re partie de la Liste de contro ˆle de la se ´curite ´ chirurgicale. Tous les membres de l'e ´quipe, y compris l'anesthe ´siologiste, devraient e ˆ tre encourage ´s a ` exprimer leurs pre ´occupations concernant tout aspect du positionnement quel qu'il soit (par ex., facteurs de risque spe ´cifiques et disponibilite ´, e ´ tat et choix adapte ´ des tables de SOP ou d'autre mate ´riel de positionnement), et des strate ´gies visant a ` mitiger ces risques devraient e ˆ tre mises en œuvre. Le positionnement du patient doit e ˆtre documente ´ et ve ´rifie ´ re ´gulie `rement par l'anesthe ´siologiste afin de s'assurer que les conditions du positionnement demeurent ide ´ales. Les patients devraient e ˆ tre informe ´s avant l'ope ´ration de tout risque spe ´cifique possiblement associe ´ au positionnement pre ´vu pour leur intervention.

5.8 Dossiers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Toutes les variables physiologiques monitore ´es doivent e ˆ tre enregistre ´es a ` intervalles re ´ guliers en fonction des circonstances cliniques. La fre ´quence cardiaque et la tension arte ´rielle doivent e ˆ tre enregistre ´es au minimum toutes les cinq minutes. La saturation en oxyge `ne doit e ˆtre monitore ´e en continu et devrait e ˆ tre enregistre ´e a ` intervalles fre ´quents, au minimum toutes les cinq minutes, chez tous les patients. La concentration en dioxyde de carbone (PCO2) te ´le ´-expiratoire doit e ˆ tre monitore ´e en continu et enregistre ´e a ` intervalles fre ´quents en cas d'intubation trache ´ale ou si un dispositif supraglottique est en place. On doit documenter au dossier anesthe ´sique toute raison pour laquelle on de ´roge a ` ces directives de tenue de dossier. Les types de moniteurs, le mate ´riel et les techniques, ainsi que l'heure, la posologie et la voie d'administration de tout me ´dicament et liquide devraient e ˆtre note ´s. Tous les autres soins et e ´ve ´nements anesthe ´siques perope ´ratoires pertinents, y compris les e ´ ve ´nements impre ´vus ou inde ´sirables, devraient e ´ galement e ˆtre enregistre ´s.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le dossier de sante ´ du patient doit inclure le niveau de conscience du patient, sa fre ´quence cardiaque, sa tension arte ´rielle, sa saturation en oxyge `ne et sa fre ´quence respiratoire tels que mesure ´s a ` l'arrive ´e en salle de re ´veil. Ces recommandations s'appliquent tant aux dossiers anesthe ´siques manuscrits qu'a ` ceux cre ´e ´s via des syste `mes e ´ lectroniques de gestion de l'information en anesthe ´sie (SGIA). A ` l'heure actuelle, il n'existe aucune norme de pratique indiquant quelles donne ´es supple ´mentaires (par ex. donne ´es d'analyse de gaz, de ventilation et respiratoires) potentiellement re ´colte ´es par un syste `me de dossier de SGIA devraient faire partie du dossier de sante ´ permanent d'un patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Il a e ´ te ´ de ´montre ´ que les SGIA pouvaient avoir des avantages potentiels par rapport aux dossiers re ´dige ´s a ` la main dans plusieurs domaines cle ´s, notamment en augmentant la lisibilite ´, la pre ´cision et la fiabilite ´ des dossiers anesthe ´siques, en cre ´ant des donne ´es interrogeables favorisant l'ame ´lioration de la qualite ´, la communication des re ´ sultats et de la performance, la recherche translationnelle, une meilleure innocuite ´ et un meilleur suivi des me ´dicaments, ainsi qu'un suivi et un soutien a ` la de ´cision clinique en temps re ´ el pour les utilisateurs. La litte ´rature sur la se ´ curite ´ des patients en anesthe ´sie appuie l'utilisation des SGIA. Il est important de mentionner que les SGIA permettent de cre ´er une base de donne ´es de patients longitudinale, de telle manie `re que les ante ´ce ´dents anesthe ´siques importants des patients soient facilement trouvables si l'on veut les passer en revue, ce qui devrait e ˆtre conside ´re ´ comme une proprie ´te ´ importante pour tout syste `me. La SCA ne promeut ni n'endosse un fournisseur ou un produit en particulier, mais elle reconna ˆ ı t les avantages potentiels d'un SGIA bien conc ¸u et mis en œuvre par rapport a ` des dossiers comple ´te ´s manuellement la ` ou' les ressources institutionnelles et du de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie permettent d'envisager l'implantation d'un SGIA. Dans l'ide ´al, ce syste `me devrait e ˆtre mis en œuvre et ge ´re ´ en coope ´ration avec le de ´partement des technologies de l'information de l'e ´tablissement, et devrait permettre la communication avec les autres bases de donne ´es e ´ lectroniques de patients de l'e ´tablissement dans la mesure du possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
6.1 La salle de re ´veil

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une salle de re ´ veil doit e ˆ tre disponible dans tout e ´ tablissement offrant des services anesthe ´siques. Des politiques administratives conformes aux re ` glements de l'e ´tablissement devront e ˆ tre applique ´es de fac ¸on a ` coordonner les responsabilite ´s des soins me ´dicaux et infirmiers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie devrait endosser l'ensemble de la responsabilite ´ administrative me ´dicale pour la salle de re ´veil. Il devrait exister un manuel des politiques de la salle de re ´veil approuve ´ par les autorite ´s me ´dicales, infirmie `res et administratives compe ´tentes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'anesthe ´siologiste devrait accompagner le patient en salle de re ´veil, transmettre les renseignements ne ´cessaires au personnel infirmier de la salle de re ´veil dans le cadre d'un transfert structure ´ du protocole de soins, et re ´diger les ordonnances ne ´cessaires. Le monitorage continu des patients est recommande ´ pendant la phase pe ´riope ´ratoire en fonction de la situation clinique. Si cliniquement indique ´, de l'oxyge `ne supple ´mentaire, une oxyme ´trie de pouls portable et d'autres dispositifs de monitorage adapte ´s doivent e ˆ tre utilise ´s pendant le transfert vers la salle de re ´ veil ou l'USI. Si de l'oxyge `ne supple ´mentaire est administre ´ a ` des patients intube ´s pendant le transport ou en salle de re ´veil, afin de minimiser tout risque de barotraumatisme, il est fortement recommande ´ de ne le fournir qu'avec des dispositifs approuve ´s pour cette application spe ´cifique. L'anesthe ´siologiste ne devrait de ´le ´guer les soins du patient a ` l'infirmier ou l'infirmie `re de la salle de re ´veil que lorsqu'il est assure ´ que le personnel infirmier pourra ade ´quatement observer et prendre soin du patient. L'anesthe ´siologiste ou un anesthe ´siologiste remplac ¸ant de ´signe ´ est responsable des soins postanesthe ´siques en salle de re ´veil. Le conge ´ de la salle de re ´veil est sous la responsabilite ´ de l'anesthe ´siologiste; cette responsabilite ´ peut e ˆtre de ´le ´gue ´e en accord avec les politiques de l'e ´tablissement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une source d'oxyge `ne d'appoint et une succion doivent e ˆ tre disponibles pour chaque patient en salle de re ´veil. Le mate ´riel d'urgence ne ´cessaire a ` la prise en charge des voies ae ´riennes, la re ´ animation et au support vital doit e ˆ tre disponible en salle de re ´veil. Le mate ´riel pour la prise en charge de voies ae ´ riennes difficiles doit e ˆ tre a ` porte ´e imme ´diate en salle de re ´veil. Le monitorage utilise ´ en salle de re ´veil doit e ˆtre adapte ´ a ` l'e ´tat du patient et un e ´ventail complet d'appareils de monitorage doit e ˆtre disponible. Les alarmes des moniteurs doivent e ˆtre en fonction, avec des parame `tres d'alarme adapte ´s a ` l'e ´tat et a ` l'a ˆge du patient. L'utilisation continue d'un saturome `tre est requise pendant la phase initiale de re ´cupe ´ration. Un capnographe est requis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pour les patients intube ´s ou sous se ´dation profonde et est recommande ´ pour les patients inconscients ayant des dispositifs supraglottiques in situ dans les voies ae ´riennes. Un moniteur d'apne ´e est recommande ´ chez les nourrissons pre ´mature ´s et ayant un a ˆ ge gestationnel de moins de 50 semaines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un dossier de ´taille ´ de la pe ´riode imme ´diate de re ´veil doit e ˆtre tenu. Celui-ci doit inclure un enregistrement des signes vitaux ainsi que des autres aspects du traitement et de l'observation. Cette feuille d'observation fait partie du dossier me ´dical permanent. Toute complication ayant un lien avec l'anesthe ´sie doit e ˆ tre note ´e sur la feuille de la salle de re ´veil ou dans les notes d'e ´volution du dossier du patient. Dans certaines situations, il peut e ˆtre acceptable de transfe ´rer un patient directement vers d'autres unite ´s de soins ou de passer outre la salle de re ´veil si un niveau de soins adapte ´ est disponible dans une autre unite ´ de l'e ´tablissement et s'il est note ´ au dossier anesthe ´sique que le patient est juge ´ apte a ` ce transfert.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
6.2 Conge ´ des patients apre `s chirurgie d'un jour

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leconge ´ des patients apre `s une chirurgie ambulatoire doit se faire en utilisant un plan formel de soins approuve ´ par l'institution et documente ´ dans les notes de soins prodigue ´s aux patients. Les patients doivent satisfaire les crite `res de conge ´ au domicile en utilisant un outil d'e ´valuation valide ´ (p. ex., le syste `me de cotation de conge ´ post-anesthe ´sie [PADSS]). La prise en charge de la douleur et des complications postope ´ratoires, ainsi que le suivi de routine et d'urgence, doivent tous faire l'objet d'instructions e ´crites spe ´cifiques. Le patient doit e ˆtre averti au sujet des synergies additives qu'il existe entre l'alcool et d'autres se ´datifs, du danger de conduire ou d'utiliser des machines dangereuses dans la pe ´riode postope ´ratoire (dans la plupart des cas durant les 24 heures suivant l'ope ´ration), et de la ne ´cessite ´ d'attention de la part d'un adulte compe ´tent dans la pe ´riode postope ´ratoire (dans la plupart des cas durant les 24 heures suivant l'ope ´ration).

7 Lignes directrices pour l'analge ´sie re ´gionale en obste ´trique

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les services d'anesthe ´sie destine ´s aux parturientes comprennent l'analge ´sie obste ´tricale pour le travail pour l'accouchement avec ou sans complication - ou pour les ce ´sariennes. Toutes les directives visant l'anesthe ´sie administre ´e pour toute autre intervention diagnostique ou the ´rapeutique s'appliquent e ´ galement a ` l'anesthe ´sie obste ´tricale. Les directives de la pre ´sente section portent sur l'analge ´sie pe ´ridurale et la rachianesthe ´sie pendant le travail. L'expression « analge ´sie re ´ gionale » de ´signe

<!-- PAGE=? -->
l'analge ´sie pe ´ridurale, la rachianesthe ´sie et la combinaison des deux.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ces directives sont passe ´es en revue chaque anne ´e par la Section d'anesthe ´sie obste ´tricale de la SCA et mises a ` jour au besoin. Chaque e ´tablissement peut de ´cider d'e ´laborer des directives ou politiques supple ´mentaires pour des situations spe ´cifiques dans lesquelles une analge ´sie re ´ gionale obste ´tricale est dispense ´e.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sous la direction d'un anesthe ´siologiste, certains aspects du monitorage et de la prise en charge de l'analge ´sie re ´ gionale obste ´tricale peuvent e ˆ tre de ´le ´gue ´s a ` d'autres membres du personnel de sante ´. Chaque e ´tablissement doit s'assurer que ces personnes rec ¸oivent les me ˆmes formation, certification, formation continue et recertification en analge ´sie re ´gionale en obste ´trique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.1 Amorce de l'analge ´sie re ´gionale en obste ´trique

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avant d'offrir une analge ´sie re ´gionale en obste ´trique, l'e ´tablissement doit disposer de protocoles de monitorage adapte ´s. Ces protocoles pre ´ciseront les types de monitorage requis et leur fre ´quence. En outre, ils pre ´ciseront clairement la manie `re de ge ´rer les proble `mes et urgences commune ´ment rencontre ´s et a ` qui faire appel en cas de besoin d'assistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seuls les me ´decins ayant la formation, les privile `ges hospitaliers et la certification ne ´cessaires a ` fournir ces services peuvent pratiquer l'analge ´sie re ´ gionale en obste ´trique. Il en va de me ˆme pour les stagiaires travaillant sous supervision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'analge ´sie re ´ gionale ne doit e ˆ tre amorce ´e et maintenue qu'aux endroits disposant du mate ´riel et des me ´dicaments de re ´ animation adapte ´s et imme ´diatement accessibles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le consentement e ´claire ´ doit e ˆ tre obtenu et note ´ au dossier me ´dical.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un acce `s intraveineux doit e ˆtre e ´tabli avant d'amorcer une analge ´sie re ´ gionale et maintenu tout au long de l'administration de l'analge ´sie re ´gionale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'anesthe ´siologiste doit e ˆ tre imme ´diatement disponible jusqu'a ` ce que l'analge ´sie soit e ´ tablie et que les signes vitaux de la patiente soient stables.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.2 Maintien de l'anesthe ´sie re ´gionale pendant le travail

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'analge ´sie pe ´ridurale par perfusion continue (APPC), l'administration programme ´e de bolus pe ´riduraux (PIEB) et l'analge ´sie pe ´ridurale contro ˆle ´e par la patiente (APCP) d'anesthe ´siques locaux pe ´riduraux dilue ´s a ` faible dose (par ex., bupivaca ¨ ı ne £ 0,125 % ou ropivaca ¨ ı ne £ 0,16 %) avec ou sans adjuvants (par ex., opio ¨ ı des) sont associe ´es a ` une tre `s faible incidence de complications majeures. Par conse ´quent, il n'est pas ne ´cessaire que l'anesthe ´siologiste reste pre ´sent ou soit imme ´diatement disponible pendant le maintien d'une APPC ou d'une PIEB, avec ou sans APCP, a ` condition :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
qu'il existe des protocoles adapte ´s pour la prise en charge des patientes recevant une APPC, une PIEB et une APCP; et

<!-- PAGE=? -->
que l'on puisse joindre l'anesthe ´siologiste pour obtenir conseils et instructions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lors de l'administration du bolus initial et de bolus pe ´riduraux supple ´mentaires d'anesthe ´sique local, l'anesthe ´siologiste doit e ˆ tre imme ´diatement disponible pour intervenir ade ´quatement, e ´ tant conscient que ces techniques peuvent provoquer des complications imme ´diates potentiellement fatales.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chaque de ´partement d'anesthe ´siologie devrait e ´ tablir ses propres politiques concernant la disponibilite ´ juge ´e adapte ´e d'un anesthe ´siologiste pour prendre en charge les complications potentielles lie ´es a ` l'analge ´sie re ´ gionale pour le travail obste ´trical et l'accouchement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Des syste `mes de se ´curite ´ doivent exister pour prote ´ger les me ´langes d'anesthe ´siques locaux pe ´riduraux contenant des substances contro ˆle ´es (par ex. des opio ¨ ı des) de fac ¸on a ` minimiser les risques de de ´tournement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7.3 Absorption orale pendant le travail

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La vidange gastrique des aliments solides est retarde ´e pendant le travail, et les analge ´siques opio ¨ ı des peuvent la retarder encore davantage. Par conse ´quent, on devrait ge ´ne ´ralement de ´courager les parturientes d'inge ´rer des aliments solides pendant le travail actif. Contrairement aux aliments solides, les liquides clairs sont e ´ limine ´s relativement rapidement de l'estomac pendant le travail. Ainsi, en re ` gle ge ´ne ´rale, on devrait permettre aux parturientes d'inge ´rer des liquides clairs comme elles le souhaitent pendant le travail actif. Chaque e ´tablissement devrait e ´ laborer des protocoles concernant l'absorption d'aliments solides et de liquides clairs par les femmes en travail actif.

8 Lignes directrices pour la prise en charge de la douleur aigue ¨ a ` l'aide de l'analge ´sie neuraxiale

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lorsque l'analge ´sie neuraxiale est prise en charge par des anesthe ´siologistes, l'incidence d'effets secondaires n'est pas plus e ´leve ´e que lorsque des techniques alternatives de prise en charge de la douleur sont utilise ´es. En conse ´quence, lorsque son utilisation est indique ´e, l'analge ´sie neuraxiale devrait e ˆtre prise en charge par les anesthe ´siologistes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aux fins de ce guide, l'analge ´sie neuraxiale se de ´finit comme l'administration intrathe ´cale ou pe ´ridurale d'opio ¨ ı des et/ou d'anesthe ´siques locaux en vue du traitement de la douleur postope ´ratoire ou d'autres proble `mes de douleur aigue ¨. Ce guide vise a ` fournir aux anesthe ´siologistes les principes de prise en charge afin que l'analge ´sie neuraxiale soit pratique ´e de manie `re a ` en maximiser les avantages et en minimiser les risques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.1 Politiques administratives et e ´ducatives

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le de ´partement d'anesthe ´sie devrait mettre sur pied un service de traitement de la douleur aigue ¨ responsable de

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'e ´laboration des politiques et proce ´dures en matie `re d'analge ´sie neuraxiale. La participation d'autres de ´partements (par ex., soins infirmiers, pharmacie, chirurgie et gestion de l'e ´quipement) doit e ˆ tre sollicite ´e au besoin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La liaison avec les de ´partements de chirurgie. Les chirurgiens doivent comprendre les crite `res de se ´ lection des patients, les effets de l'analge ´sie neuraxiale sur l'e ´volution postope ´ratoire normale et sur le mode de pre ´sentation des complications postope ´ratoires, ainsi que les implications d'autres traitements, tels que l'anticoagulation prophylactique, sur l'analge ´sie neuraxiale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'e ´ducation et la certification du personnel infirmier. Un programme de formation standardise ´ -comprenant la formation initiale, la certification et le maintien continu de la compe ´tence - devrait e ˆ tre e ´ tabli pour le personnel infirmier dispensant des soins aux patients recevant une analge ´sie neuraxiale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.2 Le personnel infirmier doit comprendre

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le risque de de ´pression respiratoire, y compris la de ´pression respiratoire tardive, lors de l'administration d'opio ¨ ı des hydrophiles;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'e ´valuation et la prise en charge de la de ´pression respiratoire;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'e ´valuation d'un bloc moteur et sensoriel;

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'e ´valuation et la prise en charge de l'hypotension chez les patients recevant une analge ´sie neuraxiale; et

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les signes et sympto ˆmes des complications rares mais catastrophiques que sont l'he ´matome ou l'abce `s pe ´ridural.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.3 Politiques en matie `re d'administration de me ´dicaments

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chaque e ´tablissement devrait employer un nombre limite ´ de solutions standard. Une fiche d'ordonnance

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pre ´imprime ´e e ´ nume ´rant les solutions standard pour l'e ´tablissement est fortement recommande ´e. Avant d'administrer toute solution non standard dans l'e ´tablissement, l'anesthe ´siologiste devrait ve ´rifier l'ordonnance avec le personnel infirmier et la pharmacie et en discuter les indications et toutes les pre ´cautions relatives a ` son emploi avec les infirmiers et infirmie `res responsables de l'administration du me ´dicament et du monitorage du patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le risque d'erreurs attribuables a ` une voie impropre d'injection du me ´dicament doit e ˆ tre minimise ´. Pour des perfusions continues ou une APCP, l'emploi de pompes inviolables distinctes de celles utilise ´es pour l'administration de solute ´s ou de me ´dicaments est vivement recommande ´. La tubulure entre les pompes de perfusion de l'analge ´sie neuraxiale et les cathe ´ters ne devrait comporter aucun orifice susceptible de permettre une injection non intentionnelle de me ´dicaments intraveineux.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
La pre ´paration des solutions devrait suivre une proce ´dure standardise ´e. Toutes les solutions analge ´siques devraient porter une e ´tiquette indiquant la composition de la solution (opio ¨ ı de, anesthe ´sique local, ou les deux) ainsi que la voie d'administration approprie ´e. Dans le cas d'une administration pe ´ridurale, cela doit inclure la date et l'heure de la pre ´paration ainsi que le nom de la personne l'ayant pre ´pare ´e.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.4 Monitorage des patients et prise en charge des e ´ ve `nements inde ´sirables

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les patients auxquels est administre ´e une analge ´sie neuraxiale devraient e ˆ tre place ´s dans une chambre e ´ quipe ´e d'oxyge `ne et de succion. Des me ´dicaments et du mate ´riel de re ´animation doivent e ˆtre a ` porte ´e imme ´diate. L'acce `s intraveineux doit e ˆtre e ´tabli avant d'amorcer l'analge ´sie neuraxiale et, apre `s cessation de l'analge ´sie neuraxiale, maintenu pendant toute la dure ´e pre ´vue des effets me ´dicamenteux.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le pansement qui maintient en place le cathe ´ter pe ´ridural doit permettre l'examen du cathe ´ter pour de ´tecter tout mouvement et permettre l'inspection quotidienne du point d'entre ´e afin de de ´celer tout signe d'infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'adoption de politiques standardise ´es au chapitre de la prise en charge des patients est pre ´conise ´e. Les parame `tres qu'il convient d'e ´valuer, la fre ´quence des e ´valuations, la documentation et les proce ´dures de prise en charge des complications devraient e ˆ tre pre ´cise ´s. Un personnel de soins infirmiers en nombre suffisant doit e ˆtre pre ´sent pour e ´ valuer et prendre en charge les patients recevant une analge ´sie neuraxiale. Le monitorage devrait se poursuivre apre `s cessation de l'analge ´sie neuraxiale jusqu'a ` ce que ses effets se soient dissipe ´s.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
127

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Un anesthe ´siologiste doit e ˆ tre imme ´diatement disponible afin de conseiller le personnel infirmier sur des aspects tels que le titrage de la dose et la prise en charge des effets inde ´sirables. Chaque e ´tablissement dote ´ d'un service de traitement de la douleur aigue ¨ doit veiller a ` ce qu'un anesthe ´siologiste soit disponible pour s'occuper directement des patients recevant une analge ´sie neuraxiale dans un de ´lai approprie ´ en fonction de la situation clinique. Chaque e ´ tablissement devrait e ´ galement de ´terminer les proce ´dures en vue d'une prise en charge urgente de toute complication menac ¸ant le pronostic vital.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
D'autres me ´dicaments, notamment les benzodiaze ´pines ou les opio ¨ ı des parente ´raux, peuvent causer une de ´pression respiratoire majeure chez les patients recevant une analge ´sie neuraxiale. Pour cette raison, les autres me ´decins ne devraient pas prescrire de se ´datifs ou d'analge ´siques a ` tout patient recevant une analge ´sie neuraxiale. Le service de traitement de la douleur aigue ¨ devrait demeurer en charge de la the ´rapeutique analge ´sique et se ´dative jusqu'a ` dissipation des effets de l'analge ´sie neuraxiale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
8.5 Pe ´ridurales et anticoagulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les patients porteurs d'un cathe ´ter pe ´ridural peuvent recevoir un traitement prophylactique d'anticoagulants a ` faible dose, si les pre ´cautions approprie ´es sont prises :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Afin de minimiser le risque d'he ´matome pe ´ridural, l'installation et le retrait du cathe ´ter ainsi que l'horaire d'administration de l'anticoagulant doivent e ˆ tre coordonne ´s de telle sorte qu'aucun effet anticoagulant significatif d'un point de vue clinique ne soit pre ´sent a ` ces moments.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
L'emploi d'agents anti-inflammatoires non ste ´ro ¨ ı diens chez des patients recevant une analge ´sie neuraxiale est approprie ´, mais l'administration concomitante de ces me ´dicaments ou d'autres antiagre ´gants plaquettaires et d'un anticoagulant peut augmenter le risque d'un he ´matome pe ´ridural.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lorsque l'analge ´sie neuraxiale est utilise ´e pour une prise en charge prolonge ´e de la douleur postope ´ratoire, il convient de de ´ployer tous les efforts ne ´cessaires afin d'e ´viter un bloc moteur des membres infe ´rieurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le personnel infirmier doit conna ˆ ı tre les signes et sympto ˆmes de l'he ´matome pe ´ridural. Toute alte ´ration de l'e ´tat neurologique ou toute apparition soudaine d'une douleur dorsale doit e ˆtre imme ´diatement examine ´e.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Si une anticoagulothe ´rapie comple `te est indique ´e chez un patient porteur d'un cathe ´ter pe ´ridural, l'anesthe ´siologiste devrait e ˆtre consulte ´ afin que le retrait du cathe ´ter et l'amorce d'un traitement analge ´sique de substitution puissent e ˆ tre effectue ´s avant le de ´but de l'anticoagulothe ´rapie.

9 Lignes directrices pour l'exercice de l'anesthe ´sie dans les lieux isole ´s

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les principes fondamentaux, les exigences de formation, les techniques, le mate ´riel et les me ´dicaments utilise ´s pour la pratique de l'anesthe ´sie dans les lieux isole ´s ont e ´te ´ documente ´s dans d'autres sections de ce Guide . Ils s'appliquent e ´ galement aux soins anesthe ´siques, notamment a ` la se ´dation consciente (voir Annexe 6) dispense ´e par un anesthe ´siologiste dans toute salle d'ope ´ration ou emplacement hors de la salle d'ope ´ration, tant a ` l'inte ´rieur d'un e ´ tablissement hospitalier qu'a ` l'exte ´rieur (par ex. bureaux, cliniques).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.1 Soins anesthe ´siques dispense ´s dans un e ´ tablissement me ´dical/chirurgical/dentaire non hospitalier

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.1.1 Se ´lection des patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le statut physique des patients devrait e ˆtre cate ´gorise ´ selon le score de l'American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). D'une manie `re ge ´ne ´rale, seuls les patients des classes ASA I et II devraient e ˆtre retenus pour subir une intervention. Les patients de statut ASA III pourraient e ˆ tre accepte ´s sous certaines conditions, mais seulement a ` la discre ´tion de l'anesthe ´siologiste en charge. Il faut faire preuve de prudence lors de la se ´lection de patients pre ´sentant des voies ae ´riennes difficiles connues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.1.2 Conside ´rations pre ´ope ´ratoires

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Une histoire de cas et un examen physique re ´cents, incluant un examen des voies ae ´riennes, devraient paraı ˆtre au dossier du patient, ainsi que les re ´sultats des examens de laboratoire approprie ´s. Ces examens peuvent e ˆtre exe ´cute ´s par un autre me ´decin (par ex. un 'proce ´duraliste', soit un me ´decin/chirurgien compe ´tent pour re ´aliser des interventions diagnostiques ou the ´rapeutiques), mais l'existence d'un processus de se ´lection mis au point et endosse ´ par les services anesthe ´siques est fortement recommande ´e. La dure ´e du jeu ˆne devrait e ˆtre conforme a ` la section 4 .2 Lignes directrices concernant le jeu ˆne .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.1.3 Conduite de l'anesthe ´sie

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Les installations des salles d'anesthe ´sie et de re ´veil doivent e ˆ tre conformes aux normes hospitalie `res e ´ tablies par la CSA (voir Annexe 1) et a ` toutes les lignes directrices de la SCA e ´tablies pour les soins aux patients. Le patient devrait recevoir son conge ´ de l'ho ˆ pital pour rentrer a ` la maison en utilisant un

9.2 Soins anesthe ´siques dispense ´s hors de la salle d'ope ´ration dans un ho ˆpital ou un e ´tablissement non hospitalier

<!-- PAGE=? -->
En raison des avance ´es technologiques et de la plus grande disponibilite ´ d'interventions moins invasives mais potentiellement douloureuses, la demande pour la fourniture de soins anesthe ´siques a ` l'exte ´rieur de la salle d'ope ´ration (par ex., endoscopie, radiologie interventionnelle, cathe ´te ´risation cardiaque) croı ˆt. La fourniture de soins anesthe ´siques dans ces unite ´s interventionnelles e ´ loigne ´es peut s'accompagner de de ´fis particuliers pour l'e ´quipe de soins anesthe ´siques (p. ex., les patients pourraient avoir un statut ASA IIIIV et d'importantes comorbidite ´s), et ces unite ´s pourraient se trouver a ` une certaine distance des salles d'ope ´ration et du personnel de soutien, voire a ` l'exte ´rieur d'un e ´ tablissement hospitalier. Les unite ´s d'intervention dans lesquelles les anesthe ´siologistes sont appele ´s a ` fournir des soins devraient se conformer, dans la mesure du possible, aux me ˆmes normes de la CSA (Annexe 1), lignes directrices concernant le mate ´riel d'anesthe ´sie (voir section 3.0), et lignes directrices ge ´ne ´rales de la SCA qu'une salle d'ope ´ration. Cela comprend, sans s'y limiter, la se ´lection et l'e ´valuation des patients, les examens pre ´-proce ´duraux, les lignes directrices concernant le jeu ˆne, le mate ´riel et les prises e ´ lectriques, l'oxyge `ne et la succion, la ventilation et l'e ´vacuation des agents volatils si utilise ´s, les me ´dicaments et le mate ´riel ne ´cessaires a ` la re ´animation, le monitorage du patient, les installations de re ´tablissement et le personnel de soutien en anesthe ´sie. Tout lieu ou ` des anesthe ´siologistes fournissent des soins en dehors d'une salle d'ope ´ration doit e ˆtre approuve ´ par la direction de l'anesthe ´sie dans l'e ´tablissement. Du personnel de soutien en anesthe ´sie ade ´quatement forme ´ et expe ´rimente ´, par exemple un assistant en anesthe ´sie (voir section 2.5) ou d'autres personnes ayant de l'expe ´rience dans le soutien en anesthe ´sie, devrait e ˆ tre pre ´sent ou imme ´diatement disponible pour assister l'anesthe ´siologiste dans les lieux isole ´s. Il ne convient pas de de ´pendre exclusivement du personnel de l'unite ´ chirurgicale pour soutenir l'anesthe ´sie, a ` moins que ce personnel ne soit forme ´ et ait de l'expe ´rience dans le soutien direct de la fourniture de soins anesthe ´siques et qu'il ait rec ¸u l'aval de la direction de l'anesthe ´sie. Une

| Electrolytes                                       | May be considered: • with known or compelling findings in favour of hypertension, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, complicated diabetes, liver disease, pituitary-adrenal disease, malnutrition • for patients taking diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and other therapy affecting electrolytes. |
| Creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) | May be considered: • as above for electrolytes, also with advanced age and for patients taking medications potentially affecting renal function • for patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants • as required for calculating perioperative risk indices                                                                                                      |
| Fasting glucose level                               | May be considered: • for diabetics, preoperatively on day of surgery to guide glycemic control • for patients on glucocorticoid therapy • as screening for body mass index [ 40 or a very high risk of diabetes based on signs and symptoms.                                                                                                                  |
| Hemoglobin A1c                                     | • May be considered for known diabetics as early as possible before surgery (ideally at time of surgical referral) if results would change management.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Pregnancy testing                                   | Based on specific institutional guidelines • Should be offered to women of childbearing age based on any reasonable likelihood of pregnancy, on the reliability of menstrual history, and if the results will cancel or change the procedure or the anesthetic management. • Point of care urine or blood testing capability is ideal and is therefore recommended. |
| Electrocardiography                                 | • May be considered for patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease, significant arrhythmia, peripheral vascular disease, or other significant structural heart disease. • May be considered in the absence of symptoms or known cardiovascular disease in patients having high-risk surgery in the presence of clinical risk factors (e.g., Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) or American College of Surgeons (ACS) Surgical Risk Calculator). |
| Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP or NT-pro BNP)     | May be considered if: • age ‡ 65 yr, • age 45-65 yr with significant cardiac disease, • Revised Cardiac Risk Index score ‡ 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Resting echocardiography   | • May be considered if clinical assessment suggests undiagnosed severe obstructive intra-cardiac abnormality, cardiomyopathy, or severe pulmonary hypertension.                                                                     |
| Chest radiograph           | • Not recommended for asymptomatic patients in routine preoperative assessment unless part of a surgical or oncological workup unrelated to perioperative risk assessment. • May be considered for patients with acute or chronic cardiopulmonary disease based on history and physical exam if it will change management. |

| Glycémie à jeun                              | Peut être envisagé : • Chez les diabétiques, en préopératoire, le jour de la chirurgie pour guider le contrôle glycémique. • Pour les patients recevant un traitement avec glucocorticoïdes. • À titre de dépistage chez les patients ayant un IMC [ 40 ou un risque très élevé de diabète en fonction de signes et symptômes. |
| Hémoglobine A1c                             | • Peut être envisagé chez les diabétiques connus, le plus tôt possible avant la chirurgie (de préférence, sitôt le patient adressé au chirurgien) si les résultats sont susceptibles de modifier la prise en charge du patient. |
| Formule sanguine complète                    | • Peut être envisagée en fonction du risque de perte sanguine importante, des âges extrêmes (c'est-à-dire < un an), d'une maladie hépatique ou hématologique, d'un antécédent d'anémie ou de cancer.                             |
| Test de grossesse                            | • Devrait être proposé aux femmes en âge de procréer en fonction de la probabilité raisonnable de grossesse, de la fiabilité de l'historique des menstruations et si le résultat est susceptible d'annuler ou modifier la prise en charge. |
| Dépistage d'hématies falciformes avec       | • Devrait être proposé aux patients présentant un risque élevé en raison de leur origine ethnique.                                                                                                                            |

| Électrocardiogramme                         | • La possibilité d'effectuer un test urinaire ou sanguin au point de service est l'idéal et donc recommandée. • Peut être envisagé chez les patients avec une coronaropathie, une arythmie significative, une maladie vasculaire périphérique ou toute autre cardiopathie importante connue ou soupçonnée. |
| Taux d'électrolytes                          | • Peut être envisagé : • Si connu pour ou avec des constatations connues ou convaincantes en faveur des pathologies suivantes : hypertension, insuffisance cardiaque congestive, insuffisance rénale chronique, diabète avec complications, maladie hépatique, trouble hypophysaire, atteinte de l'axe hypophyso-surrénalien, malnutrition. • chez des patients recevant des diurétiques, des inhibiteurs de l'enzyme de conversion de l'angiotensine, des bloqueurs du système rénine-angiotensine. |
| Le peptide cérébral natriurétique (BNP ou NT-pro BNP) | peut être envisagé si : • le patient est âgé ≥ 65 ans, avec des symptômes ou de maladie cardiovasculaire connue chez les patients devant subir une chirurgie à risque intermédiaire ou élevée en présence de facteurs de risque cliniques (par ex. Index de risque cardiaque révisé (RCRI), ou Calculateur de risque chirurgical de l'American College of Surgeons). |
