Abstract -This is the first scientific statement from the  American Heart  Association on maternal resuscitation. This document will provide readers with up-to-date and comprehensive information, guidelines, and recommendations for all aspects of maternal resuscitation. Maternal resuscitation is an acute event that involves many subspecialties and allied health providers; this document will be relevant to all healthcare providers who are involved in resuscitation and specifically maternal resuscitation. ( Circulation . 2015;132:1747-1773. DOI: 10.1161/CIR.0000000000000300.)

C ardiac arrest in pregnancy is one of the most challenging clinical scenarios. Although most features of resuscitating a pregnant woman are similar to standard adult resuscitation, several aspects and considerations are uniquely different. The most obvious difference is that there are 2 patients, the mother and the fetus. Caregivers must have a thorough understanding of maternal mortality to best prevent and treat cardiac arrest in  pregnancy.  Maternal  mortality  is  defined  as  the  death  of a woman during pregnancy and up to 42 days after delivery or termination of pregnancy, provided that the cause of death is  related  to  or  aggravated  by  the  pregnancy  or  its  management. Recent data from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample suggest  that  cardiac  arrest  occurs  in  1:12  000  admissions for  delivery. 1 Globally,  800  maternal  deaths  occur  daily. 2,3 Maternal mortality trends in the United States as reported by the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  from  1989 to 2009 have documented a steady increase from 7.2 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1987 to 17.8 deaths per 100 000 live births  in  2009. 4 However,  maternal  mortality  rates  are  just a  small  representation  of  maternal  critical  events;  maternal near-miss data should be considered. A maternal near miss is defined as 'a woman who nearly died but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy.' 5  Data from the Netherlands show an incidence of maternal near miss of 1:141 in delivery wards. 6   Among cases with severe maternal morbidity,  there was an overall case fatality rate of 1:53. 6 Knowledge deficits 7,8 and poor resuscitation skills 9 could be major contributors to poor outcomes once cardiac arrest has occurred. Despite these problems, recent data show that the rate of survival to hospital discharge after maternal cardiac arrest may be as high as 58.9%, 1 far  higher than most arrest populations, further justifying  appropriate  training  and  preparation  for  such  events despite their rarity.

Methods

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Authors  with  expertise  in  maternal  resuscitation  and  relevant areas of specialty were selected to contribute to this statement. Selection of the writing group was performed in accordance with the American Heart Association's  (AHA's)  conflict-of-interest management policy. Relevant literature considered for inclusion in this statement was identified through an up-to-date search strategy of the process used for the 2010 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations and the 2010 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation worksheets, PubMed, Embase, and an AHA master resuscitation reference library. The search also included a review of bibliographies and manual searches of key articles. Participants volunteered to write sections relevant to their expertise and experience. Drafts of each section were written and sent to the chair of the writing group for incorporation into a single document, which was then edited. The edited document was discussed during Webinars in which participants provided feedback to the primary author of each section and discussed the document as a group. On the basis of these discussions and consensus, the sections were then edited accordingly by the primary author, returned to the chair, and reincorporated into the single document. Further edits were performed by the chair, and a final version of the document was produced. The final document was circulated among all contributors, and consensus was achieved. Recommendations were generated from this process and then assigned a class of recommendation and level of evidence (Table 1). The final document was submitted for independent peer review and has been approved for publication  by  the AHA Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee and Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.

Important Physiological Changes in Pregnancy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal  development  and  maternal  maintenance  of  pregnancy require multiorgan physiological adaptations that are pertinent to the team responding to cardiopulmonary arrest during pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac output rises 30% to 50% as a result of increased stroke volume and, to a lesser extent, increased maternal heart rate  (15-20  bpm). 10,11 Systemic  vascular  resistance  decreases as  a  result  of  an  increase  in  several  endogenous  vasodilators, including progesterone, estrogen, and nitric oxide, leading to a decrease in mean arterial pressure, reaching a nadir in the second trimester. 12 The enlarging uterus can produce increased afterload through compression of the aorta and decreased cardiac return through compression of the inferior vena cava, starting at ≈ 12

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to 14 weeks of gestational age. 13 As a result, the supine position, which is most favorable for resuscitation, can lead to hypotension. 13,14 A  magnetic  resonance  imaging  study  comparing  the maternal hemodynamics in the left lateral position with those in the supine position was performed. 15 This study found that at 20 weeks of gestational age, there was a significant increase in ejection fraction of 8% and stroke volume of 27% in the left lateral position. At 32 weeks, there was a significant increase in ejection fraction of 11%, in end-diastolic volume of 21%, in stroke volume of 35%, and in cardiac output of 24% in the left lateral position. 15 Uteroplacental blood flow increases from 50 to close to 1000 mL/min during pregnancy, receiving up to a maximum of 20% of maternal cardiac output at term. 16  Expanded intravascular volume and a decrease in uterine vascular resistance facilitate sufficient uterine placental blood. Overall, uterine vascular reactivity is altered, characterized by reduced tone, enhanced vasodilation, and blunted vasoconstriction. Systemic hypotension can overwhelm  the  compensatory  mechanisms,  which  attempt  to maintain uterine blood flow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Functional  residual  capacity  decreases  by  10%  to  25% during pregnancy as the uterus enlarges and elevates the diaphragm. Increased ventilation (ie, an increase in tidal volume and minute ventilation) occurs, beginning in the first trimester, reaching a level 20% to 40% above baseline by term, mediated by the elevated serum progesterone levels. 17 This produces a mild respiratory alkalosis with compensatory renal excretion of bicarbonate, resulting in an arterial carbon dioxide pressure of ≈ 28 to 32 mm Hg (3.7-4.3 kPa) and a plasma bicarbonate level of 18 to 21 mEq/L. 18  Oxygen consumption increases because of the demands of the fetus and maternal metabolic processes, reaching a level 20% to 33% above baseline by the third trimester. 19 The  reduced  functional  residual  capacity  reservoir and increased consumption of oxygen are responsible for the rapid development of hypoxemia in response to hypoventilation  or  apnea  in  the  pregnant  woman. 20   The  oxyhemoglobin dissociation  curve  is  shifted  to  the  right  in  the  mother  during pregnancy (P 50 increases from 27 to 30 mm Hg). A higher partial pressure of oxygen is therefore required to achieve the same maternal oxygen saturation. The same curve is shifted to the left in the fetus (P 50 is 19 mm Hg), conferring relative resilience to hypoxic conditions. Upper airway edema and friability occur as a result of hormonal effects and may reduce visualization during laryngoscopy and increase the risk of bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnancy is characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration and increased renal blood flow by 40% to accommodate the maternal role of fetal detoxification of metabolic byproducts and maintenance of maternal osmoregulation in the face of increased  circulatory  intravascular  volume.  Altered  tubular function prevents wasting of glucose, amino acids, and proteins  required  by  both  maternal  and  fetal  metabolisms.  On balance, Starling forces favor a narrowing of the oncotic pressure-wedge  pressure  gradient,  increasing  the  tendency  for pulmonary edema to develop. 21

A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak. Many important clinical questions addressed in the guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials. Although randomized trials are unavailable, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective.

physiology,  gastrointestinal  absorption  and  gastrointestinal transit affect bioavailability. Protein binding changes also alter the free fraction of the drug available. Steroid-induced acceleration of the hepatic P450 metabolism and increased renal clearance will also lower circulating drug levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Estimating Gestational Age

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management decisions made during a maternal cardiac arrest may require estimation of gestational age. Symphysis fundal height is the measurement from the top of the maternal pubic bone to the top of the uterine fundus. In a singleton pregnancy, with the fetus in a longitudinal lie, this height in centimeters will approximately correspond to the gestational age in weeks when measured between 16 and 36 weeks of gestation. If a tape measure is not available, finger breadths are usually used as a surrogate for the centimeters. Classically accepted rule-of-thumb landmarks may also be used: Gestational age is 12 weeks if the uterus is palpable at above the pubic symphysis, 20 weeks if the uterus is palpable at the level of the umbilicus, 24 and 36 weeks if the uterus is palpable at the level of the xiphisternum. However, the fundus can be a poor predictor of gestational age and may reach the umbilicus between 15 and 19 weeks of gestation. 25 In the last month of pregnancy, after 36 weeks of gestation, there may be diminution of the fundal height from 36 down to ≈ 32 cm as the fetal head engages into the pelvis. Fundal height may also be skewed by other factors such as abdominal distention 24

and increased body mass index; therefore, fundal height may be a poor predictor of gestational age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Code  team  members  with  responsibility  for  pregnant women should be familiar with the physiological  changes  of  pregnancy  that  affect  resuscitation technique  and  potential  complications  ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

The Critically Ill Pregnant Patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pre-Event Planning

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The critically ill pregnant patient may be managed in units not accustomed to managing obstetric patients such as the intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit, or medical or surgical ward. Teams on these units need to prepare for unexpected emergencies in these patients 26 by  covering  the  following  4 important steps:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparation  for  cardiac  arrest:  Educate  staff  about  the management of cardiac arrest in pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparation for perimortem cesarean delivery (PMCD): Identify  contact  details  or  appropriate  code  calls  to mobilize  the  entire  maternal  cardiac  arrest  response team,  and  ensure  the  availability  of  equipment  for cesarean delivery and resuscitation of the neonate. In cultures that require consent for a PMCD, even in the event of a cardiac arrest, pre-event consent should be obtained.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparation  for  management  of  obstetric  complications: Stock drugs and equipment commonly available in obstetric units, including oxytocin and prostaglandin F 2 α . Pre-event planning for power of attorney related to healthcare  decisions  should  be  done  for  the  critically ill patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decisions involving the resuscitation status of the neonate: Decisions about fetal viability should be made in collaboration  with  the  obstetrician,  neonatologist,  and family. The decision depends on the gestational age and, to a significant degree, the neonatal facilities available. This information should be clearly documented.

Severity of Illness and Early Warning Scores

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The British Center for Maternal and Child Enquiries report of 2011 (2006-2008 triennium) has stated that timely recognition  of  pregnant  women  at  risk  of  potentially  life-threatening  conditions  plays  an  important  role  in  the  appropriate institution  of  treatment. 27 Brief  checklists  are  provided  for the  identification  of  a  number  of  conditions,  including  sepsis, respiratory distress, and neurological complications. The report also highlights the potential value of a modified early obstetric warning score. In a more recent publication, using a large British ICU data set, Carle et al 28  described the evaluation of several preexisting obstetric early warning scores and the development and validation of a new obstetric score and demonstrated excellent discrimination between survivors and nonsurvivors for this new score (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.995). These scores can be used to monitor patients by clinical use of an early warning score chart (Figure 1) and can accurately identify patients at high risk  of  mortality,  although  not  specifically  mortality  resulting from cardiac arrest. Therefore, they are of value in patient management and triage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnant  women  who  become  ill  should  be  risk stratified  by  the  use  of  a  validated  obstetric  early warning score ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hospital units with a pregnant woman in their care should  ensure  that  proper  pre-event  planning  has been instituted, including preparation for maternal cardiac  arrest  and  neonatal  resuscitation  ( Class  I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the Unstable Pregnant Patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rapid response to instability in the pregnant patient is essential  for  the  prevention  of  cardiac  arrest.  Maternal  hemodynamics must be optimized; hypoxemia must be treated; and intravenous access must be established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations 29

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  patient  should  be  placed  in  a  full  left  lateral decubitus position to relieve aortocaval compression ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration  of  100%  oxygen  by  face  mask  to treat or prevent hypoxemia is recommended ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous access should be established above the diaphragm to ensure that the intravenously administered  therapy  is  not  obstructed  by  the  gravid uterus ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Precipitating  factors  should  be  investigated  and treated ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac Arrest Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Basic Life Support

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  cardiac  arrest  in  pregnancy  in-hospital  BLS  algorithm should be used as a guide to management (Figure 2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
First Responders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nurses are often first responders in cardiopulmonary arrest; however, any hospital staff member may witness or discover a patient in arrest and should be able to begin basic emergency care. 30 Basic emergency care is crucial. Rapid mobilization of expert  resuscitation  teams  and  BLS  performed  competently until the arrival of these teams give the woman the best chance for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accomplishing a coordinated, well-executed first response is challenging in patient care areas in which cardiopulmonary arrest rarely occurs, including obstetric units. 30-41 The  unique  physiology  of  pregnancy  renders  the  patient vulnerable  to  hypoxemia  and  hemodynamic  disadvantage, given the rapid development of desaturation with apnea and the presence of aortocaval compression when the patient is unconscious  and  supine.  Therefore,  all  BLS  interventions are  essential  and  should  be  initiated  rapidly  and  simultaneously  once  the  rescuers  arrive.  First  responders  should

To accomplish all tasks effectively, a minimum of 4 BLS responders should be present.

Chest Compressions in Pregnancy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adult Chest Compression Science

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with all adult resuscitations, high-quality chest compressions  are  essential  to  maximize  the  patient's  chance  of  survival. For high-quality chest compressions, the patient must be supine on a hard surface, the rescuer's hands must be placed correctly, the correct rate and depth of compressions must be performed, and interruptions must be minimized. Because hospital beds are typically not firm and some of the force intended to compress the chest results in mattress displacement rather than chest compression, we have traditionally recommended the  use  of  a  backboard  despite  insufficient  evidence  for  or against the use of backboards during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 42-45 If a backboard is used, care should be taken to avoid delays in the initiation of CPR, to minimize interruptions in CPR, and to avoid line/tube displacement. 46 Air-filled mattresses  should  be  deflated  when  CPR  is  performed. 45-49 Chest compression physiology has been best studied only with the patient in the supine position and has never been studied in a patient placed in a tilt. 50  Chest compression recommendations for the pregnant patient are the same as the most current recommendations for adult resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Chest compressions should be performed at a rate of at least 100 per minute at a depth of at least 2 in (5 cm), allowing full recoil before the next compression,  with  minimal  interruptions,  and  at  a compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 51   ( Class  IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interruptions  should  be  minimized  and  limited  to 10 seconds except for specific interventions such as insertion of an advanced airway or use of a defibrillator 51 ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The patient should be placed supine for chest compressions ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is no literature examining the use of mechanical chest compressions in pregnancy, and this is not advised at this time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factors Affecting Chest Compressions in the Pregnant Patient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortocaval Compression. In the pregnant patient, supine positioning will result in aortocaval compression. Relief of aortocaval  compression  must  be  maintained  continuously  during resuscitative efforts and continued throughout postarrest care. Manual  LUD should  be  used  to  relieve  aortocaval  compression during resuscitation. Historically, tilt has been used as an option to relieve aortocaval compression during resuscitation. Rees and Willis 52 found that at >30° left lateral tilt, the manikin slid off the incline plane and that chest compression force was

It has also been found that at >30° lateral tilt, inferior vena cava compression can still occur. 53 In addition, the heart has been shown to shift laterally during tilt 54 compared with the supine position. Therefore, chest compressions performed with the patient in a tilt  could  be  significantly  less  effective  than  those  performed with the patient in the usual supine position, and this could have a major impact on the chance of successful resuscitation. 52,54 In the nonarrest population, manual LUD compared with 15° left lateral tilt has been shown to result in less hypotension and a significantly  lower  ephedrine  requirement  during  a  cesarean delivery. 55 Additional benefits of manual LUD over tilt include easier  access  for  both  airway  management  and  defibrillation. While manual LUD is performed, the patient can remain supine and receive usual resuscitative measures, including high-quality chest compressions without hindrance (Figure 3). Manual LUD can be performed from the left of the patient (Figure 4), where the uterus is cupped and lifted up and leftward off the maternal vessels, or from the right of the patient (Figure 3), where the uterus is pushed upward and leftward off the maternal vessels. The rescuer must be careful not to inadvertently push down, which would increase the amount of inferior vena cava compression and negatively affect maternal hemodynamics.

Recommendations 29

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Continuous manual LUD should be performed on all  pregnant  women  who  are  in  cardiac  arrest  in which the uterus is palpated at or above the umbilicus to relieve aortocaval compression during resuscitation ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the uterus is difficult to assess (eg, in the morbidly obese), attempts should be made to perform manual LUD if technically feasible ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Positioning of Hands During Chest Compressions. There is no scientific evidence to support changing the recommendation for hand placement for chest compressions in the pregnant patient compared with the nonpregnant patient. Previous guidelines recommended placing the hands slightly higher on the sternum in the pregnant patient, but there are no scientific data to support this recommendation.

Because an immediate cesarean delivery may be the best way to optimize the condition of the mother and fetus (see section on 'PMCD'), this operation should optimally occur at the site of the arrest. A pregnant patient  with  in-hospital  cardiac  arrest  should  not be transported for cesarean delivery. Management should occur at the site of the arrest ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ). Transport to a facility that can perform a cesarean delivery may be required when indicated (eg,  for  out-of-hospital  cardiac  arrest  or  cardiac

Defibrillation Issues During Pregnancy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prompt application of defibrillation in the setting of ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia is critical to maximize the likelihood of survival. This is no different in the pregnant patient. Transthoracic impedance remains unchanged during pregnancy compared with the nonpregnant state; therefore, the energy required for defibrillation during cardiac arrest in pregnancy would be the same as the most current recommendations for the nonpregnant patient. 57 Application of defibrillation and cardioversion shocks to the maternal chest would be expected to pass minimal energy to the fetus and is considered safe in all stages of pregnancy. 29 Defibrillation would be unlikely to cause electric arcing to fetal monitors, and the presence of fetal monitors should not deter providers from the use of rapid defibrillation when indicated. 29  When indicated, defibrillation should be performed in the pregnant patient without hesitation or delay. The risk to the mother in delaying appropriate defibrillation would outweigh any potential concern about defibrillation in the setting of fetal monitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  same  currently  recommended  defibrillation protocol should be used in the pregnant patient as in the nonpregnant patient. There is no modification of the recommended application of electric shock during pregnancy 29  ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  patient  should  be  defibrillated  with  biphasic  shock  energy of 120 to 200 J ( Class I; Level of Evidence  B )  with  subsequent  escalation  of  energy output  if  the  first  shock  is  not  effective  and  the device allows this option. 58

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Compressions  should  be  resumed  immediately delivery of the electric shock 58  ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  in-hospital  settings  where  staff  have  no  ECG rhythm recognition skills or where defibrillators are used infrequently such as in an obstetric unit, the use  of  an  automated  external  defibrillator  may  be considered 58  ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anterolateral defibrillator pad placement is recommended  as  a  reasonable  default  ( Class  IIa;  Level of  Evidence  C ).  The  lateral  pad/paddle  should  be placed under the breast tissue, an important consideration in the pregnant patient.

The  use  of  adhesive  shock  electrodes  is  recommended  to  allow  consistent  electrode  placement ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

Airway and Breathing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoxemia develops more rapidly in the pregnant patient compared with the nonpregnant patient; therefore, rapid, high-quality, and effective airway and breathing interventions are essential. As discussed above, a higher partial pressure of oxygen is required to achieve the same maternal oxygen saturation, thus highlighting the importance of ensuring maternal oxygenation and ventilation concurrent with effective chest compressions in the pregnant

patient. As a result, in the 2010 AHA guidelines for CPR and emergency  cardiovascular  care  (ECC),  the  recommendations for management of cardiac arrest in pregnancy note the importance of early bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen. 29 Airway management should always be considered more difficult in the pregnant  patient;  therefore,  appropriate  airway  algorithms  for pregnancy should be instituted. For first responders with minimal airway experience, bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen is the most rapid noninvasive strategy to initiate ventilation. 59  The standard initial compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 will minimize interruptions in chest compressions. Hyperventilation has been shown to decrease the likelihood of survival in nonpregnant  arrest  victims,  particularly  when  it  interrupts  chest  compressions. 60  Two-handed bag-mask ventilation is more effective than a single-handed technique 61 and should be used as soon as a second provider is available to compress the self-inflating bag. If attempts at mask ventilation do not produce visible chest rise or fog within the face mask, the rescuer should try to reopen the airway and improve the seal of the mask on the patient's face. An oral airway may help relieve airway obstruction in the hypopharynx. Ideally, airway patency should be maintained continuously to  optimize oxygen delivery. Obesity, sleep apnea, and airway edema all increase the difficulty of face mask ventilation. 62

         A  member  of  the  first  responder  team  should perform bag-mask ventilation with 100% oxygen flowing to the bag at a rate of at least 15 L/ min ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
         Two-handed bag-mask ventilation  is  preferred ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

Hospitals  need  to  establish  first-responder  roles that satisfy all of the requirements for BLS, including modifications recommended during pregnancy. A minimum of 4 staff members should respond for BLS resuscitation of the pregnant patient. All hospital staff should be able to fulfill first-responder roles ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  fast  and  well-coordinated  response  to  maternal  cardiac arrest  is  important,  and  the  cardiac  arrest  in  pregnancy in-hospital ACLS  algorithm  should  be  used  as  a  guide  to management (Figure 5). The ACLS maternal cardiac arrest team will continue BLS tasks and perform advanced airway management,  insert  an  intravenous  access  above  the  diaphragm,  and  administer  the  usual  ACLS  drugs  and  doses when indicated. With the arrival of the obstetric and neonatal teams,  preparation  for  PMCD  can  begin. The ACLS  algorithm includes PMCD as a treatment option for the mother who has not achieved ROSC by 4 minutes after the onset of cardiac arrest and in whom the uterus extends to or above the umbilicus. The cause of the arrest needs to be considered and addressed as necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Maternal Cardiac Arrest Team

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Activating and achieving prompt code team response is one of the most fundamental tasks to be completed during maternal cardiac arrest. 29  Each hospital must have a specific method to  activate  the  maternal  cardiac  arrest  team;  for  example, 'maternal code blue' or 'code blue maternal' could serve as a  universal  call  to  action.  Creating  1  'bundled'  emergency code call (eg, maternal code blue) to all necessary responders  simultaneously  may  save  time,  help  prevent  confusion, and reduce the risk of team members not being notified. The universal call to action should also prompt rescuers to bring the necessary specialized equipment (see section on 'Special Equipment Required for a Maternal Cardiac Arrest') to the scene of the arrest without delay. The composition of the code team must reflect the fact that 2 critically ill patients (mother and fetus) must be resuscitated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There should be 1 call to action that activates the maternal  cardiac  arrest  team,  notifies  all  members,  and  ensures  that  specialized  equipment  is brought to the scene without delay ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

general, there should be a team leader for adult resuscitation,  a  team  leader  for  obstetric  care, and  a  team  leader  for  neonatal/fetal  care.  One approach  to  deal  with  multiple  subspecialties  is for the usual cardiac arrest team leader to delegate leadership for obstetric care, fetal/neonatal care, and  airway/ventilatory  management.  All  team leaders must communicate effectively together to make decisions about code management ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

Management of Hypoxia

Current guidelines for the management of cardiac arrest in adults stress that oxygen delivery to vital organs is limited by blood flow during CPR and that chest compressions should not initially  be  interrupted  for  ventilation  or  airway  placement. The pregnant patient has a very limited oxygen reserve. Furthermore, it should be noted that cardiac arrest secondary to hypoxia (eg, severe pneumonia, aspiration, amniotic fluid embolism,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  narcotic therapy, high spinal block) requires early attention to airway and  ventilation.  Although  delayed  endotracheal  intubation combined with passive oxygen delivery and minimally interrupted chest compressions has been associated with a better

Hypoxemia should always be considered as a cause of  cardiac  arrest.  Oxygen  reserves  are  lower  and the metabolic demands are higher in the pregnant patient  compared  with  the  nonpregnant  patient; thus,  early  ventilatory  support  may  be  necessary ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

no disruption in chest compressions, any intubation attempts should  be  undertaken  by  an  experienced  laryngoscopist. Forceful laryngoscopy can lead to bleeding and airway edema that interferes with ventilation. 70 Therefore, regardless of provider experience with laryngoscopy, optimally no more than 2 attempts at either direct laryngoscopy or videolaryngoscopy should be made before insertion of a supraglottic airway. 71,72 The glottis in pregnancy is often smaller because of edema; therefore,  starting  with  a  smaller  endotracheal  tube  (ETT) may  increase  the  likelihood  of  successful  intubation.  Face mask  ventilation  between  laryngoscopic  attempts  may  preserve oxygenation; any difficulty in ventilation indicates the need to avoid further laryngoscopy and to select alternative methods of airway management. Supraglottic airway placement is the preferred rescue strategy to facilitate ventilation after failed intubation. 73   Supraglottic airway devices with an esophageal drain provide access to the stomach to relieve air and stomach contents and may reduce the risk of regurgitation  and  aspiration  pneumonitis.  Subsequent  exchange  with a definitive airway with fiberoptic guidance may be considered for women with ROSC. If oxygenation and ventilation are not successful with a supraglottic device or ETT and mask ventilation is impossible, a 'cannot intubate, cannot ventilate' situation  has  occurred.  Help  (in-house  general,  trauma,  or otolaryngology surgeons) must be called emergently, and the final pathway steps in the difficult airway algorithm must be followed for establishing  emergency invasive airway access (eg,  percutaneous  cricothyroidotomy).  Pregnant  women and those who are immediately postpartum are at increased risk of regurgitation and aspiration of stomach contents. Despite these concerns, chest compressions, oxygenation, and relief of aortocaval compression are a higher priority than techniques to  limit  the  risk  of  regurgitation  (eg,  cricoid  pressure,  rapid intubation) when caring for the obstetric victim of cardiopulmonary arrest. The 2010 AHA guidelines for CPR and ECC do not recommend the use of cricoid pressure during resuscitation of nonpregnant patients, 74 and there are no data to support  its  use  in  the  management  of  pregnant  patients  during cardiopulmonary arrest.  Cricoid  pressure  may  not  be  effective at preventing aspiration 75  and can impede ventilation and laryngoscopy. If cricoid pressure is used, it should be adjusted or released if ventilation is difficult or the laryngoscopic view is poor. In the event of regurgitation before intubation, suction may be used to remove gastric contents from the oropharynx during ongoing chest compressions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous  capnography  should  be  used  if  available  to assess correct placement of the ETT, the quality of chest compressions,  and  ROSC.  Confirmation  of  endotracheal  placement is complicated by the fact that end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P etco 2 ) may decrease to almost zero during cardiac arrest and increase only after the onset of effective CPR. The presence of a decreasing or flat capnographic tracing should prompt the physician leading the code to ensure vigorous chest compressions and LUD, to re-evaluate the location of the airway device, and to consider obstructive causes of cardiopulmonary arrest (ie, massive pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, or pneumothorax). ROSC is more likely when P etco 2 can be sustained >10 mm Hg; an abrupt increase in P etco 2 by ≈ 10 mm Hg is consistent with ROSC. Findings

Arrhythmia-Specific Therapy During Cardiac Arrest

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical  therapy  during  cardiac  arrest  is  no  different  in  the pregnant patient than in the nonpregnant patient. For patients with  refractory  (shock-resistant)  ventricular  fibrillation  and tachycardia, the drug of choice is amiodarone; in 2 separate randomized studies, amiodarone has been shown to improve survival to hospital admission compared with standard of care and lidocaine. 81,82  The US Food and Drug Administration categories of fetal risk of medications do not apply in the cardiac arrest  scenario  because  fetal  concerns  are  overshadowed  by the arrest outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  refractory  (shock-resistant)  ventricular  fibrillation  and  tachycardia,  amiodarone  300  mg  rapid infusion should be administered with 150-mg doses repeated as needed ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medication doses do not require alteration to accommodate  the  physiological  changes  of  pregnancy.  Although  there  are  changes  in  the  volume of distribution and clearance of medication during pregnancy, there are very few data to guide changes in  current  recommendations  ( Class  IIb;  Level  of Evidence C ).

In the setting of cardiac arrest, no medication should be withheld because of concerns about fetal teratogenicity 83 ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

Physiological changes in pregnancy may affect the pharmacology of medications, but there is no scientific  evidence  to  guide  a  change  in  current  recommendations. Therefore,  the  usual  drugs  and  doses are recommended during ACLS ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other Drugs Used During ACLS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Historically,  in  the  setting  of  cardiac  arrest,  vasopressors such  as  epinephrine  and  vasopressin  have  been  used  with the  goal  of  increasing  myocardial  and  cerebral  blood  flow and improving patient outcomes. However, as stated in the 2010 AHA guidelines for CPR and ECC, 74  these drugs have not been shown to improve neurologically intact long-term survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epinephrine,  an α -adrenergic  receptor  stimulant  that has been used for many years, has been shown to augment cerebral and myocardial perfusion during cardiac arrest in preclinical  studies. 84 However,  data  in  support  of  clinical efficacy in humans are scant. The first randomized trial evaluating this drug, involving 851 patients assigned to ACLS with  drug  versus  ACLS  with  no  drug,  demonstrated  an improvement in ROSC with epinephrine but no difference in survival to hospital discharge or long-term survival. 85  These results are consistent with prior observations, and thus, in view of the short-term benefit, the 2010 AHA guidelines for CPR and ECC state that it is reasonable to administer 1 mg IV/IO epinephrine every 3 to 5 minutes ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence A). 74

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasopressin is a nonadrenergic peripheral vasoconstrictor that  was  studied  as  an  alternative  to  epinephrine  in  view  of its powerful vasoconstrictive properties. However, in several randomized  trials,  vasopressin  did  not  prove  to  be  superior to epinephrine, either alone or in combination with epinephrine. 86,87 Because the clinical effect of vasopressin is regarded as equivalent to that of epinephrine, the 2010 AHA guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend 40 U IV/IO vasopressin as an alternative to the first  or  second  dose  of  epinephrine  ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence A ). 74

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A new concept under investigation is the use of a combination of drugs during vasopressor-requiring cardiac arrest. A randomized study of patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest demonstrated  that  the  combination  of  vasopressin-epinephrine  and  methylprednisolone  during  CPR  and  stress-dose hydrocortisone  in  postresuscitation  shock  led  to  improved survival  to  hospital  discharge  compared  with  epinephrine alone. 88 Despite the promising results, additional studies are needed before recommendations can be made about combined vasopressors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No data are available comparing the use of different vasopressors during arrest in pregnant patients, but because vasopressin  can  induce  uterine  contraction  and  both  agents  are considered equivalent in the nonpregnant patient, epinephrine is the preferred agent of the two. 89

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atropine  was  removed  from  the  2010  AHA  guidelines for  CPR  and  ECC  ACLS  cardiac  arrest  algorithm  in  view of  its  lack  of  efficacy,  and  it  is  indicated  only  for  cases  of bradycardia. 74

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administering 1 mg epinephrine IV/IO every 3 to 5  minutes  during  adult  cardiac  arrest  should  be considered. In view of the effects of vasopressin on the uterus and because both agents are considered equivalent,  epinephrine  should  be  the  preferred agent ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

It is recommended that current ACLS drugs at recommended  doses  be  used  without  modifications 29 ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

Fetal Assessment During Cardiac Arrest

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  active  CPR,  the  focus  should  remain  on  maternal resuscitation and restoration of maternal pulse and blood pressure with adequate oxygenation. During this time, evaluation of  the  fetal  heart  will  not  be  helpful  and  carries  the  risk  of inhibiting or delaying maternal resuscitation and monitoring. Should the mother achieve ROSC and her condition be stabilized, then fetal heart surveillance may be instituted when deemed appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal  assessment  should  not  be  performed  during resuscitation ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal  monitors  should  be  removed  or  detached  as soon as possible to facilitate PMCD without delay or hindrance ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Delivery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This  section  is  written  on  the  premise  that  the  patient's arrest occurred in an institution that has staff with the expertise to deliver a neonate. PMCD is defined as the birth of the fetus after maternal cardiac arrest, most commonly during resuscitation. Birth is almost always accomplished through cesarean delivery. A review of all published cases of PMCD up to 2010 showed that PMCD led to a clear maternal survival benefit in 19 of 60 cases (31.7%), and there were no cases in which PMCD may have been deleterious to maternal survival. 90

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There may be situations during advanced pregnancy in which noninvasive relief of inferior vena cava compression with manual LUD is not enough to provide a hemodynamic advantage to result in successful resuscitation. This is when PMCD needs to be considered  as  the  definitive  means  to achieve complete relief of inferior vena cava compression and as a treatment option during ACLS measures for maternal cardiac arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The purpose of timely perimortem delivery is 2-fold. The first is facilitation of resuscitation. If cardiac output has not yet been effectively established, relieving aortocaval compression by  emptying  the  uterus  significantly  improves  resuscitative efforts. Second, and of critical importance, early delivery of the baby, the second patient, is accomplished with a decreased risk of permanent neurological damage from anoxia. In situations  in  which  the  mother  is  nonresuscitatable  (eg,  severe trauma is present), timely delivery of the fetus is essential.

woman  whose  uterus  extends  to  or  above  the  umbilicus. 29 By the time the physician is ready to deliver the baby, standard ACLS should be underway, and immediately reversible causes of cardiac arrest should have been ruled out. When the gravid uterus is large enough to cause maternal hemodynamic changes as a result of aortocaval compression, PMCD should be considered regardless of fetal viability. 29

<!-- PAGE=? -->
What Defines a Gravid Uterus With the Potential to Cause Aortocaval Compression?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several factors determine the weight of the gravid uterus, and these  additive  factors  could  result  in  a  uterus  that  is  heavy enough  or  positioned  in  such  a  manner  to  cause  aortocaval compression. Determinants of uterine weight include weight of the fetus, the number of fetuses, and the weight of the fluid (ie, polyhydramnios). Other factors that may affect the degree of aortocaval compression include the size of the fetus, the relationship of the fetus to the woman's anatomy, and additional factors such as increased body mass index and morbid obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unfortunately,  published  evidence  does  not  adequately address each of these contingencies. However, some general principles can be used to guide recommendations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A study found that maternal aortocaval compression can occur for singleton pregnancies at > 20 weeks of gestational age. 14  One review of PMCD in maternal cardiac arrest before the third trimester concluded that if the fundus extends above the level of the umbilicus, aortocaval compression can occur, and  PMCD  should  be  performed  regardless  of  gestational age. 25 Two  cases  of  maternal  cardiac  arrest  in  early  pregnancy of 13 to 15 weeks were reported in which the mother was  resuscitated  without  PMCD  being  performed  and  the pregnancy continued to successful delivery of a live infant at term. 91,92  Not every pregnant woman in cardiac arrest is a candidate for PMCD; the decision depends on whether the gravid uterus is thought to interfere with maternal hemodynamics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Why Perform PMCD in Cardiac Arrest?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several case reports of PMCD during a maternal cardiac arrest resulted in ROSC or improvement in maternal hemodynamic status only after the uterus had been emptied. 93-103 In  a  case series of 38 PMCDs, 12 of 20 women for whom maternal outcome was recorded had ROSC immediately after delivery. 93 No cases of worsened maternal status after cesarean delivery were reported. 93 The  critical  point  to  remember  is  that  both mother and infant may die if the provider cannot restore blood flow to the mother's heart.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Importance of Timing With PMCD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  5-minute  window  that  providers  have  to  determine whether cardiac arrest can be reversed by BLS and ACLS was first described in 1986 and has been perpetuated in specialty guidelines. 93,103a  It was recommended that PMCD should begin at 4 minutes to effect delivery at 5 minutes after failed resuscitative efforts. This time interval was chosen to minimize the risks of neurological damage, which begins to develop after 4 to 6 minutes of anoxic cardiac arrest if there is no ROSC. 104 The rescue team was not required to wait 5 minutes before initiating  PMCD,  and  there  are  circumstances  that  support an  earlier  start. 24 For  instance,  in  an  obvious  nonsurvivable injury 30   in  which the maternal prognosis is grave and resuscitative efforts appear futile, moving straight to PMCD may be appropriate, especially if the fetus is viable. In the situation of an unwitnessed arrest in which a prolonged period of pulselessness is suspected, the priority of PMCD comes to the forefront.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many reports document long intervals between a decision for an urgent hysterotomy and actual delivery of the infant, far exceeding the obstetric guideline of 30 minutes for patients not in arrest. 105,106  Very few cases of PMCD fall within the previously recommended 5-minute period. 90,93,94  However, survival of the mother has been reported with PMCD performed up to 15 minutes after the onset of maternal cardiac arrest. 94,107-109 Therefore, if PMCD could not be performed by the 5-minute mark, it was still advisable to prepare to evacuate the uterus while the resuscitation continued. At > 24 to 25 weeks of gestation,  the  best  survival  rate  for  the  infant  occurs  when  the infant is delivered no more than 5 minutes after the mother's heart  stops  beating. 104,110-112 At  gestational  ages > 30  weeks, infant survival has been seen even when delivery occurred >5 minutes from the onset of maternal cardiac arrest. 93 In a recent retrospective cohort series, neonatal survival was documented even when delivery occurred up to 30 minutes after the onset of maternal cardiac arrest. 94  A systematic review of all published  maternal  cardiac  arrests  occurring  before  delivery after widespread adoption of resuscitation guidelines (19802010) demonstrated a good outcome in most cases; Cerebral Performance Category was assessed to have been 1 or 2 in 78.4% (40 of 51) of mothers and 52.3% (22 of 42) of neonates after the event. In cases undergoing PMCD, the average time elapsing from arrest to delivery was significantly different between surviving (27 of 57) and nonsurviving (30 of 57) mothers (10.0±7.2 minutes [median, 9 minutes; range, 1-37 minutes and 22.6±13.3 minutes [median, 20 minutes; range, 4-60 minutes], respectively; P <0.001; 95% confidence interval, 6.9-18.2). The area under the receiver-operating curve for the prediction of maternal death by the time that elapsed from arrest to delivery was 0.827. For neonates, the time elapsing from arrest to delivery was described in only 57 cases and was <4 minutes in only 4 cases. Mean times were 14±11 minutes (median, 10 minutes; range, 1-47 minutes) and 22±13 minutes (median, 20 minutes; range, 4-60 minutes) in surviving and  nonsurviving  neonates,  respectively  ( P =0.016),  and  the area under the receiver-operating curve for the prediction of neonatal death by the time that elapsed from arrest to delivery was only 0.729, reflecting the wide range of arrest-to-delivery survival times. 90

PMCD Technique

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The procedure should be performed at the site of the maternal resuscitation. Time should not be wasted moving the patient. Simulation with a manikin of maternal transport to the operating  room  during  cardiac  arrest  has  found  that  transport increases the time to PMCD. 113  Additionally, time should not be wasted waiting for surgical equipment or doing abdominal preparation. If desired, antiseptic solution may be poured on the maternal abdomen. The only equipment needed to start a PMCD is a scalpel.

Resuscitative  efforts  should  be  continued  during  cesarean delivery, including manual LUD. The position of the rescuer performing the manual LUD will need to accommodate the surgical field to allow access and to prevent injury to the rescuer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The technique used to perform the PMCD is at the discretion of the physician performing the procedure. Both the vertical  incision  and  the  Pfannenstiel  incision  are  acceptable.  The  vertical  incision  provides  better  visualization  of the abdomen and pelvis and may prove beneficial in treating the cause of the arrest. The vertical abdominal incision is also considered faster. However, the Pfannenstiel incision may  be  preferred  by  a  provider  who  is  more  comfortable with performing this technique. Because successful PMCD has also been described with the Pfannenstiel incision, it is a reasonable alternative.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During PMCD, the fetus is delivered and given to the neonatal resuscitation team. The placenta is delivered. The uterus should then be quickly wiped clean, and the uterine incision should be closed with a running locking stitch of absorbable suture. The abdomen is closed in the regular fashion. A Foley catheter should be placed at this time if not already present. After the procedure, if maternal resuscitation has been successful,  administration  of  antibiotics  and  oxytocin  may  be considered. However, oxytocin should be used with caution because it can precipitate rearrest (see the section on etiology in the online-only Appendix).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Teams  find  it  difficult  to  perform  PMCD  in  a  timely fashion. Therefore, emergency preparedness is important for maternal  cardiac  arrest.  Institutions  with  limited  resources or only 1 staff member available (who, for example, may be involved in an operation when the cardiac arrest is called) should have staff respond as quickly as possible. Response times  may  be  dictated  by  the  reality  of  staff  numbers  and availability. Given the rarity of maternal cardiac arrest, it is not reasonable to allocate 2 in-house obstetricians to be on call  24/7  solely  for  the  purpose  of  responding  to  a  maternal  cardiac  arrest  if  the  institution  otherwise  has  a  more restricted staffing protocol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During cardiac arrest, if the pregnant woman (with a fundus height at or above the umbilicus) has not achieved  ROSC  with  usual  resuscitation  measures with manual uterine displacement, it is advisable to prepare  to  evacuate  the  uterus  while  resuscitation continues ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decisions on the optimal timing of a PMCD for both the infant and mother are complex and require consideration of factors such as the cause of the arrest, maternal pathology and cardiac function, fetal gestational age, and resources (ie, may be delayed until qualified  staff  is  available  to  perform  this  procedure). Shorter arrest-to-delivery time is associated with better outcome ( Class I; Level of Evidence B ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PMCD  should  be  strongly  considered  for  every mother in whom ROSC has not been achieved after ≈ 4 minutes of resuscitative efforts ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If maternal viability is not possible (through either fatal injury or prolonged pulselessness), the procedure should be started immediately; the team does not have to wait to begin the PMCD ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 When  PMCD  is  performed,  the following are recommended:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
         The  woman  should  not  be  transported  to  an operating room for PMCD during the management of an in-hospital maternal cardiac arrest ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence B ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
         The  team  should  not  wait  for  surgical  equipment to begin the procedure; only a scalpel is required ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
         The team should not spend time on lengthy antiseptic  procedures.  Either  a  very  abbreviated antiseptic pour should be performed, or the step should be eliminated entirely ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
         Continuous manual LUD should be performed throughout the PMCD until the fetus is delivered  ( Class  IIa;  Level  of  Evidence  C ).  Care should be taken to avoid injury to the rescuer performing the manual LUD during PMCD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the uterus is difficult to assess (eg, in the morbidly obese), then determining the size of the uterus may prove difficult.  In  this  situation,  PMCD  should  be considered  at  the  discretion  of  the  obstetrician  by using  his  or  her  best  assessment  of  the  uterus.  In these  patients,  bedside  ultrasound  may  help  guide decision making ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vaginal Delivery During Maternal Cardiac Arrest

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Few published cases describe vaginal delivery during a cardiac  arrest  in  pregnancy. 114 Obstetric  caregivers  involved  in an  intrapartum  cardiac  arrest  resuscitation  may  conduct  a vaginal examination, provided that CPR is being adequately performed by the medical team. If the cervix is found to be fully dilated and the fetal head is at an appropriately low station, immediate assisted vaginal delivery can be considered. This will allow resuscitation of the fetus and will facilitate the resuscitation of the mother because of the factors discussed above.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

Assisted  vaginal  delivery  should  be  considered when the cervix is dilated and the fetal head is at an appropriately low station ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

Neonatal Resuscitation Considerations Neonatal Resuscitation Team

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is expected that each maternity hospital will have a designated team for managing unexpected neonatal resuscitations. Because of the high likelihood of delivering a depressed neonate  after  maternal  arrest,  the  team  attending  delivery  must anticipate and be prepared for an advanced resuscitation. This includes designating a team leader, checking equipment, and

preassigning  specific  roles  to  team  members. Team  composition  optimally  should  include  a  neonatologist/pediatrician, neonatal  nurses,  and  respiratory  therapists  who  should  be familiar  with  the  local  neonatal  resuscitation  algorithms. 115 At least 1 member of the team must be skilled in emergency neonatal endotracheal intubation. In some settings, this may require accepting the urgent assistance of other subspecialty professionals, for example, an anesthesiologist, an otolaryngologist, or emergency physicians.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The neonatal resuscitation team should be notified of the impending delivery and its circumstances as early  as  feasible  to  allow  maximum  preparatory time ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  following  critical  information  should  be  provided  to  the  neonatal  resuscitation  team  leader: gestational  age,  number  of  fetuses,  and  mode  of delivery ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the event of multiple pregnancies, it is recommended that each fetus be resuscitated by a separate resuscitation team ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonatal Resuscitation Equipment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PMCD may be performed outside the maternity unit and will require the team to perform resuscitation in a relatively unfamiliar  environment  that  may  lack  optimal  equipment.  Each hospital must have prestocked neonatal crash carts available, the locations of which should be clearly marked and known to the neonatal resuscitation team. Alternatively, neonatal resuscitation  equipment  can  be  prestocked  in  easy-to-carry  bags that can be taken to the area of need by the resuscitation team on notification of impending delivery. Such carts/bags must be fully stocked, regularly checked, and accessible from all relevant clinical locations of the hospital. A comprehensive list of all equipment deemed necessary for neonatal resuscitation is presented in Table 4.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMS Considerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal  cardiac  arrest  that  occurs  out  of  hospital  will likely have worse outcomes than cardiac arrest that occurs in  hospital. 90   Therefore,  a  coordinated  EMS  response  to maternal cardiac arrest is of critical importance. If possible, additional prehospital providers should respond to the location of the maternal arrest to ensure that a sufficient number of providers is available to provide BLS (Figure 6) and ACLS care,  including  LUD.  Prehospital  providers  should not  be  expected  to  perform  a  PMCD;  however,  transporting the mother in cardiac arrest to a location where PMCD can be performed in a timely manner is essential. Fetal cardiac activity  may be slow but present after many minutes of  maternal  pulselessness. 116,117 As  a  result,  fetal  survival can occur in cases when maternal vital signs are lost before arrival in the emergency department and when CPR fails to restore maternal pulses. 118

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediate  transport  of  the  obviously  pregnant  patient, identified as the uterus extending to or above the umbilicus, should be initiated. This is justified because PMCD may be required to achieve ROSC by relieving aortocaval compression, decreased time to PMCD is associated with better fetal outcomes, 90  resources to perform PMCD are usually lacking in the field, 119 and multiple teams will be required to resuscitate the neonate and the mother after PMCD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMS  medical  directors  should  identify appropriate receiving hospitals for obviously pregnant patients according  to  the  resources  available  within  the  service  area. Choices should include whether a specialized obstetric center  or  a  center  with  a  neonatal  ICU  is  preferred  over  the closest destination. As a result of the geographical restrictions of rural systems, the closest appropriate receiving hospital might be used regardless of the availability of obstetric or neonatal services. For PMCD to be used as a lifesaving procedure, it is extremely time dependent; delays as short as 5 minutes affect fetal survivability. Therefore, transport should be directed toward a center that is prepared to perform PMCD rather than the closest facility, but optimally transport should not be prolonged by >10 minutes to reach a center with more capabilities (eg, neonatal ICU). Although it  is  possible  that  prehospital  transport  will  take  >5  minutes and the likelihood of PMCD success will therefore be lower, there is still less advantage to transporting a patient to a facility where PMCD cannot be offered. When trauma is the proximate cause of maternal cardiac arrest, resuscitation including PMCD can be performed at a trauma center with early activation of the hospital maternal cardiac arrest team. Bypassing the trauma bay or emergency department to arrive at the operating room is not advisable, given the evidence that CPR quality is impaired during transfer 56  and that  procedures  do  not  occur  faster  in  the  operating  room compared with other settings. 113

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMS providers in rural or other resource-limited settings may be faced with limited staff and equipment and extended transportation  distances  to  the  most  appropriate  receiving hospitals. EMS systems that provide care in the rural setting should consider these factors during planning and attempt to optimize care through coordinated education and training with first-responder organizations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMS responders should use the cardiac arrest in pregnancy  out-of-hospital  BLS  algorithm  for  healthcare  providers as the basis of care during a maternal cardiac arrest (Figure 6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If resources are available, EMS response to a maternal  cardiac  arrest  should  include  the  appropriate complement of staff to ensure that BLS and ACLS actions  can  be  performed,  including  chest  compressions, LUD, defibrillation when indicated, and management of the difficult airway ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  available,  transport  should  be  directed  toward a  center  that  is  prepared  to  perform  PMCD,  but transport should not be prolonged by >10 minutes to reach a center with more capabilities ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

Cause of the Cardiac Arrest

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Similar to the recommendations for adult (nonpregnant) ACLS, 74 an understanding of the importance of diagnosing and treating the underlying cause or aggravating factors of the cardiac arrest is fundamental to the management of cardiac arrest in pregnancy. It is important to consider the cause of the cardiac arrest early in the management algorithm. Specific therapy directed at the cause of the cardiac arrest can be lifesaving. It is important to understand the causes of maternal mortality to have an understanding of the unique pathogenic factors that may have precipitated the maternal cardiac arrest. The most common causes of maternal cardiac arrest and mortality are listed in Table 5. Caregivers not  routinely  involved  in  high-risk  pregnancy  may  not  have experience with the presentation or frequency in which specific diagnoses  can  result  in  maternal  mortality  and  cardiac  arrest. Therefore, the online-only Appendix includes a specific robust chapter that reviews the causes of maternal mortality and highlights important diagnostic and treatment considerations.

have  recommended  and  produced  obstetric  crisis-specific checklists. 26,103a,122 One  such  checklist  for  maternal  cardiac arrest is provided in Figure 7. These checklists may include, but are not limited to, contact numbers, critical service lines (eg, transfusion services, neonatal/pediatric teams), locations of necessary equipment (eg, scalpel location), and critical steps in care (eg, prepare to make the incision for delivery). The key factors  for  optimal  use  of  point-of-care  instruments  are  that teams should be familiar with the content and use of checklists in general and that the checklist should be written specifically for the institution with input from providers who would respond and be involved in rendering care at that institution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Institutions should create point-of-care checklists to help guide and support critical interventions during obstetric crises ( Class I; Level of Evidence B ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediate Postarrest Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  essential  that  a  multidisciplinary  team  continue  care in  the  postarrest  period.  As  with  all  postarrest  patients, the  pregnant  patient  who  is  successfully  resuscitated  will require thorough assessment, monitoring, and treatment as complications  arise.  For  example,  as  perfusion  improves, bleeding may become a serious issue. If the patient is not delivered,  aortocaval  compression  could  precipitate  hypotension and rearrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the patient is still pregnant, she should be placed in  the  full  left  lateral  decubitus  position,  provided that this does not interfere with additional management issues such as monitoring, airway control, and intravenous access. If the patient is not in full left lateral tilt, manual LUD should be maintained continuously ( Class I; Level of Evidence C) .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The patient should be transferred to the ICU unless an operation is required ( Class I; Level of Evidence C) .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimal  pre-event  planning  should  be  ensured  as discussed above ( Class I; Level of Evidence C) .

Multidisciplinary care must continue ( Class I; Level of Evidence C) .

Antiarrhythmic Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postarrest  therapy  for  recurrent  life-threatening  arrhythmias includes consideration of placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or medication therapy in the pregnant patient as in the nonpregnant patient 124 ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ). β -Blockers are often used as first-line therapy for a diversity of  arrhythmias;  they  are  generally  safe  in  pregnancy  (metoprolol is a preferred β -antagonist used in pregnancy) 125 ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ). For long-QT syndrome, β -blockers were found to be effective in reducing the incidence of adverse events  and  therefore  highly  recommended  during  pregnancy and the postpartum period 126,127 ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).  In  general,  for  recurrent  primary  ventricular  tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, amiodarone should be considered ( Class  IIb;  Level  of  Evidence  C ).  Evaluation  for  reversible causes of cardiac arrhythmias should be routine. Thyroid dysfunction, adverse drug effects, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac ischemia,  and  heart  failure  should  all  be  identified  and  corrected when possible ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

Targeted Temperature Management/Therapeutic Hypothermia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Even when resuscitative efforts are successful in restoring spontaneous circulation, postarrest brain injury often limits the positive outcome for cardiac arrest. 128  One apparent beneficial intervention has been mild postarrest-induced hypothermia,  which  is  based  on  scientific  plausibility  and  the positive results of 2 randomized, clinical trials published in 2002. 129,130  On the basis of these data, targeted temperature management  to  32°C  to  34°C  (89.6°F-93.2°F)  for  12  to 24 hours has been recommended for nonpregnant comatose adult  patients  with  ROSC  after  out-of-hospital  ventricular  fibrillation  cardiac  arrest  ( Class  I;  Level  of  Evidence B ).  There  are  2  case  reports  with  favorable  maternal  and fetal outcomes in which postarrest cooling was instituted in early pregnancy, the fetus was monitored, and emergency cesarean  delivery  was  not  necessary. 91,131 There  is  1  case report of fetal demise in the setting of targeted temperature management, but in this case, there was a period of unsuccessful  resuscitation  of  22  minutes  before  resuscitation by  EMS  was  started. 132 Therefore,  data  for  hypothermia in pregnancy are scant. Pregnancy is thus not an absolute contraindication to targeted temperature management. However, given the lack of data on the use of targeted temperature management after PMCD and the risk of impaired coagulation during the lowering of systemic temperatures, targeted temperature management may be considered on an individual basis after cardiac arrest in a comatose pregnant patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Targeted temperature management should be considered in pregnancy on an individual basis ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  used  in  pregnancy,  targeted  temperature  management should follow the same current protocol as for the nonpregnant patient ( Class IIb; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal  monitoring  should  be  performed  throughout targeted temperature management ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal Risk of Postresuscitation Intervention

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A large number of medications may be used after ROSC is  achieved.  Unlike  in  the  nonpregnant  state,  whether medications  may  adversely  affect  the  fetus  must  be  considered, in addition to the potential compromise caused by circulatory  failure,  lack  of  adequate  placental  perfusion, and  impaired  oxygen  and  nutrient  exchange  between  the mother and fetus.

Cardiac Arrest in Pregnancy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1765

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Three major principles guide the decisions made by clinicians at this stage:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal  well-being  is  the  overriding  priority  because maternal  demise  or  unfavorable  recovery  never  bodes well for the unborn baby.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Embryogenesis  is  mostly  complete  by  12  weeks  of gestation;  hence,  even  teratogenic  drugs  (eg,  warfarin, phenytoin, corticosteroids) are unlikely to cause malformations if the event occurs after the first trimester.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs  may  cause  fetal  toxicity  rather  than  teratogenicity  in  late  pregnancy  (eg,  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,  which  can  cause  fetal  renal  failure and oligohydramnios).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In general, most therapeutic drugs have a molecular weight of  <1000,  allowing  them  to  cross  the  human  placenta  from the maternal to the fetal circulation. The exceptions are large molecules such as heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, insulin, and other proteins. However, after 20 weeks of gestation, all biologics that are IgG can cross the placenta by using the Fc transporters. The fact that a drug crosses the placenta is, per se, not a reason for concern because the concentrations of most of these agents do not inflict fetal damage. The risks and benefits of medication use in the postarrest period should be considered on an individual basis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment of the Newborn

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The majority  of  neonates  delivered  by  PMCD  are  likely  to require active resuscitation 90 ; the severity of perinatal depression and the extent of resuscitation may vary. Management of the neonate after PMCD should follow the most current AHA guidelines. 115

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal Assessment (If Undelivered)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases when maternal cardiac arrest is treated without delivery of the fetus and the pregnancy is considered potentially viable (minimum, 23 weeks of gestation), continuous fetal heart rate monitoring  with  cardiotocography  should  be  started  as  soon as  feasible  after  maternal  ROSC  and  continued  until  clinical recovery of the mother. The goal for such monitoring is to assess for signs of nonreassuring fetal status (fetal tachycardia, bradycardia, loss of heart rate variability, variable or late decelerations) and to monitor for uterine activity. 29,133 Furthermore, because the fetus is considered to be more sensitive to changes in environment, nonreassuring fetal well-being could be the first sign of deterioration of the maternal clinical condition and may signify impending maternal decompensation. The presence of signs of nonreassuring fetal well-being on fetal heart rate monitoring  should  prompt an urgent obstetric and medical review because an emergency cesarean delivery may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postarrest  assessment  of  the  fetus  should  include continuous  fetal  heart  rate  monitoring  ( Class  I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs of nonreassuring fetal status should prompt a thorough maternal and fetal reassessment ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Delivery could be considered if signs of nonreassuring fetal status occur ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical-Legal Considerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal cardiac arrest and the death of the mother, the fetus, or both are traumatic and usually unexpected events. As highlighted throughout this scientific statement, efforts of all those involved in  the  care  of  pregnant  women  should  be  directed at  prevention,  identification  of  high-risk  patients,  and  referral  to  specialized  care  for  those  at  risk  for  adverse  events. However, not all events can be prevented, and if cardiac arrest does occur, EMS, institutions, and individual healthcare team members who would be involved in resuscitative efforts must be prepared. Patient safety is strengthened through this type of proactive approach to pregnancy care. One such example of a system-wide approach to pregnancy care has been shown to result in reduced claims. 134 Once a cardiac arrest has occurred during pregnancy, important steps should be taken to review the care received by the patient to improve systems of care going forward. Implementation of a quality incident notification system has shown that this type of program can help identify avoidable adverse outcomes and can be used to improve practices  of  care. 134,135,135a The  references  highlighted  above are useful tools for readers to review and potentially improve their own institutional practices.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All cases of cardiac arrest and maternal near miss should be reviewed by the maternal cardiac arrest committee for the hospital ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identified deficiencies should be corrected ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Knowledge Translation Strategy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Knowledge  translation,  also  referred  to  as  dissemination and  implementation,  has  been  defined  by  the  National Center for the Dissemination of Disability Research as 'the collaborative and systematic review, assessment, identification, aggregation, and practical application of high-quality research by key stakeholders (consumers, researchers, practitioners, policy makers) for the purpose of improving the  lives  of  individuals....' 136 This  statement  represents  an important step in the knowledge translation process: the collaborative  filtering  of  information  by  experts  so  that  only the  most  valid  and  useful  knowledge  is  left. 137 Clinicians are often faced with an unmanageable multitude of primary studies  or  information  of  variable  quality.  Comprehensive syntheses presented in statements such as this one provide a trustworthy and applicable aggregation and appraisal of the existing knowledge. This scientific statement is specifically designed to increase the likelihood of translation and uptake by using reviews of the evidence and providing direct practice recommendations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reading  this  statement  cannot  be  where  the  knowledge translation  process  ends.  An  active  knowledge  translation strategy, which includes multidisciplinary involvement (customized  information),  barrier assessment,  full leadership

commitment  and  support, 138 and  a  variety  of  ongoing  dissemination  approaches,  is  crucial  to  ensure  routine  use  of evidence-based practices.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is an entire body of literature on various approaches to  ensure  the  routine  use  of  knowledge,  all  with  variable success, depending on the context and intensity with which they are applied. Some approaches that may be specifically pertinent  in  the  case  of  maternal  cardiac  arrest  include  the following:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Instituting  standardized  order  sets,  a  prefilled  form  of evidence-based  orders  that  can  be  signed  by  the  lead physician so that there is no confusion as to what needs to be done and no time is lost starting from blank orders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Developing  a  program  of  mock  code  drills.  Lifelike maternal  cardiac  arrest  scenarios  are  simulated  for  all staff at regular intervals to make crisis situations feel more commonplace, to decrease fears and anxiety in the team, to  improve communication, and to increase familiarity with  resuscitation  guidelines.  This  has  been  shown  to directly improve resuscitation skills performance in both the adult 139 and pediatric settings. 140   Recommendations by the Confidential Enquiries Into Maternal and Child Health of the United Kingdom, The Joint Commission, and  others  emphasize  the  use  of  periodic  emergency drills that involve both the obstetric and neonatal teams as a way to practice critical communication skills and to identify occult errors in the system. 141-145

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Building in an audit and feedback mechanism to collect data during resuscitation situations and to provide constructive feedback to the team to identify key areas of success and areas for improvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Holding case debriefing sessions, which are similar to audit  and  feedback,  to  provide  an  opportunity  for  the team to talk about how the event went, what worked well and what did not work, and to offer a chance for others who may never have been part of a maternal resuscitation to learn from their colleagues' experience.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The key factor to successful knowledge translation is an active,  multifaceted  approach  that  attends  to  the  multidisciplinary  nature  of  health  care.  A  unique  consideration  for maternal cardiac arrest is the relatively low volume of events any  one  clinician  will  be  involved  in  treating;  this  can  be detrimental  to  the  impact  of  knowledge  translation  efforts. However, strategies such as case discussions and mock drills can be very effective in ensuring that the team is ready when a pregnant patient in cardiac arrest comes through the door.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  stakeholders/specialties  involved  in  maternal resuscitation  should  form  maternal  cardiac  arrest committees within each institution to ensure guideline  implementation,  training,  and  institution  of mock code drills ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal Resuscitation Training

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An analysis of simulated maternal cardiac arrests involving participants trained in ACLS suggests that performance during an actual event may be suboptimal. 31  AHA ACLS courses do  not  routinely  emphasize  obstetric-specific  interventions. In addition, CPR courses tend to stress knowledge and technical  skills  over  behavioral/communication  skill  sets. 146,147 The rarity of maternal cardiac arrest 9 implies that participants in  CPR  courses  could  benefit  from  a  review  of  obstetricspecific interventions. Although many obstetric providers are not trained in ACLS, knowledge decay and gaps in fund of information specific to the obstetric domain exist even among those who are. 7,8,148,149

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal cardiac arrest demands  a multidisciplinary response that requires unique coordination among teams. Such coordination is predicated on clear and succinct communication. 150  Data from The Joint Commission suggest that communication failures are the root cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in 70% of cases 142 that occur in the obstetric domain. In addition, in an analysis of preventable maternal mortalities, facility factors contributed significantly to the fatal outcome in 75% of cases. 142a This suggests that lack of institutional preparedness can decrease or even negate the ability of highly functioning  staff  to  render  optimal  care.  Moreover,  ACLS courses cannot hope to address the identification and correction of institutional system issues; this suggests that multidisciplinary maternal cardiac drills are important components of institutional preparedness. Maternally oriented CPR courses are  likely  more  relevant  to  the  learning  needs  and  goals  of obstetric staff; these courses have been developed by groups in the United Kingdom and the United States. 94,141,151

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Periodic multidisciplinary drills may help institutions  optimize  safety  systems  ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Specific courses on maternal resuscitation should be available to staff if not available outside local institutions ( Class IIa; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The future goal should be to have national and international programs in maternal resuscitation ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Future Considerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The questions remaining unanswered in relation to both treatment and outcomes (both maternal and neonatal) should prompt the establishment of a central registry of cases of maternal near miss  and  cardiac  arrest. 152 Maternal  cardiac  arrest  represents the  tip  of  the  iceberg  of  near-miss  maternal  complications. Understanding why in some cases the pregnant woman reached a state of arrest may require root-cause analysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multiple issues related to maternal resuscitation remain. Some could be addressed by simple analyses of database information, as mentioned above, for example, whether PMCD improves the rate of ROSC in accordance with the theory of aortocaval decompression, the optimal timing of cesarean delivery for both maternal and neonatal outcomes, and whether these outcomes are as good as those suggested in the most recent literature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current guidelines advocate placement of the woman in the full supine position with manual uterine displacement to alleviate  aortocaval  compression.  However,  there  are  sparse data on the impact of the anterior and left lateral displacement

of the heart during pregnancy on the probability of hand placement on the cardiac apex, and data on the effect of manual uterine displacement or pelvic wedging on the position of the heart and upper back are also scant. Finally, both maternal and neonatal long-term neurological status and functional status after resuscitation remain enigmas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A central registry of cases of maternal near miss and cardiac arrest with documentation of both process and outcome should be established ( Class I; Level of Evidence C ).*

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conclusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal cardiac arrest is a complex clinical scenario. Resuscitation of the pregnant woman involves multispecialties and complex care decisions. It is unlikely that prospective studies on maternal resuscitation will provide additional data in the future, despite the fact that clinical equipoise remains for most treatments  in  this  situation. Although  maternal  cardiac  arrest is  rare,  it  appears  to  be  increasing  in  frequency. The  number of high-risk women undergoing pregnancy is on the rise, as is the rate of severe complications related to pregnancy (including cardiac arrest). 153  The writing group acknowledges that scientific  evidence for management of cardiac arrest in pregnancy is lacking. 154,155  The majority of the writing group's recommendations are Level of Evidence C, which underscores the need for further research. This expert panel of authors has applied

<!-- PAGE=? -->
a multispecialty, expert approach to develop these recommendations through experience, previous publication of direct and indirect data, and expert opinion to reach consensus. The writing  group  recognizes  that  without  an  organized  approach  to maternal cardiac arrest, chaos will likely ensue. Therefore, the development and implementation of the recommendations contained in this document will be beneficial to maternal care. This scientific statement will help healthcare providers be prepared and provide the best possible care for a maternal cardiac arrest. The newly developed in-hospital and out-of-hospital BLS and ACLS  algorithms  should  be  the  backbone  of  the  response plan to a maternal cardiac arrest. Special attention should be paid to manual LUD, the difficult airway, and appropriate use of PMCD. Lifesaving interventions such as defibrillation and medications should not be withheld in the setting of pregnancy. The  healthcare  community  must  be  proactively  prepared  to respond to a maternal cardiac arrest. A maternal cardiac arrest committee must be formed at every institution, and emergency response plans specific to each institution must be developed and  implemented.  The  maternal  cardiac  arrest  committee would link adult resuscitation teams with obstetrics, neonatology, intensive care, anesthesia, the emergency department, and EMS and involve the allied healthcare teams, including nursing,  respiratory  therapy,  social  work,  and  clergy,  as  available and necessary to implement guidelines and recommendations. Training, mock code drills, and review of cases should become routine. This scientific statement has addressed all aspects of maternal resuscitation: prearrest care, BLS, ACLS, and postarrest  care.  In  addition,  the  online-only Appendix  has  a  robust chapter on the causes of maternal mortality and cardiac arrest in pregnancy with specific therapies to consider. The statement has also provided readers with resources, point-of-care instruments, and algorithms that will be useful to consider when developing institutional response plans.
