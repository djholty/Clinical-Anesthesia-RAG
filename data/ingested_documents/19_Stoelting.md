Normal glucose physiology is marked by a balance between glucose  utilization  and  endogenous  production  or  dietary delivery (Figure 19-1). Th e liver is the primary source of endogenous glucose production via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Following a meal, plasma glucose level increases, which

<!-- PAGE=? -->
stimulates  an  increase  in  plasma  insulin  secretion  that  promotes glucose utilization. Late in the postprandial period (2 to 4 hours a ft er eating) when glucose utilization exceeds glucose production, a transition from exogenous glucose delivery to endogenous production becomes necessary to maintain a normal plasma glucose level. Approximately 70% to 80% of glucose released by the liver is metabolized by insulin-insensitive tissues such as the brain, gastrointestinal tract, and red blood cells. During this time, diminished insulin secretion is fundamental to the maintenance of a normal plasma glucose concentration.  Hyperglycemia-producing  hormones  (glucagon, epinephrine, growth hormone, cortisol) comprise the glucose counterregulatory  system  and  support  glucose  production. Glucagon plays a primary role by stimulating glycogenolysis and  gluconeogenesis,  and  inhibiting  glycolysis.  Epinephrine predominates when glucagon secretion is de fi cient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes  mellitus  results  from  an  inadequate  supply  of insulin and/or an inadequate tissue response to insulin. Th is leads  to  increased  circulating  glucose  levels  with  eventual microvascular and macrovascular complications. Type 1a diabetes is caused by autoimmune destruction of beta cells within pancreatic  islets  resulting  in  complete  absence  or  minimal circulating levels of insulin. Type 1b diabetes is a rare disease of  absolute  insulin  de fi ciency that is not immune mediated. Type 2 diabetes also is not immune mediated and results from defects  in  insulin  receptors  and  postreceptor  intracellular signaling pathways.

TYPE 1 DIABETES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between 5% and 10% of all cases of diabetes are type 1. Th ere are 1.4 million individuals with type 1 diabetes in the United States and 10 to 20 million globally. Currently, the incidence is increasing by 3% to 5% per year. Th e disorder is usually diagnosed before the age of 40 and is one of the most common chronic childhood illnesses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type  1  diabetes  is  caused  by  a  T  cell-mediated  autoimmune  destruction  of  beta  cells  in  the  pancreas. Th e  exact cause  is  unknown,  although  environmental  triggers  such  as

FIGURE 19-1 The pancreatic islets act as glucose sensors to balance hepatic glucose release to insulin-insensitive tissues (brain) and insulin-sensitive tissues (fat, muscle). Insulin inhibits glucose release by the liver and stimulates glucose utilization by insulinsensitive tissues. With hyperglycemia, insulin secretion increases. With hypoglycemia, the reverse occurs.

viruses  (especially  enteroviruses),  dietary  proteins,  or  drugs or chemicals may initiate the autoimmune process in genetically susceptible hosts. A long preclinical period (9 to 13 years) characterized by production of antibodies to beta cell antigens with loss of beta cell function precedes the onset of clinical diabetes  in  the  majority  of  patients.  At  least  80%  to  90%  of beta cell function must be lost before hyperglycemia occurs. Th e autoimmune attack initially presents as islet in fl ammation (insulitis), with immune cells in fi ltrating the pancreatic islets. Circulating antibodies signify islet cell injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presentation  of  clinical  disease  is  o ft en sudden and severe secondary to loss of a critical mass of beta cells. Patients demonstrate hyperglycemia over several days to weeks associated  with  fatigue,  weight  loss,  polyuria,  polydipsia,  blurring of vision, and signs of intravascular volume depletion. Th e  diagnosis is based on the presence of a random blood glucose level of more than 200 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A 1c (Hb A1c) level of more than 7.0%. Th e presence of ketoacidosis  indicates  severe  insulin  de fi ciency  and  unrestrained lipolysis. Beta cell destruction is complete within 3 years of diagnosis in most children, with the process being slower in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TYPE 2 DIABETES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 2 diabetes is responsible for 90% of all cases of diabetes  mellitus in the world. In 2000, there were approximately 150 million individuals with type 2 diabetes globally, and the number is expected to double by 2025. Patients with type 2 diabetics are typically in the middle to older age group and are overweight, although there has been a signi fi cant increase in younger patients and even children with type 2 diabetes over the past decade. Type 2 diabetes continues to be underrecognized and underdiagnosed because of its subtle presentation. It is estimated that most individuals with type 2 diabetes had the disease for approximately 4 to 7 years before the disorder was diagnosed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by relative beta cell insuffi ciency and insulin resistance. In the initial stages of the disease, an insensitivity to insulin on the part of peripheral tissues leads to an increase in pancreatic insulin secretion to maintain normal plasma glucose levels. As the disease progresses and pancreatic  cell  function  decreases,  insulin  levels  are  unable to  compensate  and  hyperglycemia  occurs. Th ree  important defects  are  seen  in  type  2  diabetes:  (1)  an  increased  rate  of hepatic  glucose  release,  (2)  impaired  basal  and  stimulated insulin secretion, and (3) ine ffi cient use of glucose by peripheral tissues (i.e., insulin resistance) (Figure 19-2). Th e increase in hepatic glucose release is caused by the reduction of insulin's normal inhibitory e ff ects on the liver, as well as abnormalities in regulation of glucagon secretion. Although relative beta cell insu ffi ciency is signi fi cant, type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin  resistance  in  skeletal  muscle,  adipose  tissue,  and  the liver. Causes of insulin resistance include an abnormal insulin molecule; circulating insulin antagonists, including counterregulatory hormones, free fatty acids, antiinsulin and insulin receptor  antibodies,  and  cytokines;  and  target  tissue  defects at insulin receptors and/or postreceptor sites. It appears that insulin resistance is an inherited component of type 2 diabetes, with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle being acquired and contributing factors. Impaired glucose tolerance is associated with an increase in body weight, a decrease in insulin secretion, and a reduction in peripheral insulin action. Th e transition to clinical diabetes is characterized by these same factors plus an increase in hepatic glucose production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents appears related to obesity, since 85% of a ff ected children are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis. Obese patients exhibit a compensatory hyperinsulinemia to  maintain  normoglycemia. Th ese  increased  insulin  levels may desensitize target tissues, causing a reduced response to insulin. Th e  mechanisms  for  hyperinsulinemia  and  insulin resistance from weight gain remain elusive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic syndrome, or insulin-resistance syndrome, is a constellation  of  clinical  and  biochemical  characteristics  frequently seen in patients who have, or are at risk of developing, type 2 diabetes (Table 19-1). Th is syndrome combines insulin resistance  with  hypertension,  dyslipidemia,  a  procoagulant state, and obesity, and is associated with premature atherosclerosis  and  subsequent  cardiovascular  disease. Th is  syndrome a ff ects at least 25% of people in the United States.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e American Diabetes Association has established diagnostic  criteria  for  diabetes  mellitus  (Table  19-2).  Measurement of  fasting  plasma  glucose  level  is  the  recommended  screening test for diabetes mellitus. Th e upper limit for normal fasting glucose level is 100 mg/dL. Hyperglycemia not su ffi cient to  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  diabetes  is  classi fi ed  as either impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, depending on whether it is identi fi ed through measurement of fasting plasma glucose level or an oral glucose tolerance test.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any fasting glucose level between 101 and 125 mg/dL is categorized as impaired fasting glucose. Glucose levels, especially in type 2 diabetics, usually increase over years to decades, progressing from the normal range to the impaired glucose tolerance range and fi nally to clinical diabetes. Although rarely used in routine practice, the oral glucose tolerance test is recommended for diagnosis when glucose values are equivocal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Hb A1c test provides a valuable measure of long-term glycemic control. Hemoglobin is nonenzymatically glycosylated  by  glucose,  which  freely  crosses  red  blood  cell  membranes. Th e percentage of hemoglobin molecules participating in this reaction is proportional to the average plasma glucose concentration during the preceding 60 to 90 days. Th e normal range for Hb A 1c is 4% to 6%. Increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular disease begins when the Hb A 1c proportion is 6.5% or higher.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cornerstones of treatment for type 2 diabetes are dietary adjustments along with weight loss, exercise therapy, and oral antidiabetic drugs. Reduction of body weight through diet and exercise is the fi rst therapeutic measure to control type 2 diabetes. Th e decrease in adiposity improves hepatic and peripheral  tissue  insulin  sensitivity,  enhances  postreceptor insulin action, and may possibly increase insulin secretion. Nutritional guidelines of the American Diabetes Association emphasize maintenance of optimal plasma   glucose and lipid levels.

ORAL ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  four  major  classes  of  oral  antidiabetic  medications  are (1) the secretagogues (sulfonylureas, meglitinides), which increase  insulin  availability;  (2)  the  biguanides  (metformin), which suppress excessive hepatic glucose release; (3) the thiazolidinediones or glitazones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), which improve insulin sensitivity; and (4) the α -glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol), which delay gastrointestinal glucose absorption  (Figure  19-3). Th ese  agents  are  used  to  maintain  glucose control, which is de fi ned as a fasting glucose level of 90 to 130 mg/dL, peak postprandial glucose level of less than 180 mg/dL, and HbA1c level of less than 7% in the initial stages of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  sulfonylureas  are  usually  the  initial  pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Th ey act by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells; they can also enhance  insulin-stimulated  peripheral  tissue  utilization  of glucose. Th e second-generation agents (glyburide, glipizide, glimepiride) are more potent and have fewer side e ff ects than their predecessors. Unfortunately, because of the natural history of type 2 diabetes characterized by decreasing beta cell function, these drugs are not e ff ective inde fi nitely. Hypoglycemia is the most common side e ff ect. Whether or not harmful cardiac e ff ects from sulfonylureas have been demonstrated is  controversial.  Potassium  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP) channels in the myocardium mediate ischemic preconditioning,  which  appears  critical  for  myocardial  protection  and limitation  of  infarction  size.  Sulfonylureas  may  inhibit  this protective response and potentially delay contractile recovery, which results in larger myocardial infarction areas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  biguanides  decrease  hepatic  gluconeogenesis  and, to  a  lesser  degree,  enhance  utilization  of  glucose  by  skeletal muscle  and  adipose  tissue  by  increasing  glucose  transport across cell membranes. In addition to lowering glucose levels, they  decrease  plasma  levels  of  triglycerides  and  low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol  and  reduce  postprandial  hyperlipidemia and plasma-free fatty acids. Th e risk of hypoglycemia is less than that with the sulfonylureas. Lactic acidosis is a rare but serious side e ff ect of the biguanides; the risk is particularly high in patients with renal insu ffi ciency. It is much less common with metformin than with its predecessor phenformin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  thiazolidinediones  or  glitazones  are  insulin  sensitizers that decrease insulin resistance by binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptors  located  in  skeletal  muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. Th ese drugs in fl uence the expression of genes encoding proteins for glucose and lipid metabolism, endothelial function, and atherogenesis and, as a result, may in fl uence diabetic dyslipidemia in addition to hyperglycemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e α -glucosidase inhibitors inhibit α -glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of enterocytes in the proximal small intestine, which results in a delay in the intraluminal production and subsequent absorption of glucose. Th ey are administered before a main meal to ensure their presence at the site of action.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In most patients, therapy is initiated with a sulfonylurea or biguanide and titrated to achieve fasting and peak postprandial  glucose  levels  recommended by the American Diabetes Association  (Figure  19-4).  Combination  therapy  with  oral agents directed at more than one mechanism is o ft en e ff ective. If  combination oral therapy is unsuccessful, a bedtime dose of intermediate-acting insulin is added, since hepatic glucose overproduction  is  typically  highest  at  night.  If  oral  agents plus single-dose insulin therapy is ine ff ective, type 2 diabetic patients are switched to insulin therapy alone.

Tight control of type 2 diabetes provides signi fi cant bene fi ts in  preventing  and  slowing  the  progression  of  microvascular disease  and  possibly  macrovascular  disease.  Not  only  must hyperglycemia be treated but all abnormalities of insulin resistance (metabolic syndrome) must be managed, with the goals of therapy including an Hb A 1c level of less than 7%, a   low-density lipoprotein level of less than 100 mg/dL, a   high-density lipoprotein  level  of  more  than  40  mg/dL  in  men  and  more than  50 mg/dL  in  women,  a  triglycerides  level  of  less  than 200 mg/dL, and a blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg.

INSULIN

Insulin is necessary to manage all cases of type 1 diabetes and many cases of type 2 diabetes (Table 19-3). In the United States, 30%  of  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  are  treated  with  insulin.  Conventional  insulin  therapy  uses  twice-daily  injections. Intensive  insulin  therapy  requires  three  or  more  daily  injections or a continuous infusion (Figures 19-5 through 19-9).

Th e various forms of insulin include basal insulins, which are intermediate acting (NPH, Lente, lispro protamine, aspart protamine)  administered  twice  daily  or  long-acting  (Ultralente, glargine) administered once daily; and insulins that are short  acting (regular)  or rapid  acting (lispro,  aspart),  which provide glycemic control at mealtimes. Conventional insulin therapy  usually  requires  twice-daily  injections  of  combinations of intermediate-acting and short- or rapid-acting insulins. A typical total daily basal dose of insulin equals weight (in kilograms) × 0.3, with the hourly rate obtained by dividing by 24.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoglycemia is the most frequent and dangerous complication of insulin therapy. Th e hypoglycemic e ff ect can be exacerbated by simultaneous administration of alcohol, sulfonylureas, biguanides, thiazolidinediones, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and nonselective β -blockers. β -Blockers may exacerbate hypoglycemia by inhibiting lipolysis of adipose tissue, which serves as an alternate fuel when patients become hypoglycemic. Defective counterregulatory  responses  by  glucagon  and  epinephrine  to reduced plasma glucose levels contribute to this complication.

Symptoms  are  adrenergic  (sweating, tachycardia,  palpitations,  restlessness,  pallor)  and  neuroglycopenic  (fatigue,  confusion,  headache,  somnolence, convulsions, coma). Treatment includes the administration of sugar in the form of sugar cubes, glucose tablets, or soft drinks if the patient is conscious, and glucose 0.5 g/kg IV or  glucagon  0.5  to  1.0  mg  IV ,  IM,  or  SC  if  the  patient  is unconscious.

Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic  ketoacidosis  (DKA)  is  a  complication  of  decompensated diabetes mellitus. Th e signs and symptoms of DKA are  primarily  the  result  of  abnormalities  in  carbohydrate and  fat  metabolism.  Episodes  of  DKA  occur  more  commonly in patients with type 1 diabetes and are precipitated by   infection or acute illness. High glucose levels exceed the threshold for renal tubular absorption, which creates a signi fi cant osmotic diuresis with marked hypovolemia. A tight metabolic  coupling  between  hepatic  gluconeogenesis  and ketogenesis leads to an overproduction of ketoacids by the liver. DKA results in an excess of glucose counterregulatory hormones, with glucagon activating lipolysis and free fatty acids  providing  the  substrate  for  ketogenesis.  An  increase in  production  of  ketoacids  ( β -hydroxybutyrate,  acetoacetate,  acetone)  creates  an  anion  gap  metabolic  acidosis (Table 19-4).  Substantial  de fi cits  of  water,  potassium,  and phosphorus exist, although laboratory values of these electrolytes may be normal or increased. Hyponatremia results from  the  e ff ect  of  hyperglycemia  and  hyperosmolarity  on water distribution. Th e de fi cit of potassium is usually substantial (3 to 5 mEq/kg), and the de fi cit of phosphorus can lead to diaphragmatic and skeletal muscle dysfunction and impaired myocardial contractility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e treatment of DKA consists of administration of large amounts of normal saline and e ff ective doses of insulin, and electrolyte supplementation. An intravenous loading dose of 0.1 unit/kg of regular insulin plus a low-dose insulin infusion of 0.1 unit/kg/hr is initiated. Insulin administration must be continued  until  a  normal  acid-base  status  is  achieved. Th e insulin rate is reduced when hyperglycemia is controlled, the blood  pH  is  higher  than  7.3,  and  bicarbonate  level  is  more than 18 mEq/L. Potassium and phosphate are replaced with KCl and K2PO4. Magnesium is replaced as needed. Sodium

<!-- PAGE=? -->
bicarbonate is administered if the blood pH is less than 7.1. Th e infrequent but devastating development of cerebral edema can result from correction of hyperglycemia without simultaneous correction of serum sodium level. Th e overall mortality rate from DKA is 5% to 10%, but it is signi fi cantly higher in patients older than 65 years of age and in those who are comatose at presentation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HYPERGLYCEMIC HYPEROSMOLAR SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycemic  hyperosmolar  syndrome  is  characterized  by severe  hyperglycemia,  hyperosmolarity,  and  dehydration.  It usually occurs in patients with type 2 diabetes who are older than 60 years of age in the context of an acute illness. Th e syndrome evolves over days to weeks with a persistent glycosuric diuresis. When the glucose load exceeds the renal tubular maximum for glucose reabsorption, a massive solute diuresis occurs with total body water depletion. Th e patient experiences polyuria, polydipsia, hypovolemia, hypotension, tachycardia, and organ hypoperfusion. Hyperosmolarity (>340 mOsm/L) is  responsible for mental obtundation or coma (Table 19-5). Patients may have some degree of metabolic acidosis but do not  demonstrate  ketoacidosis.  Vascular  occlusions  secondary  to  lowfl ow  states  and  di ff use  intravascular  coagulation are important complications of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  includes  signi fi cant fl uid  resuscitation,  insulin  administration,  and  electrolyte  supplementation.  If  the plasma osmolarity is greater than 320 mOsm/L, large volumes of hypotonic saline (1000 to 1500 mL/hr) should be administered until the osmolarity is less than 320 mOsm/L, at which time large volumes of isotonic saline (1000 to 1500 mL/hr) can be given. Insulin therapy is initiated with an intravenous bolus of 15 units of regular insulin followed by a 0.1 unit/kg/hr infusion. Th e insulin infusion is decreased to 2 to 3 units/hr when the glucose level decreases to approximately 250 to 300 mg/dL. Electrolyte de fi cits are signi fi cant but usually less severe than in  DKA. Th e  mortality  rate  of  hyperglycemic  hyperosmolar syndrome is 10% to 15%.

MICROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Microvascular dysfunction is unique to diabetes and is characterized by nonocclusive, microcirculatory disease and impaired  autoregulation  of  blood fl ow  and  vascular  tone. Hyperglycemia  is  essential  for  the  development  of  these changes, and intensive glycemic control delays the onset and slows the progression of microvascular e ff ects.

Nephropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 30% to 40% of individuals with type 1 diabetes  and  5%  to  10%  of  those  with  type  2  diabetes  develop end-stage  renal  disease. Th e  kidneys  demonstrate  glomerulosclerosis  with  glomerular  basement  membrane  thickening, arteriosclerosis, and  tubulointerstitial disease. Th e clinical course is characterized by hypertension, albuminuria, peripheral edema, and a progressive decrease in glomerular fi ltration rate. When the glomerular fi ltration rate decreases to less than 15 to 20 mL/min, the ability of the kidneys to excrete potassium and acids is impaired and patients develop hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and microalbuminuria accelerate the decrease in  the  glomerular fi ltration  rate.  Treatment  of  hypertension can markedly slow the progression of renal dysfunction. ACE inhibitors are particularly bene fi cial in diabetic patients because they retard the progression of proteinuria and the decrease in glomerular fi ltration rate. If end-stage renal disease develops, there are four options: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, continuous  ambulatory  peritoneal  dialysis,  and  transplantation. Patients who receive a kidney transplant, especially if the organ is  from  a  living  human  HLA-identical  donor,  demonstrate  a longer  survival  than  those  who  undergo  dialysis.  Combined kidney-pancreas  transplantation  results  in  lower  mortality than dialysis or renal transplantation alone and may prevent recurrence of diabetic nephropathy in the transplanted kidney.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral Neuropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
More than 50% of patients who have had diabetes for longer  than  25  years  develop  a  peripheral  neuropathy.  A  distal symmetric di ff use sensorimotor polyneuropathy is the most common  form.  Sensory  de fi cits  usually  overshadow  motor abnormalities and appear in the toes or feet and progress proximally toward the chest in a "stocking and glove" distribution. Loss of large sensory and motor fi bers produces loss of light touch and proprioception as well as muscle weakness. Loss of small fi bers decreases the perception of pain and temperature and produces dysesthesia, paresthesia, and neuropathic pain. Foot ulcers develop from mechanical and traumatic injury as a result of loss of cutaneous sensitivity to pain and temperature and  impaired  perfusion.  Signi fi cant  morbidity  results  from recurrent infection, foot fractures (Charcot's joint), and subsequent amputations. Th e treatment of peripheral neuropathy includes optimal glucose control, as well as the use of nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants for pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic  retinopathy  results  from  a  variety  of  microvascular  changes,  including  blood  vessel  occlusion,  dilation, increased permeability, and microaneurysm formation resulting in hemorrhage, exudation, and growth of abnormal blood vessels and fi brous tissue. Visual impairment can range from minor changes in color vision to total blindness. Strict glycemic control and blood pressure control can reduce the risk of development and progression of retinopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autonomic Neuropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic autonomic neuropathy can a ff ect any part of the autonomic nervous system and is the result of damaged vasoconstrictor fi bers,  impaired  baroreceptor  function,  and  ineffective cardiovascular reactivity. Symptomatic autonomic neuropathy is rare and is present in fewer than 5% of diabetics. Th e  pathogenesis is not completely understood, but may involve  metabolic,  microvascular,  and/or  autonomic  abnormalities. Cardiovascular signs of autonomic neuropathy include abnormalities in heart rate control as well as central and peripheral vascular dynamics. Resting tachycardia and loss of heart rate variability during deep breathing are early signs. A heart rate that fails to respond to exercise is indicative of signi fi cant cardiac denervation and is likely to result in substantially  reduced exercise tolerance. Th e  heart may demonstrate systolic and diastolic dysfunction with a reduced ejection fraction.  Dysrhythmias may be responsible for sudden death. In advanced stages, severe orthostatic hypotension is present. Th e presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy can be demonstrated by measuring orthostatic changes in heart rate and blood pressure and the hemodynamic response to exercise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic  autonomic  neuropathy  may  also  impair  gastric secretion  and  gastric  motility,  eventually  causing  gastroparesis  diabeticorum  in  approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients. Although it is o ft en clinically silent, symptomatic patients will have  nausea,  vomiting,  early  satiety,  bloating,  and  epigastric pain. Treatment of gastroparesis includes strict blood glucose control, consumption of multiple small meals, reduction of the fat content of meals, and use of prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide. Diarrhea and constipation are also common among diabetic patients and may be related to diabetic autonomic neuropathy. In addition, patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy may demonstrate altered respiratory re fl exes and impaired ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MACROVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and the leading  cause  of  mortality  in  diabetic  individuals.  Between 20% and 30% of patients coming to the hospital with a myocardial infarction have diabetes. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes demonstrate elevated triglyceride levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and an abnormally small, dense, more atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Th is dyslipidemia is caused by lack of appropriate insulin signaling and is exacerbated by poor glucose control. Measures to prevent coronary artery disease include maintaining lipid levels, glucose level, and blood pressure within normal limits. Aspirin and statin therapy should be considered for all diabetic patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
infarction. Silent ischemia is possible if autonomic neuropathy is present, and stress testing should be considered in patients with multiple cardiac risk factors and poor or indeterminate exercise  tolerance.  For  renal  disease,  control  of  hypertension  is  important.  Meticulous  attention  to  hydration  status, avoidance  of  nephrotoxins,  and  preservation  of  renal  blood fl ow are also essential. Th e  presence of autonomic neuropathy predisposes the patient to perioperative dysrhythmias and intraoperative hypotension. In addition, loss of compensatory sympathetic responses interferes with the detection and treatment of hemodynamic insults. Preoperative evaluation of the musculoskeletal system should look for limited joint mobility caused by nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins and abnormal cross-linking of collagen. Firm, woody, nonpitting edema of  the  posterior  neck  and  upper  back  (scleredema  of  diabetes) coupled with impaired joint mobility may limit range of motion of the neck and render endotracheal intubation di ffi -cult. Gastroparesis may increase the risk of aspiration, regardless of nothing-by-mouth status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of insulin in the preoperative period depends on the type of insulin that the patient takes and the timing of dosing. If a patient takes subcutaneous insulin each night at bedtime, two thirds of this dose (NPH and regular) should be administered the night before surgery, and one half of the usual morning NPH dose should be given on the day of surgery. Th e daily morning dose of regular insulin should be held. If the patient uses an insulin pump, the overnight rate should be decreased by 30%. On the morning of surgery, the pump can  be  kept  infusing  at  the  basal  rate  or  discontinued  and replaced with a continuous insulin infusion at the same rate; alternatively, the patient can be given subcutaneous glargine and  the  pump  discontinued  60  to  90  minutes  a ft er  administration. If the patient uses glargine and lispro or aspart for daily glycemic control, the patient should take two thirds of the glargine dose and the entire lispro or aspart dose the night before surgery and hold all morning dosing. Oral hypoglycemics should be discontinued 24 to 48 hours preoperatively. It is advised that sulfonylureas be avoided during the entire perioperative  period,  because  they  block  the  myocardial  potassium  ATP  channels  that  are  responsible  for  ischemia-  and anesthetic-induced preconditioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aggressive glycemic control is important intraoperatively (Table 19-6). Ideally, a continuous infusion of insulin should be initiated  at  least  2  hours  before  surgery.  Intraoperative  serum glucose  levels  should  be  maintained  between  120  and  180 mg/dL. Levels above 200 mg/dL are likely to cause glycosuria and dehydration and to inhibit phagocyte function and wound healing.  Typically,  1  unit  of  insulin  lowers  glucose  approximately 25 to 30 mg/dL. Th e initial hourly rate for a continuous insulin infusion is determined by dividing the total daily insulin requirement by 24. A typical rate is 0.02 unit/kg/hr, or 1.4 units/hr in a 70-kg patient. An insulin infusion can be prepared by  mixing  100  units  of  regular  insulin  in  100  mL  of  normal saline  (1  unit/mL).  Insulin  infusion  requirements  are  higher for  patients  undergoing  coronary  artery  bypass  gra ft surgery, patients receiving steroids, patients with severe infection, and patients receiving hyperalimentation or vasopressor infusions. An insulin infusion should be accompanied by an infusion of 5% dextrose in half-normal saline with 20 mEq KCl at 100 to 150 mL/hr to provide enough carbohydrate (at least 150 g/day) to  inhibit  hepatic  glucose  production  and  protein  catabolism. Serum glucose level should be monitored at least every hour and even every 30 minutes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or patients with high insulin requirements. Glucose determination is preferentially made using venous plasma or serum samples; arterial and capillary blood yields glucose values approximately 7% higher than those for venous blood, and whole-blood determinations are usually 15% lower than plasma or serum values. Urine glucose monitoring is not reliable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of hypoglycemia is especially critical, since recognition of hypoglycemia may be delayed in patients receiving anesthetics, sedatives, analgesics, β -blockers, or sympatholytics and in those with autonomic neuropathy. If hypoglycemia does occur, treatment consists of administration of 50 mL of 50% dextrose in water, which typically increases the glucose level 100 mg/dL or 2 mg/dL/mL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE CARE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  postoperative  management of diabetic  patients  requires meticulous  monitoring  of  insulin  requirements.  Hyperglycemia  has  been  associated  with  poor  outcomes  in  postoperative and critically ill patients. However, the optimal target for  blood  glucose  level  in  the  perioperative  period  has  not yet been de fi ned. In addition, this target may be di ff erent for patients with newly diagnosed hyperglycemia than for those with preexisting diabetes. Th e risks of hypoglycemia must also be considered. Currently, the American Diabetes Association recommends that glucose levels be maintained between 140 and 180 mg/dL in critically ill patients and that insulin treatment be initiated if serum glucose levels exceed 180 mg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INSULINOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Insulinomas are rare, benign insulin-secreting pancreatic islet cell tumors. Th ey usually occur as an isolated fi nding but may present  as  part  of  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  syndrome type  I  (insulinoma,  hyperparathyroidism,  and  a  pituitary tumor). Th ey occur in women twice as o ft en as in men and usually  in  the fift h  or  sixth  decade  of  life. Th e  diagnosis  is made  by  demonstrating  Whipple's  triad:  (1)  symptoms  of hypoglycemia  with  fasting,  (2)  a  glucose  level  of  less  than 50  mg/dL  with  symptoms,  and  (3)  relief  of  symptoms  by administration of glucose. An inappropriately high insulin level (>5 to 10 microunits/mL) during a 48- to 72-hour fast con fi rms the  diagnosis.  Preoperative  localization  of  these  o ft en  small lesions is challenging, and several studies (computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], endoscopic or  transabdominal  ultrasonography,  transhepatic  portal  vein sampling, and/or intraarterial calcium stimulation) are commonly utilized in combination to improve tumor localization.

THYROID DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  thyroid  gland  weighs  approximately  20  g  and  is  composed of two lobes joined by an isthmus. Th e gland is closely a ffi xed to the anterior and lateral aspects of the trachea, with the upper border of the isthmus located just below the cricoid cartilage. A pair of parathyroid glands is located on the posterior aspect of each lobe. A rich capillary network permeates the entire gland. Th e gland is innervated by the adrenergic and cholinergic  nervous  systems. Th e  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve and external motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve are in intimate proximity to the gland. Histologically, the thyroid is  composed  of  numerous  follicles fi lled  with  proteinaceous colloid. Th e major constituent of colloid is thyroglobulin, an iodinated glycoprotein that serves as the substrate for thyroid hormone synthesis. Th e thyroid gland also contains parafollicular C cells, which produce calcitonin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Production  of  normal  quantities  of  thyroid  hormones depends on the availability of exogenous iodine. Th e  diet  is the primary source of iodine. Iodine is reduced to iodide in the gastrointestinal  tract,  rapidly  absorbed  into  the  blood,  then actively  transported  from  the  plasma  into  thyroid  follicular cells (Figure 19-10). Binding of iodine to thyroglobulin (i.e., organi fi cation) is catalyzed by an iodinase enzyme and yields inactive monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine. Approximately  25%  of  the  monoiodotyrosine  and  diiodotyrosine undergo coupling via  thyroid  peroxidase  to  form  the  active compounds  triiodothyronine  (T 3 )  and  thyroxine  (T 4 ). Th e remaining 75% never becomes hormones, and eventually the iodine is cleaved and recycled. T 3 and T 4 remain attached to thyroglobulin and are stored as colloid until they are released

into  the  circulation.  Since  the  thyroid  contains  a  large  store of hormones and has a low turnover rate, there is protection against depletion if synthesis is impaired or discontinued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e T 4 /T3 ratio of secreted hormones is 10:1. Upon entering the blood, T 4 and T 3 bind reversibly to three major proteins: thyroxine-binding globulin (80% of binding), prealbumin (10% to  15%),  and  albumin  (5%  to  10%).  Only  the  small  amount of  free  fraction  of  hormone,  however,  is  biologically  active. Although only 10% of thyroid hormone secretion is T 3 ,  T 3 is three to four times more active than T 4 per unit of weight and may be the only active thyroid hormone in peripheral tissues. In the periphery, T 3 traverses cell membranes and binds to receptors in the cell nucleus, stimulating messenger RNA synthesis, which  in  turn  controls  protein  synthesis.  Also,  binding  with mitochondria  stimulates  oxidative  phosphorylation  and  ATP formation. At the plasma membrane level, T 3 in fl uences transcellular fl ux of substrates and cations. Th yroid hormones stimulate virtually all metabolic processes. Th ey in fl uence growth and maturation of tissues, enhance tissue function, and stimulate protein synthesis and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th yroid  hormone  acts  directly  on  cardiac  myocytes  and vascular smooth muscle cells. In the heart, T 3 is  transported via  speci fi c  proteins  across  the  myocyte  cell  membrane  and enters the nucleus, binding to nuclear receptors that in turn bind  to  speci fi c  target  genes.  T 3 -responsive  genes  code  for structural  and  regulatory  proteins  in  the  heart  (myosin, β -adrenergic receptors, Ca 2+ -activated ATPase, phospholamban, and Ca 2+ , Na + ,  and K +  channels) that are important for systolic contractile function and diastolic relaxation. Th yroid hormone increases myocardial contractility directly, decreases systemic vascular resistance via direct vasodilation,  and increases  intravascular  volume.  Most  recent  studies  emphasize the direct e ff ects of T 3 on the heart and vascular smooth muscle  as  responsible  for  the  exaggerated  hemodynamic

e ff ects of hyperthyroidism. Even though hyperthyroid patients appear to have increased numbers of β -adrenergic receptors, these receptors demonstrate little or no increased sensitivity to adrenergic stimulation, and surprisingly, these patients have normal or low serum concentrations of catecholamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regulation of thyroid function is controlled by the hypothalamus, pituitary,  and  thyroid  glands,  which  participate  in a classic feedback control system. Th yrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is secreted from the hypothalamus, traverses the pituitary stalk, and promotes release of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the anterior pituitary. TSH binds to speci fi c receptors on the thyroid cell membrane and enhances all processes of synthesis and secretion of T 4 and T 3 . A decrease in TSH causes a reduction in synthesis and secretion of T 4 and T3, a decrease in follicular cell size, and a decrease in the gland's vascularity. An increase in TSH yields an increase in hormone production and release and an increase in gland cellularity and vascularity. TSH secretion is also in fl uenced by plasma levels of T4 and T 3 via a negative feedback loop. In addition to the feedback system, the thyroid gland has an autoregulatory mechanism that maintains a consistent level of hormone stores.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e third generation of the TSH assay is now the single best test  of  thyroid  hormone  action  at  the  cellular  level.  Small changes in thyroid function cause signi fi cant changes in TSH secretion. Th e normal level of TSH is 0.4 to 5.0 milliunits/L. A TSH level of 0.1 to 0.4 milliunits/L with normal levels of free T3 (FT 3 ) and free T 4 (FT 4 ) is diagnostic of subclinical hyperthyroidism. A TSH level of less than 0.03 milliunits/L with elevated T 3 and T 4 is diagnostic of overt hyperthyroidism. A TSH level of 5.0 to 10 milliunits/L with normal levels of FT 3 and FT4 is diagnostic of subclinical hypothyroidism. A TSH level of more than 20 milliunits/L (may be as high as 200 or even 400 milliunits/L) with reduced levels of T 3 and T 4 is diagnostic of overt hypothyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  TRH  stimulation  test  assesses  the  functional  state  of the TSH-secreting mechanism in response to TRH and is used to  test  pituitary  function.  Other  tests  that  may  be  helpful  in detecting thyroid dysfunction include measurement of serum antimicrosomal antibodies, antithyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating  immunoglobulins. Th yroid  scans  using iodine 123 ( 123 I) or technetium 99m evaluate thyroid nodules as "warm" (normally functioning), "hot" (hyperfunctioning), or "cold" (hypofunctioning). Ultrasonography is 90% to 95% accurate in determining whether a lesion is cystic, solid, or mixed.

Hyperthyroidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperthyroidism refers  to  hyperfunctioning  of  the  thyroid gland with excessive secretion of active thyroid hormones. Th e majority of cases of hyperthyroidism result from one of three pathologic processes: Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, or a toxic adenoma. Regardless of the cause, the signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism are those of a hypermetabolic state. Th e  patient  is  anxious,  restless,  and  hyperkinetic  and may  be  emotionally  unstable. Th e  skin  is  warm  and  moist, the face is fl ushed, the hair is fi ne, and the nails are so ft and fragile. Th e patient may demonstrate increased sweating and complain  of  heat  intolerance. Th e  eyes  exhibit  a  wide-eyed stare  with  retraction  of  the  upper  eyelids  (exophthalmos  or proptosis) resulting from an in fi ltrative process that involves retrobulbar fat and the eyelids. Wasting, weakness, and fatigue of the proximal limb muscles are common. Th e patient usually  complains  of  extreme  fatigue  but  an  inability  to  sleep. Increased bone turnover and osteoporosis may occur. A fi ne tremor of the hands and hyperactive tendon re fl exes are common. Weight loss despite an increased appetite occurs secondary to increased calorigenesis. Bowel movements are frequent and diarrhea is not uncommon.

Th e  cardiovascular  system  is  most  threatened  by  hypermetabolism of peripheral tissues, increased cardiac work with tachycardia, arrhythmias (commonly atrial) and palpitations, a hyperdynamic circulation, increased myocardial contractility and cardiac output, and cardiomegaly. Th e cardiac responses are due to the direct e ff ects of T 3 on the myocardium and the peripheral vasculature. Although cardiac failure rarely occurs, a thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy has been described characterized by a lymphocytic and eosinophilic in fi ltration of the myocardium  with fi brotic  and  fatty  changes.  Elderly  patients  with unexplained cardiac failure or rhythm disturbances-  especially atrial in origin-should be evaluated for thyrotoxicosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Graves' disease or toxic di ff use goiter occurs in 0.4% of the U.S.  population  and  is  the  leading  cause  of  hyperthyroidism. Th e disease typically occurs in females (female/male ratio is 7:1) between the ages of 20 and 40 years. Although the etiology is unknown, Graves' disease appears to be a systemic autoimmune disease  caused  by  thyroid-stimulating  antibodies  that  bind  to TSH receptors in the thyroid, activating adenyl cyclase and stimulating thyroid growth, vascularity, and hypersecretion of T 4 and T3 . Th e thyroid is usually di ff usely enlarged, becoming two to three times its normal size. An ophthalmopathy occurs in 30% of cases and may include upper lid retraction, a wide-eyed stare, muscle weakness, proptosis, and an increase in intraocular pressure. When severe, the condition is termed malignant exophthalmos. Steroid  therapy,  bilateral  tarsorrhaphy,  external  radiation therapy,  or  surgical  decompression  may  be  necessary  in  these cases. Fortunately, most cases are mild, follow a benign course, and remit spontaneously. Th e diagnosis of Graves' disease is confi rmed by the presence of thyroid-stimulating antibodies in the context of low TSH level and elevated T 4 and T 3 levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Toxic multinodular goiter usually arises from long-standing simple goiter and occurs mostly in patients older than 50 years of age. It may present with extreme thyroid enlargement that can cause dysphagia, globus sensation, and possibly inspiratory stridor from tracheal compression. Th e latter is especially common when the mass extends into the thoracic inlet behind the sternum. In severe cases, superior vena cava obstruction syndrome may also be present. Th e diagnosis is con fi rmed by a thyroid scan demonstrating "hot" patchy foci throughout the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
gland or one or two "hot" nodules. Radioactive iodine uptake and serum T4 and T 3 levels may only be slightly elevated. Th e goiter must be di ff erentiated from a neoplasm, and a CT scan and biopsy may be necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst line of treatment for hyperthyroidism is an antithyroid drug,  either  methimazole  or  propylthiouracil  (PTU). Th ese agents interfere with the synthesis of thyroid hormones by inhibiting organi fi cation and coupling. PTU has the added advantage of inhibiting the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 . A euthyroid state can almost always be achieved in 6 to 8 weeks with either drug if a su ffi cient dosage is used. Side e ff ects occur in 3% to 12% of patients, with agranulocytosis being the most serious.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Iodide in high concentrations inhibits release of hormones from  the  hyperfunctioning  gland.  High  concentrations  of iodide decrease all phases of thyroid synthesis and release, and result in reduced gland size and possibly a decrease in vascularity. Its e ff ects occur immediately but are short-lived. Th erefore, iodide is usually reserved for preparing hyperthyroid patients for surgery, managing patients with actual or impending thyroid storm, and treating patients with severe thyrocardiac disease. Th ere is no need to delay surgery in a patient with otherwise well-controlled thyrotoxicosis in order to initiate iodide therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Iodide is administered orally as a saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI), 3 drops PO every 8 hours for 10 to 14 days. Th e radiographic contrast dye ipodate or iopanoic acid (0.5 to 3.0 g every day) contains iodide and demonstrates bene fi cial e ff ects similar to those of inorganic iodide. In addition, ipodate inhibits the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 and may also antagonize thyroid hormone binding to receptors. Antithyroid drug therapy should precede the initiation of iodide treatment, because administration of iodide alone will increase thyroid hormone stores  and  exacerbate  the  thyrotoxic  state.  Lithium  carbonate 300 mg PO every 6 hours may be given in place of potassium iodide or ipodate to patients who are allergic to iodide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ablative therapy with radioactive iodine 131 ( 131 I) or surgery  is  recommended  for  patients  with  Graves'  disease  for whom medical management has failed, as well as for patients with toxic multinodular goiter or a toxic adenoma. Standard doses of 131 I deliver approximately 8500 rad to the thyroid and destroy the follicular cells. Th e remission rate is 80% to 98%. A major disadvantage of therapy is that 40% to 70% of treated patients become hypothyroid within 10 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Adrenergic  antagonists  do  not  a ff ect  the  underlying thyroid abnormality but may relieve signs and symptoms of increased  adrenergic  activity  such  as  anxiety,  sweating,  heat intolerance, tremors, and  tachycardia.  Propranolol  o ff ers the added features of impairing the peripheral conversion of T4 to T 3 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery (i.e., subtotal thyroidectomy or possibly total thyroidectomy) results in prompt control of disease and is associated with a lower incidence of hypothyroidism (10% to 30%) than radioactive iodine therapy. Subtotal thyroidectomy corrects  thyrotoxicosis in more than 95% of patients; mortality rate for the procedure is less than 0.1%. Complications from surgery  include  hypothyroidism,  hemorrhage  with  tracheal compression, unilateral or bilateral damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve(s), damage to the motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, and damage to or inadvertent removal of the parathyroid glands.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy is treated with low dosages of antithyroid drugs. However, these drugs do cross the placenta  and  can  cause  fetal  hypothyroidism.  If  the  mother remains euthyroid while taking small dosages of an antithyroid drug, the occurrence of fetal hypothyroidism is rare. Radioactive iodine treatment is contraindicated during pregnancy, as is oral iodide therapy, because it can cause fetal goiter and hypothyroidism. Th e long-term use of propranolol during pregnancy is controversial since intrauterine growth retardation has been attributed to its use. Fortunately, pregnancy appears to attenuate the severity of hyperthyroidism, and dosages of antithyroid drugs can usually be kept low (i.e., PTU < 200 mg/day). If dosages  higher  than  300  mg/day  of  PTU  are  needed  during  the fi rst trimester, a subtotal thyroidectomy should be performed in the second trimester. Th yroid storm occurring in pregnancy is managed in the same way as in nonpregnant patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  hyperthyroid  patients  undergoing  surgery,  euthyroidism should  de fi nitely  be  established  preoperatively.  In  elective cases, this may mean waiting a substantial time (6 to 8 weeks) for antithyroid drugs to become e ff ective. In emergency cases, the use of an intravenous β -blocker, ipodate, glucocorticoids, and  PTU  is  usually  necessary.  No  intravenous  preparation of  PTU is  available,  so  the  drug  must  be  taken  orally,  via  a nasogastric tube, or rectally. Glucocorticoids (dexamethasone 2 mg IV every 6 hours) should be administered to decrease hormone release and reduce the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 . Th e anesthesiologist should be prepared to manage thyroid storm, especially in patients with uncontrolled or poorly controlled disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of the upper airway for evidence of tracheal compression or deviation caused by a goiter is an important part of the preoperative evaluation. Examination of chest radiographs and CT scans is o ft en helpful in this regard. Intraoperatively, the need for invasive monitoring is determined on an individual basis and depends on the type of surgery to be performed and the medical condition of the patient. Controlled studies in hyperthyroid animals demonstrate no clinically signi fi cant increase  in  anesthetic  requirements  (i.e.,  minimum  alveolar concentration).  Establishment  of  adequate  anesthetic  depth is extremely important to avoid exaggerated sympathetic nervous system responses. Drugs that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system (i.e., ketamine, pancuronium, atropine, ephedrine, epinephrine) should be avoided. Th iopental, because of its thioureylene nucleus, decreases the peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3 and may have a slight advantage over other agents for anesthesia induction. Eye protection (eyedrops, lubricant, eye pads) is critical, especially for patients with proptosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For maintenance of anesthesia, any of the potent inhalation agents may be used. A concern in hyperthyroid patients is organ

<!-- PAGE=? -->
toxicity secondary to an increase in drug metabolism. Although animal  studies  demonstrate  an  increase  in  hepatotoxicity  in hyperthyroid rats following exposure to iso fl urane, these results have  not  been  substantiated  in  humans.  Nitrous  oxide  and opioids are safe and e ff ective in hyperthyroid patients. Hyperthyroid  patients  may  have  co-existing  muscle  disease  (e.g., myasthenia gravis) with reduced requirements for the nondepolarizing muscle relaxants; therefore, careful titration is required. For the treatment of intraoperative hypotension, a direct-acting vasopressor (phenylephrine) is preferred. Ephedrine, epinephrine,  norepinephrine,  and  dopamine  should  be  avoided  or administered  in  extremely  low  doses  to  prevent  exaggerated hemodynamic responses. Regional anesthesia can be safely performed and in fact may be a preferred technique. Epinephrinecontaining local anesthetic solutions should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Removal of the thyrotoxic gland does not mean immediate resolution of thyrotoxicosis. Th e half-life of T 4 is 7 to 8 days; therefore, β -blocker therapy may need to be continued in the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THYROID STORM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th yroid storm is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism precipitated by trauma, infection, medical illness, or surgery. Th yroid storm and malignant hyperthermia can present  with  similar  intraoperative  and  postoperative  signs  and symptoms (i.e., hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypermetabolism); therefore, di ff erentiation between the two may be extremely di ffi cult. Surprisingly, thyroid hormone levels in thyroid storm may  not  be  signi fi cantly  higher  than  during  uncomplicated hyperthyroidism. Th yroid function tests therefore may not be useful in making the diagnosis. Th e cause is probably a shi ft from protein-bound thyroid hormone to free hormone as a result of the presence of circulating inhibitors to binding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th yroid  storm  most  o ft en  occurs  in  the  postoperative period  in  untreated  or  inadequately  treated  hyperthyroid patients  a ft er  emergency  surgery.  Patients  manifest  extreme anxiety, fever, tachycardia, cardiovascular instability,  and altered  consciousness.  Treatment  includes  rapid  alleviation of thyrotoxicosis and general supportive care. Dehydration is managed with intravenous administration of glucose-containing crystalloid solutions, and cooling measures (e.g., cooling blanket, ice packs, administration of cool humidi fi ed oxygen) are  used  to  counter  the  fever. β -Blockers  should  be  titrated to decrease heart rate to less than 90 beats per minute. Dexamethasone 2 mg every 6 hours or cortisol 100 to 200 mg every 8 hours can be used to decrease hormone release and conversion of T 4 to T 3 . Antithyroid drugs (PTU 200 to 400 mg every 8  hours)  may  be  administered  through  a  nasogastric  tube, orally, or rectally. If circulatory shock is present, intravenous administration of a direct vasopressor (phenylephrine) is indicated. A β -adrenergic blocker or digitalis is recommended for atrial fi brillation accompanied by a fast ventricular response. Serum  thyroid  hormone  levels  generally  return  to  normal within 24 to 48 hours and recovery occurs within 1 week. Th e mortality rate for thyroid storm remains surprisingly high at approximately 20%.

Hypothyroidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypothyroidism or myxedema is a relatively common disease a ff ecting 0.5% to 0.8% of the adult population. Primary hypothyroidism results in decreased production of thyroid hormones despite adequate or increased levels of TSH and accounts for 95% of all cases of hypothyroidism. Th e most common cause in the United States is ablation of the gland by radioactive iodine or surgery. Th e second most common type of hypothyroidism is idiopathic and probably autoimmune in origin, with autoantibodies blocking TSH receptors in the thyroid. Unlike Graves' disease,  this  immune  response  destroys  receptors  instead  of stimulating  them.  Hashimoto's  thyroiditis  is  an  autoimmune disorder characterized by goitrous enlargement and hypothyroidism that usually a ff ects middle-aged women.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In adults, hypothyroidism has a slow, insidious, progressive course. Th ere is gradual slowing of mental and physical activity.  In  mild  cases,  patients  tire  easily  and  experience  weight gain.  In  moderate  to  severe  cases,  patients  develop  fatigue, lethargy, apathy, and listlessness. Th e speech becomes slow and the intellect becomes dull. With time, patients experience cold intolerance,  decreased  sweating,  constipation,  menorrhagia, and slowing of motor function secondary to muscle sti ff ness and cramping. Th ey gain weight despite a decrease in appetite.  Physically,  they  demonstrate  dry  thickened  skin,  coarse facial features, dry brittle hair, a large tongue, a deep hoarse voice, and periorbital and peripheral edema. Accumulation of hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides in the dermis and other tissues is responsible for the immobile, nonpitting edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologically,  cardiac  output  is  decreased  secondary to  reductions  in  stroke  volume  and  heart  rate.  Baroreceptor  function  is  also  impaired. Th e  electrocardiogram (ECG) in  patients  with  overt  hypothyroidism  shows fl attened  or inverted T waves, low-amplitude P waves and QRS complexes, and sinus bradycardia; ventricular dysrhythmias may also be present. Peripheral vascular resistance is increased and blood volume is reduced, which results in pale, cool skin. In advanced cases,  myocardial  contractility  becomes  reduced  secondary to systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and the heart becomes enlarged and dilated (hypothyroid cardiomyopathy). Pericardial e ff usions are common. Hypothyroid patients usually have hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia and may have coronary  artery  disease.  Hyponatremia  and  impairment  of free water excretion are also common, related to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Maximum breathing capacity and di ff usion capacity are decreased, and ventilatory responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercarbia is depressed. Pleural e ff usions may result in dyspnea. Gastrointestinal function is slow, and an adynamic ileus may occur. Deep tendon re fl exes demonstrate a prolonged relaxation phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Twenty percent of women older than 60 years of age have subclinical  hypothyroidism.  Subclinical  disease  is  associated with  an  increased  risk  of  coronary  heart  disease  in  patients with  a  TSH  level  of  more  than  10  milliunits/L.  Although most patients have few if any signs or symptoms, changes in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
390

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
myocardial  structure  and  contractibility  can  occur  secondary to systolic  and  diastolic  dysfunction.  Even  though these changes are reversible with l -thyroxine therapy, use of thyroid replacement for subclinical disease remains controversial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary  hypothyroidism  is  diagnosed  by  reduced  levels of FT 4 , T 4 , and T 3 , as well as a reduced TSH level. A TRH stimulation  test  can  con fi rm  pituitary  abnormality  as  the cause. Th is  test  measures the responsiveness of the pituitary gland to intravenously administered TRH, the hypothalamic stimulator of TSH. In primary hypothyroidism, basal levels of TSH are elevated, and the elevation is exaggerated a ft er TRH administration. With pituitary dysfunction, there is a blunted or absent response to TRH.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Euthyroid  sick  syndrome  is  the  occurrence  of  abnormal results on thyroid function tests in critically ill patients with signi fi cant nonthyroidal illness. Characteristic fi ndings include low levels of T 3 and T 4 and a normal TSH level. As illness increases in severity, the T 3 and T 4 levels decrease further. Th e etiology of  this  response  is  not  understood.  Euthyroid  sick  syndrome may be a physiologic response to stress, and it can be induced by surgery. No treatment for thyroid function is necessary. Differentiating hypothyroidism from euthyroid sick syndrome can be extremely di ffi cult. A serum TSH level is the best aid. Levels higher than 10 milliunits/L indicate hypothyroidism, whereas levels lower than 5.0 milliunits/L indicate euthyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes in thyroid function test results have also been documented  following  uncomplicated  acute  myocardial  infarctions, congestive heart failure, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Signi fi cant depression of T 3 levels occurs, but the administration of T 3 does not appear e ffi cacious. In addition, the use of T3 as an inotrope has not been show to result in any substantial improvement in cardiac performance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
l -Th yroxine (levothyroxine sodium) is usually administered for the treatment of hypothyroidism. Th e fi rst  evidence of a therapeutic response to thyroid hormone is sodium and water diuresis  and  a  reduction  in  the  TSH  level.  In  patients  with hypothyroid cardiomyopathy, a measurable improvement in myocardial function is o ft en achieved with therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  angina  is  uncommon  in  hypothyroidism,  it can  appear  or  worsen  during  treatment  of  the  hypothyroid state  with  thyroid  hormone.  Medical  management  of  such patients is particularly di ffi cult. Th erefore, patients who have both  hypothyroidism  and  angina  should  undergo  angiographic  evaluation  of  the  coronary  arteries  before  hormone replacement  is  initiated.  If  surgically  remediable  disease  is demonstrated,  coronary  artery  bypass  gra ft surgery  can  be successfully accomplished despite hypothyroidism. Coronary revascularization can permit the necessary thyroid hormone replacement and reinstitution of the euthyroid state.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypothyroid patients may be at increased risk when undergoing  either  general  or  regional  anesthesia  for  a  number  of reasons.  Airway  compromise  secondary  to  a  swollen  oral cavity,  edematous vocal cords, or goitrous enlargement may be present. Decreased gastric emptying increases the risk of regurgitation  and  aspiration.  A  hypodynamic  cardiovascular  system characterized by decreased cardiac output, stroke volume,  heart  rate,  baroreceptor  re fl exes,  and  intravascular volume may be compromised by surgical stress and cardiacdepressant  anesthetic  agents.  Decreased  ventilatory  responsiveness to hypoxia and hypercarbia is enhanced by anesthetic agents. Hypothermia occurs quickly and is di ffi cult  to  treat. Hematologic  abnormalities  such  as  anemia  (25%  to  50%  of patients) and dysfunction of platelets and coagulation factors (especially  factor  VIII),  electrolyte  imbalances  (hyponatremia), and hypoglycemia are common and require close monitoring intraoperatively. Decreased neuromuscular excitability is exacerbated by anesthetic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese patients can be extremely sensitive to narcotics and sedatives and may even be lethargic secondary to their disease; therefore,  preoperative  sedation  should  be  undertaken  with caution. Hypothyroid patients also appear to have an increased sensitivity to anesthetic drugs, although the e ff ect of thyroid activity  on  the  minimum  alveolar  concentration  of  volatile anesthetics is negligible. Increased sensitivity is probably secondary to reduced cardiac output, decreased blood volume, abnormal baroreceptor function, decreased hepatic metabolism, and decreased renal excretion of drugs. In patients with a hypodynamic cardiovascular system invasive monitoring and/ or transesophageal echocardiography may be needed to monitor intravascular volume and cardiac status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthetics  should  be  administered  through  an endotracheal tube following either rapid-sequence induction or awake intubation if a di ffi cult airway is present. Hypothyroid patients are very sensitive to the myocardial-depressant e ff ects  of  the  potent  inhalational  agents.  Vasodilation  in  the presence  of  possible  hypovolemia  and  impaired  baroreceptor  activity  can  produce signi fi cant hypotension. Pharmacologic support for intraoperative hypotension is best provided with  ephedrine,  dopamine,  or  epinephrine  and  not  a  pure α -adrenergic agonist (phenylephrine). Unresponsive hypotension may require supplemental steroid administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From a cardiovascular standpoint, pancuronium is a preferred  muscle  relaxant;  however,  reduced  skeletal  muscle activity in these patients coupled with a reduction in hepatic metabolism necessitates cautious dosing. Controlled ventilation is recommended in all cases, since these patients tend to hypoventilate  if  allowed  to  breathe  spontaneously.  Dextrose in  normal  saline  is  the  recommended  intravenous fl uid  to avoid  hypoglycemia  and  minimize  hyponatremia  secondary to impaired free water clearance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If emergency surgery is necessary, the potential for severe intraoperative cardiovascular instability and myxedema coma  in  the  postoperative  period  is  high.  Intravenous  thyroid replacement therapy should be initiated as soon as possible.  Although  intravenous l -thyroxine takes 10 to 12 days to yield a peak basal metabolic rate, intravenous triiodothyronine  is  e ff ective  in  6  hours  with  a  peak  basal  metabolic rate seen in 36 to 72 hours. l -Th yroxine 300 to 500 mcg IV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 19 ENDOCRINE DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
391

<!-- PAGE=? -->
or l -triiodothyronine 25 to 50 mcg IV is an acceptable initial dose. Steroid coverage with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone is  necessary,  since  decreased  adrenal  cortical  function  o ft en accompanies  hypothyroidism.  Phosphodiesterase  inhibitors such as milrinone may be e ff ective in the treatment of reduced myocardial  contractility  because  their  mechanism  of  action does not depend on β -receptors, whose number and sensitivity may be reduced in hypothyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MYXEDEMA COMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myxedema coma is a rare severe form of hypothyroidism characterized  by  delirium  or  unconsciousness,  hypoventilation, hypothermia (80% of patients), bradycardia, hypotension, and a severe dilutional hyponatremia. It occurs most commonly in elderly women with a long history of hypothyroidism. Infection,  trauma,  cold,  and  central  nervous  system  depressants predispose  hypothyroid  patients  to  myxedema  coma.  Ironically, most patients are not comatose. Hypothermia (as low as 27° C) is a cardinal feature and results from impaired thermoregulation caused by defective function of the hypothalamus (a  target  tissue  of  thyroid  hormone).  Myxedema  coma  is  a medical  emergency  with  a  mortality  rate  higher  than  50%. Intravenous l -thyroxine  or l -triiodothyronine  is  the  treatment of choice. Intravenous hydration with glucose-containing  saline  solutions,  temperature  regulation,  correction  of electrolyte  imbalances,  and  stabilization  of  the  cardiac  and pulmonary  systems  are  necessary.  Mechanical  ventilation  is frequently required. Heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature usually improve within 24 hours, and a relative euthyroid state is achieved in 3 to 5 days. Hydrocortisone 100 to 300 mg/ day IV is also prescribed to treat possible adrenal insu ffi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Goiter and Thyroid Tumors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A goiter is  a  swelling  of  the  thyroid  gland  that  results  from compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia of follicular epithelium secondary to a reduction in thyroid hormone output. Th e cause may be a de fi cient intake of iodine, ingestion of a dietary (i.e., cassava) or pharmacologic (i.e., phenylbutazone, lithium) goitrogen, or a defect in the hormonal biosynthetic pathway. Th e size of the goiter is determined by the level and duration of hormone insu ffi ciency. In most cases, a goiter is associated with a euthyroid state, with the increased mass and cellular  activity  eventually  overcoming  the  impairment  in hormone  synthesis.  However,  hypothyroidism  or  hyperthyroidism occurs in some cases. Patients with simple, nontoxic goiter are euthyroid. Nevertheless, simple, nontoxic goiter is a forerunner of toxic multinodular goiter. In the United States, most cases of  simple  nontoxic  goiter  are  of  unknown  cause and are treated with l -thyroxine. Surgery is indicated only if medical therapy is ine ff ective and the goiter is compromising the airway or is cosmetically unacceptable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthetic management of a patient undergoing surgical removal of a large goiter or thyroid mass that compromises the airway presents a major challenge. Examination of a CT scan  of  the  neck  will  demonstrate  anatomic  abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sedatives and narcotics should be avoided or used with great caution  before  and  during  endotracheal  tube  placement. Awake intubation with an armored (anode) tube using fi beroptic  bronchoscopy  is  probably  the  safest  method  to  assess the  degree  of  obstruction  and  establish  the  airway.  Surgical removal  of  the  mass  may  reveal  underlying  tracheomalacia and a collapsible airway. Tracheal extubation should be performed with as much caution and concern as intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the mass extends into the substernal regional (i.e., anterior mediastinal mass), superior vena cava obstruction, major airway  obstruction,  and/or  cardiac  compression  may  occur. Th e latter two may become apparent only upon induction of general anesthesia. Airway obstruction appears to result from changes  in  lung  and  chest  wall  mechanics  that  occur  with changes in patient position or with the onset of muscle paralysis.  During  spontaneous  respiration,  the  larger  airways  are supported by negative intrathoracic  pressure,  and  the  e ff ects of  extrinsic  compression  may  be  apparent  in  only  the  most severe cases. With cessation of spontaneous respiration, compensatory  mechanisms  are  removed  and  airway  obstruction occurs. In addition, positive pressure ventilation may demonstrate total airway occlusion. A preoperative history of dyspnea in the upright or supine position is predictive of possible airway obstruction during general anesthesia. A CT scan must be examined to assess the extent of the tumor. Flow-volume loops in the upright and supine positions will demonstrate the site of obstruction and the degree of obstruction to air fl ow in the upper airway and trachea. Limitations in the inspiratory limb of the loop indicate extrathoracic airway obstruction, and delayed fl ow in the expiratory limb indicates intrathoracic obstruction. Echocardiography with the patient in the upright and supine positions can indicate the degree of cardiac compression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  practical,  local  anesthesia  is  recommended  for  patients requiring surgery. If general anesthesia is necessary, preoperative shrinkage of a thyroid tumor by radiation or chemotherapy is recommended unless the altered histologic appearance would prevent an accurate diagnosis, as when a biopsy specimen is required for diagnosis. Unfortunately, goiters are not sensitive to radiation therapy. In such patients, an awake intubation  with fi beroptic  bronchoscopy  using  an  anode  tube  is recommended. Th e  patient  is  placed  in  semi-Fowler's  position, and volatile anesthetic with nitrous oxide and oxygen is administered using spontaneous ventilation. Muscle relaxants are avoided. It must be possible to change the patient's position.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Following  tumor  resection,  the  airway  should  be  examined by fi beroptic bronchoscopy to detect tracheomalacia and determine whether and when tracheal extubation is appropriate.  A  rigid  bronchoscope  should  be  available  to  reestablish the airway if collapse occurs. Cardiopulmonary bypass equipment should be on standby during the case.

Complications of Thyroid Surgery

Morbidity  from  thyroid  surgery  approaches  13%.  Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury may be unilateral or bilateral and temporary or permanent. Th e injury may result from excess trauma to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
392

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the nerve(s) (abductor and/or adductor fi bers of the recurrent laryngeal  nerve),  inadvertent  ligation,  or  transection.  When paralysis  of  the  abductor  muscles  to  the  vocal  cord  occurs, the involved cord assumes a median or paramedian position. If trauma is unilateral, the patient experiences hoarseness but no airway obstruction, and function usually returns in 3 to 6 months. Ligation or transection of the nerve results in permanent hoarseness. Bilateral involvement is more serious, since the patient usually experiences airway obstruction and problems with coughing and respiratory toilet. Depending on the degree of damage, a temporary or permanent tracheostomy is usually necessary. Injury to the adductor fi bers of the recurrent laryngeal nerve(s) results in paralysis of the adductor muscle(s) and increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Injury to the motor branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, which innervates the inferior pharyngeal constrictor and cricothyroid muscles, can also occur during thyroid dissection. Th is injury results in weakening of the voice and the inability to create high tones.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoparathyroidism is also a complication of thyroid surgery. It usually results from damage to the blood supply of the parathyroid glands rather than inadvertent removal. One functioning parathyroid gland with an adequate blood supply is all that is necessary to avoid hypoparathyroidism. Th e signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia occur in the fi rst 24 to 48 hours postoperatively.  Anxiety,  circumoral  numbness,  tingling  of the fi ngertips, muscle cramping, and positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's  signs  are  indicative  of  hypocalcemia.  A  positive Chvostek sign consists of facial muscle twitching produced by manual tapping over the area of the facial nerve at the angle of the mandible. A positive Trousseau sign is carpopedal spasm in response to 3 minutes of limb ischemia produced by a tourniquet. Stridor can occur and can proceed to laryngospasm. Immediate treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate (1 g, 10 mL of a 10% solution) or calcium chloride (1 g, 10 mL of a 10% solution) is necessary. A continuous infusion of calcium for several days is also recommended. For long-term management,  oral  calcium  and  vitamin  D 3 are  prescribed  or  autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue may be performed.

Tracheal compression from an expanding hematoma may cause  rapid  respiratory  compromise  in  the  period  immediately a ft er thyroid surgery. Immediate hematoma evacuation is the fi rst line of treatment. If time permits, the patient should be returned to the operating room. If necessary, the wound should be opened at the bedside, clots evacuated, and bleeding vessels secured to relieve airway obstruction. A thyroid tray, including  a  tracheostomy  set,  should  always  be  available  at the bedside during the postoperative period so that sutures or clips can be removed and the wound opened emergently. Tracheostomy is not required if the wound is decompressed early.

PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors that arise  from  chroma ffi n  cells  of  the  sympathoadrenal  system. Although pheochromocytomas account for fewer than 0.1% of all cases of hypertension in adults, their detection is imperative, since  they  have  lethal  potential  and  are  one  of  the  few  truly curable  forms  of  hypertension.  Uncontrolled  catecholamine release can result in malignant hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, and myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  precise  cause  of  a  pheochromocytoma  is  unknown. Pheochromocytomas  are  usually  an  isolated fi nding  (90% of  cases).  Ten  percent  of  pheochromocytomas  are  inherited (familial) as an autosomal dominant trait. Familial pheochromocytomas  usually  occur  as  bilateral  adrenal  tumors  or  as extraadrenal tumors that appear in the same anatomic site over successive  generations.  Both  sexes  are  equally  a ff ected,  and the peak incidence is in the third to fift h decades of life. Ten percent of pheochromocytomas occur in children, and in this population,  multiple,  extraadrenal,  and  bilateral  tumors  are relatively more common than in adults. Variability in clinical presentation leads to di ffi culties in diagnosis. Recent advances in genetic testing allow early identi fi cation of patients with a familial pheochromocytoma before signs and symptoms occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Familial pheochromocytomas can also be part of the multiple endocrine neoplastic syndromes and can occur in association with  several  neuroectodermal  dysplasias  (e.g.,  von  HippelLindau  syndrome).  Patients  with  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia syndrome type IIA have a pheochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma  of  the  thyroid,  and  hyperparathyroidism.  Patients with  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  syndrome  type  IIB  have  a pheochromocytoma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, alimentary tract ganglioneuromatosis, thickened corneal nerves, and a marfanoid habitus. Almost 100% of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type II have or will develop bilateral benign adrenal medullary pheochromocytomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eighty  percent  of  pheochromocytomas  are  located  in  the adrenal  medulla. Th e  organ  of  Zuckerkandl  near  the  aortic bifurcation is the most common extraadrenal site. Two percent of  extraadrenal  pheochromocytomas  occur  in  the  neck  and thorax. Failure of involution of chroma ffi n tissue in childhood is  the  best  explanation  for  the  development  of  extraadrenal pheochromocytomas. Most extraadrenal pheochromocytomas follow a benign course. Malignant pheochromocytomas usually spread via venous and lymphatic channels with a predilection  for  liver  and  bone. Th e  5-year  survival  rate  for  patients with malignancy is 44%. Following resection of benign tumors, 5% to 10% of patients have a benign recurrence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most pheochromocytomas secrete norepinephrine, either alone  or,  more  commonly,  in  combination  with  a  smaller amount of epinephrine in a ratio of 85:15-the inverse of the secretion  ratio  in  the  normal  adrenal  gland.  Approximately 15%  of  tumors  secrete  predominantly  epinephrine.  Some dopamine-secreting pheochromocytomas  have also been described.  Most  pheochromocytomas  are  not  under  neurogenic control and secrete catecholamines autonomously.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  of  pheochromocytoma  is  variable; attacks range from infrequent (i.e., once a month or fewer) to numerous (i.e., many times per day) and may last from less

than  a  minute  to  several  hours. Th ey  may  occur  spontaneously or be precipitated by physical injury, emotional stress, or medications. Hypertension, either continuous or paroxysmal, is  the  most  frequent  manifestation  of  pheochromocytoma. Headache, sweating, pallor, and palpitations are other classic signs and symptoms. Orthostatic hypotension is also a common fi nding and is considered to be secondary to hypovolemia and impaired vasoconstrictor re fl ex responses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic signs depend on the predominant catecholamine  secreted.  With  norepinephrine, α -adrenergic  e ff ects predominate, and patients usually have systolic and diastolic hypertension  and  a  re fl ex  bradycardia.  With  epinephrine, β -adrenergic  e ff ects  predominate,  and  patients  usually  have systolic  hypertension,  diastolic  hypotension,  and  tachycardia. Despite the 10-fold higher levels of circulating catecholamines, the hemodynamics are not greatly di ff erent in patients with  pheochromocytomas  and  in  patients  with  essential hypertension. Both groups have an increased systemic vascular resistance, usually a normal cardiac output, and a slightly decreased plasma volume. Long-term exposure to high levels of catecholamines does not appear to produce hemodynamic responses  characteristic  of  acute  administration.  A  desensitization of the cardiovascular system or a downregulation of adrenergic receptors may explain this fi nding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiomyopathy is a complication of pheochromocytoma. Th e cause appears multifactorial and includes catecholamineinduced  permeability  changes  in  the  sarcolemmal  membranes leading to excess calcium in fl ux, toxicity from oxidized products of catecholamines, and myocardial damage by free radicals. In addition, high catecholamine levels result in coronary vasoconstriction through α -adrenergic pathways, which reduces coronary blood fl ow and potentially creates ischemia. Both dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies, as well as le ft ventricular out fl ow tract obstruction, have been demonstrated echocardiographically. ECG abnormalities may include elevation or depression of the ST segment, fl attening or inversion of T waves, prolongation of the QT interval, high or peaked P  waves,  le ft axis  deviation,  and  arrhythmias. Th e  cardiomyopathy appears reversible if  catecholamine  stimulation  is removed early  before fi brosis  has  occurred.  Distinct  from  a cardiomyopathy,  pheochromocytoma  patients  may  develop cardiac hypertrophy with congestive heart failure secondary to sustained hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  pheochromocytoma  patients  rarely  have  frank diabetes, most have an elevated blood glucose level secondary to catecholamine stimulation of glycogenolysis and inhibition of insulin release.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  a  pheochromocytoma  is  clinically  suspected,  excess catecholamine secretion must be demonstrated. For patients with  a  low  probability  of  having  a  pheochromocytoma,  a 24-hour  urine  collection  for  measurement  of  metanephrines  and  catecholamines  is  a  useful  screening  test.  However, the most sensitive test for patients at high risk (familial pheochromocytoma or classic symptoms) is measurement of plasma-free metanephrines. Catecholamines are metabolized to free metanephrines within tumor cells, and these metabolites are continuously released into the circulation. A plasmafree  normetanephrine  level  higher  than  400  pg/mL  and/or a  metanephrine  level  higher  than  220  pg/mL  con fi rms  the diagnosis  of  pheochromocytoma.  A  pheochromocytoma  is excluded if normetanephrine level is less than 112 pg/mL and metanephrine level is less than 61 pg/mL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Results  are  equivocal  in  5%  to  10%  of  patients,  and  in these  cases,  the  clonidine  suppression  test  may  be  used. Clonidine  is  an α 2 -agonist  that  acts  on  the  central  nervous system to diminish e ff erent sympathetic out fl ow. In patients with a pheochromocytoma, increased plasma catecholamines result  from  tumor  release,  which  bypasses  normal  storage and release mechanisms. Clonidine acts to lower plasma catecholamine levels  in  patients  without  a  pheochromocytoma but  has  no  e ff ect  on  catecholamine  levels  in  patients  with  a pheochromocytoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the past, provocative testing with histamine or tyramine was used to elicit excess catecholamine release from the tumor. However, owing to the relatively high incidence of morbidity, these tests have been abandoned. A glucagon stimulation test is now considered to be the safest and most speci fi c provocative test. Glucagon acts directly on the tumor to induce release of catecholamines. A positive response to the test yields a plasma catecholamine increase of at least three times the baseline values or more than 2000 pg/mL within 1 to 3 minutes of glucagon administration. Th is test should be performed only in patients with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 100 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumor location can be predicted by the pattern of catecholamine  production  (Table  19-7).  CT  detects  more  than  95% of  adrenal  masses larger than 1.0 cm in diameter. MRI o ff ers advantages  over  CT,  including  better  identi fi cation  of  small adrenal lesions, better di ff erentiation of various types of adrenal lesions, no need for intravenous contrast, and lack of radiation exposure. In contrast to CT and MRI, which provide primarily anatomic information, testing with 131 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and  123 I-MIBG provides functional information. MIBG is an analogue of guanethidine, similar in structure to norepinephrine.  It  is  taken  up  by  adrenergic  neurons  and  concentrated in catecholamine-secreting tumors. MIBG is detected by

scintigraphy. MIBG scintigraphy is especially useful in detecting extraadrenal pheochromocytomas and metastatic deposits. CT, MRI, and  131 I-MIBG scintigraphy are complementary studies in localizing pheochromocytomas. Positron emission scanning and selective venous catheterization with sampling of catecholamines  from  the  adrenal  veins  and  other  sites  are  additional useful tests.

Management of Anesthesia

PREOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since most pheochromocytomas secrete predominantly norepinephrine, medical therapy has depended on α -blockade to lower blood pressure, increase intravascular volume, prevent paroxysmal  hypertensive  episodes,  allow  resensitization  of adrenergic  receptors,  and  decrease  myocardial  dysfunction. Although  a  signi fi cantly  reduced  intravascular  volume  may accompany  a  pheochromocytoma,  the  majority  of  patients have a normal or only slightly decreased intravascular volume. α -Blockade  appears  to  protect  myocardial  performance  and tissue oxygenation from the adverse e ff ects of catecholamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phenoxybenzamine  is  the most  frequently prescribed α -blocker  for  preoperative  use.  It  is  a  noncompetitive α 1 -antagonist  with  some α 2 -blocking  properties.  Because  it  is a  noncompetitive  blocker,  it  is  di ffi cult  for  excess  catecholamines to overcome the blockade. Its long duration of action permits  oral  dosing  only  twice  daily. Th e  goal  of  therapy  is normotension, a resolution of symptoms, elimination of STsegment and T-wave changes on the ECG, and elimination of arrhythmias.  Overtreatment  can  result  in  severe  orthostatic hypotension. Th e  optimal duration of α -blockade therapy is undetermined and may range from 3 days to 2 weeks or longer. Because of the prolonged e ff ect of phenoxybenzamine on α -receptors, the recommendation has been to discontinue its use 24 to 48 hours before surgery to avoid vascular unresponsiveness immediately following removal of the tumor. Some anesthesiologists administer only one half to two thirds of the morning dose preceding surgery to address similar concerns. Some surgeons request its discontinuation 48 hours preoperatively so that they can use hypertensive episodes intraoperatively  as  cues  in  localizing  areas  of  metastasis.  Prazosin  and doxazosin,  pure α 1 -competitive  blockers,  are  alternatives  to phenoxybenzamine. Th ey are shorter acting, cause less tachycardia,  and  are  easier  to  titrate  to  a  desired  end  point  than phenoxybenzamine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If tachycardia (i.e., heart rates > 120 beats per minute) or other arrhythmias result a ft er α -blockade with phenoxybenzamine, a β -adrenergic blocker is prescribed. A nonselective β -blocker  should  never  be  administered  before α -blockade, because blockade of vasodilatory β 2 -receptors results in unopposed α -agonism,  leading  to  vasoconstriction  and  hypertensive  crises.  Propranolol,  a  nonselective β -blocker  with  a half-life longer than 4 hours, is most frequently used. Atenolol, metoprolol, and labetalol have also been used successfully. Th e  degree  of α -  and β -blockade provided by labetalol (i.e., β e ff ects exceed α e ff ects) may not be appropriate for certain pheochromocytoma  patients.  In  very  rare  circumstances, β -blockade  may  be  initiated  before α -blockade.  A  patient with a pheochromocytoma secreting solely epinephrine and with coronary artery disease may bene fi t greatly from the β 1 -selective antagonist esmolol. Esmolol has a fast onset and short elimination half-life and can be administered intravenously in the period immediately before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
α -Methylparatyrosine (metyrosine) inhibits the ratelimiting  enzyme  tyrosine  hydroxylase  of  the  catecholamine synthetic pathway and may decrease catecholamine production by 50% to 80%. In combination with phenoxybenzamine, it  has  been  shown  to  facilitate  intraoperative  hemodynamic management. It is especially useful for malignant and inoperable tumors. Side e ff ects, including extrapyramidal reactions and crystalluria, have limited its application.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Calcium  channel  blockers  and  ACE  inhibitors  may  also be  used  to  control  hypertension.  Calcium  is  a  trigger  for catecholamine  release  from  the  tumor,  and  excess  calcium entry  into  myocardial  cells  contributes  to  a  catecholaminemediated  cardiomyopathy.  Nifedipine,  diltiazem,  and  verapamil have all been used to control preoperative hypertension, as has captopril. An α 1 -blocker plus a calcium channel blocker is an e ff ective combination in treatment-resistant cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimal preparation for pheochromocytoma resection involves preoperative administration of an α -adrenergic blocker with or without a β -blocker with or without α -methylparatyrosine, as well as correction of possible hypovolemia. Intraoperative goals include  avoidance  of  drugs  or  maneuvers  that  may  provoke catecholamine release or potentiate catecholamine actions, and maintenance of cardiovascular stability, preferably with shortacting drugs. Hypertension frequently occurs during pneumoperitoneum as well as during tumor manipulation. On the other hand, signi fi cant hypotension may develop following ligation of the tumor's venous drainage. Intraoperative monitoring should include standard plus invasive monitoring methods. An arterial catheter enables monitoring of blood pressure on a beat-to-beat basis. A central venous pressure catheter is usually su ffi cient for patients without cardiac symptoms or other clinical evidence of cardiac involvement. A pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography may be necessary to manage the large fl uid  requirements,  major  volume  shi ft s,  and  possible underlying myocardial dysfunction in patients with very active tumors.  A  large  positive fl uid  balance  is  usually  required  to manage hypotension and keep intravascular volumes within a normal range.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  ultrasonography  can  be  used  to  localize small,  functional  tumors  and  to  perform  adrenal-sparing procedures or partial adrenalectomies. Adrenal-sparing procedures are particularly valuable when bilateral adrenal pheochromocytomas must be removed. Laparoscopy can be used for tumors smaller than 4 to 5 cm and is becoming the surgical approach of choice for many endocrine surgeons.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factors that stimulate catecholamine release such as fear, stress,  pain,  shivering,  hypoxia,  and  hypercarbia  must  be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
minimized  in  the  perioperative  period.  Although  all  anesthetic drugs have been used with some degree of success, certain drugs should theoretically be avoided to prevent possible adverse hemodynamic responses. Morphine and atracurium can  cause  histamine  release,  which  may  provoke  release  of catecholamines from the tumor. Atropine, pancuronium, and succinylcholine are examples of vagolytic or sympathomimetic drugs that may stimulate the sympathetic nervous system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Virtually  all  patients  exhibit  increases  in  systolic  arterial pressure in excess of 200 mm Hg for periods of time intraoperatively irrespective of preoperative initiation of α -blockade. A  number  of  antihypertensive  drugs  must  be  prepared  and ready for immediate administration. Sodium nitroprusside, a direct vasodilator, is the agent of choice because of its potency, immediate onset of action, and short duration of action. Phentolamine, a competitive α -adrenergic blocker and a direct vasodilator,  is  e ff ective,  although  tachyphylaxis  and  tachycardia are associated with its use. Nitroglycerin is e ff ective, but large doses are o ft en required and may cause tachycardia. Labetalol, with more β - than α -blocking properties, is preferred for predominantly epinephrine-secreting tumors. Magnesium sulfate inhibits release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and peripheral nerve terminals, reduces sensitivity of α -receptors to catecholamines, is a direct vasodilator, and is an antiarrhythmic. However, like all antihypertensive medications, it is suboptimal in controlling hypertension during tumor manipulation. Mixtures of antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside, esmolol, diltiazem, and phentolamine have been recommended to control refractory hypertension. Increasing the depth of anesthesia is  also an option, although this approach may accentuate the hypotension accompanying tumor vein ligation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arrhythmias are usually ventricular in origin and are managed  with  either  lidocaine  or β -blockers.  Lidocaine  is  short acting and has minimal negative inotropic action. Although propranolol has been widely used, esmolol, a selective β 1 -blocker,  o ff ers  several  advantages.  Esmolol  has  a  rapid onset and is short acting (i.e., elimination half-life of 9 minutes), which allows adequate control of heart rate; it may also provide  protection  against  catecholamine-induced  ischemia and the development of postoperative hypoglycemia. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic agent that prolongs the duration of the action potential of atrial and ventricular muscle, has been used as an alternative to β -blockers to treat supraventricular tachycardia associated with hypercatecholaminemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension  following  tumor  vein  ligation  is  usually  signi fi cant  and  occurs  secondary  to  a  combination  of  factors, including an immediate decrease in plasma catecholamine levels (half-lives of norepinephrine and epinephrine are approximately 1 to 2 minutes), vasodilation from residual α -blockade with phenoxybenzamine, intraoperative fl uid and blood loss, and increased anesthetic depth. Hypotension with systolic pressures in the 70- to 79-mm Hg range is not infrequent. To prevent precipitous  hypotension,  volume  expansion  to  a  pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 to 18 mm Hg should be attained before  tumor  vein  ligation.  Lactated  Ringer's  solution  and physiologic saline are the recommended fl uids for use before tumor removal. Vasopressors and inotropes should be viewed as  a  secondary  treatment  modality.  Residual α -adrenergic blockade and downregulation of receptors make patients relatively less responsive to vasopressors. Intraoperative administration of blood salvage products has resulted in postresection hypertension  secondary  to  the  catecholamine  content  of  the blood. A decrease in anesthetic depth will also aid in controlling  hypotension.  With  a  decrease  in  plasma  catecholamine levels immediately following resection, insulin levels increase and hypoglycemia may occur. Th erefore, dextrose-containing solutions should be added a ft er tumor removal. Glucocorticoid therapy should be administered if a bilateral adrenalectomy is performed or if hypoadrenalism is a possibility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority  of  patients  become  normotensive  following complete  tumor  resection.  However,  plasma  catecholamine levels do not return to normal until 7 to 10 days a ft er surgery because of a slow release of stored catecholamines from peripheral nerves. Fi ft y percent of patients are hypertensive for several days a ft er surgery, and 25% to 30% of patients remain hypertensive inde fi nitely. In these patients, hypertension is sustained rather  than  paroxysmal,  lower  than  before  surgery,  and  not accompanied by the classic features of hypercatecholaminemia. Th e di ff erential diagnosis of persistent hypertension includes a missed pheochromocytoma, surgical complications with subsequent renal ischemia, and underlying essential hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension  is  the  most  frequent  cause  of  death  in  the period immediately a ft er surgery. Large volumes of fl uid are necessary since the peripheral vasculature is poorly responsive  to  reduced  levels  of  catecholamines.  Vasopressors  are  a secondary  consideration.  Steroid  supplementation  may  be necessary if hypoadrenalism is present. Dextrose-containing solutions should be included as part of the fl uid therapy, and plasma glucose levels should be monitored for 24 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ADRENAL GLAND DYSFUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each adrenal gland consists of two components, the adrenal cortex and the adrenal medulla. Th e adrenal cortex is responsible for the synthesis of three groups of hormones classi fi ed as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), and androgens. Corticotropin (ACTH) is secreted by the anterior pituitary  gland  in  response  to  corticotropin-releasing  hormone (CRH), which is synthesized in the hypothalamus and carried to the anterior pituitary in the portal blood. ACTH stimulates the  adrenal  cortex  to  produce  cortisol.  Maintenance  of  systemic blood pressure by cortisol re fl ects the importance of this hormone in facilitating conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla. Hyperglycemia in response to  cortisol  secretion  re fl ects  gluconeogenesis  and  inhibition of the peripheral use of glucose by cells. Retention of sodium and  excretion  of  potassium  are  facilitated  by  cortisol. Th e antiin fl ammatory e ff ects of cortisol and other glucocorticoids (cortisone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, triamcinolone)  are  particularly  apparent  in  the  presence  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
396

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
high  serum  concentrations  of  these  hormones.  Aldosterone secretion is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and the serum concentrations of potassium. Aldosterone regulates the extracellular fl uid volume by promoting resorption of sodium by the renal tubules. In addition, aldosterone promotes renal tubular excretion of potassium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e adrenal medulla is a specialized part of the sympathetic nervous system that is capable of synthesizing norepinephrine and epinephrine. Th e only important disease process associated with the adrenal medulla is pheochromocytoma. Adrenal medullary insu ffi ciency is not known to occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is one of the most potent and best-studied activators  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  (HPA)  axis. Th e degree of activation of the axis depends on the magnitude and duration of surgery and the type and depth of anesthesia. In patients with an intact, normally functioning HPA axis, CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels all increase signi fi cantly during surgery. Deep general anesthesia or regional anesthesia blunts but does  not  eliminate  this  response.  Increases  in  ACTH  begin with  surgical  incision  and  remain  elevated  during  surgery, with the peak level occurring with pharmacologic reversal of muscle relaxants and extubation of the patient at the end of the procedure. Hormone levels remain elevated for several days postoperatively.  During  major  surgery,  cortisol  release  may increase from a preoperative level of 15 to 25 mg/day to 75 to 150 mg/day, which results in a plasma cortisol level of 30 to 50 mcg/dL. An uncomplicated cholecystectomy in an otherwise healthy patient will result in a plasma cortisol level of 27 to 34 mcg/dL 30 minutes a ft er incision and 46 to 49 mcg/dL 5 hours a ft er  surgery.  Patients  in  the  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  may have plasma cortisol levels of more than 60 mcg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercortisolism (Cushing's Syndrome)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cushing's syndrome is divided into two forms: ACTH dependent and ACTH independent. In ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome, inappropriately high plasma ACTH concentrations stimulate the adrenal cortex to produce excessive amounts of cortisol. Th e ACTH-independent variant is caused by excessive production of cortisol by abnormal adrenocortical tissue that is not regulated by secretion of CRH and ACTH. In this latter form of Cushing's syndrome, CRH and ACTH levels are actually suppressed. Th e term Cushing's disease is reserved for Cushing's syndrome caused by excessive secretion of ACTH by pituitary ACTH tumors (microadenomas). Th ese microadenomas account for nearly 70% of cases of ACTH-  dependent Cushing's  syndrome.  Acute  ectopic  ACTH  syndrome  is another form of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and is most o ft en associated with small cell lung carcinoma. Benign or  malignant  adrenocortical  tumors  are  the  most  common cause of ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  no  pathognomonic  signs  or  symptoms  that  confi rm the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. Th e most common symptom is the relatively sudden onset of weight gain, which is usually central and o ft en accompanied by thickening of the facial fat, which rounds the facial contour (moon facies), and a fl orid  complexion  resulting  from  telangiectasias.  Systemic hypertension, glucose intolerance, oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in premenopausal women, decreased libido in men, and spontaneous  ecchymoses  are  frequent  concomitant fi ndings. Skeletal  muscle  wasting  and  weakness  manifest  as  di ffi culty climbing stairs. Depression and insomnia are o ft en present. Th e diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is con fi rmed by demonstrating cortisol hypersecretion based on 24-hour urinary secretion of cortisol. Determining whether a patient's hypercortisolism is  ACTH dependent or ACTH independent requires reliable measurements  of  plasma  ACTH  using  immunoradiometric assays. Th e  high-dose  dexamethasone  suppression  test  distinguishes  Cushing's  disease  from  ectopic  ACTH  syndrome (presence of complete resistance). Imaging procedures provide no information about adrenal cortex function and are useful only for determining the location of a tumor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  treatment  of  choice  for  patients  with  Cushing's  disease is  transsphenoidal  microadenomectomy  if  a  clearly  circumscribed microadenoma can be identi fi ed and is amenable to resection.  Alternatively,  patients  may  undergo  85%  to  90% resection  of  the  anterior  pituitary.  Pituitary  irradiation  and bilateral total adrenalectomy are necessary in some patients. Surgical  removal  of  the  adrenal  gland  is  the  treatment  for adrenal adenoma or carcinoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with hypercortisolism must consider the physiologic e ff ects of excessive cortisol secretion  (Table  19-8).  Preoperative  evaluation  of  systemic  blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and blood glucose concentration are especially important. Osteoporosis is a consideration when positioning patients for the operative procedure. Th e choice of drugs for preoperative medication, induction of anesthesia, and maintenance of anesthesia is not in fl uenced by the presence of hypercortisolism. Etomidate may transiently decrease the synthesis and release of cortisol by the adrenal cortex. Doses of muscle relaxants should probably be decreased initially in view of the skeletal muscle weakness that frequently accompanies hypercortisolism.  In  addition,  the  presence  of  hypokalemia may in fl uence responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 19 ENDOCRINE DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
397

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical ventilation  of  the  patient's  lungs  during  surgery is  recommended, because skeletal muscle weakness, with or without co-existing hypokalemia, may decrease the strength of the muscles of breathing. Regional anesthesia is acceptable, but the likely presence of osteoporosis, with possible vertebral body collapse, is a consideration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plasma cortisol concentrations decrease promptly a ft er microadenomectomy  or  bilateral  adrenalectomy,  and  replacement therapy is recommended. In this regard, a continuous infusion of cortisol (100 mg/day IV) may be initiated intraoperatively. Likewise, patients with metastatic disease involving the adrenal glands may develop acute adrenal insu ffi ciency, which requires the initiation of supplemental therapy. Transient diabetes insipidus and meningitis may also occur a ft er microadenomectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  hyperaldosteronism  (Conn's  syndrome)  is  present when there is excess secretion of aldosterone from a functional tumor  (aldosteronoma)  that  acts  independently  of  a  physiologic stimulus. Aldosteronomas occur more o ft en in women than in men and only rarely in children. Occasionally, primary aldosteronism  is  associated  with  pheochromocytoma,  primary hyperparathyroidism, or acromegaly. Secondary hyperaldosteronism  is  present  when  increased  circulating  serum concentrations  of  renin,  as  are  associated  with  renovascular hypertension,  stimulate  the  release  of  aldosterone.  Aldosteronism associated with Bartter's syndrome (hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular  apparatus)  is  not  accompanied  by  systemic hypertension. Th e  prevalence  of  primary  aldosteronism  in patients with essential hypertension appears to be less than 1%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  primary  aldosteronism  are nonspeci fi c,  and  some  patients  are  completely  asymptomatic. Symptoms may re fl ect systemic hypertension (headache) or hypokalemia (polyuria, nocturia, skeletal muscle cramps, skeletal muscle weakness). Systemic hypertension (diastolic blood pressure is o ft en 100 to 125 mm Hg) is a function of aldosterone-induced sodium retention and increase in extracellular fl uid volume. Th is hypertension  may  be  resistant  to  treatment.  Aldosterone  promotes renal excretion of potassium, which results in hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Increased urinary excretion of potassium (more than 30 mEq/day) in the presence of hypokalemia suggests primary aldosteronism. Hypokalemic nephropathy can result in polyuria and loss of urine-concentrating ability. Skeletal muscle weakness is presumed to re fl ect hypokalemia. Hypomagnesemia and abnormal glucose tolerance may also be present.

DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous hypokalemia in patients with systemic hypertension is highly suggestive of aldosteronism. Plasma renin activity is suppressed in almost all patients with untreated primary aldosteronism and in many with essential hypertension; with secondary  aldosteronism,  however,  the  plasma  renin  activity  is  high.  A  plasma  aldosterone  concentration  of  less  than

<!-- PAGE=? -->
9.5  ng/dL  at  the  end  of  a  saline  infusion  rules  out  primary aldosteronism.  A  syndrome  exhibiting  all  the  features  of hyperaldosteronism (systemic hypertension, hypokalemia, suppression of the renin-angiotensin system) may result from long-term ingestion of licorice (glycyrrhizic acid).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial treatment of hyperaldosteronism consists of potassium supplementation and administration of a competitive aldosterone antagonist such as spironolactone. Skeletal muscle weakness resulting from hypokalemia may require treatment with intravenous potassium. Systemic hypertension is treated with antihypertensive drugs. Accentuation of hypokalemia caused by drug-induced diuresis is decreased by use of a potassiumsparing diuretic such as triamterene. De fi nitive treatment for an aldosterone-secreting tumor is surgical excision. Bilateral adrenalectomy  may  be  necessary  if  multiple  aldosteronesecreting tumors are found.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for the surgical treatment of hyperaldosteronism  is  facilitated  by  preoperative  correction  of hypokalemia and treatment of systemic hypertension. Persistence of hypokalemia may modify responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Intraoperative hyperventilation of the patient's  lungs  can  decrease  the  plasma  potassium  concentration and should be avoided. Inhaled or injected drugs are acceptable for maintenance of anesthesia. Th e use of sevo fl urane  is  questionable,  however,  if  hypokalemic  nephropathy and polyuria are present preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurement of cardiac fi lling  pressures  via  a  right  atrial or pulmonary artery catheter may be useful during surgery for adequate evaluation of the intravascular fl uid volume and the response to intravenous infusion of fl uids. Indeed, aggressive preoperative preparation can convert the excessive intravascular fl uid volume status of these patients to unexpected hypovolemia, manifesting as hypotension in response to administration of vasodilating anesthetic drugs, positive pressure ventilation, changes in body position, or surgical blood loss. Th e detection of orthostatic hypotension during the preoperative evaluation is a clue to underlying hypovolemia. Acid-base status and plasma electrolyte concentrations should be measured frequently.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplementation with exogenous cortisol is probably unnecessary for surgical excision of a solitary adenoma in the adrenal cortex. Bilateral mobilization of the adrenal glands to excise  multiple  functional  tumors,  however,  may  introduce the need for exogenous cortisol administration. A continuous intravenous infusion of cortisol, 100 mg every 24 hours, may be initiated on an empirical basis if transient hypocortisolism resulting from surgical manipulation is a consideration.

metabolic  acidosis  is  a  predictable fi nding  in  the  presence of  hypoaldosteronism.  Heart  block  secondary  to  hyperkalemia, orthostatic hypotension, and hyponatremia may also be present.

Isolated  de fi ciency  of  aldosterone  secretion  may  re fl ect congenital de fi ciency of aldosterone synthetase or hyporeninemia resulting from defects in the juxtaglomerular apparatus or treatment with ACE inhibitors leading to loss of angiotensin stimulation. Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism typically occurs in patients older than 45 years of age with chronic renal disease and/or diabetes mellitus. Indomethacin-induced prostaglandin  de fi ciency  is  a  reversible  cause  of  this  syndrome. Treatment  of  hypoaldosteronism  includes  liberal  sodium intake and daily administration of fl udrocortisone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adrenal Insufficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are two types of adrenal insu ffi ciency (AI): primary and secondary. In primary disease (Addison's disease), the adrenal glands are unable to elaborate su ffi cient quantities of  glucocorticoid,  mineralocorticoid,  and  androgen  hormones. Th e most common cause of this rare endocrinopathy is  bilateral  adrenal  destruction  from  autoimmune  disease. More than 90% of the glands must be involved before signs of  AI  appear. Th e  insidious  onset  of  Addison's  disease  is characterized  by  fatigue,  weakness,  anorexia,  nausea  and vomiting, cutaneous and mucosal hyperpigmentation, hypovolemia,  hyponatremia,  and  hyperkalemia.  Secondary  AI results from a failure in the production of CRH or ACTH caused by hypothalamic-pituitary disease or suppression of the  hypothalamic-pituitary  axis.  Unlike  in  Addison's  disease, there is only a glucocorticoid de fi ciency in secondary disease. In the majority of cases the cause is iatrogenic, such as  pituitary  surgery,  pituitary  irradiation,  or  most  commonly the use of synthetic glucocorticoids. Th ese  patients lack  cutaneous  hyperpigmentation  and  may  demonstrate only mild   electrolyte abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cortisol  is  one  of  the  few  hormones  essential  for  life.  It participates  in  carbohydrate  and  protein  metabolism,  fatty acid  mobilization,  electrolyte  and  water  balance,  and  the antiin fl ammatory response. It facilitates catecholamine synthesis and action; modulates β -receptor synthesis, regulation, coupling,  and  responsiveness;  and  contributes  to  normal vascular  permeability,  tone,  and  cardiac  contractility.  Cortisol accounts for 95% of the adrenal gland's glucocorticoid activity, with corticosterone and cortisone contributing some activity.  Estimated  daily  cortisol  secretion  is  the  equivalent of  15  to  25  mg/day  of  hydrocortisone  or  5  to  7  mg/day  of prednisone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e classic de fi nition of AI includes a baseline plasma cortisol concentration of less than 20 mcg/dL and a cortisol level of  less  than  20  mcg/dL  a ft er  ACTH  stimulation. Th e  short 250-mcg ACTH stimulation test is a reliable test of the integrity of  the  entire  HPA  axis.  All  steroids  except  dexamethasone must be discontinued for 24 hours before testing. Cortisol levels are measured at 30 and 60 minutes following the administration of ACTH. A normal ACTH stimulation test result is a plasma cortisol level greater than 25 mcg/dL. A positive test fi nding demonstrates a poor response to ACTH and indicates an impairment of the adrenal cortex. Absolute AI is characterized by a low baseline cortisol level and a positive result on the ACTH stimulation test. Relative AI is indicated when the baseline cortisol level is higher but the result on the ACTH stimulation test is positive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most common cause of AI is exogenous steroids (Table 19-9). Patients are prescribed steroids to treat a number of illnesses,  including  arthritis,  bronchial  asthma,  malignancies, allergies,  collagen  vascular  diseases,  and  in fl ammatory conditions. Th ose who take steroids long term may exhibit signs and symptoms of AI during periods of stress, such as surgery or acute illness. For patients with a history of long-term steroid use, it may take 6 to 12 months from the time of discontinuation of the steroids for the adrenal glands to recover full function.  Recovery  from  short  courses  of  steroids  may  take several days. For example, prednisone 25 mg PO twice daily for 5 days results in a reduced response to exogenous ACTH for 5 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  glucocorticoid  coverage  should  be  provided for  patients  with  a  positive  result  on  the  ACTH  stimulation test, Cushing's syndrome, or AI as well as for those at risk of HPA  axis  suppression  or  AI  based  on  prior  glucocorticoid therapy. Adrenal suppression is much more common than AI and is of concern because overt AI, although uncommon, may occur under the stressful conditions of surgery and anesthesia. Patients taking prednisone in dosages of less than 5 mg/ day (morning dose) for any length of time, even years, do not demonstrate clinically  signi fi cant  HPA axis suppression and do not require perioperative supplementation, although they should  receive  their  normal  daily  steroid  dose.  Any  patient who received a glucocorticoid in dosages equivalent to more than 20 mg/day of prednisone for more than 3 weeks within the previous year is at risk of AI and should receive perioperative supplementation. Patients receiving dosages of steroids between  these  two  extremes  may  have  HPA  axis  suppression and should probably receive supplementation. Similarly, patients  receiving  more  than  2  g/day  of  topical  steroids  or more than 0.8 mg/day of inhaled steroids on a long-term basis should probably receive supplementation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with known or suspected adrenal suppression or AI should receive their baseline steroid therapy plus supplementation  in  the  perioperative  period.  Supplementation  is individualized  based  on  the  surgery  (Table  19-10).  When more  than  100  mg/day  of  hydrocortisone  is  administered, it  may  be  wise  to  consider  substituting  methylprednisolone  for  hydrocortisone;  given  its  lower  mineralocorticoid activity, it is less likely to cause fl uid retention, edema, and hypokalemia.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute AI should be considered in the di ff erential diagnosis of hemodynamic instability, especially in patients unresponsive to the usual therapeutic interventions. Th erapy includes treatment  of  the  cause,  repletion  of  circulating  glucocorticoids, and replacement of water and sodium de fi cits. Glucocorticoid replacement may include intravenous hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, or dexamethasone. If ACTH stimulation testing will be required to assist in establishing a diagnosis of primary or secondary disease, dexamethasone is preferred because it does not alter cortisol levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A bolus  of  100  mg  of  hydrocortisone  followed  by  a  continuous infusion at 10 mg/hr is a recommended prescription. A  100-mg  bolus  of  hydrocortisone  every  6  hours  is  also  an acceptable option. Continuous infusion has the advantage of maintaining  the  plasma  cortisol  concentration  at  stress  levels greater than 830 nmol/L (30 mcg/dL). When the patient's condition stabilizes, the steroid dosage is reduced with eventual  conversion  to  an  oral  preparation.  Volume  de fi cits  may be substantial (2 to 3 L), and 5% dextrose in normal saline is the fl uid of choice. Hemodynamic support with vasopressors may be necessary. Metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia usually resolve with fl uid and steroid administration. In primary disease,  administration  of  the  mineralocorticoid fl udrocortisone is not necessary acutely because isotonic saline replaces sodium loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No speci fi c anesthetic agent(s) and/or technique(s) are recommended in managing patients with or at risk of AI. However,  etomidate  inhibits  the  synthesis  of  cortisol  transiently and  should  be  avoided  in  this  patient  population.  Patients with untreated AI undergoing emergency surgery should be managed aggressively with invasive monitoring, intravenous corticosteroids, and fl uid and electrolyte resuscitation. Minimal doses of anesthetic agents and drugs are recommended, since myocardial depression and skeletal muscle weakness are frequently part of the clinical presentation.

INTENSIVE CARE UNIT MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AI is a common and underdiagnosed entity among critically ill  patients.  Patients  at  risk  include  those  with  infection  and systemic in fl ammation from tuberculosis, meningococcemia, human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV) infection, sepsis, and/ or  di ff use  intravascular  coagulation. Th e  incidence  of  AI  in high-risk,  critically  ill  patients  with  hypotension,  shock,  and sepsis  is  approximately  30%  to  40%.  Approximately  33%  of HIV-infected patients admitted to the ICU have AI, most likely caused  by  high  levels  of  cytokines  (interleukin-1,  interleukin-6, interferonα ) and in fl ammatory peptides that impair the response of pituitary cells and inhibit the HPA axis. Cytokines also  cause  glucocorticoid  resistance  by  impairing  glucocorticoid receptor binding a ffi nity. Hypotension is a common presentation, and hydrocortisone is required to maintain vascular tone, endothelial cell integrity, normal vascular permeability, β -receptor function, and catecholamine synthesis and action.

All  patients  suspected  of  having  AI  should  be  tested  for serum cortisol concentration and undergo an ACTH stimulation test, especially if the stress level in uncertain. Free serum cortisol level, not total cortisol level, o ff ers a better re fl ection of the HPA axis in critically ill patients with hypoproteinemia. With  the  exception  of  patients  with  vasopressor-dependent shock, signi fi cant doses of glucocorticoids should be reserved for patients with proven AI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of physiologic doses of glucocorticoids has been shown to confer survival advantage in patients with septic  shock. Hydrocortisone dosages of 200 to 300 mg/day for a minimum of 5 to 7 days followed by a 5- to 7-day taper are commonly employed. Additional studies are needed to determine whether physiologic glucocorticoid dosages are bene fi -cial to septic patients without shock or patients with shock but not vasopressor dependence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PARATHYROID GLAND DYSFUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e four parathyroid glands are located behind the upper and lower  poles  of  the  thyroid  gland  and  produce  parathyroid hormone,  a  polypeptide  hormone.  Parathyroid  hormone  is released into the systemic circulation by a negative feedback mechanism that depends on the plasma calcium concentration.  Hypocalcemia  stimulates  the  release  of  parathyroid hormone, whereas hypercalcemia suppresses both hormonal synthesis and release. Parathyroid hormone maintains normal plasma calcium concentrations (4.5 to 5.5 mEq/L) by promoting  the  movement  of  calcium  across  three  interfaces  represented by the gastrointestinal tract, renal tubules, and bone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperparathyroidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperparathyroidism is present when the secretion of parathyroid hormone is increased. Serum calcium concentrations may  be  increased,  decreased,  or  unchanged.  Hyperparathyroidism is classi fi ed as primary, secondary, or ectopic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  hyperparathyroidism  results  from  excessive  secretion  of  parathyroid  hormone  due  to  a  benign  parathyroid adenoma, carcinoma of  a  parathyroid  gland,  or  hyperplasia of  one  or  more  parathyroid  glands.  A  benign  parathyroid adenoma is responsible for primary hyperparathyroidism in approximately 90% of patients; carcinoma is responsible for fewer than 5% of cases. Hyperplasia usually involves all four parathyroid glands, although not all glands may be enlarged to the same degree. Hyperparathyroidism resulting from an adenoma or hyperplasia is the most common presenting symptom of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type I.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia (serum calcium concentration >5.5 mEq/L and ionized calcium concentration >2.5 mEq/L) is the hallmark  of  primary  hyperparathyroidism.  Primary  hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the general population, whereas cancer is the most common cause in hospitalized patients. Modest increases in plasma calcium concentrations  discovered  incidentally  in  otherwise  asymptomatic patients are most likely due to parathyroid adenomas, whereas marked hypercalcemia (>7.5 mEq/L) is more likely due to cancer. Use of automated methods to measure serum calcium  concentrations  has  detected  primary  hyperparathyroidism in a surprisingly large number of individuals, especially  postmenopausal women. Patients in surgical ICUs for prolonged periods of time may develop hypercalcemia, which may  re fl ect  increased  secretion  of  parathyroid  hormone  in response to repeated episodes of hypocalcemia resulting from sepsis,  shock,  and/or  blood  transfusions.  Urinary  excretion of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate  (cAMP)  is  increased  in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Measurement of serum parathyroid hormone concentrations is not always suffi ciently reliable to con fi rm the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypercalcemia  is  responsible  for  the  broad  spectrum  of signs and symptoms that accompany primary hyperparathyroidism (Table 19-11). Symptoms due to hypercalcemia re fl ect changes  in  the  ionized  calcium  concentration,  which  is  the physiologically active form of calcium and represents approximately 45% of the total serum calcium concentration. Th e ionized serum calcium concentration is dependent on arterial pH and the plasma albumin concentration. For this reason, it is preferable to measure ionized calcium concentrations directly using an ion-speci fi c electrode.

Early signs and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism and associated hypercalcemia include sedation and vomiting.

Skeletal  muscle  weakness  and  hypotonia  are  frequent  complaints and may be so severe as to suggest the presence of myasthenia gravis. Loss of skeletal muscle strength and mass is most notable in the proximal musculature of the lower extremities. Th is skeletal muscle weakness is a neuropathy (muscle biopsy specimens resemble those in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and not a myopathy. Loss of sensation for pain and vibration may also be present. Th e cause of the neuropathy is unclear, but it is not related to hypercalcemia; it is reversible, because skeletal muscle strength o ft en improves following surgical removal of excess parathyroid hormone-producing tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Persistent increases in plasma calcium concentrations can interfere with urine concentrating ability, and polyuria results. Oliguric renal failure can occur in advanced cases of hypercalcemia. Renal stones, especially in the presence of polyuria and  polydipsia,  must  arouse  suspicion  of  primary  hyperparathyroidism. Increased serum chloride concentration (>102 mEq/L) is most likely due to the in fl uence of parathyroid hormone on renal excretion of bicarbonate, which produces a mild metabolic acidosis. Anemia, even in the absence of renal dysfunction, is a consequence of primary hyperparathyroidism. Peptic ulcer disease is frequent and may re fl ect potentiation of gastric acid secretion by calcium. Acute and chronic pancreatitis are associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. Even in the absence of peptic ulcer disease or pancreatitis, the abdominal  pain  that  o ft en  accompanies  hypercalcemia  can mimic an acute surgical abdomen. Systemic hypertension is common, and the ECG may reveal a prolonged PR interval, whereas the QT interval is o ft en shortened. When the serum calcium concentration exceeds 8 mEq/L, cardiac conduction disturbances are likely. Th e classic skeletal consequence of primary hyperparathyroidism is  osteitis fi brosa  cystica.  Radiographic evidence of skeletal involvement includes generalized osteopenia, subcortical bone resorption in the phalanges and distal ends of the clavicles, and the appearance of bone cysts. Bone pain and pathologic fractures may be present.

In addition, patients may exhibit de fi cits  of  memory and cerebration, with or without personality changes or mood disturbances, including hallucinations.

Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary hyperparathyroidism and the associated hypercalcemia are treated initially by medical means followed by de fi nitive surgical removal of the diseased or abnormal portions of the parathyroid glands.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical  Management. Saline  infusion  (150  mL/hr)  is  the basic treatment for all patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia. Intravascular fl uid volume may be depleted by vomiting, polyuria, and urinary loss of sodium. Th e calcium-lowering e ff ect of saline hydration alone is limited, and it is o ft en necessary to add loop diuretics (furosemide 40 to 80 mg IV every 2 to 4 hours) to the therapeutic regimen. Loop diuretics inhibit sodium (and therefore calcium) reabsorption in the proximal loop of Henle. Th e goal is a daily urine output of 3 to 5 L. Addition of loop diuretics to saline hydration increases calcium excretion only if the saline infusion is adequate to restore the intravascular fl uid volume necessary for delivery of calcium to the renal tubules. Th iazide diuretics are not administered for treatment of hypercalcemia, because these drugs may enhance renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Central venous pressure monitoring may be useful for guiding fl uid replacement in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bisphosphonates such as disodium etidronate administered intravenously are the drugs of choice for the treatment of lifethreatening hypercalcemia. Th ese drugs bind to hydroxyapatite in bone and act as potent inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption.  Hemodialysis  can  also  be  used  to  lower  serum calcium  concentrations  promptly,  as  can  calcitonin,  but  the e ff ects  of  this  hormone  are  transient.  Mithramycin  inhibits the  osteoclastic  activity  of  parathyroid  hormone,  producing prompt lowering of serum calcium concentrations. Th e toxic e ff ects  of  mithramycin  (thrombocytopenia,  hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity), however, limit its use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  Management. De fi nitive  treatment  of  primary hyperparathyroidism  is  surgical  removal  of  the  diseased  or abnormal portions of the parathyroid glands. Successful surgical treatment is re fl ected by normalization of serum calcium concentrations within 3 to 4 days and a decrease in the urinary  excretion  of  cAMP .  Postoperatively,  the fi rst  potential complication  is  hypocalcemic  tetany. Th e  hypomagnesemia that occurs postoperatively aggravates the hypocalcemia and renders it refractory to treatment. Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis,  in  association  with  deterioration  of  renal  function, may occur transiently a ft er parathyroidectomy. Acute arthritis may also occur following parathyroidectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  any  speci fi c  anesthetic  drugs  or techniques are necessary in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing elective surgical treatment. Maintenance of hydration and urine output is important in perioperative management  of  hypercalcemia.  Careful  positioning  of  hyperparathyroid patients is necessary because of the likely presence of osteoporosis and the associated vulnerability to pathologic fractures. Th e existence of somnolence before induction of anesthesia introduces the possibility that intraoperative anesthetic requirements  could  be  decreased.  Owing  to  its  psychotropic  e ff ects, ketamine  is  an  unlikely  selection  in  patients  with  co-existing personality  changes  attributed  to  chronic  hypercalcemia. Th e possibility  of  co-existing  renal  dysfunction  is  a  consideration in  the  use  of  sevo fl urane, because impaired urine concentrating  ability  associated  with  polyuria  and  hypercalcemia  could be  confused  with  anesthetic-induced fl uoride  nephrotoxicity. Co-existing skeletal muscle weakness suggests the possibility of decreased requirements for muscle relaxants, whereas hypercalcemia might be expected to antagonize the e ff ects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. In view of the unpredictable response to muscle relaxants, it is advisable to decrease the initial dose of these drugs and titrate subsequent doses to e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
that the QT interval may not be a reliable index of changes in  serum  calcium  concentrations  during  anesthesia. Th eoretically, hyperventilation of the lungs is undesirable, because respiratory alkalosis lowers serum potassium concentrations and  leaves  the  actions  of  calcium  unopposed.  Nevertheless, since it lowers levels of the ionized fractions of calcium, alkalosis could also be bene fi cial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Secondary hyperparathyroidism re fl ects an appropriate compensatory  response  of  the  parathyroid  glands  to  counteract a  disease  process  that  produces  hypocalcemia.  For  example, chronic  renal  disease  impairs  elimination  of  phosphorus and  decreases  hydroxylation  of  vitamin  D,  which  results  in hypocalcemia and compensatory hyperplasia of the parathyroid  glands  with  increased  release  of  parathyroid  hormone. Because  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  is  adaptive  rather than autonomous, it seldom produces hypercalcemia. Treatment  of  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  is  directed  at  controlling the underlying disease, as is achieved by normalizing serum phosphate concentrations in patients with renal disease by administering an oral phosphate binder.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On  occasion,  transient  hypercalcemia  may  follow  otherwise  successful  renal  transplantation. Th is  response  re fl ects the inability of previously hyperactive parathyroid glands to adapt quickly to normal renal excretion of calcium and phosphorus and to hydroxylation of vitamin D. Th e  parathyroid glands usually return to normal size and function with time, although parathyroidectomy is occasionally necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ECTOPIC HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ectopic hyperparathyroidism (humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, pseudohyperparathyroidism) is due to secretion of  parathyroid  hormone  (or  a  substance  with  similar  endocrine  e ff ects)  by  tissues  other  than  the  parathyroid  glands. Carcinoma of the lung, breast, pancreas, or kidney and lymphoproliferative disease are most commonly associated with ectopic  parathyroid  hormone  secretion.  Ectopic  hyperparathyroidism is more likely than primary hyperparathyroidism to  be  associated  with  anemia  and  increased  plasma  alkaline phosphatase concentrations. A role for prostaglandins in the production  of  hypercalcemia  in  these  patients  is  suggested by  the  calcium-lowering  e ff ects  produced  by  indomethacin, which is an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoparathyroidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoparathyroidism  is  present  when  secretion  of  parathyroid hormone is absent or de fi cient or peripheral tissues are resistant to the e ff ects of the hormone (Table 19-12). Absence or  de fi ciency  of  parathyroid  hormone  is  almost  always  iatrogenic,  re fl ecting  inadvertent  removal  of  the  parathyroid glands, as during thyroidectomy. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is  a  congenital  disorder  in  which  the  release  of  parathyroid hormone is intact, but the kidneys are unable to respond to the hormone. A ff ected patients manifest mental retardation,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measurements of serum calcium concentration and the ionized fraction of calcium are the most valuable diagnostic indicators for  hypoparathyroidism.  A  serum  calcium  concentration  of less than 4.5 mEq/L and an ionized calcium concentration of less than 2.0 mEq/L are indicative of hypoparathyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms  of  hypoparathyroidism  depend  on  the rapidity  of  the  onset  of  hypocalcemia.  Acute  hypocalcemia can occur a ft er accidental removal of the parathyroid glands during  thyroidectomy  and  is  likely  to  manifest  as  perioral paresthesias, restlessness, and neuromuscular irritability, as  evidenced by a positive Chvostek sign or Trousseau sign. Inspiratory  stridor  re fl ects  neuromuscular  irritability  of  the intrinsic laryngeal musculature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  hypocalcemia  is  associated  with  complaints  of fatigue  and  skeletal  muscle  cramps  that  may  be  associated with  a  prolonged  QT  interval  on  the  ECG. Th e  QRS  complex, PR interval, and cardiac rhythm usually remain normal. Neurologic changes include lethargy, cerebration de fi cits, and personality changes reminiscent of those occurring in hyperparathyroidism.  Chronic  hypocalcemia  is  associated  with formation  of  cataracts,  calci fi cation  involving  the  subcutaneous tissues and basal ganglia, and thickening of the skull. Chronic renal failure is  the  most  common cause of chronic hypocalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  acute  hypocalcemia  consists  of  an  infusion  of calcium (10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate or 10 mL of 10% calcium  chloride  IV)  until  signs  of  neuromuscular  irritability  disappear.  Correction  of  any  co-existing  respiratory  or

metabolic alkalosis is  indicated.  For  treatment  of  hypoparathyroidism  not  complicated  by  symptomatic  hypocalcemia, the approach is oral administration of calcium and vitamin D. An exogenous parathyroid hormone replacement preparation practical for clinical use is not yet available. Th iazide diuretics may be useful, because these drugs cause sodium depletion without proportional potassium excretion and thereby tend to increase serum calcium concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of hypocalcemia is designed to prevent any further decrease in the serum calcium concentration and to treat the adverse e ff ects of hypocalcemia, particularly those involving the heart. In this regard, it is important to avoid iatrogenic hyperventilation, because it will further aggravate the clinical picture. Routine administration of whole blood containing citrate usually does not decrease serum calcium concentrations, because calcium is rapidly mobilized from body stores. Ionized calcium concentrations can be decreased, however, when infusions of blood are rapid (500 mL every 5 to 10 minutes, as during cardiopulmonary bypass or liver transplantation) or when metabolism or elimination of citrate is impaired by hypothermia, cirrhosis of the liver, or renal dysfunction.

PITUITARY GLAND DYSFUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e pituitary gland, located in the sella turcica at the base of the brain, consists of the anterior pituitary and posterior pituitary. Th e anterior pituitary secretes six hormones under the control of the hypothalamus (Table 19-13). Th e hypothalamus controls the function of the anterior pituitary by means of vascular connections (hormones travel via the hypophyseal portal veins to reach the  anterior  pituitary). Th e  hypothalamic-anterior  pituitarytarget organ axis is composed of tightly coordinated systems in which hormonal signals from the hypothalamus stimulate or inhibit secretion of anterior pituitary hormones, which in turn act on target organs and modulate hypothalamic and anterior pituitary activity (closed-loop, negative feedback system). Th e posterior pituitary is composed of terminal neuron endings that originate in the hypothalamus. Vasopressin (ADH) and oxytocin are synthesized in the hypothalamus and are subsequently transported along the hypothalamic neuronal axons for storage in the posterior pituitary. Th e stimulus for the release of these hormones from the posterior pituitary arises from osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus that sense plasma osmolarity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overproduction  of  anterior  pituitary  hormones  is  most o ft en  associated  with  hypersecretion  of  ACTH  (Cushing's syndrome)  by  anterior  pituitary  adenomas.  Hypersecretion of  other  tropic  hormones  rarely  occurs.  Underproduction of  a  single  anterior  pituitary  hormone  is  less  common  than generalized pituitary hypofunction (panhypopituitarism). Th e  anterior  pituitary  gland  is  the  only  endocrine  gland  in which a tumor, most o ft en a chromophobe adenoma, causes destruction by compressing the gland against the bony confi nes of the sella turcica. Metastatic tumor, most o ft en from the breast or lung, also occasionally produces pituitary hypofunction. Endocrine features of panhypopituitarism are highly variable and depend on the rate at which the de fi ciency develops and the patient's age. Gonadotropin de fi ciency (amenorrhea, impotence) is typically the fi rst manifestation of global pituitary  dysfunction.  Hypocortisolism  occurs  4  to  14  days a ft er  hypophysectomy, whereas hypothyroidism is not likely to manifest before 4 weeks. CT and MRI are useful for radiographic assessment of the pituitary gland.

Acromegaly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acromegaly is due to excessive secretion of growth hormone in adults, most o ft en by an adenoma in the anterior pituitary gland.  Failure  of  plasma  growth  hormone concentrations to decrease 1 to 2 hours a ft er ingestion of 75 to 100 g of glucose is presumptive evidence of acromegaly, as are growth hormone concentrations higher than 3 ng/mL. A skull radiograph and CT are useful for detecting enlargement of the sella turcica, which is characteristic of anterior pituitary adenomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations  of  acromegaly  re fl ect  parasellar  extension  of the anterior pituitary adenoma and peripheral e ff ects produced by the presence of excess growth hormone (Table 19-14). Headache  and  papilledema  re fl ect  increased  intracranial  pressure resulting  from  expansion  of  the  anterior  pituitary  adenoma. Visual disturbances are due to compression of the optic chiasm by the expanding overgrowth of surrounding tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overgrowth of so ft tissues  of  the  upper  airway  (enlargement of the tongue and epiglottis) makes patients susceptible to upper airway obstruction. Hoarseness and abnormal movement of the vocal cords or paralysis of a recurrent laryngeal nerve may result from stretching caused by overgrowth of the surrounding  cartilaginous  structures.  In  addition,  involvement of the cricoarytenoid joints can result in alterations in the patient's voice resulting from impaired movement of the vocal cords.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral neuropathy is common and likely re fl ects trapping  of  nerves  by  skeletal,  connective,  and  so ft tissue  overgrowth. Flow through the ulnar artery may be compromised in  patients  exhibiting  symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Even in the absence of such symptoms, approximately one half of patients with acromegaly have inadequate collateral blood fl ow through the ulnar artery in one or both hands.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucose  intolerance  and,  on  occasion,  diabetes  mellitus requiring treatment with insulin re fl ect the e ff ects of growth hormone on carbohydrate metabolism. Th e incidence of systemic  hypertension,  ischemic  heart  disease,  osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis seems to be increased in these patients. Lung volumes are increased, and ventilation/perfusion mismatching may be present. Th e patient's skin becomes thick and oily, skeletal muscle weakness may be prominent, and complaints of fatigue are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transsphenoidal  surgical  excision  of  pituitary  adenomas  is the preferred initial therapy. When adenomas have extended beyond  the  sella  turcica,  surgery  or  radiation  therapy  is  no longer  feasible;  medical  treatment  with  suppressant  drugs (bromocriptine) may be an option in these cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  acromegaly  is complicated  by  changes  induced  by  excessive  secretion  of growth  hormone.  Particularly  important  are  changes  in  the upper  airway.  Distorted  facial  anatomy  may  interfere  with placement  of  an  anesthesia  face  mask.  Enlargement  of  the tongue and epiglottis predisposes to upper airway obstruction and interferes with visualization of the vocal cords by direct laryngoscopy. Th e distance between the lips and vocal cords is  increased  due  to  overgrowth  of  the  mandible. Th e  glottic opening  may  be  narrowed,  because  of  enlargement  of  the vocal  cords. Th is,  in  addition  to  subglottic  narrowing,  may necessitate use of a tracheal tube with a smaller internal diameter than would be predicted based on the patient's age and size. Nasal turbinate enlargement may preclude the passage of nasopharyngeal or nasotracheal airways. A preoperative history of dyspnea on exertion or the presence of hoarseness or stridor suggests involvement of the larynx by acromegaly. In this instance, indirect laryngoscopy may be indicated to quantitate  the  extent  of  vocal  cord  dysfunction.  When  di ffi culty placing  a  tracheal  tube  is  anticipated,  it  may  be  prudent  to consider an awake fi beroptic tracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When a catheter is placed in the radial artery, it is important to consider the possibility of inadequate collateral circulation at the wrist. Monitoring blood glucose concentrations is useful if diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance accompanies acromegaly. Peripheral nerve stimulation is used to guide dosing  of  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants,  particularly  if skeletal muscle weakness is present. Th e skeletal changes associated  with  acromegaly  may  make  the  use  of  regional  anesthesia technically di ffi cult or unreliable. Th ere is no evidence that hemodynamic instability or alterations in pulmonary gas exchange accompany anesthesia in acromegalic patients.

Diabetes Insipidus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes insipidus re fl ects the absence of vasopressin (ADH) owing  to  destruction  of  the  posterior  pituitary  (neurogenic diabetes  insipidus)  or  failure  of  renal  tubules  to  respond  to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 19 ENDOCRINE DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
405

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ADH  (nephrogenic  diabetes insipidus). Neurogenic and nephrogenic  diabetes  insipidus  are  di ff erentiated  based  on the  response  to  desmopressin  (DDAVP), a vasopressin analogue that leads to concentration of the urine in the presence of neurogenic, but not nephrogenic, diabetes insipidus. Classic manifestations of diabetes insipidus are polydipsia and a high output of poorly concentrated urine despite increased serum osmolarity. Diabetes insipidus that develops during or immediately a ft er pituitary gland surgery is generally due to reversible trauma to the posterior pituitary and is usually transient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial  treatment of diabetes insipidus consists of intravenous  infusion  of  electrolyte  solutions  if  oral  intake  cannot o ff set polyuria. Chlorpropamide, an oral hypoglycemic drug, potentiates the e ff ects of ADH on renal tubules and may be useful for treating nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Treatment of  neurogenic  diabetes  insipidus  is  with  ADH  administered intramuscularly every 2 to 4 days or by intranasal administration of desmopressin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for patients with diabetes insipidus includes monitoring the urine output and serum electrolyte concentrations during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inappropriate Secretion of Antidiuretic Hormone

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inappropriate secretion of ADH can occur in the presence of diverse  pathologic  processes,  including  intracranial  tumors, hypothyroidism, porphyria, and carcinoma of the lung, particularly undi ff erentiated small cell carcinoma. Inappropriate secretion of ADH is alleged to occur in most patients following major surgery. Inappropriately increased urinary sodium concentrations and osmolarity in the presence of hyponatremia and decreased serum osmolarity are highly suggestive of inappropriate ADH secretion. Hyponatremia is due to dilution,  re fl ecting  expansion  of  the  intravascular fl uid  volume secondary  to  hormone-induced  resorption  of  water  by  the renal tubules. Abrupt decreases in serum sodium concentration, especially to less than 110 mEq/L, can result in cerebral edema and seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  inappropriate  secretion  of  ADH  consists of restriction of oral fl uid intake (to approximately 500 mL/ day), antagonism of the e ff ects of ADH on the renal tubules by administration of demeclocycline, and intravenous infusion  of  sodium  chloride.  O ft en fl uid  restriction  is  su ffi cient treatment  for  inappropriate  secretion  of  ADH  not  associated  with  symptoms  secondary  to  hyponatremia.  However, restriction  of  oral fl uid intake and administration of demeclocycline are not immediately e ff ective in the management of patients manifesting acute neurologic symptoms resulting from hyponatremia. In these patients, intravenous infusions of hypertonic saline su ffi cient to increase serum sodium concentrations by 0.5 mEq/L/hr are recommended. Overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia has been associated with central pontine myelinolysis, a type of brain cell dysfunction caused by destruction of the myelin sheath of nerve cells in the brainstem.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Diabetes mellitus results from an inadequate supply of and/ or  inadequate  tissue  response  to  insulin,  which  leads  to increased circulating glucose levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e e ff ects of chronic hyperglycemia are many and include hypertension,  coronary  artery  disease,  congestive  heart failure,  peripheral  vascular  disease,  cerebrovascular  accident, chronic renal failure, and autonomic neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Aggressive perioperative glucose control has been shown to limit infection risk, improve wound healing, and result in overall reductions in morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e direct e ff ects of T 3 on the heart and vascular smooth muscle are responsible for the exaggerated hemodynamic e ff ects of hyperthyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  third-generation  TSH  assay  is  the  single  best  test  of thyroid hormone action at the cellular level.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Every e ff ort should be made to render patients euthyroid before  surgery.  When  caring  for  surgical  patients  with hyperthyroidism  or  hypothyroidism,  the  clinician  must be prepared to manage thyroid storm or myxedema coma during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Since  most  pheochromocytomas  secrete  predominantly norepinephrine,  preoperative α -blockade  is  necessary  to lower blood pressure, increase intravascular volume, prevent paroxysmal hypertensive episodes, allow resensitization of adrenergic receptors, and decrease myocardial dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ During surgical excision of a pheochromocytoma, the patient o ft en exhibits an exaggerated hypertensive response to anesthetic induction, intubation, surgical excision, and particularly  tumor  manipulation.  Conversely,  hypotension  may occur following ligation of the tumor's venous drainage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e physiologic response to surgical stress is an increase in CRH, ACTH, and cortisol secretion that begins at surgical incision and continues into the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e most common cause of AI is administration of exogenous steroids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients  who  received  glucocorticoids  in  dosages  equivalent to more than 20 mg/day of prednisone for longer than 3 weeks within the previous year are considered to have adrenal suppression and are at increased risk of AI. Such patients require perioperative corticosteroid supplementation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Hydrocortisone  200  to  300  mg/day  for  a  minimum  of 5 to 7 days followed by a tapering regimen over 5 to 7 days results in overall improvement in patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of  hypercalcemia  in  the  general  population  and  usually results  from  a  benign  parathyroid  adenoma.  Hypercalcemia  can  be  treated  medically  by  saline  infusion,  furosemide, and/or bisphosphonates before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Overproduction  of  anterior  pituitary  hormones  is  most commonly  manifested  as  Cushing's  syndrome  caused  by ACTH hypersecretion by an adenoma in the anterior pituitary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Inappropriate secretion of ADH is common in the postoperative period and usually responds to fl uid restriction.
