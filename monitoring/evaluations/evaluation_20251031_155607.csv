when should a preoperative echocardiogram be ordered,"an echocardiogram may be considered if clinical assessment is suggestive of an undiagnosed severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality such as aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiomyopathy, or severe pulmonary hypertension",2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md,"**Preoperative Echocardiogram Ordering: Evidence-Based Guidelines** Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, we will summarize the indications for preoperative echocardiogram ordering. **Routine Echocardiography Not Recommended** [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]
We recommend against performing preoperative resting echocardiography to enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation (Strong Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence). **Indications for Echocardiography** The following scenarios warrant preoperative echocardiography: * **Suspected Undiagnosed Severe Obstructive Intracardiac Abnormality**: Patients with a clinical examination suggesting severe obstructive intracardiac abnormalities, such as aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, or hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, should undergo echocardiography before surgery to inform the anesthesiologist, surgeon, and medical team of the type and degree of disease (Duceppe et al., 2017) [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]
* **Suspected Severe Pulmonary Hypertension**: Patients with a clinical assessment suggesting severe pulmonary hypertension should undergo echocardiography before surgery (Duceppe et al., 2017) [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]
* **Suspected Undiagnosed Cardiomyopathy**: If a physician's clinical assessment suggests a patient might have an undiagnosed cardiomyopathy, echocardiography should be performed to facilitate optimization of long-term cardiac health (Duceppe et al., 2017) [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]
* **Clinical Assessment Suggests LV Dysfunction**: Patients with dyspnea of unknown origin, worsening dyspnea, or other changes in clinical status suggestive of LV dysfunction should undergo preoperative evaluation of LV function (Fleisher et al., 2014) [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md] **Other Considerations** * **Coronary Computed Tomographic Angiography (CCTA)**: CCTA may be considered for stable patients with an interval of 1 to 3 months (Fleisher et al., 2014) [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]

However, they do provide information on fluid maintenance and replacement requirements. **Fluid Maintenance Requirements** According to the Holliday and Segar formula, fluid maintenance rates are additive, as shown in Table 27-3 from [Source: 27_Stoelting.md]: | Weight Group | mL/kg/hr |
| --- | --- |
| First 10 kg | 4 |
| Next 10 kg | 2 |
| Additional kg | 1 | For example, a 25-kg child requires 40 mL/hr (4 mL/kg/hr) for the first 10 kg, 20 mL/hr (2 mL/kg/hr) for the next 10 kg, and 5 mL/hr (1 mL/kg/hr) for each additional kg above 20 kg, for a total of 65 mL/hr. **Fluid Replacement Requirements** Blood loss is generally replaced 3:1 for each milliliter of blood loss with isotonic crystalloid, and replenishment for evaporative loss is guided by estimations based on type of procedure and associated area of surgical exposure (Table 27-4 from [Source: 27_Stoelting.md]). **Glucose Administration** The maintenance glucose requirement for newborns is 6 to 8 mg/kg/min [Source: 27_Stoelting.md]. Term newborns are capable of maintaining normoglycemia for up to 10 hours with no exogenous glucose administration. However, since the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia are masked by general anesthesia, most practitioners supply some of the required glucose to infants while they are anesthetized. **Fasting Guidelines** Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly state the recommended fasting duration after clear fluids. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the available information. However, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2015 PALS Guidelines [Source: 2015 ACC_AHA PALS Guidelines.md] suggest that infants and children should be given an initial fluid bolus of 20 mL/kg for resuscitation, including those with conditions such as severe sepsis. Providers should reassess the patient after every fluid bolus. In conclusion, while the provided context provides valuable information on fluid maintenance and replacement requirements, it does not explicitly address the recommended fasting duration after clear fluids for infants and children. As such, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the available information. **References** [Source: 27_Stoelting.md]

what is the incidence of post dural puncture headache?,1 percent,2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md,"**Incidence of Postdural Puncture Headache** The incidence of postdural puncture headache (PDPH) following neuraxial anesthesia is approximately 1% [1]. However, it is significantly higher after accidental dural puncture with a 16-18G epidural needle, with an incidence greater than 50% [1]. The size of the dural puncture is an important risk factor. Studies have shown that the use of pencil-point needles (e.g., Whitacre, Sprotte, Pencan, and Gertie-Marx) decreases the risk of PDPH compared with cutting needles (e.g., Quincke) of the same size [1]. **Factors Affecting Incidence** Several factors can affect the incidence of PDPH, including: * Needle design: Cutting needles have a higher risk of PDPH than blunt needles [2].
* Needle size: Larger needles have a higher risk of PDPH than smaller needles [2].
* Needle bevel: A bevel that cuts dural fibers transversely increases the risk of PDPH [2].
* Pregnancy: Pregnancy increases the risk of PDPH [2].
* Number of dural punctures: Multiple dural punctures increase the risk of PDPH [2].
* Paramedian technique: This technique may reduce the incidence of PDPH [2].
* Age: Younger patients have a higher risk of PDPH [2].
* Gender: Females have a higher risk of PDPH than males [2].
* Vaginal delivery: Women who undergo vaginal delivery have a higher risk of PDPH [2].
* Morbid obesity: Morbid obesity may be protective against PDPH [2].
* Air travel: Air travel soon after dural puncture may increase the risk of PDPH [2]. **Features of PDPH** PDPH typically presents with: * Frontal/occipital headache that often radiates to the neck
* Mild to incapacitating pain
* Postural component: worse upright, some relief horizontal
* Difficulty with ADLs in 75% of patients [2] **Diagnosis and Treatment** Diagnosis of PDPH is clinical, and imaging is not recommended unless symptoms suggest another diagnosis. Conservative treatments include: * Bed rest and hydration
* Oral analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and opioids)
* A single 300-mg dose of oral caffeine
* Sphenopalatine ganglion blocks performed by a skilled operator Epidural blood patch is a safe and effective treatment for PDPH, with a success rate of 85-95% [2].

The incidence of PDPH is approximately 1% following any neuraxial procedure, but greater than 50% following accidental dural puncture with a 16-18G epidural needle [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]. **Conservative Treatments** For patients with mild PDPH without associated cranial symptoms, conservative treatments include: * Combination of bed rest and hydration (oral or intravenous)
* Oral analgesics including acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and opioids as needed
* A single 300-mg dose of oral caffeine
* Sphenopalatine ganglion blocks performed by a skilled operator [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md] **Epidural Blood Patch** Patients who are unable or unwilling to await spontaneous resolution of PDPH should be offered epidural blood patch [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. The epidural blood patch likely forms a clot over the meningeal hole, and symptoms are relieved within 1 to 24 hours in 85 to 95% of patients [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. A second patch is effective in 90% of patients who fail an initial blood patch [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. **Side Effects of Blood Patch** The most common side effects of blood patch are backache and radicular pain [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. **Spontaneous Resolution** PDPH usually resolves spontaneously in a few days to a week for most patients [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. However, some patients may experience persistent symptoms for months. **Key Considerations** * The size of the dural puncture is an important risk factor for PDPH.
* The use of pencil-point needles decreases the risk of PDPH compared with cutting needles of the same size.
* Patients with PDPH are at increased risk of neurologic complications, including subdural hematoma, cerebral venous thrombosis, and bacterial meningitis.
* Conservative treatments are often effective, but epidural blood patch may be necessary for patients who are unable or unwilling to await spontaneous resolution of PDPH. References:

However, it is mentioned in the 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md that the convention is to keep the patient supine, monitor them with CAS monitors for one to two hours, and to instruct them to avoid straining activities involving Valsalva maneuvers. To clarify the monitoring duration, let's refer to the 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md, which provides information on monitoring after neuraxial blocks. In patients who have received fibrinolytic and thrombolytic drugs, it is suggested that neurological monitoring should be continued for an appropriate interval, which may not be more than 2 hours between neurologic checks. However, this is in the context of patients who have received fibrinolytic and thrombolytic therapy, not specifically epidural blood patches. Considering the provided information, I would recommend a monitoring duration of at least one to two hours after an epidural blood patch, as per the convention mentioned in the 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md. However, it is essential to note that this recommendation is based on the available context, and further research may be necessary to determine the optimal monitoring duration. **Recommendation:** Monitor the patient after an epidural blood patch for at least one to two hours, as per the convention mentioned in the 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md.

The PLV group therefore had smaller minute ventilation and increased anatomic dead space ventilation (increased respiratory rate), resulting in decreased CO 2 elimination [44]. Permissive hypercapnea should be considered a routine component of a PLV strategy for OLV. Assuming a reasonable cardiovascular reserve, and in particular right ventricular function, P a CO 2 levels up to 70 mmHg are well tolerated in the short term and clearly beneficial in terms of lung injury avoidance and attenuation. Higher levels should be avoided in the majority of patients due to the risk of hemodynamic instability.\n\nI:E Ratio and Respiratory Rate\n\nEach ventilatory cycle consists of time spent in inspiration and expiration. The appropriate ratio of inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) time depends on underlying lung mechanics. Restrictive lung disease is characterized by poorly compliant lungs, which resist passive lung expansion, but rapidly recoil to FRC. Increasing the I:E ratio to 1:1 (or using inverse ratio ventilation) maximizes the time spent in inspiration, thereby reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures. For illustration, at a respiratory rate of 15 bpm and an I:E ratio of 1:1, each respiratory cycle lasts 4 s, with 2 s spent in each of inspiration and expiration, respectively. Obstructive lung disease, on the other hand, is characterized by lungs, which have difficulty to empty towards FRC, due to poor elastic recoil and conducting airway collapse. Decreasing the I:E ratio towards 1:4 allows for more expiratory time, and helps to minimize the risk of auto-PEEP and dynamic hyperinflation. For illustration, at a respiratory rate of 15 bpm, now with the I:E ratio to 1:4, each respiratory cycle is still 4 s, however, expiration now takes up 3.2 s of the entire cycle."", ""source"": ""wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""31878402-6260-4407-8648-2f0df318fbdb""}, {""content"": ""PaCO2 levels as high as 70-135 mmHg have been observed during OLV and were shown to be associated with ventricular arrhythmias, oxygenation difficulties, and frequently the need for inotropic support. 41\n\nThe respiratory rate (RR) needs to be increased slightly upon initiation of OLV to avoid excessive hypercapnia with a protective Vt. High RR, however, will decrease both inspiratory and expiratory time.

Conversely, with low Vt, inadequate PEEP may promote derecruitment and increase the shunt fraction in the ventilated lung. Patients are most likely to benefit from PEEP if their pulmonary function is normal, as extrinsic PEEP tends to increase the end-expiratory pressure towards the lower inflection point of the pressure-volume curve. On the other hand, in patients with obstructive lung disease and a reduced forced expiratory volume after one second, extrinsic PEEP is more likely to raise the end-expiratory pressure above the lower inflection point and create or enhance intrinsic PEEP during OLV. 31 Development of intrinsic PEEP can be detected by the presence of an interrupted expiratory flow on a flow-volume curve, worsening lung compliance on spirometry, or increasing plateau pressures. 3 Ferrando et al. recently showed improved oxygenation and lung mechanics when external PEEP was set based on achieving optimal dynamiclungcomplianceusingaPEEPdecrementtrialaftera lung recruitment maneuver. 32\n\n123\n\n1108\n\nC.

Early reports indicated that 40-50% of patients suffered hypoxemia during OLV [101]. Predictors for possible desaturation have been identified (Table 6.3). Hurford et al. examined the intraoperative oxygenation of patients who had undergone preoperative V / Q scanning [101]. They found that the amount of preoperative perfusion (and ventilation) to the operative lung inversely correlated with P a O 2 after 10 min of OLV. As HPV is only able to halve blood flow through the operative lung during OLV, the authors concluded that the extent of preoperative blood flow helped to predict the amount of intra-operative shunt. Slinger et al. showed that P a O 2 during OLV relates to multiple factors. Poor oxygenation during TLV was predictive of continued oxygenation difficulties as were right-sided operations (due to the increased perfusion to that side). Good preoperative pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) was found to be predictive of poor OLV oxygenation, which is felt to be due to the lack of auto-PEEP and secondary de-recruitment in normal lungs [102]. Two recent studies correlated the risk of hypoxemia to the end-tidal CO 2 gradients. One study showed that the difference of end-tidal CO 2 between the lungs in the lateral position significantly correlates with the P/F ratio at 15 min of OLV [103]. The other study demonstrated that there was a significant negative correlation between the lowest P a O 2 recorded during the first 45 min of OLV and the end-tidal CO 2 difference between TLV and the early phase of OLV [104].

This is of particular importance for surgical exposure during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Ko et al. compared three different gas mixtures during TLV immediately prior to OLV (air/O 2 , N 2 O/O 2 , O 2 ) and investigated which gas mixture would best collapse the operative lung while maintaining arterial oxygenation in patients undergoing lung resection surgery [57]. F i O 2 was 0.4 in the air/O 2 and N 2 O/O 2 group, and 1.0 in the O 2 group during TLV. All groups received 100% oxygen on initiation of OLV. Not surprisingly, lung deflation was worse if nitrogen (i.e., air) was administered prior to lung collapse, due to the poor solubility of nitrogen in blood (Fig. 6.6). A nitrous oxide/O 2 mixture was superior to oxygen alone for lung collapse, but nitrous oxide is contraindicated in many thoracic patients. Administering 100% oxygen pre-OLV temporarily improved OLV oxygenation, but only until the nonventilated lung becomes atelectatic.

However, based on the evidence, a tidal volume of approximately **6 mL/kg Predicted Body Weight (PBW)** is recommended as a starting point, with a goal of reducing tidal volume over 1 to 2 hours toward this goal [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. If plateau pressure remains > 30 cm H2O after reduction of tidal volume to 6 mL/kg PBW, tidal volume may be further reduced to as low as **4 mL/kg PBW**. However, it is essential to note that very low tidal volumes may result in significant patient-ventilatory dyssynchrony and patient discomfort [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. The use of low tidal volumes in combination with zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) has been associated with increased mortality in animal studies [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]. Therefore, it is recommended to use a physiologic (low) tidal volume and sufficient PEEP to minimize both overdistension and atelectasis. **PEEP Levels under OLV** Early, routine application of PEEP helps to prevent atelectasis and shunt formation and thereby improves oxygenation during OLV. Low levels of PEEP (5-10 cmH 2 O) are safe and likely beneficial for lung injury avoidance and should be used in all patients. However, PEEP levels need to be adjusted to the individual and their respiratory mechanics [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]. **Clinical Recommendations** * Use a tidal volume of approximately 6 mL/kg PBW as a starting point, with a goal of reducing tidal volume over 1 to 2 hours toward this goal.

OLV was associated with increases in multiple surrogate markers of lung injury (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP], lung weight gain [LWG] and TXB 2 cytokine levels), which occurred to a lesser degree in the protective ventilation group. The protective ventilation group, however, only received half the minute ventilation of the control group, as no compensatory increase in respiratory rate was used in the low tidal volume group. Based on the study design it was therefore not possible to state whether the outcome benefit was due to any one, or all, of minute ventilation reduction, tidal volume reduction and/or application of external PEEP [36]. Kuzkov et al. showed that when comparing equal minute ventilation in anesthetized sheep undergoing pneumonectomies, protective ventilation with 6 mL/kg - PEEP 2 cmH 2 O lowered extravascular lung water (a surrogate for lung injury), compared to 12mL/kg - ZEEP [37]. While neither study was able to answer the question whether tidal volume reduction or the addition of PEEP results in improved outcomes, it appears clear that tidal volume reduction alone is not sufficient.

Patients with normal lung function or restrictive lung disease should benefit from, and will tolerate, 5-10 cmH 2 O PEEP. Patients with severe obstructive lung disease, as evidenced by preoperative hyperinflation (RV/TLC >> 140%) exhibit significant air trapping during OLV, but as previously stated may not exhibit a significant increase in total PEEP with the application of external PEEP. Low levels of extrinsic PEEP 2-5 cmH 2 O are likely well tolerated and should routinely be applied. Clearly dynamic hyperinflation must be considered in the differential for intraoperative hypotensive episodes in patients at risk. However, based on the static compliance analysis by Licker et al., who used routine PEEP in all patients as part of their PLV strategy, hyperinflation (and secondary decrease in static compliance) does not appear to be a significant concern, as the compliance actually increased in their cohort exposed to PLV with routine PEEP [44].

What is the recommend respiratory rate under OLV?,14-16 breaths per minute (bpm),step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"Based on the provided context from the clinical guidelines and medical literature, the recommended respiratory rate under One-Lung Ventilation (OLV) is: * 12-16 breaths/min [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md] It is essential to note that the respiratory rate needs to be adjusted slightly upon initiation of OLV to avoid excessive hypercapnia with a protective tidal volume (Vt). However, high respiratory rates can decrease both inspiratory and expiratory time, leading to increased peak inspiratory pressures and plateau pressures. Additionally, the context suggests that the respiratory rate may need to be modified based on the underlying lung mechanics. In patients with restrictive lung disease, dividing a given minute volume by a higher respiratory frequency may be beneficial in reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures. However, in patients with obstructive lung disease, reducing the respiratory rate may be necessary to allow for complete exhalation and reduce the risk of dynamic hyperinflation. It is also worth noting that respiratory rate modification may be necessary to avoid increased auto-PEEP, particularly in OLV with small tidal volumes and rapid respiratory rates [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]. In summary, the recommended respiratory rate under OLV is 12-16 breaths/min, and it may need to be adjusted based on the individual patient's lung mechanics and specific clinical situation. **Important Considerations:** * PaCO2 levels should be maintained between 40-60 mmHg [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md].

This is evident from several studies and clinical guidelines. **Reduced CO2 elimination with increased respiratory rate** When tidal volumes are small, increasing the respiratory rate results in reduced CO2 elimination. This is because the anatomic dead space remains unchanged, making up a larger component of the tidal volume [65, wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]. For example, a patient ventilated at 400 mL - 20 bpm receives the identical minute ventilation as a patient ventilated at 800 mL - 10 bpm. However, dead space ventilation has doubled from 1,500 mL at 10 bpm to 3,000 mL at 20 bpm, reducing alveolar ventilation from 6,500 mL (8,000-1,500) to 5,000 mL (8,000-3,000) [65, wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]. **Increased dynamic hyperinflation with rapid respiratory rate** Rapid, shallow ventilation can lead to statistically higher auto-PEEP [65, wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]. While auto-PEEP elevations in this study were unlikely to be clinically significant, they serve as a reminder that rapid, shallow ventilation has the potential to increase dynamic hyperinflation. **Clinical guidelines and recommendations** The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend increasing the respiratory rate to a maximum of 35 breaths/min during tidal volume reduction to maintain minute ventilation [2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. However, this recommendation is made with the caveat that very low tidal volumes may result in significant patient-ventilatory dyssynchrony and patient discomfort. **Experimental evidence** A randomized trial investigating 32 patients scheduled for one-lung ventilation (OLV) and thoracotomy found that OLV increased cytokine levels (TNFa, sICAM-1) in both groups, but levels were lower in the low tidal volume ventilation group [21]. This study suggests that tidal volumes per se are linked to the etiology of acute lung injury (ALI) after lung surgery. **Conclusion** Based on the available evidence, increasing the respiratory rate to improve minute ventilation when using small tidal volumes may not be beneficial and could potentially lead to negative consequences, including reduced CO2 elimination and increased dynamic hyperinflation. Clinical guidelines and recommendations should be followed, and patient safety considerations should be prioritized. Sources: [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]

Extreme airflow obstruction may require very long expiratory times. After reducing the I:E ratio to the minimum of 1:4 this can only be achieved by increasing the overall cycle length, i.e., reducing the respiratory rate. Clinical examples, such as the patient with severe cystic fibrosis requiring a respiratory rate of 4-6 to allow for complete exhalation have been reported [64]. In restrictive lung disease, on the other hand, dividing a given minute volume by a higher respiratory frequency may be beneficial in reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures. It has to be realized, however, that as anatomic dead space remains unchanged, dividing the minute volume by a higher respiratory rate results in reduced CO 2 elimination as the unchanged size of the anatomic dead space makes up a larger component of the tidal volume [65]. For illustration, a patient ventilated at 400 mL - 20 bpm receives the identical minute ventilation as a patient ventilated at 800 mL - 10 bpm. However, dead space ventilation, which occupies about 150 mL of each breath, has doubled from 1,500 mL at 10 bpm to 3,000 mL at 20 bpm. Alveolar ventilation has therefore been reduced from 6,500 mL\n\n(8,000-1,500) to 5,000 mL (8,000-3,000).

OLV was associated with increases in multiple surrogate markers of lung injury (pulmonary artery pressure [PAP], lung weight gain [LWG] and TXB 2 cytokine levels), which occurred to a lesser degree in the protective ventilation group. The protective ventilation group, however, only received half the minute ventilation of the control group, as no compensatory increase in respiratory rate was used in the low tidal volume group. Based on the study design it was therefore not possible to state whether the outcome benefit was due to any one, or all, of minute ventilation reduction, tidal volume reduction and/or application of external PEEP [36]. Kuzkov et al. showed that when comparing equal minute ventilation in anesthetized sheep undergoing pneumonectomies, protective ventilation with 6 mL/kg - PEEP 2 cmH 2 O lowered extravascular lung water (a surrogate for lung injury), compared to 12mL/kg - ZEEP [37]. While neither study was able to answer the question whether tidal volume reduction or the addition of PEEP results in improved outcomes, it appears clear that tidal volume reduction alone is not sufficient. This point was well illustrated by an animal study comparing low vs. high tidal volume ventilation with or without PEEP in ALI.

This approach was mandated by the absence of a clearly documented OLV end-time in approximately 40% of these cases. We believe that this approach is likely to result in a sampling of ventilator management data most representative of overall OLV since standard OLV management at our institution is established early during this period and early sampling of OLV data is most likely to avoid the undocumented reinstitution of TLV.

High respiratory rates with a short expiratory phase entail a risk of dynamic hyperinflation, i.e., incomplete expiration through one lumen of the DLT. Patients suffering from obstructive pathology or undergoing left-sided ventilation via a left-sided DLT are at an increased risk.\n\nMode of ventilation\n\nWhen selecting a ventilator mode for OLV, it is important to remember that volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) entails a pre-selected volume being applied at a constant flow. Conversely, pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) involves a pre-selected pressure being applied with a decelerating flow and variable tidal volumes.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that VCV is superior to PCV. It has been shown, however, that oxygenation was better using PCV during OLV [17].\n\nAdvanced measures\n\nSimple clamping of the pulmonary artery (or its divisions) by the surgeon reduces blood flow and with that shunting.

what are the predictors of hypoxemia under OLV,"Right-sided operation, normal preoperative FEV1, Low PaO2 during two lung ventilation, preferential perfusion to the operative lung, supine position, vasodilator use, excessive volatile anesthesia (much greater than 1 MAC), sepsis",step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"**Predictors of Hypoxemia under One-Lung Ventilation (OLV)** Hypoxemia is a significant concern during One-Lung Ventilation (OLV). The available context provides several predictors of hypoxemia under OLV. **Patient-Related Predictors:** 1. **Preoperative Perfusion to the Operative Lung**: Studies have shown that the extent of preoperative blood flow to the operative lung inversely correlates with PaO2 after 10 minutes of OLV [101].
2. **Poor Pulmonary Function**: Good preoperative pulmonary function (FEV1) is predictive of poor OLV oxygenation, likely due to the lack of auto-PEEP and secondary de-recruitment in normal lungs [102].
3. **Right-Sided Operations**: Right-sided surgical pulmonary interventions are associated with increased perfusion to the right lung, which can lead to hypoxemia [102].
4. **High Cardiac Output**: High cardiac output can increase the risk of hypoxemia during OLV [101].
5. **Partial Respiratory Failure**: Partial respiratory failure is a predictor of hypoxemia during OLV [101]. **Procedure-Related Predictors:** 1. **End-Tidal CO2 Gradients**: Elevated end-tidal CO2 gradients between the lungs in the lateral position significantly correlate with the P/F ratio at 15 minutes of OLV [103].
2. **Lowest PaO2 Recorded**: The lowest PaO2 recorded during the first 45 minutes of OLV is negatively correlated with the end-tidal CO2 difference between TLV and the early phase of OLV [104]. **Pathophysiologic Mechanism:** Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a regional change in blood flow in smaller sections of the pulmonary arterial vascular bed aimed at optimizing the V/Q ratio and reducing shunt by up to 40% [10,12,13]. HPV is primarily triggered by a low alveolar pO2, while low mixed venous pO2 is a secondary mechanism [10]. Systemic vasodilators (e.g., volatile anesthetics) can exert an unfavorable influence on HPV, which is enhanced by vasoconstrictors. **Respiratory Gas Exchange:** During OLV, patients with relevant pulmonary pathology of the ventilated lung, such as pleural effusion, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, oedema, bronchospasm, or other restrictive changes, are at an increased risk of hypoxaemia [13]. Other predictors of hypoxemia include right-sided surgical pulmonary interventions, high cardiac output, and partial respiratory failure. **Anaesthesiologic Measures:** 1. **Lung Protective Ventilation**: Avoidance of volutrauma and barotrauma is crucial during OLV [14].
2. **Optimization of Oxygenation**: Monitoring and optimizing oxygenation during OLV is essential to prevent hypoxemia.
3. **Cerebral Oximetry**: Cerebral oximetry can be useful in assessing cerebral oxygenation during OLV [21]. **Monitoring:** 1. **Arterial Blood Gas Analysis**: Arterial blood gas analysis is helpful in assessing oxygenation and the adequacy of ventilation during OLV.
2. **Continuous Spirometry**: Continuous spirometry can assess changes in lung compliance due to recruitment/derecruitment and diagnose air leaks and air-trapping.
3. **Transesophageal Echocardiography**: Transesophageal echocardiography can be helpful in assessing right heart dysfunction, which may be worsened due to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance induced by the initiation of OLV.

Early reports indicated that 40-50% of patients suffered hypoxemia during OLV [101]. Predictors for possible desaturation have been identified (Table 6.3). Hurford et al. examined the intraoperative oxygenation of patients who had undergone preoperative V / Q scanning [101]. They found that the amount of preoperative perfusion (and ventilation) to the operative lung inversely correlated with P a O 2 after 10 min of OLV. As HPV is only able to halve blood flow through the operative lung during OLV, the authors concluded that the extent of preoperative blood flow helped to predict the amount of intra-operative shunt. Slinger et al. showed that P a O 2 during OLV relates to multiple factors. Poor oxygenation during TLV was predictive of continued oxygenation difficulties as were right-sided operations (due to the increased perfusion to that side). Good preoperative pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) was found to be predictive of poor OLV oxygenation, which is felt to be due to the lack of auto-PEEP and secondary de-recruitment in normal lungs [102]. Two recent studies correlated the risk of hypoxemia to the end-tidal CO 2 gradients. One study showed that the difference of end-tidal CO 2 between the lungs in the lateral position significantly correlates with the P/F ratio at 15 min of OLV [103]. The other study demonstrated that there was a significant negative correlation between the lowest P a O 2 recorded during the first 45 min of OLV and the end-tidal CO 2 difference between TLV and the early phase of OLV [104]. Both studies postulated that elevated CO 2 gradients were indicative of V / Q mismatching and therefore explained the risk of hypoxemia.\n\nOver the years the incidence of hypoxemia has been declining.

A few recent studies have attempted to define the effects of OLV on organ function. More research is needed to delineate the end-organ effects of OLV.\n\nA recent study by Mierdl et al. analyzed the impact of hypoxia during OLV on myocardial metabolism in patients with severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease.

However, we can infer some guidelines from the available information. **Tolerated Levels of Hypercapnea** According to the provided sources: * In a study by Sticher et al., patients were ventilated with 7 mL/kg - PEEP 2 cmH2O or 3.5 mL/kg - PEEP 2 cmH2O, resulting in a PaCO2 rise from 42 to 64 mmHg, which was well tolerated [60].
* In a case series of 24 patients undergoing volume reduction surgery for advanced emphysema, permissive hypercapnea was used electively as part of a barotrauma avoidance strategy, resulting in a mean PaCO2 value of 56 mmHg with a peak of 86 mmHg, which was also well tolerated [61].
* However, higher levels of hypercapnea were poorly tolerated, with peak PaCO2 values of 70-135 mmHg, resulting in pH values as low as 7.03 and leading to inotropic support, ventricular dysrhythmias, and tracheal gas insufflation requirements in some patients [62]. **Target PaCO2 Levels for Permissive Hypercapnea** Based on the available evidence, it appears that moderate hypercapnea (PaCO2 levels around 50-70 mmHg) is well tolerated and may be beneficial for preventing barotrauma during OLV. However, extremely high levels of hypercapnea (PaCO2 levels above 70 mmHg) are poorly tolerated and may lead to adverse effects. **Clinical Recommendations** * Use permissive hypercapnea as part of a protective ventilation strategy during OLV to minimize mechanical stress and prevent barotrauma.
* Target moderate hypercapnea levels (PaCO2 around 50-70 mmHg) to balance the benefits of reduced mechanical stress with the risks of hypercapnea.
* Monitor PaCO2 levels closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed to maintain moderate hypercapnea levels.
* Avoid extremely high levels of hypercapnea (PaCO2 levels above 70 mmHg), as they may lead to adverse effects. **Source Citations** * [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]

In patients with obstructive lung disease what is a reasonable inspiratory to expiratory ratio,a reasonable ratio is anywhere from 1:2 up to 1:6,step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"**Inspiratory to Expiratory (I:E) Ratio in Obstructive Lung Disease** In patients with obstructive lung disease, the optimal I:E ratio is crucial to minimize the risk of auto-PEEP and dynamic hyperinflation. According to [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md], a decreased I:E ratio towards 1:4 is recommended to allow for more expiratory time and help prevent these complications. This adjustment in I:E ratio is particularly important in patients with severe airflow obstruction, where reducing the I:E ratio to the minimum of 1:4 may be necessary to achieve complete exhalation [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]. In such cases, reducing the respiratory rate may also be beneficial to allow for longer expiratory times and prevent dynamic hyperinflation. For example, a patient with severe cystic fibrosis may require a respiratory rate of 4-6 to allow for complete exhalation [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md].

* In patients with severe airflow obstruction, reducing the I:E ratio to the minimum of 1:4 and reducing the respiratory rate may be necessary to achieve complete exhalation and prevent dynamic hyperinflation.

2. **Minimize Recruitment Pressure**: Use lower plateau pressures, such as 30 cm H2O without resection and 20 cm H2O with lung resection, to minimize lung injury due to ischemic reperfusion injury [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md].
3. **Slowly Develop Recruitment Pressure**: Maintain recruitment pressure until full lung re-expansion has occurred, roughly 30-60 seconds [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md].
4. **Minimize FIO2**: Use lower FIO2 levels, ideally 92-96%, to limit oxidative stress and prevent atelectasis [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md].
5. **Maintain Protective Lung Ventilation**: Use a protective ventilation strategy, including low tidal volumes (4-6 mL/kg IBW) and PEEP, to prevent lung injury and promote optimal lung function [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]. Additionally, it is essential to consider the patient's individual respiratory mechanics and adjust PEEP levels accordingly.

L. Brassard et al.\n\nTwo-lung ventilation: post-OLV to emergence\n\nThe period after OLV is important for returning the patients lungs as close as possible to baseline function. Postoperative lung function is impaired for a multitude of reasons, including general anesthesia, residual paralysis, lung edema due to fluids, manipulation, and inflammation, but also likely residual atelectasis. Patients may be at particular risk of lung injury at this time, as they have encountered a ''first hit'' in the form of lung surgery and OLV. After recruitment of the operative lung, TLV needs to be established with a protective ventilation strategy. Tidal volumes may be increased slightly to 6-8 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW if overall lung volumes are unchanged and should remain at 4-6 mL /C1 kg -1 if significant lung resection has occurred. Appropriate PEEP needs to be maintained until extubation, as the operative lung is particularly prone to recollapse. The F I O2 should be titrated to an SpO2 of 92-96% to limit oxidative stress. Lung recruitment can be used as needed, taking care to limit airway pressure and high volume delivery to the operative lung. Considering the propensity to derecruitment and the increased airflow resistance of double-lumen endotracheal tubes, it is preferable not to switch the patient to unsupported spontaneous ventilation on emergence. Hypoventilation, particularly in the setting of high FI O2, will encourage atelectasis. Pressure-supported ventilation with PEEP is more likely to maintain optimal lung volumes during emergence.\n\nRecommendations\n\nMaintain protective lung ventilation post OLV.\n\n4-6 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW with PEEP with lung resection."", ""source"": ""step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""40d805ed-63f0-4825-a19b-239d523db5bd""}, {""content"": ""From OLV to extubation\n\nRe-expansion of the operative lung\n\nLung recruitment at the conclusion of OLV serves multiple purposes. Restoration of normal lung expansion is necessary to re-establish the pleural interface and minimize any postoperative pneumothorax. Alveolar recruitment maneuvers optimize postoperative pulmonary function, restore V/Q matching, and thereby improve oxygenation. In the case of lung resection, caution needs to be exercised not to disrupt staple lines and create undue hemodynamic instability in the face of commonly practiced relative hypovolemia. Based on animal experiments of lung recruitment in ALI, gradual re-expansion potentially induces less ALI in the operative lung. 33 The lung should therefore be re-expanded at a slow rate and to a lower plateau pressure. 47\n\nLung re-expansion may worsen lung injury due to ischemic reperfusion injury in the presence of ROS and oxidative stress. Lower FIO2 should likely be employed when recruiting the lung after prolonged lung collapse, as hypoxemic reperfusion has been shown to attenuate the inflammatory response and organ injury after intestinal ischemia. 48 The use of a two-lung vital capacity maneuver is undesirable as it may cause overdistension and potential volutrauma in the non-operative lung which is vastly more compliant than the atelectatic operative lung.

"for adults suspected of having sepsis, is lactate measurement recommended?","yes, it is recommended to measure blood lactate levels",2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md,"For adults suspected of having sepsis, lactate measurement is recommended. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md] The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines suggest measuring blood lactate for adults suspected of having sepsis. This recommendation is based on the association of lactate level with mortality in patients with suspected infection and sepsis, which is well established in the literature [45, 46]. The guidelines state that lactate is part of the Sepsis-3 definition of septic shock [49] and can be used to screen for the presence of sepsis among undifferentiated adult patients with clinically suspected (but not confirmed) sepsis [50-52]. The lactate cutoffs determining an elevated level ranged from 1.6-2.5 mmol/L, although diagnostic characteristics were similar regardless of the cutoff [50-52]. Sensitivities range from 66-83%, with specificities ranging from 80-85% [50-52]. Pooled positive and negative likelihood ratios from the three studies are 4.75 and 0.29, respectively [50-52]. The guidelines also state that lactate testing may not be readily available in many resource-limited settings [54-61]. However, the presence of an elevated or normal lactate level significantly increases or decreases, respectively, the likelihood of a final diagnosis of sepsis in patients with suspected sepsis [50-52]. Therefore, lactate measurement is recommended as an adjunctive test to modify the pretest probability of sepsis in patients with suspected but not confirmed sepsis.

* Lactate testing may not be readily available in many resource-limited settings [54-61].
* The presence of an elevated or normal lactate level significantly increases or decreases, respectively, the likelihood of a final diagnosis of sepsis in patients with suspected sepsis [50-52]. It's worth noting that lactate measurement is not a direct measure of tissue perfusion [73], but it is an important biomarker of tissue hypoxia and dysfunction.

In resource-limited regions where measurement of CO or SV may not be possible, a >15% increase in pulse pressure could indicate that the patient is fluid responsive utilizing a passive leg-raise test for 60-90 seconds (71, 72).\n\nSerum lactate is an important biomarker of tissue hypoxia and dysfunction, but is not a direct measure of tissue perfusion (73). Recent definitions of septic shock include increases in lactate as evidence of cellular stress to accompany refractory hypotension (1). Previous iterations of these guidelines have suggested using lactate levels as a target of resuscitation in the early phases of sepsis and septic shock, based on earlier studies related to goal-directed therapy and meta-analyses of multiple studies targeting reductions in serum lactate in comparison with 'standard care' or increases in central venous oxygen saturation (74, 75).

"for adults with septic shock on vasopressors, what is the recommended initial target for mean arterial pressure (MAP)",The initial recommended target MAP is 65 mm Hg,2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md,"**Initial Target Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) for Adults with Septic Shock on Vasopressors** For adults with septic shock on vasopressors, the recommended initial target mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 65 mm Hg. This recommendation is based on moderate-quality evidence and a strong recommendation from the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md] **Rationale:** * Increasing MAP results in increased tissue blood flow and augments the supply side of tissue perfusion.
* MAPs below 60 mm Hg are associated with decreased organ perfusion, which tracks linearly with MAP (79).
* A RCT in septic shock comparing patients who were given vasopressors to target a MAP of 65-70 mm Hg, versus a target of 80-85 mm Hg, found no difference in mortality (80).
* Targeting higher MAP targets was associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation (80).
* A meta-analysis of two RCTs on this topic supported that higher MAP targets did not improve survival in septic shock (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90-1.23) (81). **Recent RCT Findings:** * A recent RCT, monitored to ensure protocol and MAP target compliance, compared a 'permissive hypotension' (MAP 60-65 mm Hg) group with a 'usual care' group that received vasopressors and MAP targets set by the treating physician in patients aged 65 years and older with septic shock (82, 83).
* The intervention group achieved a mean MAP of 66.7 mm Hg, compared with 72.6 mm Hg in the usual care group.
* Among 2,463 analyzed patients, there was significantly less exposure to vasopressors in the intervention group, measured by duration of vasopressor infusion and total vasopressor doses expressed in norepinephrine equivalents.
* Ninety-day mortality in the permissive hypotension and usual care groups was similar (41.0% vs 43.8%). **Recommendation:** Given the lack of advantage associated with higher MAP targets and the lack of harm among elderly patients with MAP targets of 60-65 mm Hg, the panel recommends targeting a MAP of 65 mm Hg in the initial resuscitation of patients with septic shock who require vasopressors.

Increasing MAP therefore usually results in increased tissue blood flow and augments the supply side of tissue perfusion. While some tissues, such as the brain and kidneys have the ability to autoregulate blood flow, MAPs below a threshold, usually understood to be approximately 60 mm Hg, are associated with decreased organ perfusion, which tracks linearly with MAP (79). Previous SSC guidelines recommended targeting a MAP of greater than 65 mm Hg for initial resuscitation. The recommendation was based principally on a RCT in septic shock comparing patients who were given vasopressors to target a MAP of 65-70 mm Hg, versus a target of 80-85 mm Hg (80). This study found no difference in mortality, although a subgroup analysis demonstrated a 10.5% absolute reduction in renal replacement therapy (RRT) with higher MAP targets among patients with chronic hypertension. Additionally, targeting higher MAP with vasopressors was associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation. A limitation of this study was that the average MAP in both arms exceeded the targeted range.

what is the first-line recommended vasopressor in septic shock,norepinephrine,2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md,"Based on the provided context from the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md and 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines Updates.md, the first-line recommended vasopressor in septic shock is norepinephrine. **Recommendation:**
For adults with septic shock, we recommend using norepinephrine as the first-line agent over other vasopressors. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines Updates.md] **Rationale:**
The evidence suggests that norepinephrine is a more effective and safer option for septic shock patients compared to other vasopressors. The panel considered the desirable and undesirable consequences of these vasopressors and issued a strong recommendation to use norepinephrine as a first-line agent instead of dopamine, vasopressin, epinephrine, selepressin, and angiotensin II. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md] **Monitoring and Intravenous Access:**
When administering vasopressors, it is suggested to start them peripherally to restore mean arterial pressure rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured. When using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa.

The use of norepinephrine as a first-line vasopressor in septic shock is supported by strong evidence and is recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign. This recommendation is based on the panel's evaluation of the desirable and undesirable consequences of these vasopressors. Patient safety considerations emphasize the importance of monitoring and intravenous access when administering vasopressors. **Citation:**

Increasing MAP therefore usually results in increased tissue blood flow and augments the supply side of tissue perfusion. While some tissues, such as the brain and kidneys have the ability to autoregulate blood flow, MAPs below a threshold, usually understood to be approximately 60 mm Hg, are associated with decreased organ perfusion, which tracks linearly with MAP (79). Previous SSC guidelines recommended targeting a MAP of greater than 65 mm Hg for initial resuscitation. The recommendation was based principally on a RCT in septic shock comparing patients who were given vasopressors to target a MAP of 65-70 mm Hg, versus a target of 80-85 mm Hg (80). This study found no difference in mortality, although a subgroup analysis demonstrated a 10.5% absolute reduction in renal replacement therapy (RRT) with higher MAP targets among patients with chronic hypertension. Additionally, targeting higher MAP with vasopressors was associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation. A limitation of this study was that the average MAP in both arms exceeded the targeted range. A meta-analysis of two RCTs on this topic supported that higher MAP targets did not improve survival in septic shock (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90-1.23) (81)."", ""source"": ""2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""b8ebc13f-f9e0-4016-8e91-3b5a47166fda""}, {""content"": ""The evidence regarding the optimal therapeutic strategy for shock requiring high dose vasopressors is scant (360).

Thus, the use of another drug such as epinephrine that targets the same receptors may be of limited utility and vasopressin could be more adequate in this scenario. In an indirect comparison, a network meta-analysis did not find any significant difference between epinephrine and vasopressin in terms of mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.47-1.88) (362).

There is not as strong an evidence base, however, for the patients presenting with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation who do not fulfil the criteria for ARDS. A 2015 systematic review and metaanalysis found a reduction in the risk of a composite endpoint of ARDS or pneumonia during the hospital stay in the low tidal volume ventilation group compared to the high tidal volume ventilation group (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98) (450). Our analysis of three RCTs (1,129 patients) showed no difference in mortality with low Vt ventilation (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.26), with a trend toward lower risk of developing ARDs (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.02) (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 4).\n\nThere are limited data on ventilation strategies for patients with sepsis-induced respiratory failure who do not meet criteria for ARDS. However, sepsis is an independent risk factor for the development of ARDS, and delays in diagnosing ARDS may result in delayed use of low tidal volumes. We therefore suggest that low tidal volume ventilation be used in all patients with sepsis who are receiving mechanical ventilation to avoid underuse or delayed use of this intervention. Furthermore, the use of low tidal volume ventilation avoids the risk of promoting ventilator induced lung injury in septic patients in whom the diagnosis of ARDS has been missed.\n\nRecruitment Maneuvers\n\nRationale"", ""source"": ""2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""f58d2647-629c-4011-87c7-fadba6237191""}, {""content"": ""The use of lung-protective strategies for patients with ARDS is supported by clinical trials and has been widely accepted; however, the precise tidal volume for an individual ARDS patient requires adjustment for factors such as the plateau pressure, the selected positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), thoracoabdominal compliance, and the patient's breathing effort. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis, high minute ventilation, or short stature may require additional manipulation of tidal volumes. Some clinicians believe it may be safe to ventilate with tidal volumes > 6 mL/kg PBW, as long as plateau pressure can be maintained \u2264 30 cm H 2 O (429, 430). The plateau pressure is only truly valuable if the patient is passive during the inspiratory hold.

There is not as strong an evidence base, however, for the patients presenting with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation who do not fulfil the criteria for ARDS. A 2015 systematic review and metaanalysis found a reduction in the risk of a composite endpoint of ARDS or pneumonia during the hospital stay in the low tidal volume ventilation group compared to the high tidal volume ventilation group (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.98) (450). Our analysis of three RCTs (1,129 patients) showed no difference in mortality with low Vt ventilation (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.26), with a trend toward lower risk of developing ARDs (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.02) (Supplemental Digital Content: Appendix 4).\n\nThere are limited data on ventilation strategies for patients with sepsis-induced respiratory failure who do not meet criteria for ARDS. However, sepsis is an independent risk factor for the development of ARDS, and delays in diagnosing ARDS may result in delayed use of low tidal volumes. We therefore suggest that low tidal volume ventilation be used in all patients with sepsis who are receiving mechanical ventilation to avoid underuse or delayed use of this intervention. Furthermore, the use of low tidal volume ventilation avoids the risk of promoting ventilator induced lung injury in septic patients in whom the diagnosis of ARDS has been missed.\n\nRecruitment Maneuvers\n\nRationale"", ""source"": ""2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""f58d2647-629c-4011-87c7-fadba6237191""}]",39
are steroids recommended for adults with septic shock and ongoing requirements for vasopressor therapy?,"yes, IV corticosteroids are recommended in this scenario",2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md,"**Clinical Recommendation: Steroids for Adults with Septic Shock and Ongoing Vasopressor Therapy** Based on the provided context from the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines, the recommendation for adults with septic shock and ongoing requirements for vasopressor therapy is as follows: * We suggest using IV corticosteroids, specifically hydrocortisone at a dose of 200mg/day, divided doses. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]
* The optimal dose, timing of initiation, and duration of corticosteroids remain uncertain, and recent RCTs used 200 mg per day of IV hydrocortisone in divided doses. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md] **Key Points to Emphasize:** * Ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy is defined as a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min for at least 4 hours after initiation to maintain the target mean arterial pressure (MAP). [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]
* No dose response benefit was seen in a prior systematic review and meta-analysis. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md] **Patient Safety Considerations:** * Corticosteroids should be used judiciously, and their use should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition and response to treatment.
* The decision to use corticosteroids should be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare team, and the patient's blood pressure, cardiac function, and other vital signs should be closely monitored. **Clinical Recommendations in Context:** * The use of corticosteroids in adults with septic shock and ongoing vasopressor therapy is supported by moderate-quality evidence. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]
* The recommended dose of hydrocortisone is 200mg/day, divided doses, although the optimal dose, timing of initiation, and duration of corticosteroids remain uncertain. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md] **References:** [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]

should patients with a recent myocardial infarction wait before undergoing noncardiac surgery?,"Yes, patients with recent myocardial infarction should wait at least 60 days before elective noncardiac surgery.",2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md,"**Timing of Elective Noncardiac Surgery in Patients with Previous Myocardial Infarction (MI)** Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, patients with a recent myocardial infarction should wait before undergoing noncardiac surgery. According to the 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md], it is recommended that ≥ 60 days should elapse after a MI before noncardiac surgery in the absence of a coronary intervention. This is based on studies demonstrating that the postoperative MI rate decreased substantially as the length of time from MI to operation increased [42]. However, the presence and type of coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] versus percutaneous coronary interventions [PCIs]) that occurred at the time of the MI should be considered. Patients who have undergone CABG may be at lower risk for perioperative cardiac complications [43]. Additionally, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend delaying elective noncardiac surgery for at least 30 days after MI [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. **Specific Recommendations for Timing of Elective Noncardiac Surgery after Previous PCI:** * Elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed 14 days after balloon angioplasty and 30 days after Bare Metal Stent (BMS) implantation [231-233, Level of Evidence B].
* Elective noncardiac surgery should optimally be delayed 365 days after Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) implantation [234-237, Level of Evidence B].
* In patients in whom noncardiac surgery is required, a consensus decision among treating clinicians as to the relative risks of surgery and discontinuation or continuation of antiplatelet therapy can be useful [Level of Evidence C].
* Elective noncardiac surgery after DES implantation may be considered after 180 days if the risk of further delay is greater than the expected risks of ischemia and stent thrombosis [234,238, Level of Evidence B]. **Important Considerations:** * Patients with a history of MI are at increased risk for perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality, and careful consideration should be given to the timing of noncardiac surgery.
* The presence and type of coronary revascularization should be taken into account when determining the timing of noncardiac surgery.
* A consensus decision among treating clinicians should be made regarding the relative risks of surgery and discontinuation or continuation of antiplatelet therapy. **References:** [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]

However, the outcomes in most of these studies are not reflective of contemporary perioperative event rates, nor was the patient management consistent with current standards of preventive and perioperative cardiac care [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. The 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery also recommend against performing preoperative CCTA to enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation . Exercise stress testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing are not recommended for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk noncardiac surgery, as the available data do not show an association between electrocardiogram (ECG) changes during exercise and postoperative outcome . In summary, exercise stress testing is not recommended for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk noncardiac surgery, and routine screening with noninvasive stress testing is not useful for low-risk noncardiac surgery. Key recommendations: * Routine screening with noninvasive stress testing is not useful for low-risk noncardiac surgery .
* Exercise stress testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing are not recommended for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk noncardiac surgery .

The risk of DES thrombosis during noncardiac surgery more than 4 to 6 weeks after stent implantation is low but is higher than in the absence of surgery, although the relative increased risk varies from study to study. This risk decreases with time and may be at a stable level by 6 months after DES implantation. 234,238 The value of continuing aspirin alone or DAPT to prevent stent thrombosis or other ischemic events during noncardiac surgery is uncertain given the lack of prospective trials. The risk of bleeding is likely higher with DAPT than with aspirin alone or no antiplatelet therapy, but the magnitude of the increase is uncertain. 231,232,307-309,312 As such, use of DAPT or aspirin alone should be individualized on the basis of the considered potential benefits and risks, albeit in the absence of secure data.

should perioperative pain management strategies be individualized to minimize hemodynamic stress?,"Yes, pain management should be tailored to minimize hemodynamic fluctuations.",2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md,"**Perioperative Pain Management Strategies** To address the question of whether perioperative pain management strategies should be individualized to minimize hemodynamic stress, we need to consider various aspects of pain management, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. **Individualized Pain Management** Individualized pain management is crucial in the perioperative period to minimize hemodynamic stress. A systematic review and meta-analysis of pain management strategies in surgical patients found that individualized pain management resulted in improved patient outcomes, including reduced hemodynamic stress, pain scores, and opioid consumption [1]. **Non-Pharmacological Interventions** Non-pharmacological interventions, such as regional anesthesia, can also be effective in reducing hemodynamic stress during surgery. A randomized controlled trial found that neuraxial anesthesia for postoperative pain relief decreased the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery [2]. **Pharmacological Interventions** Pharmacological interventions, such as epidural analgesia, can also be effective in reducing hemodynamic stress during surgery. A randomized controlled trial found that perioperative epidural analgesia decreased the incidence of preoperative cardiac events in patients with a hip fracture [3]. **Fluid Management** Fluid management is also crucial in the perioperative period to minimize hemodynamic stress. A randomized controlled trial found that fluid restriction in the perioperative period reduced postoperative complications, including hypotension and hypovolemia [4]. Another study found that calculation of fluid requirements in the obese patient should be based on lean body weight with a goal of euvolemia to avoid fluid overload and pulmonary edema [5]. **Positioning and Oxygen Administration** Positioning and oxygen administration can also be important in minimizing hemodynamic stress during surgery. A study found that the sitting position improved arterial oxygenation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea [6]. However, routine administration of oxygen during the postoperative period is controversial, and oxygen administration should be provided only if arterial oxygen desaturation occurs [7]. In conclusion, individualized pain management strategies, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, fluid management, positioning, and oxygen administration, are crucial in minimizing hemodynamic stress during surgery.

In 1 prospective cohort study on the role of preoperative echocardiography in 1005 consecutive patients undergoing elective vascular surgery at a single center, LV dysfunction (LVEF <50%) was present in 50% of patients, of whom 80% were asymptomatic. 58 The 30-day cardiovascular event rate was highest in patients with symptomatic HF (49%), followed by those with asymptomatic systolic LV dysfunction (23%), asymptomatic diastolic LV dysfunction (18%), and normal LV function (10%). Further studies are required to determine if the information obtained from the assessment of ventricular function in patients without signs or symptoms adds incremental information that will result in changes in management and outcome such that the appropriateness criteria should be updated.

In addition, the preoperative ECG may provide a useful baseline standard against which to measure changes in the postoperative period.

The guidelines suggest that patients with ACHD may have greater operative risk than patients without ACHD, and that the 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery may not apply directly [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. In terms of the specific recommendations for cardiac surgery and interventional procedures in ACHD patients, there is limited evidence available in the provided context. However, it is clear that a high level of expertise and experience in managing ACHD patients is necessary to ensure optimal outcomes. Based on the available information, it is reasonable to conclude that cardiac surgery and interventional procedures in ACHD patients should not be performed by general cardiologists without the support of a multidisciplinary team that includes cardiologists with expertise in adult congenital heart disease, anesthesiologists, and surgeons. **Recommendation:** * Cardiac surgery and interventional procedures in ACHD patients should be performed by a multidisciplinary team that includes cardiologists with expertise in adult congenital heart disease, anesthesiologists, and surgeons.
* Patients with ACHD may require a more nuanced approach to perioperative care due to their unique physiological challenges.
* The 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and Management of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery may not apply directly to patients with ACHD. **Rationale:** * Patients with ACHD may have greater operative risk than patients without ACHD.

Is routine echocardiography recommended for all adults with repaired atrial septal defect without symptoms or residual shunt?,"No, routine echocardiography is not indicated in asymptomatic patients with repaired ASD without residual shunt or chamber enlargement.",2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md,"Based on the provided context from the 2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease, the recommendation for routine echocardiography in adults with repaired atrial septal defect (ASD) without symptoms or residual shunt is not explicitly stated. However, the guidelines do provide information on routine follow-up and testing intervals for adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD), including those with ASD. Table 15 in the guidelines lists the routine follow-up and testing intervals for AVSD, which includes: - Echocardiogram (TTE): Not specified as a routine follow-up test for all adults with repaired ASD without symptoms or residual shunt. - 6-minute walk test or cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET): Suggested as an alternative or additional test, depending on the clinical indication. - Invasive hemodynamic assessment: Recommended as a confirmatory tool and for evaluation of pulmonary vasoreactivity, which carries prognostic significance for adults with shunts. - Pulse oximetry: Suggested for resting and ambulatory assessment to identify patients with increased pulmonary resistance and shunt reversal. Based on the available information, it appears that routine echocardiography is not specifically recommended for all adults with repaired ASD without symptoms or residual shunt. However, individualized evaluation and testing may be necessary depending on the clinical indication and patient-specific factors. **Recommendation:** * Routine echocardiography is not specifically recommended for all adults with repaired ASD without symptoms or residual shunt.

Should patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot undergo periodic imaging with cardiac MRI?,"Yes, periodic imaging with cardiac MRI is recommended in repaired tetralogy of Fallot to assess right ventricular size and function.",2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md,"**Recommendation for Periodic Imaging in Patients with Repaired Tetralogy of Fallot:** According to the 2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease [1], patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) should undergo periodic imaging with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to assess right ventricular size and function, pulmonary valve function, pulmonary artery anatomy, and left heart abnormalities. **Frequency of Imaging:** The guidelines recommend a baseline CMR study with periodic follow-up CMR, with the frequency of repeat imaging determined by anatomic and physiological findings [1]. This indicates that the imaging schedule should be tailored to the individual patient's needs, considering factors such as residual defects, symptoms, and previous imaging findings. **CMR as the Gold Standard:** CMR is considered the gold standard imaging modality for assessing right ventricular size and function in patients with repaired TOF [2]. It allows for quantification of valve regurgitation, pulmonary and systemic flows, and delineation of pulmonary artery anatomy, as well as detection of scar tissue in the ventricular myocardium [3]. **Comparative Imaging Modalities:** While cardiac computed tomography (CCT) may be used if CMR is not feasible, the frequency of repeat imaging should be weighed against radiation exposure [1]. CCT is not recommended as a replacement for CMR in patients with repaired TOF, due to the higher radiation dose and lower sensitivity for detecting subtle changes in right ventricular function [4]. **Important Considerations:** Infective endocarditis is a significant concern in patients with repaired TOF, and antibiotics should be administered before dental or surgical procedures to prevent this complication [5]. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot should undergo periodic imaging with cardiac magnetic resonance to assess right ventricular size and function, pulmonary valve function, pulmonary artery anatomy, and left heart abnormalities. The frequency of repeat imaging should be tailored to the individual patient's needs, considering factors such as residual defects, symptoms, and previous imaging findings. **References:** [1] 2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.

Infants with pulmonary atresia undergo Rastelli's procedures. Without surgery, mortality exceeds 50% by 3 years of age.

[Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md] The 2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease recommend that all women with ACHD receive appropriate counseling regarding contraception choices and the risks of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum period. [1] Prepregnancy counseling allows for an individualized risk assessment, including a discussion of maternal risks for pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum period, as well as medications that may be teratogenic and require alternative therapies. [2] The guidelines emphasize the importance of clear documentation and contingency plans for anticipated complications related to the presence of CHD. [3] Furthermore, the guidelines suggest that women with ACHD who are at high risk of thrombosis, including those with cyanosis, Fontan physiology, mechanical valves, prior thrombotic events, and PAH, should be counseled on the risks and benefits of anticoagulation during pregnancy. [4] In addition, the guidelines recommend that each patient with ACHD should be counseled regarding the potential for infertility and referral to a specialized reproductive endocrinologist when appropriate. [5] Therefore, based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, women with ACHD considering pregnancy should receive preconception counseling in a specialized ACHD center to ensure an individualized risk assessment and contingency planning. **Recommendation:** Women with Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) considering pregnancy should receive preconception counseling in a specialized ACHD center to ensure an individualized risk assessment and contingency planning. **References:** [1] Stout et al.

[Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]
Routine preoperative resting 12-lead ECG is not useful for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk surgical procedures. 35,141 (Level of Evidence: B) However, for patients with ACHD, the ECG is an essential part of a complete cardiovascular evaluation, and it is recommended to obtain an ECG at baseline for comparison to any subsequently obtained ECG. [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md] This is because asymptomatic arrhythmias seen in patients with ACHD may be associated with development of symptoms and increased risk of death, and are more common in particular lesions or repairs. Bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias may occur, and some may require treatment even when asymptomatic.

* Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is recommended as a baseline study, with periodic follow-up CMR studies to evaluate for anatomic and physiological changes.
* If CMR is contraindicated or there is a history of stent therapy, Cardiac Computed Tomography (CCT) may be used to evaluate cross-sectional imaging status-post-stent therapy for CoA.
* Routine Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) may be unnecessary in a year when CMR imaging is performed, unless clinical indications warrant otherwise. **Indications for Imaging:** * Patients with a history of surgical or transcatheter intervention for CoA should undergo regular follow-up imaging to evaluate for long-term complications such as aneurysm formation, stent fracture, or stent migration.
* Patients with unoperated CoA may require periodic imaging to evaluate for recoarctation or aneurysm formation.
* Patients with a family history of aortic dissection or those with a history of aortic dissection may require more frequent imaging to evaluate for aortic dilation or other complications. **Clinical Guidelines:** * The 2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease recommend that patients with CoA should undergo regular follow-up imaging to evaluate for complications such as recoarctation, aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, and dissection.
* The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend serial evaluation of the size and morphology of the aortic sinuses and ascending aorta by echocardiography, CMR, or CT angiography in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and an aortic diameter greater than 4.0 cm. **Radiation Exposure:** * The frequency of imaging should be weighed against radiation exposure.

Is pregnancy contraindicated in women with Eisenmenger syndrome?,"Yes, pregnancy is contraindicated in women with Eisenmenger syndrome due to high maternal and fetal risk.",2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md,"Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, Eisenmenger syndrome is not directly addressed in the context. However, patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and Eisenmenger syndrome share similar high-risk profiles, particularly during pregnancy. The 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease states that valve intervention is recommended before pregnancy for symptomatic patients with severe AS (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m per second or mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, stage D) (Class I, Level of Evidence: C) [1]. In patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, a condition characterized by pulmonary arterial hypertension and systemic-to-pulmonary shunting, the pregnancy risk is extremely high. While Eisenmenger syndrome is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is essential to note that the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in these patients is significant, often exceeding 50% [2]. Considering the shared high-risk profile and the recommendations provided for symptomatic patients with severe AS, it is likely that pregnancy would be contraindicated in women with Eisenmenger syndrome due to the potential for severe complications during pregnancy and delivery. However, further consultation with a cardiologist or other relevant specialist is recommended to make an accurate assessment of the patient's individual risk factors and to provide personalized guidance.

Intervention: Recommendations\n\nClass I\n\nValve intervention is recommended before pregnancy for symptomatic patients with severe AS (aortic velocity \u2265 4.0 m per second or mean pressure gradient \u2265 40 mm Hg, stage D). ( Level of Evidence: C)\n\nPatients with severe AS are at high risk for complications during the hemodynamic stress of pregnancy. Early studies demonstrated a very poor outcome for patients with severe AS who become pregnant, with a maternal mortality rate of 17% and fetal and neonatal mortality rate of 32%. Subsequent studies reported better outcomes, but there is still a 3% to 10% risk of complication of HF and up to a 25% risk of arrhythmia. In addition, sudden deterioration and even death may occur, despite meticulous medical care during pregnancy and delivery. Fetal complications, including preterm birth, intrauterine growth retardation, and low birth weight occur in up to 25% of pregnant women with moderate and severe AS. The severity of stenosis and presence of symptoms are predictors of poor outcomes during pregnancy in patients with AS. Valve intervention is recommended for all patients with severe symptomatic AS, regardless of whether or not pregnancy is being contemplated. Women with symptomatic severe AS who wish to become pregnant should have a valve intervention before conception to prevent the possible devastating consequences of progressive or sudden deterioration during pregnancy and delivery. Percutaneous aortic balloon dilation may be considered in patients with noncalcified bicuspid aortic valves, with the understanding that restenosis may occur within several years of the procedure.

How should peri-operative anticoagulants be managed?,They should be managed to balance the risk of bleeding with the risk of thrombosis.,Blood components updated V2 final.md,"**Peri-operative Management of Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Therapy** Peri-operative management of patients receiving anticoagulant therapy requires special attention to balance the risks of surgical bleeding and thromboembolism. The following guidelines are based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature. **General Considerations** * Certain operations such as some ophthalmic, dental, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal procedures can be carried out without interruption of oral anticoagulant therapy [20_Stoelting.md].
* For most operations, anticoagulation needs to be temporarily interrupted, and bridging therapy with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin is instituted in patients at moderate and high risk of thrombosis [20_Stoelting.md]. **Bridging Therapy** * Bridging therapy with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin reduces the risk of VTE by up to 80% [20_Stoelting.md].
* Warfarin should be stopped approximately 5 days before the procedure, and heparin should be started 36 hours after the last dose of warfarin [20_Stoelting.md].
* In patients receiving heparin by continuous infusion, the infusion should be stopped 6 hours before surgery [20_Stoelting.md]. **Antiplatelet Therapy** * Antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and thienopyridine derivatives (e.g., clopidogrel) is often indicated for patients with a history of coronary stents [36].
* These medications may be safely continued for most procedures until the day before surgery as most evidence suggests they do not increase bleeding [127].
* However, discontinuation of these medications 5-7 days before the procedure is recommended for surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in a confined space (brain, posterior chamber of the eye, medullary canal) [128]. **Specific Considerations** * **Dental Procedures**: Warfarin can be safely continued for patients having 1-2 dental extractions or endodontic (root canal) procedures [2013 Thrombosis Canada Wafarin Bridging.md].
* **Colonoscopy & Gastroscopy**: Warfarin interruption will be needed for most patients who undergo colonoscopy because the potential for biopsies and/or polyp removal cannot always be determined beforehand [2013 Thrombosis Canada Wafarin Bridging.md].
* **Minor Diagnostic or Other Procedures**: Caution is warranted with anticoagulation after selected diagnostic tests (e.g., biopsy of kidney, liver, or prostate; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP] with sphincterotomy) or minor surgeries (e.g., pacemaker placement) which are associated with increased bleeding risk [2013 Thrombosis Canada Wafarin Bridging.md]. **Post-operative Management** * The timing of resumption of LMWH or UFH therapy should be assessed based on bleeding risk and adequacy of hemostasis [2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md].
* Patients receiving heparin by continuous infusion should have the infusion restarted 6 hours after surgery [20_Stoelting.md].
* Patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin should have the last dose administered no less than 18 hours preoperatively if they are on a twice-daily regimen and 30 hours preoperatively if they are on a once-daily regimen [20_Stoelting.md]. **Critical Clinical Recommendations** * Patients with a history of VTE, mechanical heart valves, or atrial fibrillation should have their anticoagulation therapy managed carefully during the peri-operative period.
* Patients receiving antiplatelet therapy should have their medications managed carefully during the peri-operative period, and consideration should be given to the use of haemadsorption filters if urgent or emergency cardiopulmonary bypass is undertaken in patients with P2Y12 inhibitors [129]. **Patient Safety Considerations** * Minimizing bleeding is important because of associated morbidity; a delay in warfarin resumption also exposes patients to an increased thromboembolic risk [2013 Thrombosis Canada Wafarin Bridging.md].
* Patients should be closely monitored for signs of bleeding or thromboembolism during the peri-operative period. **Contraindications and Warnings** * Patients with a history of bleeding disorders or those taking medications that increase the risk of bleeding should be carefully managed during the peri-operative period.

In addition, patients with bare metal or drugeluting coronary stents require antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and thienopyridine derivatives (eg, clopidogrel) for varying durations. These patients may present for elective or urgent surgical procedures. Perioperative management involves balancing the risks of surgical bleeding and thromboembolism. Minor procedures may not require interruption of antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy. However, continuation of these medications in the setting of a major surgery increases the risk of bleeding. Thus, it is critical to determine whether the planned procedure necessitates interruption of antithrombotic/antiplatelet therapy and, if so, whether the patient will need bridging therapy to minimize the risk of thromboembolism during the time the antithrombotic effect is subtherapeutic. In many patients, antithrombotic therapy may be safely interrupted until adequate surgical hemostasis is achieved. In other patients, bridging anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH is required until the time of surgery (and reinitiated in the immediate postoperative period). It may also be necessary to postpone elective surgeries in patients where a suitable ' bridge ' has not been identified and antithrombotic therapy is critical; premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary stents has been associated with stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and death 35,36 (Tables 3 and 4)."", ""source"": ""2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""71cb4656-36de-4079-a61e-241a70803a12""}, {""content"": ""Emergencysurgery\n\nIf surgery can wait for 6 -8 h, then 5 mg of intravenous phytomenadione (vitamin K) can restore coagulation factors although this may preclude warfarinisation for a few days subsequently; if this is not possible, anticoagulation can be reversed with 25 -50iu.kg -1 of PCC [126].\n\nAntiplatelet drugs\n\nAntiplatelet drugs are used in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Every effort should be made to measure blood loss volumes cumulatively, with volumetric and gravimetric techniques after all deliveries so escalation is based on actual rather than estimated blood loss. Early recognition of bleeding incorporated into a clear escalation plan of obstetric intervention and involvement of the multi-professional team reduces the use of blood components [81]. In an international RCT, a multicomponent intervention consisting of early detection of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), with a calibrated blood-collection drape and a bundle of /uniFB01 rst-response treatments (uterine massage, oxytocic drugs, tranexamic acid, intravenous /uniFB02 uids, examination and escalation) led to a lower risk of severe PPH, death from bleeding and laparotomy for bleeding when compared with usual care [82], whilst also demonstrating cost-effectiveness [83].\n\nAs soon as abnormal bleeding is recognised ( > 500 ml after a vaginal delivery and > 1000 ml after a caesarean delivery) the obstetrician, anaesthetist and senior midwife should attend to the mother. Blood should be taken for full blood count, clotting studies, group and screen, and a venous blood gas for rapid lactate and haemoglobin measurement. A lactate > 2 mmol.l -1 is an indicator of shock but a normal haemoglobin can be falsely reassuring before resuscitation. A clotting screen, lactate and haemoglobin should be repeated for every 500 ml of continuing blood loss or for clinical concerns to ensure a timely response to an abnormal haemoglobin result or coagulopathy. If available, a paired sample should be taken for VHA. Cell salvage is recommended if abnormal bleeding occurs during caesarean section, and a leucocyte /uniFB01 lter should be used for autotransfusion of processed blood [84]."", ""source"": ""Blood components updated V2 final.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""ef09abf3-4669-4235-a1af-e812dc71d454""}, {""content"": ""Platelet transfusion is required rarely unless PPH is > 5000 ml or platelet count is < 100 \u00d7 10 9 .l -1 from another cause prior to the PPH [91].

The potential advantages and limitations of VHAshave been discussed previously. These can be used in all hospital-based maternity settings [87] and their use across the UK is increasing with a reported 30 maternity units already using them routinely, and a further 36 obstetric units set to use them as part of a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trials (NIHR152057). Interpretation should focus on the /uniFB01 brinogen assay and replacement with /uniFB01 brinogen concentrate or cryoprecipitate prioritised. Laboratory and VHA results should be interpreted within the clinical situation, repeated if bleeding is ongoing, and blood components withheld if bleeding has stopped [92].

7 Every institution should have a major haemorrhage protocol which is regularly audited and reviewed. They should be concise but targeted, and allow for immediate release and protocolised administration of blood components. The protocol should be designed to include robust activation and communication from bedside to laboratory, and should mobilise resources collaterally, such as clinical staff, portering services, blood warmers, pressure infusers, and cell salvage devices [54]. [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]
A structured form of communication (e.g. Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) between clinical and laboratory areas is recommended. Their activation should also mobilise resources collaterally, such as clinical staff, portering services, blood warmers, pressure infusers and cell salvage devices [54]. The key principles of a major haemorrhage protocol include: * Early haemorrhage control
* Blood pressure management (do not attempt to normalise blood pressure during active haemorrhage)
* Target trauma-induced coagulopathy (deliver blood components empirically at first, and use laboratory coagulation tests or VHAs to guide therapy as soon as available)
* Critical care (target endpoints for resuscitation include: pH > 7.2; and normalising base deficit and lactate) [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]
Ensure the clinical course is aimed towards haemorrhage control. Use temporary haemostatic devices (pressure, tourniquets, etc.) followed by surgery or interventional radiology for control of haemorrhage [53, 54]. Blood pressure management: Do not attempt to normalise blood pressure during active haemorrhage. Achieve a lower acceptable blood pressure with volume resuscitation alone. This may need to be modified in patients with identified, or suspected traumatic brain injury, where brain injury is the dominant condition. During uncontrolled haemorrhage, implement major haemorrhage protocols for volume resuscitation [53]. Crystalloids should only be given where there is profound hypotension and no imminent availability of blood components. The use of vasopressors should be avoided during active haemorrhage [53, 54]. Target trauma-induced coagulopathy: Deliver blood components empirically at first and, once in hospital, use laboratory coagulation tests or VHAs to guide therapy as soon as available. Give tranexamic acid (Table 4) immediately, but avoid if more than 3 h from injury, unless there is ongoing evidence of hyperfibrinolysis from point of care testing [54]. Whilst haemorrhage is being controlled, protocolised administration of RBC and FFP in a ratio of 1:1 should be used to replace circulating volume [54]. Consider the administration of cryoprecipitate (two pools) and platelets (one adult therapeutic dose) until test results are available and bleeding is controlled. Administer platelets and cryoprecipitate as per major haemorrhage protocols. Once haemorrhage control is achieved, blood product administration should be guided by regular laboratory and/or VHA testing. Target endpoints for resuscitation include: pH > 7.2; and normalising base deficit and lactate. In summary, having a major haemorrhage protocol in place is crucial for ensuring that patients receive timely and effective care in the event of major bleeding. The protocol should be regularly audited and reviewed to ensure it is concise, targeted, and allows for immediate release and protocolised administration of blood components.

What platelet threshold is recommended in obstetric haemorrhage?,Platelet transfusion should be given if platelet count is < 75 × 10⁹/L in obstetrics.,Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context, the recommended platelet threshold for obstetric haemorrhage is not explicitly stated in terms of a specific platelet count. However, it is mentioned that platelet transfusion is required rarely unless the platelet count is less than 100 × 10^9/l or PPH is > 5000 ml [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].

It is worth noting that the use of platelet transfusion in obstetric haemorrhage is generally reserved for severe cases, such as when the platelet count is low or PPH is > 5000 ml. In these situations, platelet transfusion may be necessary to prevent or treat coagulopathy. In terms of specific recommendations for platelet transfusion in obstetric haemorrhage, the provided context suggests that the following thresholds may be relevant: * Platelet count < 75 × 10^9/l: Platelets should be transfused [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* Platelet count < 100 × 10^9/l: Platelet transfusion may be required, especially if PPH is > 5000 ml [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].

Every effort should be made to measure blood loss volumes cumulatively, with volumetric and gravimetric techniques after all deliveries so escalation is based on actual rather than estimated blood loss. Early recognition of bleeding incorporated into a clear escalation plan of obstetric intervention and involvement of the multi-professional team reduces the use of blood components [81]. In an international RCT, a multicomponent intervention consisting of early detection of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), with a calibrated blood-collection drape and a bundle of /uniFB01 rst-response treatments (uterine massage, oxytocic drugs, tranexamic acid, intravenous /uniFB02 uids, examination and escalation) led to a lower risk of severe PPH, death from bleeding and laparotomy for bleeding when compared with usual care [82], whilst also demonstrating cost-effectiveness [83].\n\nAs soon as abnormal bleeding is recognised ( > 500 ml after a vaginal delivery and > 1000 ml after a caesarean delivery) the obstetrician, anaesthetist and senior midwife should attend to the mother.

However, it does mention the use of platelet transfusions in certain situations, as well as the role of prothrombin complex concentrate and bridging anticoagulation therapy. **Platelet transfusions:** The context suggests that platelet transfusions are not recommended for routine prophylaxis in patients with a normal or mildly thrombocytopenic platelet count (10 × 10^9/L or above) [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. However, in patients with a platelet count below 10 × 10^9/L, platelet transfusions may be considered [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. **Prothrombin complex concentrate:** The context mentions the use of prothrombin complex concentrate in patients with bleeding or anticoagulation reversal, but does not specifically address prophylactic use before low-risk invasive procedures [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md]. **Bridging anticoagulation therapy:** The context discusses bridging anticoagulation therapy in patients at moderate to high risk of thromboembolism, but does not specifically address the use of FFP in this context [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md]. **Conclusion:** Based on the provided context, there is no clear evidence-based recommendation for prophylactic FFP before low-risk invasive procedures. The use of platelet transfusions and bridging anticoagulation therapy may be considered in specific situations, but the role of FFP is not explicitly addressed. **Recommendation:** The available context does not provide sufficient information to answer this question, and therefore, it is recommended to consult current clinical guidelines and protocols for specific guidance on prophylactic FFP use before low-risk invasive procedures. **Patient Safety Consideration:** It is essential to weigh the potential risks of bleeding against the risk of thrombosis when deciding on anticoagulation management in patients undergoing low-risk invasive procedures.

Is PCC recommended for rapid reversal of warfarin in major bleeding?,"Yes, PCC is indicated for rapid reversal of warfarin in life-threatening bleeding.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context from the clinical guidelines and medical literature, PCC is recommended for rapid reversal of warfarin in major bleeding. * PCC, specifically four-factor PCC, is recommended for the rapid reversal of warfarin in life-threatening bleeding .
* Four-factor PCC is more effective than three-factor PCC in reversing warfarin .
* PCC is better than recombinant activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa) in reversing warfarin .
* PCC can reverse warfarin anticoagulation within 10-30 minutes, making it a suitable option for emergency situations [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* The recommended starting dose of PCC is 25 IU/kg, but this may vary according to local guidelines [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* It is essential to also give 5-10 mg of intravenous vitamin K due to the short half-life of factor VII (6 hours) [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. It is worth noting that while PCC is recommended for rapid reversal of warfarin in major bleeding, the decision to use PCC should be guided by clinical and laboratory assessment of haemostatic efficacy, and careful consideration of the potential risks associated with its use, including thrombosis and hypersensitivity/allergic reactions [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].

Should vitamin K be co-administered with PCC?,"Yes, 5–10mg intravenous vitamin K should be given with PCC to maintain correction.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"**Clinical Question:** Should vitamin K be co-administered with Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC)? **Evidence-Based Answer:** According to the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md], vitamin K should be co-administered with PCC when used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation. The literature states: ""Due to the short half-life of factor VII (6 h), it is essential to also give 5 -10 mg of intravenous vitamin K."" This recommendation is based on the understanding that PCC contains factor VII, which has a short half-life of 6 hours. Administering vitamin K alongside PCC will help maintain the correction of warfarin anticoagulation and prevent the depletion of factor VII. **Clinical Guidelines:** * Start with a dose of 25 IU/kg of PCC [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* Check an INR 30 minutes after dosing to assess the degree of correction.
* Consider additional dosing based on clinical and laboratory assessment of haemostatic efficacy.
* Administer 5-10 mg of intravenous vitamin K alongside PCC to prevent factor VII depletion. **Important Considerations:** * Vitamin K is essential for the hepatic synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as protein C and protein S.
* Vitamin K deficiency can lead to depletion of these factors, resulting in prolongation of PT and potentially life-threatening bleeding.
* Vitamin K should be administered to maintain reversal of warfarin anticoagulation, even if other agents are used. **Conclusion:** Vitamin K should be co-administered with PCC when used to reverse warfarin anticoagulation.

Is prehospital tranexamic acid beneficial within 3 hours of trauma?,"Yes, tranexamic acid within 3 hours reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context, the question is whether prehospital tranexamic acid is beneficial within 3 hours of trauma. The available evidence suggests that tranexamic acid administered within 3 hours of injury reduces mortality in patients who are bleeding after trauma . Furthermore, a recent study by Gruen et al. observed a lower 28-day mortality rate in patients who received tranexamic acid, but no difference in the primary outcome of survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months . In contrast, the CRYOSTAT-2 trial found no evidence of an effect on the primary outcome of all-cause mortality at 28 days when high-dose cryoprecipitate was administered within 90 minutes of randomization and 3 hours of injury . However, this trial also showed that patients with penetrating trauma who received cryoprecipitate had a higher 28-day mortality rate . In summary, the available evidence suggests that prehospital tranexamic acid may be beneficial in reducing mortality in patients who are bleeding after trauma, but further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal timing and dosage of tranexamic acid administration. **Key Recommendations:** * Prehospital tranexamic acid may be considered in patients who are bleeding after trauma and are at risk of major hemorrhage.
* Tranexamic acid should be administered within 3 hours of injury.
* Further research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of prehospital tranexamic acid and to determine the optimal timing and dosage of administration. **Important Considerations:** * Patients with penetrating trauma may have a higher risk of mortality when receiving cryoprecipitate, and alternative treatments may be considered.

Haemoglobin drops by a mean (SD) of 0.52 (0.69) g.l -1 per day whilst on ICU [70]. Approximately 30 -40% of patients who are critically ill will have moderately severe anaemia (Hb < 90 g.l -1 ) at some point during their ICU stay [71]. Patients who are critically ill display the hallmarks of anaemia of in /uniFB02 ammation characterised by disturbed iron homeostasis, impaired erythropoiesis and reduced red cell survival [72]. This is often exacerbated by haemodilution and blood loss from phlebotomy, extracorporeal circuits and/or surgery [71].\n\nThe current mainstay of treatment for anaemia in patients who are critically ill is RBC transfusion. A restrictive transfusion threshold of Hb < 70 g.l -1 is recommended in most patients, including those with ARDS and septic shock [73, 74]. Uncertainties on the optimal transfusion remain in patients who are critically ill with acute coronary syndromes or ischaemic heart disease (see Section on ' Red blood cells ' ).

Haemoglobin drops by a mean (SD) of 0.52 (0.69) g.l -1 per day whilst on ICU [70]. Approximately 30 -40% of patients who are critically ill will have moderately severe anaemia (Hb < 90 g.l -1 ) at some point during their ICU stay [71]. Patients who are critically ill display the hallmarks of anaemia of in /uniFB02 ammation characterised by disturbed iron homeostasis, impaired erythropoiesis and reduced red cell survival [72]. This is often exacerbated by haemodilution and blood loss from phlebotomy, extracorporeal circuits and/or surgery [71].\n\nThe current mainstay of treatment for anaemia in patients who are critically ill is RBC transfusion. A restrictive transfusion threshold of Hb < 70 g.l -1 is recommended in most patients, including those with ARDS and septic shock [73, 74].

This decrease in blood flow is attributable to acute thrombus formation at a site where an atherosclerotic plaque fissures, ruptures, or ulcerates, which creates a local environment that favors thrombogenesis. Typically, vulnerable plaques-that is, those with rich lipid cores and thin fibrous caps-are most prone to rupture. Plaques that rupture are rarely of a size that causes significant coronary obstruction. By contrast, flow-restrictive plaques that produce angina pectoris and stimulate development of collateral circulation are less likely to rupture.\n\n\u25a0 Th e primary goal in the management of STEMI is reestablishment of blood fl ow in the obstructed coronary artery as soon as possible. Th is can be achieved by reperfusion therapy or coronary angioplasty with or without placement of an intracoronary stent.

It is also reasonable to begin perioperative beta blockers in patients with intermediate- or high-risk myocardial ischemia noted in preoperative risk stratification tests or in patients with ≥ 3 RCRI risk factors. However, the decision to begin beta blockers should be influenced by whether a patient is at risk for stroke and whether the patient has other relative contraindications.

An additional consideration, irrespective of the timing of surgery, is that surgery is associated with proin /uniFB02 ammatory and prothrombotic effects that may increase the risk of coronary thrombosis at the level of the stented vascular segment as well as throughout the coronary vasculature (154,155).\n\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/ by Lea Binder on 10/04/2016\n\nJ A C C V O L . 6 8 , N O . 1 0 , 2 0 1 6 S E P T E M B E R 6 , 2 0 1 6 : 1 0 8 2 -1 1 5\n\nLevine et al .\n\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n\n1103\n\n30 d \u2014 \u2014"", ""source"": ""2016 ACC_AHA DAPT Guidelines.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""2e872d55-4107-4384-96b6-a49834295f36""}]",110
how long should dual antiplatelet therapy be continued after a drug-eluting stent,1 year with drug eluting stents,01_Stoelting.md,"**Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) after a Drug-Eluting Stent** According to the 2016 ACC/AHA DAPT Guidelines, the recommended duration of DAPT after a drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation varies depending on the clinical status of the patient [Source: 2016 ACC_AHA DAPT Guidelines.md]. **General Recommendations:** * A Class I recommendation (should be given) is made for at least 6 to 12 months of DAPT.
* A Class IIb recommendation (may be reasonable) is made for prolonged DAPT beyond the initial 6- to 12-month period. **Factors Influencing DAPT Duration:** * Patients with higher ischemic risk and lower bleeding risk may benefit from longer DAPT duration.
* Patients with lower ischemic risk and high bleeding risk may be considered for shorter DAPT duration. **Studies on DAPT Duration:** * A systematic review and meta-analysis found that an abbreviated duration of DAPT (< 6 months) following second-generation DES implantation was safe in patients with coronary artery disease * A pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analysis found that extended duration DAPT (> 12 months) was associated with increased mortality in patients treated with drug-eluting stents **Key Recommendations:** * Aspirin therapy should be continued indefinitely in patients with coronary artery disease.
* The recommended daily dose of aspirin in patients treated with DAPT is 81 mg (range, 75 mg to 100 mg). **Conclusion:** The optimal duration of DAPT after a drug-eluting stent implantation varies depending on the clinical status of the patient. A minimum period of 6 to 12 months of DAPT is recommended, and a decision to continue DAPT beyond this period should be made on an individual basis, taking into account the benefit-risk ratio, patient preference, and clinical judgment.

Intraoperative events can significantly impact the management of patients with MS undergoing noncardiac surgery. **Significant Intraoperative Events in Mitral Stenosis:** 1. **Tachycardia:** Tachycardia should be avoided in patients with MS due to the shortened diastolic left ventricular filling time across the stenotic mitral valve, resulting in an increase in left atrial pressure.

However, in the presence of severe mitral regurgitation, the use of invasive monitoring is helpful for detecting the adequacy of cardiac output and the hemodynamic response to anesthetic and vasodilating drugs and for facilitating intravenous fl uid replacement. Mitral regurgitation produces a V wave on the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure waveform. Changes in V wave amplitude can assist in estimating the magnitude and direction of changes in the degree of mitral regurgitation. However, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure may be a poor measure of le ft ventricular end-diastolic volume in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation.

* The population of adults with congenital heart disease, surgically corrected or uncorrected, is estimated to exceed 1 million persons in the United States [Source: 03_Stoelting.md].
* Advances in imaging modalities such as echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and three-dimensional echocardiography have increased the understanding of complex cardiac malformations and allowed visualization of blood flow and vascular structures [Source: 03_Stoelting.md]. Regarding atrial septal defects specifically, a recent study found that: * Atrial septal defects are a type of acyanotic congenital heart disease characterized by a left-to-right intracardiac shunt [Source: 03_Stoelting.md].
* The ultimate result of an ASD is increased pulmonary blood flow with pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, and eventually congestive heart failure [Source: 03_Stoelting.md].

According to the provided context, the congenital heart defects that result in a right to left intracardiac shunt are: * **Eisenmenger's Syndrome**: This is a complication of a large left-to-right shunt that eventually leads to pulmonary hypertension and reversal of the shunt to a right-to-left shunt [1].
* **Tetralogy of Fallot**: This congenital heart defect consists of four components: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. The shunt in Tetralogy of Fallot is typically right-to-left, resulting in cyanosis [1].
* **Tricuspid Atresia**: This congenital heart defect involves the absence or abnormal development of the tricuspid valve, resulting in a right-to-left shunt [1].
* **Truncus Arteriosus**: This congenital heart defect involves a single common blood vessel arising from the heart, resulting in a right-to-left shunt [1].
* **Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return**: This congenital heart defect involves the pulmonary veins connecting to the right atrium or one of its tributaries, resulting in a right-to-left shunt [1]. **Key Points** * The shunt direction can change over time, depending on the underlying cardiac pathology and the patient's hemodynamic status.
* Management of anesthesia in patients with right-to-left shunts requires careful consideration of the patient's underlying cardiac disease and the potential for adverse effects on cardiac function.
* Antibiotic prophylaxis to protect against infective endocarditis is recommended for patients with unrepaired congenital heart defects, including those with right-to-left shunts. **References** [1] Stoelting, R.

Th e most common auscultatory fi nding is a systolic ejection murmur heard along the le ft sternal border resulting from blood fl ow across the stenotic pulmonic valve or right ventricular out fl ow tract. In contrast to pulmonic stenosis with an intact ventricular septum, the murmur of tetralogy of Fallot becomes shorter and less intense with increasing severity of pulmonic stenosis. During a hypercyanotic spell, the murmur disappears or becomes very so ft . A holosystolic murmur of VSD may be heard in the le ft lower sternal border in some children. Congestive heart failure rarely develops, because the large VSD permits equilibration of intraventricular pressures and cardiac workload. Chest radiographs show evidence of decreased lung vascularity, and the heart is boot shaped with an upturned right ventricular apex and a concave main pulmonary arterial segment. Th e ECG is characterized by changes indicative of right axis deviation and right ventricular hypertrophy. Arterial oxygen desaturation is present even when the patient breathes 100% oxygen (Pa o 2 is usually <50 mm Hg), indicating central cyanosis. Compensatory erythropoiesis is proportional to the magnitude of the arterial hypoxemia. Th e Pa co 2 and arterial pH are usually normal.

what drugs caused drug induced heart rate increases?,"atropine or glycopyrrolate, sympathomimetic drugs, caffeine, nicotine, cocaine or amphetamines",04_Stoelting.md,"Based on the provided context, the following drugs are known to cause an increase in heart rate: * Atropine or glycopyrrolate: These anticholinergic medications block the action of acetylcholine on the SA node, leading to an increase in heart rate. [Source: 04_Stoelting.md]
* Sympathomimetic drugs: These medications, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and isoproterenol, stimulate the beta-1 receptors in the heart, leading to an increase in heart rate. [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* Caffeine: Caffeine is a stimulant that can increase heart rate by stimulating the beta-1 receptors in the heart. [Source: 04_Stoelting.md]
* Nicotine: Nicotine is a stimulant that can increase heart rate by stimulating the beta-1 receptors in the heart. [Source: 04_Stoelting.md]
* Cocaine or amphetamines: These stimulant drugs can increase heart rate by stimulating the beta-1 receptors in the heart. [Source: 04_Stoelting.md] It's worth noting that these medications can have varying effects on heart rate depending on the individual and the specific circumstances. Additionally, while these medications can increase heart rate, they can also have other effects on the cardiovascular system, such as increasing blood pressure or altering cardiac output. In the context of anesthesia, it's essential to consider the potential effects of these medications on heart rate and to use them judiciously to avoid adverse effects. The provided context also mentions Esmolol, a beta-1 selective blocker that is used to decrease heart rate, rather than increase it. It's also worth noting that the provided context mentions Bezold-Jarisch Reflex, which can be triggered by noxious ventricular stimuli and leads to hypotension and bradycardia.

Th e ECG during sinus tachycardia shows a normal P wave before every QRS complex. Th e PR interval is normal unless a co-existing conduction block exists. Typically, it is a nonparoxysmal increase in heart rate that speeds up and slows down gradually. Sinus tachycardia is caused by acceleration of SA node discharge secondary to sympathetic stimulation.\n\nSinus tachycardia without manifestations of hemodynamic instability is not life-threatening. It can occur as part of the normal physiologic response to stimuli such as fear or pain or as a pharmacologic response to medications or substances such as atropine or ca ff eine. Since it does increase myocardial oxygen demand, it can contribute to myocardial ischemia and congestive heart failure in susceptible patients. Sinus tachycardia can also occur as a compensatory mechanism in the setting of signi fi cant heart disease such as congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction (Table 4-1). In these circumstances, the increased heart rate is usually a physiologic e ff ort to increase cardiac output. Sinus tachycardia is the most common supraventricular dysrhythmia associated with acute myocardial infarction, occurring in 30% to 40% of these patients."", ""source"": ""04_Stoelting.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""5f518252-214a-4b95-85d4-b25a98806f78""}]",129

Characteristically, the ventricular rate is about 150 beats per minute. Atrial fl utter frequently occurs in association with other dysrhythmias such as atrial fi brillation or atrial tachycardia.

WPW syndrome is a rare heart condition characterized by an abnormal electrical pathway in the heart that can cause fast heart rhythms. However, I can provide information on drugs that are contraindicated in patients with WPW syndrome, based on general principles of anesthesiology. **Drugs to avoid in patients with WPW syndrome:** 1. **Beta-agonists**: Drugs that stimulate the beta-adrenergic receptors, such as isoproterenol, may worsen the condition by increasing the heart rate and potentially triggering a life-threatening arrhythmia.
2. **Sympathomimetics**: Drugs that mimic the effects of the sympathetic nervous system, such as ephedrine, may also exacerbate the condition. Please note that these contraindications are general principles and not specific to WPW syndrome. The management of WPW syndrome during anesthesia requires careful consideration of the patient's underlying condition and the potential effects of anesthetic agents on the heart. The available context does not provide sufficient information to discuss specific anesthetic management strategies for patients with WPW syndrome. However, I can suggest that a comprehensive anesthetic plan should be developed in consultation with a cardiologist or anesthesiologist experienced in the management of patients with WPW syndrome.

what is the definition of hypertension?,when blood pressure measures 140/90 or higher,05_Stoelting.md,"**Definition of Hypertension** Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition characterized by elevated blood pressure levels that can lead to end-organ damage and cardiovascular disease. According to the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7), the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, hypertension is defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher in adults . **Classification of Hypertension** The classification of hypertension is based on the level of blood pressure. The JNC 7 report categorizes blood pressure into the following levels: * Normal: Less than 120/80 mmHg
* Elevated: 120-129/80 mmHg
* Stage 1 hypertension: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
* Stage 2 hypertension: 140/90 mmHg or higher . **Prevalence of Hypertension** The prevalence of hypertension in the adult population in the United States is approximately 30% . Hypertension is more common in certain populations, such as African Americans, with a prevalence of approximately 40% [Source: 05_Stoelting.md]. **Causes of Hypertension** Essential hypertension is the most common cause of hypertension, accounting for approximately 90% of cases [Source: 05_Stoelting.md]. Other causes of secondary hypertension include renal artery stenosis, primary aldosteronism, and obstructive sleep apnea . **Treatment of Hypertension** The standard goal of therapy for essential hypertension is to decrease systemic blood pressure to less than 140/90 mmHg. In the presence of concurrent diabetes mellitus or renal disease, current guidelines recommend lowering the blood pressure to less than 130/80 mmHg [Source: 05_Stoelting.md]. **Important Considerations** It is essential to note that hypertension can have significant consequences, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and stroke.

Th ere may be frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep. Hypopnea is a reduction in the size or number of breaths compared with normal ventilation and is associated with some degree of arterial desaturation. Apnea occurs when the pharyngeal airways collapse. Pharyngeal patency depends on the action of dilator muscles that prevent upper airway collapse. Th e pharyngeal muscle tone is decreased during sleep, and in many individuals, this reduced tone leads to a signi fi cant narrowing of the upper airway, resulting in turbulent air fl ow and snoring. In susceptible individuals this may progress to severe snoring and, ultimately, to sleep apnea. Sleep fragmentation is the most likely explanation for the daytime somnolence, which is associated with impaired concentration, memory problems, and even motor vehicle accidents in patients with sleep apnea. Airway obstruction may induce physiologic changes that include arterial hypoxemia, arterial hypercarbia, polycythemia, systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure. In addition, patients may complain of morning headaches caused by nocturnal carbon dioxide retention and cerebral vasodilation.

This can include: * Encephalopathy
* Intracerebral hemorrhage
* Acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary edema
* Unstable angina
* Acute myocardial infarction
* Dissecting aortic aneurysm
* Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
* Renal insufficiency According to the clinical guidelines and medical literature, a parturient woman with pregnancy-induced hypertension may develop signs of encephalopathy with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 100 mmHg. Even in the absence of symptoms, a parturient with a diastolic blood pressure higher than 109 mmHg is considered to have a hypertensive emergency and requires immediate treatment. **Clinical Features and Treatment** The goal of treatment in hypertensive emergencies is to decrease the diastolic blood pressure promptly but gradually. A precipitous decrease in blood pressure to normotensive levels could provoke coronary or cerebral ischemia. Typically, mean arterial pressure is reduced by about 20% within the first hour of treatment and then more gradually over the next 2 to 6 hours to a target blood pressure of about 160/110 mmHg if tolerated as indicated by the absence of symptomatic hypoperfusion of target organs. The initial choice of drug for treatment of a hypertensive emergency is based on an analysis of all of the patient's medical conditions and the symptoms and signs at presentation (Table 5-6). Placement of an intraarterial catheter to continuously monitor systemic blood pressure is recommended during treatment with potent vasoactive drugs. The recommended treatment options include: * Sodium nitroprusside 0.5 to 10.0 mcg/kg/min IV

what is the definition of pulmonary artery hypertension?,mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 25 mm Hg at rest,05_Stoelting.md,"**Definition of Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH)** PAH is defined hemodynamically as a mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 25 mm Hg at rest with a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, left atrial pressure, or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15 mm Hg or less, and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of more than 3 Wood units [Source: 05_Stoelting.md]. **Classification of PAH** The 2008 Fourth World Symposium on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension recommends avoiding the terms ""primary"" and ""secondary"" pulmonary hypertension and using ""idiopathic PAH (IPAH)"" instead. IPAH refers to sporadic cases of PAH with no familial context and no identifiable risk factor. Heritable PAH is preferred over familial PAH, and most patients with heritable PAH have mutations in bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) [Source: 05_Stoelting.md]. **Clinical Presentation and Evaluation** PAH often presents with vague symptoms, including breathlessness, weakness, fatigue, and abdominal distention. Syncope and angina pectoris are indicative of severe limitations in cardiac output and possible myocardial ischemia. Chest pain likely reflects reduced coronary blood flow to a markedly hypertrophied right ventricle. On physical examination, the patient may exhibit a parasternal lift, murmurs of pulmonic insufficiency and/or tricuspid regurgitation, a pronounced pulmonic component of S2, an S3 gallop, jugular venous distention with a large a wave in the jugular venous pulsation, peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, and ascites [Source: 05_Stoelting.md]. **Diagnostic Studies** A 6-minute walk test can be performed to assess functional status and noninvasively follow the progress of therapy. Right-sided heart catheterization provides a definitive means to determine disease severity and to ascertain which patients can respond to vasodilator therapy. A potent vasodilator such as prostacyclin, NO, adenosine, or prostaglandin E1 is administered. The result of the vasodilator test is considered positive if PVR and mean pulmonary arterial pressure both decrease acutely by 20% or more [Source: 05_Stoelting.md]. **Key Definitions and Criteria** Pulmonary hypertension is defined as elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure to ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest and does not imply a specific underlying pathophysiology [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. Pulmonary hypertension is further classified on the basis of the presumed mechanism, including elevation of pulmonary venous pressure, parenchymal or restrictive lung disease, rheumatologic disease, portal hypertension, toxin exposure, and thromboembolism [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. **Adverse Effects of Pulmonary Hypertension Therapies** Adverse effects of pulmonary hypertension therapies in patients with ACHD with pulmonary hypertension may differ from those noted in other patients, because of concomitant multiorgan and vascular effects from longstanding congenital heart and vascular disease [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md].",3,"The RAG model's answer is mostly correct, providing a clear definition of pulmonary artery hypertension and additional information on classification, clinical presentation, diagnostic studies, and key definitions.

Pulmonary hypertension is further classified on the basis of the presumed mechanism (including elevation of pulmonary venous pressure [denoted as 'postcapillary pulmonary hypertension'], parenchymal or restrictive lung disease, rheumatologic disease, portal hypertension, toxin exposure, and thromboembolism). It is also classified by developmental or acquired anatomic abnormalities of decreased pulmonary arterial capacitance, impedance, or stenosis throughout the pulmonary arterial vascular bed. PAH as initially described required pulmonary venous pressure \u2264 15 mm Hg with concomitant elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance. Although left-to-right shunting was the initial research model of triggered PAH, pulmonary hypertension in patients with ACHD can be caused by, or associated with, any of the factors described above. Effective therapies may be specific to the primary mechanism of pulmonary hypertension in a given patient, so patients with CHD should have thorough investigation for all potential contributing etiologies to pulmonary hypertension that may require specific therapy if best clinical outcomes are to be achieved.

[Source: 06_Stoelting.md]
* **Moist Rales**: the presence of crackles or rales in the lungs, which are indicative of pulmonary congestion and edema. These rales may be localized to the lung bases in mild cases or become diffuse in more severe cases. [Source: 06_Stoelting.md]
* **Resting Tachycardia**: an increased heart rate at rest, which is a compensatory mechanism to try to maintain adequate cardiac output. [Source: 06_Stoelting.md]
* **Third Heart Sound (S3 Gallop or Ventricular Diastolic Gallop)**: a low-frequency sound heard during late diastole, which is a sign of increased left ventricular volume and pressure. [Source: 06_Stoelting.md] These physical exam findings are supported by the clinical guidelines and medical literature, as mentioned in the provided context. The presence of these signs and symptoms suggests that the patient is experiencing decreased cardiac reserve and low cardiac output, which are characteristic of LV failure. **Important Considerations** * The absence of these classic physical exam findings does not rule out LV failure, as some patients may not exhibit all of these signs.

Diagnostic Testing-Cardiac Catheterization\n\nLeft ventriculography and/or hemodynamic measurements are indicated when clinical assessment and/or noninvasive tests are inconclusive or discordant regarding 1) severity of MR, 2) LV function, or 3) the need for surgery. Imaging with these techniques is adequate for evaluation of MR in the majority of cases. However, invasive hemodynamic evaluation may be necessary in some cases, especially when there is a clinical discrepancy between symptomatic status and noninvasive testing. Elevated filling pressures support a cardiac cause for dyspnea and/or may indicate severely abnormal pathophysiology even when the patient claims to be asymptomatic. Conversely, a normal invasive hemodynamic examination in a symptomatic patient with what appears to be less than severe MR suggests a noncardiac cause for the symptoms. Hemodynamic evaluation can be especially helpful in patients with concomitant lung disease. Normal left atrial (or wedge) pressure and a large transpulmonary gradient suggest pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease rather than mitral valve disease. Patients usually complain of dyspnea with exertion, yet noninvasive evaluation is usually made at rest. Hemodynamic measurement made during either handgrip or dynamic exercise may be very revealing. Increased load with exercise may bring out severely disordered hemodynamics explaining the patient's exercise-related symptoms. Left ventriculography may also be of diagnostic benefit. Whereas echo-Doppler interrogation of the mitral valve measures flow velocity, ventriculography uses the density of contrast to determine the amount of blood flow from the left ventricle to LA. Although only semiquantitative, a carefully performed ventriculogram can add significantly to the diagnostic data pool.\n\nSupporting Reference: (42)\n\nPage 83 of 235 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on March 3, 2014"", ""source"": ""2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""7dc0c889-d7e3-4e1e-b0e0-01d0e51b1bc0""}]",141
