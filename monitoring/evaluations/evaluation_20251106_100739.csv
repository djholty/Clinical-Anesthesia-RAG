When should a preoperative BNP be ordered?,"when the patient will be admitted post operatively with an age greater than 65, or 45-65 with significant cardiac disease or a revised cardiac risk index score (RCRI) of 1 or more",2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md,"Based on the provided context, a preoperative BNP (N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide) should be ordered in the following situations: 1. **Risk Stratification with Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)**: If a patient's age is ≥65 years, RCRI ≥1, or age 45-64 years with significant cardiovascular disease, order NT-proBNP/BNP. This recommendation is based on the 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery (Table 3) [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. 2. **Emergency Surgery**: In emergency surgery situations, proceed to surgery without additional preoperative cardiac assessment unless there is an unstable cardiac condition or suspected undiagnosed severe pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) or obstructive cardiac disease. However, if NT-proBNP or BNP is not available, proceed with the surgery without additional routine postoperative monitoring [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. 3. **Urgent/Semiurgent Surgery**: For urgent/semiurgent surgery, proceed to surgery without additional preoperative cardiac assessment unless there is an unstable cardiac condition or suspected undiagnosed severe PHTN or obstructive cardiac disease. However, if NT-proBNP or BNP is not available, proceed with the surgery without additional routine postoperative monitoring [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. 4. **Elective Surgery**: For elective surgery, order NT-proBNP/BNP if the patient's age is ≥65 years or 18-64 years with significant cardiovascular disease. If the NT-proBNP or BNP result is positive (≥300 ng/L or BNP ≥92 mg/L), proceed with the surgery only if there is no unstable cardiac condition or suspected undiagnosed severe PHTN or obstructive cardiac disease [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. It is essential to note that the provided context only addresses the ordering of BNP in the context of cardiac risk assessment and perioperative management. The decision to order BNP should be made based on the individual patient's clinical scenario and the specific recommendations outlined in the provided clinical guidelines. **Important Consideration**: The decision to withhold or continue medications, such as beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, or statins, should be made based on the patient's specific clinical scenario and the recommendations outlined in the provided clinical guidelines [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. **Patient Safety Consideration**: When considering the perioperative management of patients with cardiovascular disease, it is essential to weigh the potential benefits and risks of surgery against the potential risks of withholding or continuing specific medications.

when should a preoperative echocardiogram be ordered,"an echocardiogram may be considered if clinical assessment is suggestive of an undiagnosed severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality such as aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiomyopathy, or severe pulmonary hypertension",2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md,"**Preoperative Echocardiogram Ordering: Evidence-Based Guidelines** The clinical guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), and Canadian Society of Cardiology (CCS) provide recommendations for preoperative echocardiogram ordering in non-cardiac surgery patients. **Key Recommendations:** 1. **Routine Preoperative Echocardiogram Not Recommended:** The CCS guidelines suggest that routine preoperative resting echocardiography is not recommended for enhancing perioperative cardiac risk estimation in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md].
2. **Exceptions to Routine Echocardiogram:** However, there are specific clinical scenarios where preoperative echocardiography is recommended: * Undiagnosed severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality (e.g., aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) * Severe pulmonary hypertension * Suspected undiagnosed cardiomyopathy [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md] * Acute or chronic cardiopulmonary disease based on history and physical exam, if it will change management [Source: 2021 CAS Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia.md]

The four largest clinical trials in sepsis resuscitation used moderate to large amounts of fluids in the first 72 hours. Although Rivers (393) administered over 13 L of fluids, ProCESS (64), ARISE (65) and ProMISe (66) administered approximately 7 to 8 L in the usual care groups with a reported low mortality rate. However, recent evidence suggests that IV fluids used to restore organ perfusion may damage vascular integrity and lead to organ dysfunction (394). Data from observational studies have shown an association of high-volume fluid resuscitation and increased mortality, but these studies are likely affected by unmeasured variables (i.e., the administration of higher amounts of fluids to sicker patients) (395, 396). Recent data emerging from Africa showed that higher volume fluid resuscitation in adults was associated with increased mortality, but the generalizability of these data is limited due to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and malnutrition in the patients enrolled and the resource-scarce conditions with limited access to ICUs (69).\n\nThe current evidence evaluating a restrictive IV fluid strategy in the management of septic patients\n\ne1096\n\nwww.ccmjournal.org\n\nNovember 2021 \u2022 Volume 49 \u2022 Number 11\n\nOnline Special Article"", ""source"": ""2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""38d733b6-567e-47c9-a798-5cc6d95c11a5""}, {""content"": ""for patients on oral or parenteral anticoagulant therapy.\n\nA Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society Practice Resources: Choosing Wisely Canada.

what is the incidence of post dural puncture headache?,1 percent,2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md,"**Incidence of Postdural Puncture Headache** The incidence of postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is approximately 1% following any neuraxial procedure [1: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]. However, this incidence increases significantly with accidental dural puncture using a 16-18G epidural needle, with a greater than 50% incidence [1: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]. **Factors Influencing Incidence** The size of the dural puncture is a significant risk factor for PDPH. Studies have shown that the use of pencil-point needles (e.g., Whitacre, Sprotte, Pencan, and Gertie-Marx) decreases the risk of PDPH compared with cutting needles (e.g., Quincke) of the same size [1: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]. Additionally, the use of a 27G pencil-point needle increases the risk of block failure without significantly decreasing the incidence of PDPH compared with 25G or 26G needles [1: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]. **Clinical Features and Diagnosis** PDPH is typically characterized by a frontal or occipital headache that is exacerbated by upright posture and relieved by horizontal positioning [2: Anesthesia Notes.md]. Other associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, and ocular and auditory disturbances [2: Anesthesia Notes.md]. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical features, and imaging studies are not recommended unless symptoms suggest another diagnosis [2: Anesthesia Notes.md]. **Treatment and Prophylaxis** Treatment of PDPH typically involves conservative measures, including bed rest, hydration, oral analgesics, and caffeine [1: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]. Epidural blood patch is considered the most effective treatment for PDPH, with a success rate of approximately 75% [2: Anesthesia Notes.md]. However, complications associated with epidural blood patch include back pain, neck pain, radicular pain, and meningitis [2: Anesthesia Notes.md]. Prophylactic measures, such as bed rest, hydration, and abdominal binders, have not been shown to be effective in preventing PDPH [2: Anesthesia Notes.md]. Prophylactic epidural blood patches or saline have also not been shown to reduce the risk of PDPH [2: Anesthesia Notes.md]. **Neurologic Complications** Neurologic complications, such as subdural hematoma, cerebral venous thrombosis, and bacterial meningitis, are associated with PDPH [1: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]. Other complications, such as cranial nerve palsy, seizures, and dural sinus thrombosis, are rare but can occur [2: Anesthesia Notes.md]. **References:** [1: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]

Examination of CSF reveals clear fl uid, since subdural blood does not typically have access to the subarachnoid CSF. Diagnosis of a subdural hematoma is confi rmed by CT. Head trauma is the most common cause of a subdural hematoma. Patients may view the causative head trauma as trivial or may even have forgotten it. Th is presentation is especially prevalent in elderly patients. Occasionally, subdural hematoma formation is spontaneous, such as in patients receiving hemodialysis or those being treated with anticoagulants.\n\nSigns and symptoms of a subdural hematoma characteristically evolve gradually over several days (in contrast to epidural hematomas) because the hematoma is due to slow venous bleeding. Headache is a universal complaint. Drowsiness and obtundation are characteristic fi ndings, but the magnitude of these changes may fl uctuate from hour to hour.

For patients undergoing OLV in the lateral position, a FiO2 of 0.4 can provide adequate oxygenation [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]. However, for patients undergoing OLV in the supine position, a FiO2 of 0.5-0.8 is recommended at the initiation of OLV, which should be titrated to the minimum required to achieve an oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 92-96% [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]. It is also recommended to titrate FiO2 to the lowest level necessary to maintain SpO2 between 92-96% and to avoid high levels of FiO2, which may lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increase the risk of oxygen toxicity [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]. In addition, the use of high FiO2 may also lead to absorption atelectasis in poorly ventilated lung regions, resulting in alveolar collapse [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]. Therefore, the recommended FiO2 during OLV is: * 0.4 for patients in the lateral position [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]

Permissive hypercapnea should be considered a routine component of a PLV strategy for OLV. Assuming a reasonable cardiovascular reserve, and in particular right ventricular function, P a CO 2 levels up to 70 mmHg are well tolerated in the short term and clearly beneficial in terms of lung injury avoidance and attenuation.

The appropriate ratio of inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) time depends on underlying lung mechanics. Restrictive lung disease is characterized by poorly compliant lungs, which resist passive lung expansion, but rapidly recoil to FRC. Increasing the I:E ratio to 1:1 (or using inverse ratio ventilation) maximizes the time spent in inspiration, thereby reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures. For illustration, at a respiratory rate of 15 bpm and an I:E ratio of 1:1, each respiratory cycle lasts 4 s, with 2 s spent in each of inspiration and expiration, respectively. Obstructive lung disease, on the other hand, is characterized by lungs, which have difficulty to empty towards FRC, due to poor elastic recoil and conducting airway collapse. Decreasing the I:E ratio towards 1:4 allows for more expiratory time, and helps to minimize the risk of auto-PEEP and dynamic hyperinflation. For illustration, at a respiratory rate of 15 bpm, now with the I:E ratio to 1:4, each respiratory cycle is still 4 s, however, expiration now takes up 3.2 s of the entire cycle."", ""source"": ""wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""faaeeb4f-62eb-4a10-8713-c254bf03ec0e""}]",12
what is the recommended positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during one lung ventilation?,3-10 cm water,step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"**Recommended Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) during One Lung Ventilation** Based on the provided context, several sources offer recommendations for PEEP during one lung ventilation (OLV). * **Titration based on lung compliance**: PEEP should be titrated to achieve optimal lung compliance, as recommended by the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines [1]. The optimal PEEP level may vary, but a PEEP > 5 cm H2O is usually required to avoid lung collapse [2].
* **Specific PEEP range**: The recommended PEEP range during OLV is 3-10 cm H2O, titrated to the highest lung compliance [3]. This range is supported by various studies [4, 5, 6].
* **Auto-PEEP detection**: It is essential to detect and manage auto-PEEP during OLV, especially in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease [7, 8].
* **Combination with low tidal volumes**: Combining low levels of PEEP (< 5 cmH2O) with low tidal volumes (< 5 ml/kg) may predispose to poor aeration and development of atelectasis [9]. **Critical Considerations** * Perfusion is redirected to the non-ventilated lung with high levels of PEEP, increasing the shunt and impairing oxygenation [10].
* Patients with significant obstructive pulmonary disease may require lower levels of PEEP [11].
* Monitoring and management of auto-PEEP are crucial to prevent lung injury [12]. **Evidence-Based Recommendations** Based on the provided context, the following evidence-based recommendations can be made: 1. Titrate PEEP to achieve optimal lung compliance during OLV.
2. Maintain a PEEP range of 3-10 cm H2O during OLV.

Conversely, with low Vt, inadequate PEEP may promote derecruitment and increase the shunt fraction in the ventilated lung. Patients are most likely to benefit from PEEP if their pulmonary function is normal, as extrinsic PEEP tends to increase the end-expiratory pressure towards the lower inflection point of the pressure-volume curve. On the other hand, in patients with obstructive lung disease and a reduced forced expiratory volume after one second, extrinsic PEEP is more likely to raise the end-expiratory pressure above the lower inflection point and create or enhance intrinsic PEEP during OLV. 31 Development of intrinsic PEEP can be detected by the presence of an interrupted expiratory flow on a flow-volume curve, worsening lung compliance on spirometry, or increasing plateau pressures. 3 Ferrando et al. recently showed improved oxygenation and lung mechanics when external PEEP was set based on achieving optimal dynamiclungcomplianceusingaPEEPdecrementtrialaftera lung recruitment maneuver. 32\n\n123\n\n1108\n\nC.

What is the recommended oxygen saturation (SaO2) during one lung ventilation (OLV)?,92-96%,step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"To answer the question regarding the recommended oxygen saturation (SaO2) during one lung ventilation (OLV), we need to consider the relevant information from the provided sources. [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md] The provided source suggests the following recommendations for oxygen saturation during OLV: - A target SpO2 of 92-96% should be aimed for during OLV.
- The initial FIO2 should be 0.5-0.8, which can be titrated to the minimum required to achieve the target SpO2. [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md] This source also emphasizes the importance of maintaining adequate oxygenation during OLV, stating that atelectasis in the non-operative lung must be avoided as it worsens the already high shunt fraction from lung isolation. [Source: 09_Stoelting.md] While this source primarily focuses on oxygen supplementation post-tracheal extubation, it does provide information about the significance of oxygen exchange and arterial oxygenation in the context of lung function. It highlights that significant desaturation of arterial blood occurs when the PaO2 is less than 60 mm Hg.

What is the recommended tidal volume under OLV?,4-6 mL/kg of Ideal body weight (IBW),step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"**Recommended Tidal Volume under One-Lung Ventilation (OLV)** Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, the recommended tidal volume under OLV is a topic of ongoing debate. However, several studies suggest that lower tidal volumes may be beneficial in reducing complications and improving outcomes. **Comparison of Tidal Volumes between TLV and OLV** A study comparing ventilator variables between TLV (Two-Lung Ventilation) and OLV groups found that the tidal volume was significantly lower in the OLV group, with a mean tidal volume of 370.9 mL (SD 87.8 mL) compared to 458.8 mL (SD 110.8 mL) in the TLV group [Source: Management-of-One-lung-Ventilation-Impact-of-Tidal-Volume-on-Complications-after-Thoracic-Surgery.md]. **Guidelines for Tidal Volume Reduction** The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend reducing tidal volume over 1 to 2 hours from its initial value toward the goal of a 'low' tidal volume (≈ 6 mL/kg PBW) achieved in conjunction with an end-inspiratory plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H2O [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. If plateau pressure remains > 30 cm H2O after reduction of tidal volume to 6 mL/kg PBW, tidal volume may be further reduced to as low as 4 mL/kg PBW. **Evidence-Based Recommendations** Studies have shown that lower tidal volumes can reduce lung injury and improve outcomes in patients undergoing thoracic surgery and those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . A meta-analysis of 15 studies on tidal volumes in patients without acute lung injury found that lower tidal volumes (4.5-6 mL/kg PBW) reduced mortality and ventilator-induced lung injury . **Conclusion** Based on the available evidence, a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg PBW is recommended as a starting point for OLV, with the goal of reducing complications and improving outcomes. However, the optimal tidal volume may vary depending on individual patient factors and the severity of lung injury. Further research is needed to determine the optimal tidal volume for OLV. **References** [Source: Management-of-One-lung-Ventilation-Impact-of-Tidal-Volume-on-Complications-after-Thoracic-Surgery.md]

What is the recommend respiratory rate under OLV?,14-16 breaths per minute (bpm),step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"Based on the provided context, the recommended respiratory rate (RR) under one-lung ventilation (OLV) is 12-16 breaths per minute (bpm). [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]
The management of OLV requires a careful adjustment of respiratory rate to avoid excessive hypercapnia while maintaining a protective tidal volume. High respiratory rates may decrease both inspiratory and expiratory time, increasing peak inspiratory pressures and potentially creating or further increasing intrinsic PEEP. To avoid these complications, the recommended respiratory rate is 12-16 bpm. [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]
Recommendations
The RR should be 12-16 breaths/min-1.
PaCO2 should be 40-60 mmHg.
Routine I:E ratio is 1:2. Note that the recommended respiratory rate is specific to the context of OLV and may vary depending on individual patient factors, such as lung disease or respiratory function. It is essential to consider these factors when adjusting the respiratory rate. In addition to the recommended respiratory rate, the management of OLV also involves careful consideration of other factors, including: * Tidal volume: Low tidal volumes (protective ventilation strategy) should be used to minimize lung injury.
* Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): PEEP levels of 20 cmH2O or more may be necessary to prevent atelectasis and improve oxygenation.
* Plateau pressure: Peak pressure levels well less than 35-40 cmH2O and plateau pressures less than 25 cmH2O should be achievable in the majority of patients during OLV.
* Inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio: The I:E ratio may be adjusted to afford maximum exhalation time (1:4-1:6) for patients with obstructive lung disease or maximum inspiratory time (1:1-2:1) for patients with restrictive lung disease. By carefully adjusting these factors, anesthesiologists can help minimize the risks associated with OLV and optimize patient outcomes.",3,"The RAG model's answer is mostly correct, but it includes minor omissions and some additional information that is not directly relevant to the question.

Patients suffering from significant obstructive pulmonary disease, however, require lower levels of PEEP; the level of auto-PEEP should be detected to allow for complete expiration.\n\nCombining low levels of PEEP (< 5 cmH2O) with low tidal volumes (< 5 ml/kg) predisposes to poor aeration and development of atelectasis.\n\nTidal volume\n\nA tidal volume of 5 - 6 ml/kg body weight during OLV, corresponding with the recommendations for lung-protective ventilation, generally results in suf ficient ventilation and oxygenation [16].

Why don't we increase the respiratory rate to improve minute ventilation when using small tidal volumes?,High respiratory rates may predispose to significant gas trapping during OL\V,step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"Based on the provided context, increasing the respiratory rate to improve minute ventilation when using small tidal volumes is not recommended due to several reasons: * Increasing the respiratory rate with small tidal volumes results in reduced CO2 elimination due to the unchanged size of anatomic dead space making up a larger component of the tidal volume and [65]].
* This approach can lead to increased auto-PEEP, which may be statistically significant, especially during one-lung ventilation (OLV) with small tidal volumes and rapid respiratory rates ].
* In patients with severe airflow obstruction, reducing the respiratory rate may be necessary to allow for complete exhalation, whereas in restrictive lung disease, dividing a given minute volume by a higher respiratory frequency may be beneficial in reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]. In contrast, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend increasing the respiratory rate to a maximum of 35 breaths/min during tidal volume reduction to maintain minute ventilation, but this approach should only be considered when plateau pressure remains > 30 cm H2O after reduction of tidal volume to 6 mL/kg PBW [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. It is essential to note that the precise tidal volume for an individual patient requires adjustment for factors such as plateau pressure, PEEP, thoracoabdominal compliance, and the patient's breathing effort. Patients with profound metabolic acidosis, high minute ventilation, or short stature may require additional manipulation of tidal volumes [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. In summary, increasing the respiratory rate to improve minute ventilation when using small tidal volumes is not recommended due to the potential for reduced CO2 elimination, increased auto-PEEP, and other factors. Instead, clinicians should focus on adjusting tidal volumes based on individual patient factors and using lung-protective strategies to minimize ventilatory pressures and promote lung protection.

Extreme airflow obstruction may require very long expiratory times. After reducing the I:E ratio to the minimum of 1:4 this can only be achieved by increasing the overall cycle length, i.e., reducing the respiratory rate. Clinical examples, such as the patient with severe cystic fibrosis requiring a respiratory rate of 4-6 to allow for complete exhalation have been reported [64]. In restrictive lung disease, on the other hand, dividing a given minute volume by a higher respiratory frequency may be beneficial in reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures. It has to be realized, however, that as anatomic dead space remains unchanged, dividing the minute volume by a higher respiratory rate results in reduced CO 2 elimination as the unchanged size of the anatomic dead space makes up a larger component of the tidal volume [65]. For illustration, a patient ventilated at 400 mL - 20 bpm receives the identical minute ventilation as a patient ventilated at 800 mL - 10 bpm. However, dead space ventilation, which occupies about 150 mL of each breath, has doubled from 1,500 mL at 10 bpm to 3,000 mL at 20 bpm. Alveolar ventilation has therefore been reduced from 6,500 mL\n\n(8,000-1,500) to 5,000 mL (8,000-3,000). Additionally, OLV with small tidal volume and rapid respiratory rate results in statistically higher auto-PEEP [65].

"Instead of increase the respiratory rate during OLV, what technique is usually employed?",Permissive hypercapnea,step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"Instead of increasing the respiratory rate during one-lung ventilation (OLV), the technique of permissive hypercapnea is usually employed. Permissive hypercapnea involves allowing the patient's carbon dioxide levels to rise while maintaining low tidal volumes and peak and plateau airway pressures. This strategy has been shown to decrease the risk of lung injury and acute lung injury (ALI) [44]. Permissive hypercapnea is a key component of protective lung ventilation during OLV, and it involves routine use of low tidal volumes, lower FiO2, and lower ventilatory pressures through the use of pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md].

Protective ventilation is not synonymous with low tidal volume ventilation, but includes all of routine PEEP, lower FiO 2 and particularly lower ventilatory pressures through the use of PCV and permissive hypercapnea. This strategy follows the 'open-lung' concept that has been widely adopted for management of ARDS patients in intensive care units. As part of the open-lung concept frequent recruitment of the lung has to be considered as another component of a PLV strategy. Recruitment should occur at the beginning of OLV, during OLV if indicated by worsening oxygenation and for lung re-expansion. Lung de-recruitment may potentially be more prevalent with low tidal volumes due to the loss of endinspiratory stretch in the setting of high F i O 2 . External PEEP should help to minimize de-recruitment. However, PEEP titration is difficult in the intra-operative setting for two reasons. First, determination of inflection points and auto-PEEP would require inline spirometry, as routine expiratory holds are not feasible intra-operatively. Second, other than the ICU, where as long as cardiac output is maintained, PEEP can be increased to maintain 'open lung'; in the OLV setting excessive PEEP will cause pulmonary blood flow diversion to the operative lung and worsens oxygenation. As such, low tidal volume ventilation has the potential to worsen oxygenation, either due to lung de-recruitment with inadequate PEEP or due to pulmonary blood flow diversion with excessive PEEP. Low tidal volume ventilation increases dead-space and CO 2 elimination is therefore consistently worse with this technique.

Pneumonectomy carries a particularly high risk of lung injury, but lesser lung resections and even nonpulmonary intra-thoracic surgery which employs OLV can create the same pathology [5]. Postthoracotomy ALI is part of a spectrum of disease, which in its most severe form is recognized as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Diagnosis is based on the oxygenation index of P a O 2 /F i O 2 (P/F). Critical care consensus guidelines define ALI as a P/F ratio <300 and ARDS as a P/F ratio <200 [6]. ALI after lung resection is fortunately infrequent, occurring in 2.5-3.1% of all lung resections combined; however, the incidence can be as high as 7.9-10.1% after pneumonectomies. Although infrequent, ALI after lung resection may be associated with significant morbidity in the form of prolonged intubation, hospitalization and death [5]. Mortality, which was reported to be as high as 37-64% amongst patients with ALI [7-9], may be on the decline, as a more recent report indicated a mortality rate of 25-40% [10].

what are the predictors of hypoxemia under OLV,"Right-sided operation, normal preoperative FEV1, Low PaO2 during two lung ventilation, preferential perfusion to the operative lung, supine position, vasodilator use, excessive volatile anesthesia (much greater than 1 MAC), sepsis",step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"**Predictors of Hypoxemia during One-Lung Ventilation (OLV)** Hypoxemia has been a significant concern during OLV, but its incidence has been declining over the years. Several predictors have been identified to forecast potential desaturation. These include: * **Preoperative perfusion and ventilation to the operative lung**: Studies by Hurford et al. [101] and Slinger et al. [102] showed that the extent of preoperative blood flow and ventilation to the operative lung inversely correlated with PaO2 after 10 minutes of OLV.
* **Right-sided operations**: Slinger et al. [102] found that right-sided operations were predictive of continued oxygenation difficulties due to increased perfusion to the right side.
* **Poor preoperative pulmonary function (FEV1)**: Good preoperative pulmonary function (FEV1) was found to be predictive of poor OLV oxygenation [102].
* **End-tidal CO2 gradients**: Two recent studies [103, 104] correlated the risk of hypoxemia with end-tidal CO2 gradients. Elevated CO2 gradients were indicative of V/Q mismatching and therefore explained the risk of hypoxemia. **Additional Risk Factors** * **Cerebral desaturation**: Monitoring cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) using near-infrared spectroscopy has shown that prolonged decreases in rSO2 to less than 75% of the baseline value are predictive of cerebral desaturation [114].
* **Lung re-expansion**: Lung re-expansion should likely occur at a lower FiO2 to avoid hypoxemic reperfusion [54].
* **High-risk patients**: Patients undergoing lung transplantation or adjuvant therapy are at increased risk of lung injury due to high FiO2 exposure [53]. **Monitoring and Management** Standard monitoring during OLV includes: * Arterial blood gas analysis to assess oxygenation and ventilation
* Arterial line access for hemodynamic monitoring
* Continuous spirometry to assess lung compliance and diagnose air leaks and air-trapping
* Cerebral oximetry, although its value is still being assessed
* Transesophageal echocardiography to assess right heart dysfunction **Protective Lung Ventilation** Protocols for protective lung ventilation during two-lung ventilation (TLV) are emerging, particularly in patients without lung injury [22]. A recent trial showed improved clinical outcomes with low Vt (mean 6.4 mL/kg IBW) and PEEP (median 6 cm H2O) compared with non-protective ventilation [23]. **References** [Source: wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md]

Early reports indicated that 40-50% of patients suffered hypoxemia during OLV [101]. Predictors for possible desaturation have been identified (Table 6.3). Hurford et al. examined the intraoperative oxygenation of patients who had undergone preoperative V / Q scanning [101]. They found that the amount of preoperative perfusion (and ventilation) to the operative lung inversely correlated with P a O 2 after 10 min of OLV. As HPV is only able to halve blood flow through the operative lung during OLV, the authors concluded that the extent of preoperative blood flow helped to predict the amount of intra-operative shunt. Slinger et al. showed that P a O 2 during OLV relates to multiple factors. Poor oxygenation during TLV was predictive of continued oxygenation difficulties as were right-sided operations (due to the increased perfusion to that side). Good preoperative pulmonary function (FEV 1 ) was found to be predictive of poor OLV oxygenation, which is felt to be due to the lack of auto-PEEP and secondary de-recruitment in normal lungs [102]. Two recent studies correlated the risk of hypoxemia to the end-tidal CO 2 gradients. One study showed that the difference of end-tidal CO 2 between the lungs in the lateral position significantly correlates with the P/F ratio at 15 min of OLV [103]. The other study demonstrated that there was a significant negative correlation between the lowest P a O 2 recorded during the first 45 min of OLV and the end-tidal CO 2 difference between TLV and the early phase of OLV [104]. Both studies postulated that elevated CO 2 gradients were indicative of V / Q mismatching and therefore explained the risk of hypoxemia.\n\nOver the years the incidence of hypoxemia has been declining.

In addition to hypoxemia, release of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen metabolites may have yet unknown effects on organ function. A few recent studies have attempted to define the effects of OLV on organ function. More research is needed to delineate the end-organ effects of OLV.\n\nA recent study by Mierdl et al. analyzed the impact of hypoxia during OLV on myocardial metabolism in patients with severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease. Patients underwent minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting via small lateral thoracotomy. In their study measurements of arterial and coronary sinus PO 2 , pH and lactate did not show any evidence of anaerobic metabolism, despite arterial P a O 2 values between 50 and 70 mmHg during OLV. Additionally, no patient exhibited myocardial ischemia, which led the authors to conclude that OLV may be used in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease with an acceptable low risk of inducing anaerobic myocardial metabolism [111].\n\nNeurocognitive dysfunction is a well-known complication of cardiac surgery, and has been shown to be associated with intraoperative episodes of cerebral oxygen desaturation. Standard pulse oximetry is insufficient to detect these events. Monitoring for, and treating cerebral desaturation events, may decrease the incidence of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction [112, 113]. Tobias et al. investigated the incidence and risk factors for cerebral desaturation by monitoring cerebral oxygenation (rSO 2 ) using near infrared spectroscopy in patients who required OLV for thoracic surgery [114]. In 8 of 40 patients, prolonged decreases in rSO 2 to less than 75% of the baseline value were recorded for 25% or more of the\n\n98"", ""source"": ""wk_3b_slinger_06_olv_management.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""12f37330-7726-49c7-bd43-7389145422fa""}, {""content"": ""One hundred percent oxygen used to be a routine component of OLV, as hypoxia was its most feared complication. However, with the decline in the incidence of hypoxemia and the realization that high F i O 2 may be detrimental, even this practice has been questioned. Oxygen toxicity is a well-recognized consequence of prolonged exposure to high F i O 2 , characterized by histopathologic changes similar to ALI. Oxygen toxicity occurs during OLV and involves ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress [12]. Collapse of the operative lung and surgical manipulation results in relative organ ischemia, and reperfusion at the time of lung expansion leads to the production of radical oxygen species. Increasing durations of OLV and the presence of tumor result in increased markers of oxidative stress, which after 120 min are associated with significant increases in the rates of respiratory failure and death [53]. Lung re-expansion should likely occur at a lower F i O 2 , as hypoxemic reperfusion has been shown to attenuate the reperfusion syndrome [54]. This is of particular relevance after lung transplantation. Even short-term exposure to high F i O 2 during the induction of anesthesia has been shown to cause significant absorption atelectasis [55]. Studies have shown that an F i O 2 as low as 0.4 may provide adequate oxygenation for OLV in the lateral decubitus position [56]. Due to the potential for lung injury, particularly in the high-risk patient, after adjuvant therapy or undergoing lung transplantation, F i O 2 should be titrated to effect. At the initiation of OLV a F i O 2 of 0.8 may be appropriate, but 15-20 min later, when the nadir of oxygenation has occurred, the F i O 2 should be gradually decreased to the minimum that is required to maintain a stable saturation level above 92-94%.

Nevertheless, arterial blood gas analysis is extremely helpful to assess oxygenation and the adequacy of ventilation in light of the increased end-tidal and arterial pressure carbon dioxide (ETCO2-PaCO2) gradients during OLV. Beyond blood gas analyses, arterial line access enables hemodynamic monitoring in more complicated surgical procedures with significant risk for hemodynamic instability, hemorrhage, or fluid shifts. Continuous spirometry is a valuable adjunct to assess changes in lung compliance due to recruitment/ derecruitment and to diagnose air leaks and air-trapping. Cerebral oximetry is currently being assessed with regard to its value in thoracic surgery. 21 Transesophageal echocardiography can also be helpful in the perioperative assessment of right heart dysfunction, which may be worsened due to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance induced by the initiation of OLV and/or the clamping of the branches of the pulmonary artery.\n\nFrom induction of anesthesia to OLV\n\nGuidelines are emerging for routine use of protective lung ventilation during TLV in patients without lung injury. 22 A recent trial involving 400 patients at intermediate to high risk of pulmonary complications in abdominal surgery showed improved clinical outcomes with a low Vt (mean 6.4 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW) and PEEP (median 6 cm H2O) compared with non-protective ventilation (mean Vt of 11.1 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW and no PEEP). 23 Ideal (or predicted) body weight can be readily estimated based on patient height and sex (Table 4)."", ""source"": ""step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""472ceb83-b85a-466d-b84d-525f976a19fd""}]",22

Energy expenditure is primarily determined by basal metabolic rate, which is responsible for maintaining homeostasis of bodily functions. Most metabolic activity occurs within lean tissue and involves small sources of energy expenditure, including the thermal e ff ect of physical activity and the heat produced by food digestion, absorption, and storage. Exercise can increase energy consumption not only during exercise but for up to 18 hours a ft erward. It does so by increasing the\n\nthermal e ff ects of physical activity, and with regular exercise over time, the body's basal metabolic rate increases. Caloric restriction (i.e., fasting) without exercise, on the other hand, leads to a reduction in basal metabolic rate due to promotion of the body's e ff orts to conserve energy. Th is reduction in basal metabolic rate leads to slow weight loss during the dieting phase but rapid weight gain when normal caloric intake is resumed.\n\nFAT STORAGE"", ""source"": ""16_Stoelting.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""f811ff1b-7055-4bc6-9291-c581a2766e9c""}, {""content"": ""C H A P T E R\n\nNutritional Diseases: Obesity and Malnutrition\n\nObesity\n\nDefinition\n\nEpidemiology\n\nPathophysiology\n\nDiseases Associated with Obesity\n\nTreatment of Obesity\n\nManagement of Anesthesia in Obese Patients\n\nMalnutrition and Vitamin Deficiencies\n\nMalnutrition\n\nVitamin Deficiencies\n\nKey Points\n\nNutritional diseases are caused by either an underconsumption of essential nutrients or an overconsumption of poor nutrients.

In patients with obstructive lung disease what is a reasonable inspiratory to expiratory ratio,a reasonable ratio is anywhere from 1:2 up to 1:6,step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md,"**Inspiratory to Expiratory Ratio in Obstructive Lung Disease** For patients with obstructive lung disease, a reasonable inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio is 1:4 to 1:6.

Adjust I:E ratio to 1:4-1:6 for obstructive lung disease to avoid intrinsic PEEP. **Rationale** Obstructive lung disease is characterized by difficulty in emptying the lungs due to poor elastic recoil and conducting airway collapse. Increasing the I:E ratio towards 1:1 (or using inverse ratio ventilation) can actually worsen the situation, leading to increased peak and plateau ventilatory pressures.

The inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio may be adjusted to afford maximum exhalation time (1:4-1:6) for the patient with obstructive lung disease and maximum inspiratory time (1:1-2:1) for the patient with restrictive lung disease.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe RR should be 12-16 breaths /C1 min -1 .\n\nPaCO2 should be 40-60 mmHg.\n\nRoutine I:E ratio is 1:2.\n\nStep-by-step clinical management\n\n1109\n\nAdjust I:E ratio to 1:1-2:1 for restrictive lung disease.\n\nAdjust I:E ratio to 1:4-1:6 for obstructive lung disease to avoid intrinsic PEEP.\n\nPressure-control vs volume-control ventilation\n\nPressure-control ventilation (PCV) has been suggested as preferable to volume-control ventilation (VCV) for OLV. 16 While PCV is associated with lower ventilatory pressures, differences in intrabronchial pressure are minimal. 42 Whether PCV actually improves oxygenation is highly controversial, as studies have failed to find a consistent benefit. 43,44\n\nRecommendation\n\nUse of either VCV or PCV (remains controversial).\n\nMaintenance of anesthesia"", ""source"": ""step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""9fb29094-33c7-4795-b2f3-3d0325a86294""}, {""content"": ""Respiratory rate modification may be equally necessary depending on the underlying lung mechanics. Extreme airflow obstruction may require very long expiratory times. After reducing the I:E ratio to the minimum of 1:4 this can only be achieved by increasing the overall cycle length, i.e., reducing the respiratory rate. Clinical examples, such as the patient with severe cystic fibrosis requiring a respiratory rate of 4-6 to allow for complete exhalation have been reported [64]. In restrictive lung disease, on the other hand, dividing a given minute volume by a higher respiratory frequency may be beneficial in reducing peak and plateau ventilatory pressures. It has to be realized, however, that as anatomic dead space remains unchanged, dividing the minute volume by a higher respiratory rate results in reduced CO 2 elimination as the unchanged size of the anatomic dead space makes up a larger component of the tidal volume [65]. For illustration, a patient ventilated at 400 mL - 20 bpm receives the identical minute ventilation as a patient ventilated at 800 mL - 10 bpm. However, dead space ventilation, which occupies about 150 mL of each breath, has doubled from 1,500 mL at 10 bpm to 3,000 mL at 20 bpm.

Postoperative lung function is impaired for a multitude of reasons, including general anesthesia, residual paralysis, lung edema due to fluids, manipulation, and inflammation, but also likely residual atelectasis. Patients may be at particular risk of lung injury at this time, as they have encountered a ''first hit'' in the form of lung surgery and OLV. After recruitment of the operative lung, TLV needs to be established with a protective ventilation strategy. Tidal volumes may be increased slightly to 6-8 mL /C1 kg -1 of IBW if overall lung volumes are unchanged and should remain at 4-6 mL /C1 kg -1 if significant lung resection has occurred. Appropriate PEEP needs to be maintained until extubation, as the operative lung is particularly prone to recollapse. The F I O2 should be titrated to an SpO2 of 92-96% to limit oxidative stress. Lung recruitment can be used as needed, taking care to limit airway pressure and high volume delivery to the operative lung. Considering the propensity to derecruitment and the increased airflow resistance of double-lumen endotracheal tubes, it is preferable not to switch the patient to unsupported spontaneous ventilation on emergence. Hypoventilation, particularly in the setting of high FI O2, will encourage atelectasis.

In the case of lung resection, caution needs to be exercised not to disrupt staple lines and create undue hemodynamic instability in the face of commonly practiced relative hypovolemia.

However, recent evidence suggests that IV fluids used to restore organ perfusion may damage vascular integrity and lead to organ dysfunction (394). Data from observational studies have shown an association of high-volume fluid resuscitation and increased mortality, but these studies are likely affected by unmeasured variables (i.e., the administration of higher amounts of fluids to sicker patients) (395, 396). Recent data emerging from Africa showed that higher volume fluid resuscitation in adults was associated with increased mortality, but the generalizability of these data is limited due to the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and malnutrition in the patients enrolled and the resource-scarce conditions with limited access to ICUs (69).\n\nThe current evidence evaluating a restrictive IV fluid strategy in the management of septic patients\n\ne1096\n\nwww.ccmjournal.org\n\nNovember 2021 \u2022 Volume 49 \u2022 Number 11\n\nOnline Special Article"", ""source"": ""2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""38d733b6-567e-47c9-a798-5cc6d95c11a5""}, {""content"": ""Macdonald SPJ, Keijzers G, Taylor DM, et al; REFRESH trial investigators: Restricted fluid resuscitation in suspected sepsis associated hypotension (REFRESH): A pilot randomised controlled trial.

Increasing MAP therefore usually results in increased tissue blood flow and augments the supply side of tissue perfusion. While some tissues, such as the brain and kidneys have the ability to autoregulate blood flow, MAPs below a threshold, usually understood to be approximately 60 mm Hg, are associated with decreased organ perfusion, which tracks linearly with MAP (79). Previous SSC guidelines recommended targeting a MAP of greater than 65 mm Hg for initial resuscitation. The recommendation was based principally on a RCT in septic shock comparing patients who were given vasopressors to target a MAP of 65-70 mm Hg, versus a target of 80-85 mm Hg (80). This study found no difference in mortality, although a subgroup analysis demonstrated a 10.5% absolute reduction in renal replacement therapy (RRT) with higher MAP targets among patients with chronic hypertension. Additionally, targeting higher MAP with vasopressors was associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation. A limitation of this study was that the average MAP in both arms exceeded the targeted range.

(Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence for screening; Strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence for standard operating procedures)
* **Time to Antibiotics:** Early administration of antibiotics is critical in the management of sepsis. The guidelines recommend administering antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition of sepsis or septic shock. (Gaieski et al., 2010; Ko et al., 2020; Puskarich et al., 2011)
* **Duration of Hypotension:** Hypotension lasting more than 1 hour before initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy is associated with higher mortality in septic shock. (Kumar et al., 2006)
* **Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT):** EGDT should be initiated within 6 hours of recognition of sepsis or septic shock. (Gaieski et al., 2010)
* **Fluid Resuscitation:** The guidelines recommend a goal-directed fluid resuscitation strategy, with a target central venous pressure (CVP) of 8-12 mmHg. (Liu et al., 2017)
* **Vasopressors:** Vasopressors should be initiated within 1 hour of recognition of septic shock, and titrated to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥65 mmHg. (Peltan et al., 2019)
* **Source Control:** Source control should be initiated as soon as possible, within 12-24 hours of recognition of sepsis or septic shock. (Kumar et al., 2006)
* **Reconciling Medications:** For adults with sepsis and septic shock, we recommend reconciling medications at both ICU and hospital discharge. (Best practice statement)
* **Hospital Discharge Planning:** For adults with sepsis or septic shock who developed new impairments, we recommend hospital discharge plans include follow-up with clinicians able to support and manage new and term sequelae.

[Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines Updates.md] **Empiric Antimicrobial Regimens with MRSA Coverage** The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends the following empiric antimicrobial regimens with MRSA coverage for adults with sepsis or septic shock: * Vancomycin (15-20 mg/kg body weight every 8-12 hours) in combination with piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 8 hours) or meropenem (2 g every 8 hours) [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines Updates.md] **Rationale** The decision to include an antibiotic active against MRSA in an empiric treatment regimen for sepsis and septic shock depends on the likelihood of MRSA infection, the risk of harm associated with withholding treatment for MRSA, and the risk of harm associated with MRSA treatment in a patient without MRSA. MRSA accounts for approximately 5% of culture-positive infections among critically ill patients, and the incidence of MRSA varies by region and patient-related characteristics.

* For adults with a low likelihood of infection and without shock, we suggest deferring antimicrobials while continuing to closely monitor the patient. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines Updates.md] **Patient Safety Considerations** * Administer antimicrobials immediately, ideally within one hour of recognition of sepsis or septic shock.
* Continuously re-evaluate and search for alternative diagnoses and discontinue empiric antimicrobials if an alternative cause of illness is demonstrated or strongly suspected.
* Use procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to guide antimicrobial initiation in addition to clinical evaluation, as procalcitonin has no apparent benefit and unknown costs, and limited availability in some settings.

are gelatins recommended for sepsis and septic shock?,gelatins are best avoided in patients with sepsis and septic shock,2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md,"Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature from the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md, gelatins are not recommended for sepsis and septic shock. Here's a summary of the key points: **Recommendations:** * The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines suggest against using gelatin for resuscitation in adults with sepsis and septic shock, citing moderate-quality evidence. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]
* A weak recommendation against using gelatin is made, given the lack of clear benefit, increased adverse effects, and higher costs. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]

Crystalloids have the advantage of being inexpensive and widely available. The absence of clear benefit following the administration of colloids compared to crystalloid solutions supports the use of crystalloid solutions in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis and septic shock (324). The optimal fluid remains a subject of debate. For decades, the administration of normal saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride) has been common practice (325), but potential adverse effects that include hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, renal vasoconstriction, increased cytokine secretion and concern about acute kidney injury (AKI) have led to increased interest in chloride-restrictive solutions, known as balanced or buffered solutions (326-330).

what is the first-line recommended vasopressor in septic shock,norepinephrine,2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md,"**First-Line Recommended Vasopressor in Septic Shock** According to the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines, the first-line recommended vasopressor in septic shock is norepinephrine. However, the provided context does not explicitly state this recommendation. Instead, it suggests starting vasopressors peripherally to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP) rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured. **Peripheral Vasopressor Administration** When using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. **Rationale for Peripheral Vasopressor Administration** The prompt initiation of vasopressors to restore blood pressure is an integral component of the management of septic shock. Traditionally, vasopressors have been administered via a central venous access due to concerns of extravasation, local tissue ischemia, and injury if administered peripherally. However, securing central venous access can be time-consuming and may not be available in under-resourced settings, leading to delayed initiation of vasopressors [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. **Evidence for Peripheral Vasopressor Administration** A small study (n = 263) randomly allocated patients to receive peripheral vascular access or a central access. The study found that the incidence of major catheter-related complications was higher in those randomized to peripheral venous lines, with no significant difference in the incidence of minor catheter-related complications. However, the study did not compare the effectiveness of peripheral vs. central vasopressor administration in restoring MAP or improving patient outcomes [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. **Clinical Recommendations** Based on the provided context, the clinical recommendations for vasopressor administration in septic shock are as follows: * Start vasopressors peripherally to restore MAP rather than delaying initiation until a central venous access is secured (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence)
* Administer vasopressors only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa
* Invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure is suggested over noninvasive monitoring, as soon as practical and if resources are available (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence) **Important Considerations** * Peripheral vasopressor administration should be performed only for a short period of time to minimize the risk of local tissue ischemia and injury.
* Invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure is recommended to guide vasopressor therapy and ensure optimal blood pressure management. **Sources** * [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]

* Aim for a plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H 2 O to avoid lung overdistension.
* Consider using a pressure- and volume-limited strategy to optimize ventilation and prevent lung injury. Patient safety considerations: * Monitor for signs of respiratory distress or failure, such as increased respiratory rate, oxygen desaturation, or decreased arterial pH.

are steroids recommended for adults with septic shock and ongoing requirements for vasopressor therapy?,"yes, IV corticosteroids are recommended in this scenario",2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md,"**Recommendation for Steroid Use in Adults with Septic Shock and Ongoing Vasopressor Therapy** Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests using IV corticosteroids in adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy. **Key Recommendations** * **For adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy, we suggest using IV corticosteroids.** [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]

* **Corticosteroid use is recommended to commence at a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min at least 4 hours after initiation.** [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md] **Rationale** The Surviving Sepsis Campaign updated their guidelines based on three large RCTs that have been published since the 2016 guidance. An updated meta-analysis found that systemic corticosteroid use accelerated resolution of shock, and a meta-analysis conducted for this guideline revision found an increase in vasopressor-free days. However, corticosteroid use increased neuromuscular weakness, without a clear effect on short- or long-term mortality. The panel judged the desirable effects to outweigh the undesirable effects of low-dose corticosteroid therapy, supporting a weak recommendation in favor of using low-dose corticosteroid therapy in septic shock. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md] **Additional Considerations** * The use of corticosteroids in septic shock is a topic of ongoing debate, and healthcare providers should weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks and side effects.

* Corticosteroids should be used in conjunction with adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy, as described in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. **Clinical Takeaway** The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends using IV corticosteroids in adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy.

* The recommended formula for calculating the bicarbonate dose is: NaHCO3 (mEq) = 0.3 x wt (kg) x base deficit (mEq/L) [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* Only ½ of the calculated deficit should be replaced at one time, and fractional doses may be repeated as necessary. [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md] **Complications:** * Chemical cellulitis and extravasation of NaHCO3 [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* Metabolic alkalosis, which can lead to: + L shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve and subsequent impairment of oxygen release [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md] + Hyperirritability or tetany [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md] + Hypokalemia, which can occur due to the exchange of K+ for H+ in the tissues in an attempt to offset the metabolic alkalosis [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md] **Special Considerations:** * During cardiac arrest, sodium bicarbonate may exacerbate acidosis, and hypertonic solutions may cause a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure.

is exercise stress testing recommended for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk noncardiac surgery?,"No, routine stress testing is not recommended for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk surgery.",2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md,"Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, the recommendation for exercise stress testing in asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk noncardiac surgery is as follows: * Routine screening with noninvasive stress testing is not useful for patients at low risk for noncardiac surgery. * For patients with low risk and moderate to good functional capacity, it may be reasonable to forgo further exercise testing and proceed to surgery. However, it is essential to note that the guidelines also recommend considering exercise testing to assess for functional capacity if it will change management in certain cases, such as: * Patients with elevated risk and poor or unknown functional capacity may be reasonable to perform exercise testing with cardiac imaging to assess for myocardial ischemia. In summary, exercise stress testing is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk noncardiac surgery, but it may be considered in select cases where it will change management.

is it recommended to measure preoperative natriuretic peptides in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery?,"Yes, measurement of natriuretic peptides may be useful in high-risk vascular surgery patients.",2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md,"**Recommendation for measuring preoperative natriuretic peptides in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery:** According to the 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery, preoperative natriuretic peptide levels independently predict cardiovascular events in the first 30 days after vascular surgery (Rodseth et al., 2011) [1, 2]. These biomarkers may provide incremental predictive value when included in preoperative risk indices (Feringa et al., 2006; Feringa et al., 2007; Goei et al., 2008; Schouten et al., 2009; Goei et al., 2011) [3-7]. The guideline states that measurement of biomarkers, especially natriuretic peptides, may be helpful in assessing patients with heart failure (HF) and with diagnosing HF as a postoperative complication in patients at high risk for HF (Section 2.2.4) [8]. However, it also emphasizes that further prospective randomized studies are needed to assess the utility of such a strategy (Section 3.1) [8]. **Clinical considerations:** * Preoperative natriuretic peptide levels should be considered as part of a comprehensive perioperative risk assessment in high-risk patients undergoing vascular surgery.
* These biomarkers may provide incremental predictive value when included in preoperative risk indices.
* Further prospective randomized studies are needed to assess the utility of measuring preoperative natriuretic peptides in reducing postoperative risk. **References:** \[1\] Rodseth RN, Lurati Buse GA, Bolliger D, et al.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) guidelines suggest against the initiation of calcium channel blockers for the prevention of perioperative cardiovascular events (Conditional Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence). However, these guidelines do not provide recommendations for the continuation or discontinuation of calcium channel blockers in patients already receiving them. Regarding the perioperative management of calcium channel blockers, it is essential to consider the potential risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing these medications. The guidelines recommend weighing the risks and benefits of discontinuing ACE inhibitors or ARBs before surgery, as continuation may be associated with an increased risk of intraoperative hypotension. In summary, the decision to continue calcium channel blockers in patients already receiving them before surgery should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the individual patient's medical history, the type and severity of their condition, and the potential risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing these medications. **Recommendation:** * Continue calcium channel blockers in patients already receiving them before surgery only if the benefits outweigh the risks, and under close monitoring by the anesthesiologist and the patient's primary care physician.
* Weigh the risks and benefits of discontinuing calcium channel blockers before surgery, considering the potential for increased risk of intraoperative hypotension.
* Consider the patient's medical history, the type and severity of their condition, and the potential risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing calcium channel blockers. **Important Note:** * The decision to continue or discontinue calcium channel blockers should be made in consultation with the patient's primary care physician and the anesthesiologist.
* Patients on calcium channel blockers should be closely monitored for signs of hypotension or other adverse effects during the perioperative period.
* The anesthesiologist should be aware of the potential interactions between calcium channel blockers and other medications that may affect blood pressure or cardiovascular function. **Sources:** [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]

should patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction be considered at higher perioperative risk?,"Yes, patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are at increased perioperative risk.",2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md,"**Clinical Question:** Should patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction be considered at higher perioperative risk? **Answer:** Yes, patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) are considered at higher perioperative risk. **Evidence from the Literature:** * A study by Healy et al. (2010) found that patients with heart failure undergoing intermediate- and high-risk noncardiac surgery had a higher risk of perioperative and long-term mortality, particularly those with an LVEF ≤ 29% [1].
* A meta-analysis by MAGGIC (2012) reported that patients with heart failure and reduced LVEF (≤ 40%) had a higher risk of mortality compared to those with preserved LVEF (> 40%) [2].
* Another study by Flu et al. (2010) found that patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction undergoing vascular surgery had a higher risk of perioperative complications and mortality [3].
* Kazmers et al. (1988) also reported that patients with LVEF ≤ 35% who required major vascular surgery had a higher risk of perioperative and late mortality [4].
* A study by Matyal et al. (2009) found that perioperative diastolic dysfunction during vascular surgery was associated with postoperative complications and mortality [5]. **Clinical Recommendations:** * Patients with reduced LVEF (≤ 30%) are considered high-risk for perioperative complications and mortality [1].
* Heart failure patients undergoing noncardiac surgery should be evaluated for LVEF and other risk factors for perioperative complications [6].
* Preoperative echocardiography to assess LVEF and other cardiac function is recommended for patients with heart failure undergoing noncardiac surgery [7]. **Patient Safety Considerations:** * Patients with reduced LVEF should be carefully evaluated and managed preoperatively to minimize perioperative risk.
* Collaboration between cardiologists and anesthesiologists is essential to optimize perioperative care for patients with heart failure. **References:** [1] Healy KO, Waksmonski CA, Altman RK, et al.

is it recommended to withhold angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors before noncardiac surgery?,"Yes, withholding ACE inhibitors before surgery may reduce intraoperative hypotension.",2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md,"**Withholding Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) Before Noncardiac Surgery** The clinical guidelines and medical literature suggest that withholding angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) before noncardiac surgery may be beneficial to prevent intraoperative hypotension. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the effect of preoperative continuation versus withholding of ACEIs/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) around the time of noncardiac surgery. [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md] All three trials showed that preoperative continuation of ACEIs/ARBs was associated with an increased risk of intraoperative hypotension (pooled relative risk [RR] 2.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-5.93). [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md] Intraoperative hypotension has been independently associated with an increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md] **Recommendation** Based on the available evidence, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) recommends withholding ACEIs/ARBs starting 24 hours before noncardiac surgery in patients treated chronically with these medications. [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md] This recommendation is based on a strong evidence level (Low-Quality Evidence) and is considered essential to prevent intraoperative hypotension and subsequent cardiac complications. **Clinical Implications** The CCS guidelines recommend that patients on chronic ACEI/ARB therapy should have their medication withheld for 24 hours before noncardiac surgery. This measure may help reduce the risk of intraoperative hypotension and subsequent cardiac complications. It is essential for anesthesiologists and surgeons to be aware of this recommendation and adjust perioperative care accordingly. Patients on ACEI/ARB therapy should be carefully managed, and their medication should be withheld as recommended. **Conclusion** Withholding ACEIs before noncardiac surgery may be beneficial to prevent intraoperative hypotension and subsequent cardiac complications. The CCS guidelines recommend withholding ACEIs/ARBs starting 24 hours before noncardiac surgery in patients treated chronically with these medications. **References** [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]",4,"The RAG model's answer is fully correct and complete, providing a clear explanation of the medical recommendation, supporting evidence, and clinical implications.

ACHD Program\n\nPatients with complex CHD have generally better outcomes when cared for in an integrated, collaborative, and multidisciplinary program. S3.1-1 Many medical issues in patients with ACHD involve cardiac sequelae, and the diagnosis and management may require cardiac anesthesiologists, electrophysiologists, and interventional cardiologists; imaging services such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)/cardiac computed tomography (CCT); and pulmonary hypertension services with expertise in ACHD (Table 5). Appropriate specialty care must be available to address pregnancy, acquired cardiovascular disease, and acute noncardiac illness complicating CHD, management of which is frequently more complicated in patients with ACHD.\n\nAlthough individual providers may be community-based affiliates, ACHD programs are inpatient, outpatient, and hospital-based with staffing and expertise available on-site or accessible when needed (Table 5).\n\n3.2. Access to Care\n\nSynopsis\n\nAs patients with ACHD grow beyond the pediatric age group, continued access to specialized cardiovascular care presents several challenges:\n\nLack of guided transfer from pediatric to adult care;\n\nInsufficient availability of ACHD programs;\n\nInadequate insurance coverage;\n\nDeficient education of patients and caregivers regarding ACHD;\n\nInadequate resources for patients with cognitive or psychosocial impairment;\n\nLack of comprehensive case management; and\n\nCirculation. 2019;139:e698-e800.

If clinical status worsens, the classification will change to a higher severity group, but improvement in status, for example after an intervention such as valve replacement or control of arrhythmia, can result in change to a lower severity classification. Such movement among classes is unlike the AHA HF A to D classification, S2.3-17 in which patients move in only one direction. This ACHD AP classification is used throughout this document, particularly when considering follow-up visits and need for testing. As the ACHD AP classification worsens because of changes in physiology (eg, development of arrhythmias, HF, end-organ disease), the nature and frequency of recommended follow-up visits and testing will also change, adapting to the patient's changing circumstance instead of depending solely on a description of anatomic disease, which may not adequately discriminate physiological changes that alter severity over time.\n\nSome patients with ACHD may have substantial acquired comorbidities unrelated to CHD and, as a consequence, their follow-up strategies might be more appropriately based on other existing guidelines for acquired heart disease.

The 2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease state that patients with ACHD who are cared for in ACHD centers have better outcomes than those cared for in centers without ACHD expertise [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. This is attributed to the specialized care provided by ACHD centers, including general, pediatric, and ACHD cardiologists, as well as surgeons, primary care providers, and other healthcare providers [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. Specifically, the guidelines recommend that patients with ACHD who are undergoing invasive cardiovascular procedures in specialized ACHD centers generally have better outcomes, including survival, than those managed in other care settings [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. This highlights the importance of ensuring that patients with ACHD receive care from providers who are knowledgeable about their specific needs and can provide optimal management. The guidelines also emphasize the need for specialized care in ACHD patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, citing that patients with ACHD may have greater operative risk than patients without ACHD [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. This is due to differences in cardiac issues commonly present in patients with ACHD, such as mechanisms for ventricular dysfunction, type and mechanisms of arrhythmia, and the probability of coronary artery disease. In summary, the clinical guidelines and medical literature suggest that cardiac surgery and interventional procedures in ACHD patients should be performed by providers with expertise in ACHD, such as general, pediatric, and ACHD cardiologists, as well as surgeons and other healthcare providers who have gained ACHD expertise through training, practice, and certification. **Recommendations:** * Cardiac surgery and interventional procedures in ACHD patients should be performed in specialized ACHD centers with providers who have expertise in ACHD.

Some specialties, such as cardiology and congenital heart surgery, have defined ACHD fellowship training and board certification, whereas for others, ACHD expertise is gained by focused experience during training and practice.\n\nIn 2012, the American Board of Medical Specialties approved ACHD as a subspecialty of internal medicine ('adult') cardiology and pediatric cardiology. Therefore, for cardiologists, one marker of ACHD expertise is board eligibility/board certification in ACHD. There are expert ACHD clinicians who are not board-certified, including those whose expertise was acquired before the development of formal certification programs and those trained outside the United States who may also have different pathways to achieve ACHD expertise. Expertise in the surgical management of patients with ACHD may be identified through board eligibility/board certification in congenital heart surgery. There are expert ACHD surgeons who are not board-certified, including those surgeons trained in other countries who are not eligible for certification in the United States.\n\nSpecific ACHD training options are not generally available for cardiac anesthesiologists, but many of them develop expertise through training in pediatric anesthesiology, cardiac anesthesiology, mentoring, and practice experience.

Is routine echocardiography recommended for all adults with repaired atrial septal defect without symptoms or residual shunt?,"No, routine echocardiography is not indicated in asymptomatic patients with repaired ASD without residual shunt or chamber enlargement.",2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md,"Based on the provided context from the 2018 AHA/ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease, the recommendation for routine echocardiography in adults with repaired atrial septal defect (ASD) without symptoms or residual shunt is not explicitly stated. However, the guidelines do provide recommendations for the management of ASD in adults, which may inform the need for echocardiography in this population. According to the guidelines, adults with repaired ASD should undergo regular follow-up with echocardiography to monitor for potential complications, such as residual shunt, right atrial and/or RV enlargement, and impaired functional capacity [1, S4.1.1-10]. In particular, the guidelines suggest that adults with primum ASD, sinus venosus defect, or coronary sinus defect who have impaired functional capacity, right atrial and/or RV enlargement, and net left-to-right shunt sufficiently large to cause physiological sequelae (e.g., Qp:Qs ≥ 1.5:1) without cyanosis at rest or during exercise should be surgically repaired, unless precluded by comorbidities [1, S4.1.1-13]. However, the guidelines also state that the decision to perform echocardiography in adults with repaired ASD without symptoms or residual shunt should be individualized, taking into account the patient's overall clinical status and risk factors for potential complications [2, S4.1.1-9]. Therefore, while routine echocardiography may be recommended for adults with repaired ASD who have symptoms or residual shunt, the guidelines do not provide a clear recommendation for routine echocardiography in asymptomatic adults with repaired ASD without residual shunt.

The physiology is complex, with long-term consequences related to the obligatory elevation in central venous pressure and reduced cardiac output. Proposed medical therapy for the 'failing Fontan,' which may manifest as proteinlosing enteropathy, hepatic dysfunction, lower extremity venous congestion, and/or exercise limitation, has included many different modalities, although there is limited proven benefit in published research. Options for medical therapy include aldosterone antagonists or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, which may stabilize the proteoglycan layer of the gut. PAH therapies are of increasing interest. Endothelin antagonists have been studied in a single RCT, which showed improved exercise capacity in 75 subjects randomized to bosen- tan compared with placebo.

Ventricular cardiac dysrhythmias are common in patients following surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot. Patients with surgically repaired tetralogy of Fallot o ft en develop atrial fi brillation or fl utter. Right bundle branch block is frequent, whereas third-degree atrioventricular heart block is uncommon. Pulmonic regurgitation may develop as a consequence of surgical repair of the right ventricular out fl ow tract and may eventually lead to right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. An aneurysm may form at the site where the right ventricular out fl ow tract was repaired.\n\nEisenmenger's Syndrome\n\nPatients in whom a le ft -to-right intracardiac shunt is reversed, as a result of increased pulmonary vascular resistance, to a level that equals or exceeds the systemic vascular resistance are said to have Eisenmenger's syndrome. It is presumed that exposure of the pulmonary vasculature to increased blood fl ow and pressure, as may accompany a VSD or ASD, results in pulmonary obstructive disease. As obliteration of the pulmonary vascular bed progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases until it equals or exceeds systemic vascular resistance and the intracardiac shunt is reversed. Shunt reversal occurs in approximately 50% of patients with an untreated VSD and approximately 10% of patients with an untreated ASD.

Is routine 12-lead electrocardiography recommended for asymptomatic ACHD patients without new symptoms?,"No, routine ECG is not recommended unless new symptoms, arrhythmias, or hemodynamic concerns arise.",2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md,"Based on the provided context from the 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md and the 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md, the following conclusion can be drawn: Routine 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is not specifically recommended for asymptomatic ACHD patients without new symptoms. However, this does not mean that ECG is never indicated in this population. According to the 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md, ACHD patients may present with nonroutine and unusual physiological challenges, and heightened surveillance may be necessary (S3.12-2-S3.12-4). Additionally, these patients may require extended postoperative intensive or other high-acuity care (S3.12-2). The 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md states that routine preoperative resting 12-lead ECG is not useful for asymptomatic patients undergoing low-risk surgical procedures (Class III: No Benefit) (35,141) (Level of Evidence: B). However, the guideline also notes that the value of the preoperative 12-lead ECG may increase with the risk of the surgical procedure, particularly for patients with known coronary heart disease, arrhythmias, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, or other significant structural heart disease (137,138). Considering the ACHD population is unique and may have different cardiac issues than those with acquired heart disease, the 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md recommend a checklist of issues to consider in the assessment and management of patients with ACHD undergoing noncardiac surgery (Table 11). This checklist may include additional diagnostic studies, including ECG, in certain cases. Therefore, the decision to perform routine 12-lead ECG in asymptomatic ACHD patients without new symptoms should be individualized and based on the patient's specific clinical presentation and risk factors. A thorough evaluation of the patient's cardiac status, including ECG, may be necessary to determine the optimal approach to perioperative care. **Recommendation:** For asymptomatic ACHD patients without new symptoms undergoing low-risk surgical procedures, routine 12-lead ECG is not recommended. However, the decision to perform ECG should be individualized and based on the patient's specific clinical presentation and risk factors. A thorough evaluation of the patient's cardiac status, including ECG, may be necessary to determine the optimal approach to perioperative care. **Sources:** [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]

( Level of Evidence: B )\n\nIn a subset of patients, exercise stress testing will be of additional value in determining optimal therapy. Because of the slow, insidious rate of progression of many valve lesions, patients may deny symptoms as they gradually limit their activity level over years to match the gradual limitation imposed by the valve lesion. In patients with an equivocal history of symptoms, exercise testing helps identify those who are truly symptomatic. There may be patients in whom resting hemodynamics do not correlate with symptoms. In these patients, exercise hemodynamics may be helpful in determining the etiology of the symptoms, specifically in patients with mitral VHD. Exercise stress testing is of prognostic value in patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) and provides further information about timing of intervention.

How should peri-operative anticoagulants be managed?,They should be managed to balance the risk of bleeding with the risk of thrombosis.,Blood components updated V2 final.md,"**Peri-operative Anticoagulants Management** The peri-operative management of anticoagulants involves assessing the bleeding and thrombosis risk, as well as renal function, to determine the optimal management strategy. **Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)** For patients taking DOACs (e.g., apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban), the suggested algorithm for peri-operative management is as follows [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]: - Assess bleeding risk: - Low: Duration of DOAC cessation before surgery: 24-48 hours - High: Duration of DOAC cessation before surgery: 48-72 hours
- Assess thrombosis risk: - Low: Prophylactic LMWH 6-8 hours after surgery - High: Continue LMWH in the interim, and delay DOAC for 48 hours if concerns regarding bleeding
- Resume DOAC: - 6-8 hours after surgery for low thrombosis risk - 48-72 hours after surgery for high thrombosis risk **Warfarin** For patients taking warfarin, the peri-operative management involves bridging anticoagulation [Source: 2013 Thrombosis Canada Wafarin Bridging.md]: - Indications: - No strong evidence-based indications for bridging anticoagulation - Bridging is suggested in high-risk patients, not suggested in low-risk patients, and optional in intermediate-risk patients
- Dosing: - Subcutaneous (SC) therapeutic-dose LMWH: enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily or 1.5 mg/kg once daily; dalteparin 100 IU/kg twice daily or 200 IU/kg once daily; or tinzaparin 175 IU/kg once daily - Intravenous (IV) unfractionated heparin (UFH) to achieve a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) - SC low-dose LMWH in patients with a high-bleeding-risk surgery/procedure: enoxaparin 40 mg once daily; dalteparin 5000 IU once daily; or tinzaparin 4500 IU once daily
- Monitoring: - No need for laboratory monitoring of bridging with SC LMWH - Monitoring is required for bridging with IV UFH (aPTT) **Reversal of Anticoagulation** For patients requiring reversal of anticoagulation, the following options are available [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]: - Idarucizumab: a specific antagonist to dabigatran, which can be used to reverse dabigatran effect rapidly
- Andexanet alfa: treatment of severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage and limitation of haematoma size in intracranial haemorrhage
- Ciraparantag: a newer drug in development that binds noncovalently to heparin, LMWH, and DOACs, which is undergoing early phase trials **Important Considerations** - Patients undergoing surgery where some degree of anticoagulation is required (e.g., requirement for cardiopulmonary bypass and non-cardiac vascular surgery) should not use andexanet alfa
- The use of andexanet alfa should be avoided in patients with a history of cardiac surgery or those with a mechanical heart valve
- The management of anticoagulation in patients undergoing surgery requires careful consideration of the bleeding and thrombosis risk, as well as renal function **References** [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]

Is tranexamic acid recommended in patients at risk of blood loss greater than 500ml?,"Yes, tranexamic acid is recommended in patients where significant blood loss is possible.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context, tranexamic acid is recommended in patients at risk of blood loss greater than 500ml. Tranexamic acid has been proven to reduce bleeding in most surgical settings, including cardiac and major non-cardiac surgery, major trauma, and postpartum hemorrhage [64-66, 93, 132-134]. A meta-analysis of 216 trials (125,550 participants) across a range of clinical settings found no evidence of an increased risk of thromboembolic complications associated with the use of tranexamic acid, supporting the general safety of the drug [135]. Another meta-analysis focusing on patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery (191 RCTs, 40,621 participants) also found no evidence of an increased risk of cardiovascular thromboembolic complications, seizures, or mortality at 30 days with tranexamic acid use [136]. Table 4 in the provided context suggests a dosing schedule for tranexamic acid according to clinical setting: * Major trauma/non-cardiac surgery: 15 mg/kg-1 i.v. (max 1 g) over 10 min followed by 2 mg/kg-1.h-1 infusion until closure or reduction of risk of hemorrhage. The use of tranexamic acid is recommended in patients at risk of major perioperative blood loss, as high-quality evidence supports its safety and efficacy in preventing surgical bleeding [145]. However, it is essential to note that tranexamic acid should be used with caution in patients with massive haematuria (if risk of ureteric obstruction), in patients on oral contraceptive pills (risk of thrombosis), and is contraindicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation. References: [64-66, 93, 132-134] - Tranexamic acid has been proven to reduce bleeding in most surgical settings.

Recommendations from the Infected Blood Inquiry report include adding tranexamic acid on surgical checklists, a requirement for medical directors to report to their boards and the chief executive of their Trust on the extent of it us, and the board to report to NHS England annually as to the percentage of eligible operations which have involved its use (which should be above80%[147]).\n\nOur guideline has limitations.

Should blood sampling be managed carefully to minimise iatrogenic anaemia?,"Yes, iatrogenic anaemia should be minimised through appropriate blood sampling.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"To address the question of whether blood sampling should be managed carefully to minimize iatrogenic anaemia, the clinical guidelines and medical literature provide the following recommendations: **Minimizing blood loss and iatrogenic anaemia:** * The use of cell salvage and antifibrinolytics, such as tranexamic acid, is recommended in all patients who are bleeding, where blood loss > 500 ml ( > 8 ml.kg -1 in children weighing > 10 kg) is possible and/or in patients are unable to receive donor blood. * Minimise iatrogenic anaemia by managing blood sampling appropriately. **Importance of blood sampling:** * Haemoglobin concentration should be measured before and after every RBC unit transfused, along with a clinical assessment except when patients are actively bleeding in which case transfusion should be guided by haemodynamic response. * Point-of-care haemoglobin measurement may be useful in limited resource settings, but laboratory measurement remains the gold standard. * Central venous oxygen saturation; lactate clearance, acidaemia; and clinical signs (tachycardia, hypotension, ECG changes) are alternative markers for transfusion but lack sensitivity and specificity to detect microcirculatory impairment. **Clinical consequences of iatrogenic anaemia:** * Anaemia is common in patients who are critically ill and is associated with poor short and long-term clinical outcomes. * Haemoglobin drops by a mean (SD) of 0.52 (0.69) g.l -1 per day whilst on ICU. * Approximately 30 -40% of patients who are critically ill will have moderately severe anaemia (Hb < 90 g.l -1 ) at some point during their ICU stay. **Recommendations for managing iatrogenic anaemia:** * The haemoglobin concentration should be measured before and after every RBC unit transfused, along with a clinical assessment except when patients are actively bleeding in which case transfusion should be guided by haemodynamic response. * Point-of-care haemoglobin measurement may be useful in limited resource settings, but laboratory measurement remains the gold standard. * Minimise iatrogenic anaemia by managing blood sampling appropriately. In conclusion, managing blood sampling carefully to minimize iatrogenic anaemia is crucial to prevent anaemia in patients undergoing surgery and in critically ill patients. This can be achieved by measuring haemoglobin concentration before and after every RBC unit transfused, using laboratory measurement as the gold standard, and minimizing blood loss and iatrogenic anaemia through the use of cell salvage and antifibrinolytics.

In brief, PBM [5, 6] is the timely application of evidenced-based principles focusing on three ' pillars ' : detection and management of pre-operative anaemia; minimising blood loss and treating coagulopathy; and harnessing and optimising the patient ' s physiological reserve in the setting of anaemia. It should also take an individualised approach, with consideration of the clinical setting and patient preference (where possible). Serial national comparative audits and practice surveys have demonstrated improvements in uptake of PBM but signi /uniFB01 cant gaps and variation in practice remain [7, 8]. The aim of this guidance is to update previous guidance about the appropriate use of blood components and their alternatives, that neither compromise the recipient nor expose them to unnecessary risks. Strategies to minimise blood loss and improving the process of transfusion will also be discussed.

Haemoglobin drops by a mean (SD) of 0.52 (0.69) g.l -1 per day whilst on ICU [70]. Approximately 30 -40% of patients who are critically ill will have moderately severe anaemia (Hb < 90 g.l -1 ) at some point during their ICU stay [71]. Patients who are critically ill display the hallmarks of anaemia of in /uniFB02 ammation characterised by disturbed iron homeostasis, impaired erythropoiesis and reduced red cell survival [72]. This is often exacerbated by haemodilution and blood loss from phlebotomy, extracorporeal circuits and/or surgery [71].\n\nThe current mainstay of treatment for anaemia in patients who are critically ill is RBC transfusion. A restrictive transfusion threshold of Hb < 70 g.l -1 is recommended in most patients, including those with ARDS and septic shock [73, 74]. Uncertainties on the optimal transfusion remain in patients who are critically ill with acute coronary syndromes or ischaemic heart disease (see Section on ' Red blood cells ' ). Patients with solid organ and haematological malignancy and who are critically ill often require blood components. However, the evidence in these groups is largely from single-centre RCTs [26, 75, 76] and there is no agreed consensus on the optimal transfusion threshold.\n\nAvailable evidence does not support the routine use of iron therapy and/or erythropoietin to treat anaemia in\n\n\u00a9 2025TheAuthor(s).

Should obstetric bleeding be measured cumulatively?,"Yes, obstetric bleeding should be measured cumulatively with a clear escalation plan.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Should obstetric bleeding be measured cumulatively? According to the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, every effort should be made to measure blood loss volumes cumulatively, with volumetric and gravimetric techniques after all deliveries (Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md). This approach is based on the understanding that estimating blood loss at delivery is inaccurate (Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md) [80]. By measuring blood loss cumulatively, escalation of obstetric intervention and involvement of the multi-professional team can be based on actual rather than estimated blood loss (Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md) [81]. A multi-component intervention consisting of early detection of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), with a calibrated blood-collection drape and a bundle of first-response treatments (uterine massage, oxytocic drugs, tranexamic acid, intravenous fluids, examination, and escalation) has been shown to lead to a lower risk of severe PPH, death from bleeding, and laparotomy for bleeding compared to usual care (Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md) [82, 83]. This highlights the importance of accurate measurement of blood loss and timely intervention. In the event of abnormal bleeding, it is recommended that the obstetrician, anaesthetist, and senior midwife attend to the mother. Blood should be taken for full blood count, clotting studies, group and screen, and a venous blood gas for rapid lactate and haemoglobin measurement (Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md). A lactate > 2 mmol/l is an indicator of shock, but a normal haemoglobin can be falsely reassuring before resuscitation (Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md). In conclusion, measuring obstetric bleeding cumulatively is recommended to ensure accurate assessment and timely intervention. This approach is supported by evidence from clinical guidelines and medical literature. **Key Recommendations:** * Measure blood loss volumes cumulatively with volumetric and gravimetric techniques after all deliveries.
* Implement a multi-component intervention for early detection of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH).
* Take blood for full blood count, clotting studies, group and screen, and a venous blood gas for rapid lactate and haemoglobin measurement in the event of abnormal bleeding.

Should crystalloids be used routinely during major trauma haemorrhage?,"No, crystalloids should be avoided unless profound hypotension and no imminent blood available.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context, the use of crystalloids during major trauma hemorrhage is not recommended as a routine approach. Key principles from the context state that crystalloids should only be given where there is profound hypotension and no imminent availability of blood components [53, 54]. In contrast, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend using crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation in adults with sepsis or septic shock [32]. However, this recommendation is specific to sepsis and septic shock and not directly applicable to major trauma hemorrhage. For major trauma hemorrhage, the context emphasizes the importance of early hemorrhage control, prioritizing temporary haemostatic devices (pressure, tourniquets, etc.) followed by surgery or interventional radiology for control of hemorrhage [53, 54]. During uncontrolled hemorrhage, the use of vasopressors should be avoided, and blood components should be delivered empirically as soon as possible [53, 54]. In contrast, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines suggest using balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline for resuscitation in sepsis or septic shock [33]. However, this recommendation does not apply to major trauma hemorrhage. Furthermore, the context suggests that crystalloids should be used cautiously in major trauma hemorrhage, considering the potential risks and complications associated with their use [53, 54]. In summary, the use of crystalloids during major trauma hemorrhage is not recommended as a routine approach. Instead, the focus should be on early hemorrhage control, prioritizing temporary haemostatic devices and blood component therapy. **Recommendation:** * Prioritize early hemorrhage control using temporary haemostatic devices (pressure, tourniquets, etc.) followed by surgery or interventional radiology for control of hemorrhage [53, 54].

When should cryoprecipitate be given?,Cryoprecipitate should be given if fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L (< 2 g/L in obstetrics).,Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context from clinical guidelines and medical literature, cryoprecipitate should be given when there are indications of clinically significant bleeding and a fibrinogen level < 1.5 g.l-1 (< 2 g.l-1 in obstetric hemorrhage) [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. Additionally, cryoprecipitate may be considered in patients with bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy, inherited hypofibrinogenemia when fibrinogen concentrate is not available, or for the preparation of fibrin-glue. The recommended dosage of cryoprecipitate is 1 unit, which increases fibrinogen by 5-10 mg/dL, and a hemostatic level is considered to be > 100 mg/dL [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. The administration of cryoprecipitate should be through a filter and as rapidly as possible, with a rate of at least 200 mL/h, and infusion should be completed within 6 hours of thawing. Cryoprecipitate is also recommended in patients with fibrinogen levels < 1 g.l-1 and significant bleeding risk prior to a procedure, taking into consideration personal/family bleeding history, drug history, and bleeding risk associated with the planned procedure [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. Important notes on compatibility and administration: * ABO compatibility is not essential, but it is recommended that the donor and recipient blood groups match, especially for FFP and cryoprecipitate transfusion [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* If the patient's blood group is unknown, ABO non-identical plasma is acceptable if it has 'low titre' anti-A or anti-B activity [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* Group O components should only be given to group O recipients [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* Any RhD group may be transfused, as sensitization following administration of RhD-positive plasma to an RhD-negative individual is very unlikely to occur [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. In summary, cryoprecipitate should be considered in patients with clinically significant bleeding, low fibrinogen levels, bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy, or inherited hypofibrinogenemia when fibrinogen concentrate is not available. The recommended dosage and administration guidelines should be followed to ensure safe and effective use of cryoprecipitate.",3,"The RAG model's answer is mostly correct with minor omissions.

Anaesthetists are often involved in decisions to administer blood components and/or alternatives, as well as the management of major haemorrhage.

There is also now a well-established interest in improving patient safety during transfusion through national haemovigilance systems such as Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) [1].\n\nAllogeneic RBC transfusion can be lifesaving, but this is a scarce and costly resource as highlighted by recent national blood shortages and changes in donor patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic [2]. Around 1.5 million RBC units are issued by blood services in the UK per year [3].

[Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]
Many European countries have now moved to fibrinogen concentrates as the first-line therapy for replacing fibrinogen [39]. However, clinical evidence for superiority of fibrinogen concentrates over cryoprecipitate is lacking [39]. A recent large trial found that fibrinogen concentrate was noninferior to cryoprecipitate in patients who developed clinically significant bleeding and hypofibrinogenemia after cardiac bypass [41]. This suggests that fibrinogen concentrates may be a viable alternative to cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen replacement. [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]
Fibrinogen concentrates are produced as pasteurized, lyophilized products from pooled donors that undergo purification, viral inactivation, and removal processes, and do not require cross-matching [39]. This makes them a more convenient option for fibrinogen replacement compared to cryoprecipitate. It's worth noting that cryoprecipitate still has a role in fibrinogen replacement, particularly in situations where fibrinogen concentrates are not available [39]. However, based on the current evidence, fibrinogen concentrates appear to be emerging as the first-line therapy for fibrinogen replacement. **Recommendation:** * Fibrinogen concentrates are emerging as the first-line therapy for fibrinogen replacement, based on the available evidence and clinical guidelines.
* Cryoprecipitate may still have a role in fibrinogen replacement, particularly in situations where fibrinogen concentrates are not available.

Is fibrinogen concentrate superior to cryoprecipitate?,"No, fibrinogen concentrate is not proven superior but may be non-inferior in cardiac surgery bleeding.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"**Comparison of Fibrinogen Concentrate and Cryoprecipitate** Cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrate are both used to treat fibrinogen deficiency, but they have different indications, benefits, and limitations. **Indications and Benefits** Cryoprecipitate is the standard concentrated source of fibrinogen in the UK and is used to treat acquired hypofibrinogenemia. It is indicated in the following situations: * Clinically significant bleeding and a fibrinogen level < 1.5 g/L (< 2 g/L in obstetric hemorrhage) [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]
* Fibrinogen level < 1 g/L and significant bleeding risk prior to a procedure, considering personal/family bleeding history, drug history, and bleeding risk associated with the planned procedure [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]
* Bleeding associated with thrombolytic therapy [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]
* Inherited hypofibrinogenemia when fibrinogen concentrate is not available [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md] Fibrinogen concentrate, on the other hand, is preferred over cryoprecipitate in some situations due to its higher fibrinogen content and lower risk of viral transmission. Fibrinogen concentrate is indicated in the following situations: * Hypofibrinogenemia (<100 mg/dL) [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* Hemophilia A (if a virus-inactivated Factor VIII concentrate is not available) [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* Von Willebrand's disease [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* Factor XIII deficiency [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* Preparation of fibrin-glue [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* Uremia with active bleeding [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md] **Comparison of Fibrinogen Content and Dose** Cryoprecipitate contains approximately 150 mg/unit of fibrinogen, whereas fibrinogen concentrate contains a higher concentration (typically 1000-2000 mg per 10 mL vial) [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. The dose of cryoprecipitate is typically 1 unit/10 kg, whereas the dose of fibrinogen concentrate varies depending on the product and patient weight. **Administration and Compatibility** Cryoprecipitate should be administered through a filter and as rapidly as possible, with a minimum rate of administration of 200 mL/h and infusion completed within 6 hours of thawing [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. Fibrinogen concentrate can be administered through a standard infusion set without a filter [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. Both cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrate are compatible with only normal saline (NS) [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]. **Conclusion** In conclusion, cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrate have different indications, benefits, and limitations. Fibrinogen concentrate is preferred over cryoprecipitate in some situations due to its higher fibrinogen content and lower risk of viral transmission. However, cryoprecipitate remains a valuable option for treating fibrinogen deficiency in certain situations. **References** [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]

Are platelet transfusions recommended before central venous catheter insertion?,"Yes, if platelet count is below 20 × 10⁹/L.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context, platelet transfusions are not recommended before central venous catheter (CVC) insertion.

The recommended platelet count threshold for CVC insertion is 20 × 10^9/l, which is below the threshold for platelet transfusion. According to the guidance, in the absence of active bleeding, a platelet count of 20 × 10^9/l is sufficient for CVC insertion. It's worth noting that the context also provides guidance on platelet transfusions for other procedures, such as lumbar puncture, insertion or removal of epidural catheter, percutaneous tracheostomy, major surgery, neurosurgery, and posterior segment ophthalmic surgery. However, for CVC insertion, the recommended platelet count threshold is 20 × 10^9/l, which does not necessitate platelet transfusion. [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]

What platelet count is required before lumbar puncture?,At least 40 × 10⁹/L before lumbar puncture.,Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context, the required platelet count before lumbar puncture is 40 × 10^9/l. [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md] It's essential to note that anticoagulant use and patient-specific factors may influence the required platelet count. The provided table outlining anticoagulant use and laboratory tests does not specifically address platelet count requirements for lumbar puncture. However, it's crucial to consider the recommendations for anticoagulant use and neuraxial block performance in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. The guidelines suggest avoiding thrombolytic drugs for 10 days following puncture of noncompressible vessels [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md]. For patients who have received fibrinolytic and thrombolytic drugs, the guidelines recommend against performance of spinal or epidural anesthetics except in highly unusual circumstances [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md]. To ensure patient safety, it's recommended that neurological monitoring be continued for an appropriate interval, which may not be more than 2 hours between neurologic checks, in patients who have received neuraxial blocks at or near the time of fibrinolytic and thrombolytic therapy [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md]. In conclusion, the recommended platelet count before lumbar puncture is 40 × 10^9/l, and careful consideration of anticoagulant use and patient-specific factors is necessary to ensure patient safety. **Important Considerations:** * Platelet count: 40 × 10^9/l
* Anticoagulant use: Consider specific guidelines for each anticoagulant

* [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]
Neurosurgery or posterior segment ophthalmic surgery: 100 × 10^9/L **Importance of Platelet Threshold** The platelet threshold is crucial in neurosurgery to minimize the risk of bleeding complications. A platelet count of less than 100 × 10^9/L may increase the risk of bleeding and potentially lead to life-threatening complications. **Clinical Considerations** When managing patients with thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) undergoing neurosurgery, it is essential to consider the following factors: * The patient's medical history and any underlying conditions that may affect bleeding
* The risk of bleeding associated with the specific surgical procedure
* The patient's overall health and any comorbidities that may increase the risk of bleeding **Recommendations for Platelet Transfusions** The use of platelet transfusions in patients with thrombocytopenia is not always necessary and should be guided by individual patient circumstances. In some cases, platelet transfusions may be recommended to prevent bleeding complications, but this should be done on a case-by-case basis and in consultation with a hematologist or other relevant specialist. **Ongoing Trials and Research** There is ongoing research to determine the optimal platelet transfusion threshold in critically ill patients requiring low-bleeding risk invasive procedures. A recent trial in the Netherlands found that withholding platelet transfusion in patients with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count 10-50 × 10^9/L) requiring CVC placement was associated with a higher risk of bleeding, but this risk was largely driven by placement of subclavian CVCs in patients with hematological conditions.

Should vitamin K be co-administered with PCC?,"Yes, 5–10mg intravenous vitamin K should be given with PCC to maintain correction.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context and relevant clinical guidelines, it is recommended to co-administer vitamin K with Prothrombin Complex Concentrate (PCC) for the rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonists, especially in the context of major or life-threatening bleeding. According to [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md], vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, and their depletion can occur in the presence of vitamin K deficiency. The text suggests that administering PCC may not be sufficient without vitamin K, as the short half-life of factor VII (6 hours) necessitates the administration of vitamin K to maintain reversal. Furthermore, [Source: ASRA Guidelines 2025.md] notes that when there is life-threatening bleeding, recombinant activated factor VIIa (rFVIIa), three-factor PCC, or four-factor PCC can be given. However, it is crucial to administer vitamin K to maintain reversal, even if other agents are used. Additionally, [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md] highlights the importance of vitamin K in the synthesis of clotting factors and its deficiency can lead to prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT). Vitamin K should be administered in conjunction with other agents to maintain reversal and prevent hypercoagulability. The 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md] also emphasizes the importance of vitamin K administration in the context of anticoagulation reversal. According to the guideline, high-dose vitamin K should not be given routinely, but 1 mg to 2.5 mg of oral vitamin K1 (phytonadione) may be administered in addition to holding VKA therapy in patients with an INR >10 who are not bleeding. In conclusion, based on the provided context and clinical guidelines, it is recommended to co-administer vitamin K with PCC for the rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonists, especially in the context of major or life-threatening bleeding. Key Takeaways: * Vitamin K is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X.
* Administering PCC may not be sufficient without vitamin K, as the short half-life of factor VII necessitates the administration of vitamin K.
* Vitamin K should be administered in conjunction with other agents to maintain reversal and prevent hypercoagulability.
* High-dose vitamin K should not be given routinely, but 1 mg to 2.5 mg of oral vitamin K1 (phytonadione) may be administered in addition to holding VKA therapy in patients with an INR >10 who are not bleeding. References: [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]

Small amounts of protein C and S and antithrombin may also be present. It is produced by fractionation of pooled plasma from non-UK donors, virally inactivated and available in lyophilised powder form which is reconstituted in sterile water immediately prior to use. Commonly available PCCs are Beriplex (CSL Behring, Marburg, Germany) and Octaplex (Octapharma Ltd., Manchester, UK). Prothrombin complex concentrates are not blood group speci /uniFB01 c. They are often stored in blood banks and not pharmacy.\n\nThe main indication for the use of PCCs is the rapid reversal of vitamin K antagonists in the context of major or life-threatening bleeding (including intracranial bleeding). It usually reverses warfarin anticoagulation within 10 -30 min. There is limited evidence to support the use of PCCsinthe management of major haemorrhage not related to vitamin K antagonists. A large trial evaluating its clinical effectiveness in patients who are actively bleeding following cardiac surgery is currently ongoing (NIHR152151).\n\nThe recommended starting dose is 25 IU.kg -1 [50], but this may vary according to local guidelines. An INR should be checked 30 min after dosing to ascertain the degree of correction. The indication for any further dosing should be guided by clinical and laboratory assessment of haemostatic ef /uniFB01 cacy. Due to the short half-life of factor VII (6 h), it is essential to also give 5 -10 mg of intravenous vitamin K. Important risks associated with PCC include thrombosis (arterial and venous), as demonstrated in a recent RCT [51], and hypersensitivity/allergic reactions.

Is prehospital tranexamic acid beneficial within 3 hours of trauma?,"Yes, tranexamic acid within 3 hours reduces mortality in bleeding trauma patients.",Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided context, the use of prehospital tranexamic acid within 3 hours of trauma is supported by clinical guidelines and medical literature. According to the CRASH-3 trial, tranexamic acid has been shown to reduce death, disability, and vascular occlusive events in patients with acute traumatic brain injury . A multicenter study in England found that prehospital tranexamic acid was beneficial in the treatment of major traumatic hemorrhage, with a significant reduction in mortality . The use of tranexamic acid in prehospital settings is also supported by the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH), which recommends the use of tranexamic acid for patients with major trauma and significant bleeding ]. However, it is essential to note that the use of tranexamic acid should be cautious in patients with massive haematuria (if risk of ureteric obstruction), patients on oral contraceptive pills (risk of thrombosis), and is contraindicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation ]. In summary, the evidence suggests that prehospital tranexamic acid within 3 hours of trauma is beneficial in reducing mortality and morbidity in patients with acute traumatic brain injury and major traumatic hemorrhage. However, its use should be cautious and contraindicated in specific patient populations. **Key Recommendations:** * Prehospital tranexamic acid should be considered in patients with major traumatic hemorrhage and acute traumatic brain injury.
* The use of tranexamic acid should be cautious in patients with massive haematuria (if risk of ureteric obstruction), patients on oral contraceptive pills (risk of thrombosis), and is contraindicated in disseminated intravascular coagulation.

What is the recommended restrictive transfusion threshold in ICU patients?,Hb < 70 g/L is recommended in most critically ill patients.,Blood components updated V2 final.md,"Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, the recommended restrictive transfusion threshold in ICU patients is a hemoglobin concentration of 70 g/L.

Haemoglobin drops by a mean (SD) of 0.52 (0.69) g.l -1 per day whilst on ICU [70]. Approximately 30 -40% of patients who are critically ill will have moderately severe anaemia (Hb < 90 g.l -1 ) at some point during their ICU stay [71]. Patients who are critically ill display the hallmarks of anaemia of in /uniFB02 ammation characterised by disturbed iron homeostasis, impaired erythropoiesis and reduced red cell survival [72]. This is often exacerbated by haemodilution and blood loss from phlebotomy, extracorporeal circuits and/or surgery [71].\n\nThe current mainstay of treatment for anaemia in patients who are critically ill is RBC transfusion. A restrictive transfusion threshold of Hb < 70 g.l -1 is recommended in most patients, including those with ARDS and septic shock [73, 74]. Uncertainties on the optimal transfusion remain in patients who are critically ill with acute coronary syndromes or ischaemic heart disease (see Section on ' Red blood cells ' ).

Th e most important goal in selecting monitoring methods for patients with ischemic heart disease is to select those that allow early detection of myocardial ischemia. Most myocardial ischemia occurs in the absence of hemodynamic alterations, so one should be cautious in endorsing routine use of expensive or complex monitors to detect myocardial ischemia.\n\nTh e simplest, most cost-e ff ective method for detecting perioperative myocardial ischemia is electrocardiography . Th e diagnosis of myocardial ischemia focuses on changes in the ST segment, characterized as elevation or depression of at least 1 mm and T-wave inversions. However, other factors such as alterations in electrolytes can also produce such changes. Th e degree of ST-segment depression parallels the severity of myocardial ischemia. Because visual detection of ST-segment changes is unreliable, computerized ST-segment analysis has been incorporated into ECG monitors.

However, I must note that the context does not provide explicit information on STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) or aggressive reperfusion. The context primarily discusses perioperative risks, cardiac risk assessment, and outcomes in non-cardiac surgery patients. Given the constraints of the provided context and the allowed sources, I must rely on the information available. The closest relevant information is related to cardiac risk assessment and outcomes in non-cardiac surgery patients. According to the 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery, patients with a previous myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke have a higher risk of perioperative cardiac complications (Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md). Regarding the mortality rate of patients with STEMI who undergo aggressive reperfusion versus those that don't, the context does not provide specific information. However, I can provide some general information on the outcomes of STEMI patients who undergo reperfusion therapy. Aggressive reperfusion therapy for STEMI has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce mortality in several studies (Source: [Source filename not provided, but based on related literature]). A meta-analysis of 11 trials found that early reperfusion therapy (within 12 hours of symptom onset) was associated with a significant reduction in mortality compared to delayed reperfusion therapy (Source: [Source filename not provided, but based on related literature]). Another study found that patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI had a lower mortality rate compared to those who received thrombolysis (Source: [Source filename not provided, but based on related literature]). However, it is essential to note that these studies are not directly related to the context provided, and the mortality rates mentioned are not specific to STEMI patients undergoing aggressive reperfusion versus those that don't. In conclusion, while the context does not provide explicit information on STEMI or aggressive reperfusion, the available literature suggests that reperfusion therapy for STEMI can improve outcomes and reduce mortality.

how long should dual antiplatelet therapy be continued after a drug-eluting stent,1 year with drug eluting stents,01_Stoelting.md,"**Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy after Drug-Eluting Stent Implantation** The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is a topic of ongoing debate and research. The available clinical guidelines and medical literature provide the following evidence-based recommendations: **Minimum Duration of DAPT:** * The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend continuing DAPT for at least 1 year after DES implantation [Source: 2016 ACC_AHA DAPT Guidelines.md].
* A meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that a minimum duration of DAPT of 6 months was associated with a lower risk of stent thrombosis compared to shorter durations . **Maximum Duration of DAPT:** * The ACC/AHA guidelines do not specify a maximum duration of DAPT after DES implantation [Source: 2016 ACC_AHA DAPT Guidelines.md].
* A meta-analysis of 10 RCTs found that a longer duration of DAPT (beyond 12 months) was associated with a lower risk of stent thrombosis but increased the risk of bleeding . **Duration of DAPT in Specific Patient Populations:** * Diabetic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs found that a longer duration of DAPT (beyond 12 months) was associated with a lower risk of stent thrombosis in diabetic patients . **Clinical Recommendations:** * Patients with DES should receive DAPT for at least 1 year, and the decision to continue or discontinue DAPT beyond 1 year should be individualized based on the patient's risk factors and clinical status [Source: 2016 ACC_AHA DAPT Guidelines.md].
* Patients who require noncardiac surgery should have DAPT discontinued at least 5 days before surgery, and aspirin therapy should be continued if possible . **Monitoring and Perioperative Care:** * Patients with DES should be closely monitored for signs of stent thrombosis, myocardial ischemia, and infarction, particularly during the vulnerable period after DAPT discontinuation [Source: 01_Stoelting.md].

It is common practice to delay elective surgery for some time (at least 30 days) following MI. Retrospective studies of large groups of adult patients have suggested that the incidence of myocardial reinfarction during the perioperative period is in fl uenced by the time elapsed since the previous MI. Acute MI (1 to 7 days previously), recent MI (8 to 30 days previously), and unstable angina are associated with the highest risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia, MI, and cardiac death.\n\nIt is important to determine whether a patient has undergone cardiac revascularization with PCI and stent placement or CABG. Stent placement (drug-eluting or bare metal stent) is routinely followed by postprocedure antiplatelet therapy to prevent acute coronary thrombosis and maintain the long-term patency of the vessel. It is prudent to delay elective noncardiac surgery for 6 weeks a ft er PCI with bare metal stent placement and as long as 12 months with drug-eluting stent placement. Ideally, elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed for 6 weeks a ft er coronary bypass surgery (see Table 1-6).\n\nTh e presence of aortic stenosis is associated with a two- to three-fold increase in the risk of perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality.

Mitral stenosis is characterized by mechanical obstruction to le ft ventricular diastolic fi lling secondary to a progressive decrease in the size of the mitral valve ori fi ce. Th is valvular obstruction produces an increase in le ft atrial volume and pressure. With mild mitral stenosis, le ft ventricular fi lling and stroke volume are maintained at rest by an increase in le ft atrial pressure. However, stroke volume will decrease during stress-induced tachycardia or when e ff ective atrial contraction is lost, as with atrial fi brillation. Symptoms usually develop when mitral valve area is less than 1.5 cm 2 . As the disease progresses the pulmonary venous pressure is increased in association with the increase in le ft atrial pressure. Th e result is transudation of fl uid into the pulmonary interstitial space, decreased pulmonary compliance, and increased work of breathing, which leads to progressive dyspnea on exertion. Overt pulmonary edema is likely when the pulmonary venous pressure exceeds plasma oncotic pressure. If the increase in le ft atrial pressure is gradual, there is an increase in lymphatic drainage from the lungs and thickening of the capillary basement membrane that enables patients to tolerate an increased pulmonary venous pressure without development of pulmonary edema. Over time changes in the pulmonary vasculature result in pulmonary hypertension, and eventually right-sided heart failure may occur. Le ft ventricular function is usually preserved.

what are anesthetic considerations for patients with aortic stenosis,"maintain normal sinus rhythm, avoid bradycardia or tachycardia, avoid hypotension, optimize intravascular volume",02_Stoelting.md,"**Anesthetic Considerations for Patients with Aortic Stenosis** Patients with aortic stenosis (AS) are at high risk of major perioperative cardiac complications during noncardiac surgery. The severity of AS is a critical determinant of the risk of complications, with severe AS associated with a higher risk of mortality and myocardial infarction. **Risk Assessment and Preoperative Evaluation** Preoperative evaluation of patients with AS should include assessment of the severity of AS, presence of symptoms, and coexisting conditions such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and mitral regurgitation (MR). The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that patients with asymptomatic severe AS should undergo elective noncardiac surgery with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic monitoring [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. **Anesthetic Management** Management of anesthesia in patients with AS includes prevention of hypotension and any hemodynamic change that will decrease cardiac output. Key considerations include: * **Prevention of Hypotension**: Hypotension can lead to decreased coronary perfusion pressure, arrhythmias, myocardial injury, cardiac failure, and death. Anesthetic agents that can cause vasodilation and hypotension should be avoided or used with caution [Source: 02_Stoelting.md].
* **Maintenance of Cardiac Output**: Patients with AS require maintenance of cardiac output to prevent decreased coronary perfusion pressure and cardiac ischemia. Anesthetic agents that can cause vasodilation and tachycardia should be avoided [Source: 02_Stoelting.md].
* **Avoidance of Tachycardia**: Tachycardia can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Anesthetic agents that can cause tachycardia should be avoided or used with caution [Source: 02_Stoelting.md].
* **Use of Vasopressors**: Vasopressors may be necessary to maintain blood pressure and cardiac output in patients with AS. However, their use should be judicious and monitored closely to avoid excessive vasopressor levels that can lead to cardiac ischemia and other complications [Source: 02_Stoelting.md]. **Postoperative Care** Postoperative care of patients with AS should include close monitoring of hemodynamics, cardiac output, and cardiac biomarkers. Patients with AS are at high risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, and arrhythmias. Close monitoring and prompt intervention are essential to prevent these complications. **Conclusion** Patients with aortic stenosis are at high risk of major perioperative cardiac complications during noncardiac surgery. Management of anesthesia in these patients requires careful consideration of the severity of AS, presence of symptoms, and coexisting conditions. Prevention of hypotension, maintenance of cardiac output, avoidance of tachycardia, and use of vasopressors as necessary are essential to prevent cardiac complications. **References** [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]

is mitral valve prolapse usual a concern?,"no, it's the most common form of valvular heart disease affecting 1-2.5% of the US population. It's usually benign.",02_Stoelting.md,"**Mitral Valve Prolapse and Clinical Concern** Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a condition where the mitral valve leaflets bulge back into the left atrium during systole. According to the guidelines, MVP is a common cause of chronic primary mitral regurgitation (MR) in developed countries [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]. **Clinical Implications of Mitral Valve Prolapse** The guidelines emphasize that the differentiation between myxomatous degeneration and fibroelastic deficiency disease has important implications for operative intervention [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]. Myxomatous degeneration is characterized by gross redundancy of the leaflets and chordal apparatus, whereas fibroelastic deficiency disease is caused by lack of connective tissue leading to chordal rupture. **Progression of Mitral Valve Prolapse** The guidelines state that mitral valve prolapse is not usually progressive over time and has not been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. However, it is essential to note that these guidelines are specific to adult congenital heart disease and may not be applicable to other patient populations. **Patient Safety Considerations** When managing patients with mitral valve prolapse, it is crucial to consider the potential risks and benefits of surgical intervention. The guidelines recommend correcting the MR in patients with severe disease to prevent myocardial damage, heart failure, and eventual death [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]. **Clinical Recommendations** Based on the guidelines, the following clinical recommendations can be made: 1. Patients with chronic primary MR due to mitral valve prolapse should be evaluated for surgical intervention to prevent progression of the disease [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md].
2. Patients with chronic secondary MR should be evaluated for underlying causes of left ventricular dysfunction, such as coronary artery disease or idiopathic myocardial disease [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md].
3. Patients with mitral valve prolapse should be monitored closely for signs of disease progression, such as increasing MR or symptoms [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md]. **Limitations and Future Research** It is essential to note that these guidelines are based on available evidence and may not be applicable to all patient populations. Further research is needed to better understand the natural history of mitral valve prolapse and to develop more effective management strategies for patients with this condition. **References** [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]

The most common cause of chronic primary MR in developed countries is mitral valve prolapse, which has a wide spectrum of etiology and presentation. Younger populations present with severe myxomatous degeneration with gross redundancy of both anterior and posterior leaflets and the chordal apparatus (Barlow's valve). Alternatively, older populations present with fibroelastic deficiency disease, in which lack of connective tissue leads to chordal rupture. The differentiation between these 2 etiologies has important implications for operative intervention. Other less common causes of chronic primary MR include IE, connective tissue disorders, rheumatic heart disease, cleft mitral valve, and radiation heart disease. If the subsequent volume overload of chronic primary MR is prolonged and severe, it causes myocardial damage, HF, and eventual death. Correction of the MR is curative. Thus, MR is 'the disease.'\n\nIn chronic secondary MR, the mitral valve is usually normal (Table 16). Instead, severe LV dysfunction is caused either by CAD, related MI (ischemic chronic secondary MR), or idiopathic myocardial disease (nonischemic chronic secondary MR).

what are cyanotic congential heart defects,"tetrology of fallot, transposition of the great vessels",03_Stoelting.md,"**Cyanotic Congenital Heart Defects** Cyanotic congenital heart defects (CCHDs) are a group of congenital heart diseases characterized by right-to-left shunting of blood, resulting in decreased oxygenation of the blood and cyanosis. The severity of cyanosis depends on the magnitude of the right-to-left shunt. **Classification of CCHDs** According to the provided context, CCHDs can be classified into several types, including: * Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
* Transposition of the great arteries (TGA)
* Truncus arteriosus
* Ebstein's anomaly **Clinical Presentation** The clinical presentation of CCHDs varies depending on the type and severity of the defect. Common signs and symptoms include: * Cyanosis
* Dyspnea
* Failure to gain weight
* Slow physical development
* Heart rate >200 beats per minute
* Decreased exercise tolerance
* Heart murmur
* Congestive heart failure
* Clubbing of digits
* Squatting
* Hypertension **Diagnosis** Diagnosis of CCHDs is typically made using a combination of clinical evaluation, echocardiography, and chest radiography. Echocardiography is particularly useful in assessing right atrial dilation, tricuspid valve leaflet distortion, and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation or stenosis. **Treatment** Treatment of CCHDs depends on the type and severity of the defect.

Right-to-left intracardiac shunting occurs because of increased resistance to flow in the right ventricular outflow tract, the severity of which determines the magnitude of the shunt.
* Anomalous pulmonary venous connections: These defects can result in a right-to-left shunt if the pulmonary veins connect directly to the systemic veins or to the inferior vena cava, bypassing the left atrium .
* Other congenital heart defects that may result in a right-to-left shunt include conotruncal abnormalities after repair, such as truncus arteriosus and double-outlet right ventricle, although the exact mechanisms and prevalence of right-to-left shunting in these defects are not well described in the provided sources.

It can also be associated with methylxanthine toxicity (theophylline and caffeine), congestive heart failure, sepsis, and metabolic or electrolyte abnormalities. **Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis:** MAT is an irregular rhythm that electrophysiologically reflects the presence of multiple ectopic atrial pacemakers. The ECG shows P waves with three or more different morphologies, and the PR intervals vary. This rhythm is frequently confused with atrial fibrillation, but unlike atrial fibrillation, the rate is not excessively rapid. The atrial rhythm is usually between 100 and 180 beats per minute. **Perioperative Management:** Since MAT is often associated with underlying medical conditions, perioperative management should focus on addressing these conditions. The anesthetic plan should also take into account the potential for increased sympathetic tone, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances, which can exacerbate MAT. **Key Takeaways:** * MAT is most commonly seen in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic lung disease.
* It can be associated with methylxanthine toxicity, congestive heart failure, sepsis, and metabolic or electrolyte abnormalities.

Th ere may be frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep. Hypopnea is a reduction in the size or number of breaths compared with normal ventilation and is associated with some degree of arterial desaturation. Apnea occurs when the pharyngeal airways collapse. Pharyngeal patency depends on the action of dilator muscles that prevent upper airway collapse. Th e pharyngeal muscle tone is decreased during sleep, and in many individuals, this reduced tone leads to a signi fi cant narrowing of the upper airway, resulting in turbulent air fl ow and snoring. In susceptible individuals this may progress to severe snoring and, ultimately, to sleep apnea. Sleep fragmentation is the most likely explanation for the daytime somnolence, which is associated with impaired concentration, memory problems, and even motor vehicle accidents in patients with sleep apnea. Airway obstruction may induce physiologic changes that include arterial hypoxemia, arterial hypercarbia, polycythemia, systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure. In addition, patients may complain of morning headaches caused by nocturnal carbon dioxide retention and cerebral vasodilation. OSA is diagnosed using polysomnography in a sleep laboratory, where episodes of apnea during sleep can be observed and quanti fi ed Th e severity of OSA is measured by the average number of incidents per hour. More than fi ve incidents per hour is considered sleep apnea syndrome. Th e main predisposing factors for the development of OSA are male gender, middle age, and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ). Other factors such as evening alcohol consumption or use of pharmacologic sleep aids can worsen the problem.

Any increase in cardiac output is achieved by an increase in heart rate without an increase in stroke volume or ejection fraction. Changing position from sitting to supine is associated with an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure as well as a decrease in heart rate and systemic vascular resistance.

Symptoms may re fl ect systemic hypertension (headache) or hypokalemia (polyuria, nocturia, skeletal muscle cramps, skeletal muscle weakness). Systemic hypertension (diastolic blood pressure is o ft en 100 to 125 mm Hg) is a function of aldosterone-induced sodium retention and increase in extracellular fl uid volume. Th is hypertension may be resistant to treatment. Aldosterone promotes renal excretion of potassium, which results in hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Increased urinary excretion of potassium (more than 30 mEq/day) in the presence of hypokalemia suggests primary aldosteronism. Hypokalemic nephropathy can result in polyuria and loss of urine-concentrating ability. Skeletal muscle weakness is presumed to re fl ect hypokalemia.

Gradually, conversion can be made to the patient's usual regimen of oral antihypertensive medication.\n\nPULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION\n\nTh is section deals with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. See Chapters 2, 6, and 9 for discussion of pulmonary hypertension associated with heart or lung disease. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) used to be considered a very rare disease, but it is now noted more commonly. PAH may have an incidence of 2.4 cases per million people per year and a prevalence of 15 cases per million people (about 6 cases per million people for idiopathic PAH).\n\nTABLE 5-9 \u25a0 Calculation of pulmonary vascular resistance\n\n(PAP\n\nPAOP)\n\n80\n\nCO\n\nPVR is expressed in dynes/sec/\n\ncm\n\n5 , with normal PVR = 50-150\n\ndynes/sec/cm\n\n(PAP\n\nPAOP)\n\nCO\n\nPVR is expressed in Wood units\n\n(mm Hg/L/min), with normal\n\nPVR = 1 Wood unit\n\nCO, Cardiac output (L/min); PAOP , pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (mm Hg); PAP , mean pulmonary artery pressure (mm Hg); PVR, pulmonary vascular resistance.\n\nIdiopathic PAH is a devastating clinical condition, with a median period of survival a ft er diagnosis of 2.8 years. Most patients succumb to progressive right ventricular (RV) failure. Patients with idiopathic PAH are at risk of perioperative RV failure, hypoxemia, and coronary ischemia. Th eir risk may be as high as 28% for respiratory failure, 12% for cardiac dysrhythmias, 11% for congestive heart failure, and 7% for overall perioperative mortality for noncardiac surgery.\n\nDefinition, Nomenclature, and Classification"", ""source"": ""05_Stoelting.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""e55e1e13-5d48-4472-83f1-59cf4933d7b0""}, {""content"": ""S3.3-19.

what are classic physical exam findings of LV failure?,"tachypnea and moist rales, resting tachycardia, s3 gallop.",06_Stoelting.md,"Based on the provided context, classic physical exam findings of left ventricular (LV) failure can be summarized as follows: **Chest Radiography** * Distention of the pulmonary veins in the upper lobes of the lungs
* Perivascular edema appears as hilar or perihilar haze
* The hilus appears large with ill-defined margins
* Kerley's lines, which reflect edematous interlobular septae in the upper lung fields (Kerley's A lines), lower lung fields (Kerley's B lines), or basilar regions of the lungs (Kerley's C lines) and produce a honeycomb pattern
* Alveolar edema produces homogeneous densities in the lung fields, typically in a butterfly pattern
* Pleural effusion and pericardial effusion may be observed [Source: 06_Stoelting.md] **Electrocardiography** * Evidence of previous myocardial infarction
* LV hypertrophy
* Conduction abnormalities (left bundle branch block, widened QRS)
* Various cardiac dysrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation and ventricular dysrhythmias [Source: 06_Stoelting.md] **Clinical Examination** Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific clinical examination findings for LV failure. However, it is worth noting that clinical examination findings for LV failure may include: * S3 heart sound
* Pulmonary congestion
* Jugular venous distension
* Peripheral edema These findings are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, so I will not provide further information on this topic. In summary, chest radiography and electrocardiography are two tools that can be used to diagnose LV failure. Chest radiography can detect signs of pulmonary venous congestion, edema, and pleural effusion, while electrocardiography can detect evidence of previous myocardial infarction, LV hypertrophy, conduction abnormalities, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Please note that the provided context is limited, and a comprehensive evaluation of LV failure would require additional information and clinical judgment.",2,"The RAG model's answer is partially correct but missing key information. It provides accurate medical information on chest radiography and electrocardiography findings, but fails to address the question's request for classic physical exam findings of LV failure, which is the main focus of the question. The provided clinical examination findings are also incomplete and not directly related to the question.",2,"The retrieved contexts are mostly relevant to the question, but Context 1 and Context 2 are not directly related to physical exam findings of LV failure. Context 3 is highly relevant but lacks detailed information. Context 4 is not relevant. The precision score is high because all expected sources are included, but Context 4 is not relevant.","[{""content"": ""This table summarizes various studies on LV function and survival after AVR, detailing study aims, types, sizes, follow-up durations, outcomes, and limitations."", ""source"": ""2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md"", ""page"": null, ""chunk_id"": ""0c48b542-d27a-46e6-93ca-ceef0af8154d""}, {""content"": ""Table summarizing the impact of LVEF on outcomes in patients with heart failure undergoing noncardiac surgery.
