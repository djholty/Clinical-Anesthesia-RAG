when should a preoperative echocardiogram be ordered,"an echocardiogram may be considered if clinical assessment is suggestive of an undiagnosed severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality such as aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiomyopathy, or severe pulmonary hypertension",2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md,"**Preoperative Echocardiogram Ordering: Indications and Recommendations** Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, the indications for preoperative echocardiogram ordering are as follows: **Strong Recommendations:** 1. **Do not order a preoperative resting echocardiogram to enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation** in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

Step 5: If the patient is at elevated risk of MACE, then determine functional capacity with an objective measure or scale such as the DASI. 133 If the patient has moderate, good, or excellent functional capacity ( \u2265 4 METs), then proceed to surgery without further evaluation (Section 4.1). Step 6: If the patient has poor (<4 METs) or unknown functional capacity, then the clinician should consult with the patient and perioperative team to determine whether further testing will impact patient decision making (eg, decision to perform original surgery or willingness to undergo CABG or PCI, depending on the results of the test) or perioperative care. If yes, then pharmacological stress testing is appropriate. In those patients with unknown functional capacity, exercise stress testing may be reasonable to perform. If the stress test is abnormal, consider coronary angiography and revascularization depending on the extent of the abnormal test. The patient can then proceed to surgery with GDMT or consider alternative strategies, such as noninvasive treatment of the indication for surgery (eg, radiation therapy for cancer) or palliation. If the test is normal, proceed to surgery according to GDMT (Section 5.3).

""Neurosurgery or posterior segment ophthalmic surgery: 100 × 10^9/l"" This recommendation is based on the clinical guidelines and medical literature, which suggest that a higher platelet count is necessary for neurosurgical procedures to minimize the risk of bleeding. **Patient Safety Considerations** It is essential to note that the platelet threshold for neurosurgery is crucial for patient safety. A lower platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding during the procedure, which can lead to severe complications. **Additional Considerations** The provided context also suggests that the platelet threshold for other procedures may be lower than for neurosurgery. For example: * Major surgery: 50 × 10^9/l
* Percutaneous tracheostomy: 50 × 10^9/l
* Percutaneous liver biopsy: 50 × 10^9/l (consider transjugular biopsy if platelet count is below this level) However, these recommendations are specific to the procedures mentioned and may not apply to neurosurgery. **Uncertainty Handling** The available context provides sufficient information to answer this question. However, it is essential to note that the platelet threshold for neurosurgery may vary depending on individual patient factors and the specific procedure being performed. **References** [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]

Recent trials in neonates who were critically ill and adults with intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy have questioned the roles of platelet transfusions for either of these purposes [44, 45].

what percent of hypertensive patients have obstructive sleep apnea?,30 percent,05_Stoelting.md,"Based on the provided context, we can infer that the question is asking for the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in hypertensive patients. However, the direct answer is not explicitly stated in the provided sources. Nevertheless, we can extract relevant information related to obstructive sleep apnea and hypertension from the provided context. According to [Source: 16_Stoelting.md], systemic hypertension is three to six times more frequent in obese than in lean patients and is seen in approximately 50% to 60% of obese patients. Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of obstructive sleep apnea, and it is estimated that the prevalence of OSA is higher in obese patients. While the direct prevalence of OSA in hypertensive patients is not explicitly stated, we can infer that the relationship between obesity, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea is closely linked. As stated in [Source: 16_Stoelting.md], approximately 50% to 60% of obese patients have systemic hypertension, and obesity is a major risk factor for the development of OSA. A study published in Circulation (Poirier et al., 2011) [Source: 16_Stoelting.md] states that bariatric surgery can reduce cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, in obese individuals. However, this study does not provide direct information on the prevalence of OSA in hypertensive patients. To estimate the prevalence of OSA in hypertensive patients, we can refer to a study published in Heart (Vasan, 2003) [Source: 16_Stoelting.md], which states that cardiac function is impaired in obese individuals, and that systemic hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in obese individuals. However, this study does not provide direct information on the prevalence of OSA in hypertensive patients. Based on the provided context, we can conclude that the relationship between obesity, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea is closely linked. While the direct prevalence of OSA in hypertensive patients is not explicitly stated, we can infer that the prevalence of OSA is likely higher in hypertensive patients due to the shared risk factors of obesity. Therefore, the answer to the question is: The available context does not provide a direct estimate of the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in hypertensive patients. However, we can infer that the prevalence of OSA is likely higher in hypertensive patients due to the shared risk factors of obesity.

Th ere may be frequent episodes of apnea and hypopnea during sleep. Hypopnea is a reduction in the size or number of breaths compared with normal ventilation and is associated with some degree of arterial desaturation. Apnea occurs when the pharyngeal airways collapse. Pharyngeal patency depends on the action of dilator muscles that prevent upper airway collapse. Th e pharyngeal muscle tone is decreased during sleep, and in many individuals, this reduced tone leads to a signi fi cant narrowing of the upper airway, resulting in turbulent air fl ow and snoring. In susceptible individuals this may progress to severe snoring and, ultimately, to sleep apnea. Sleep fragmentation is the most likely explanation for the daytime somnolence, which is associated with impaired concentration, memory problems, and even motor vehicle accidents in patients with sleep apnea. Airway obstruction may induce physiologic changes that include arterial hypoxemia, arterial hypercarbia, polycythemia, systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure. In addition, patients may complain of morning headaches caused by nocturnal carbon dioxide retention and cerebral vasodilation. OSA is diagnosed using polysomnography in a sleep laboratory, where episodes of apnea during sleep can be observed and quanti fi ed Th e severity of OSA is measured by the average number of incidents per hour. More than fi ve incidents per hour is considered sleep apnea syndrome. Th e main predisposing factors for the development of OSA are male gender, middle age, and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 ). Other factors such as evening alcohol consumption or use of pharmacologic sleep aids can worsen the problem. Treatment of OSA is aimed at applying enough positive airway pressure through a nasal mask to sustain patency of the upper airway during sleep.

Snoring, as estimated from history, and adenotonsillar size on examination have relatively low positive and negative predictive values in the evaluation of children with sleep-disordered breathing. Polysomnography remains the gold standard for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea. Breathing parameters that are usually monitored in pediatric patients include airfl ow, respiratory e ff ort, and oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. End-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, brain electrical potentials (via electroencephalography), chin muscle electrical potentials (vis electromyography), and leg movements may also be monitored.\n\nObstructive sleep apnea is usually de fi ned as cessation of air fl ow with continued respiratory e ff ort for at least two breaths or 10 seconds.

Examples are hypothyroidism and Cushing's disease. It is important to consider the possibility of an endocrine disorder when evaluating obese patients.\n\nCARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS\n\nCardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in obese individuals and may manifest as systemic hypertension, coronary artery diseases, and heart failure. In patients with clinically severe obesity, cardiac function is best at rest and exercise is poorly tolerated. Physical activity may cause exertional dyspnea and/or angina pectoris. Any increase in cardiac output is achieved by an increase in heart rate without an increase in stroke volume or ejection fraction. Changing position from sitting to supine is associated with an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure as well as a decrease in heart rate and systemic vascular resistance. Obese individuals with cardiac dysfunction may choose to sleep sitting up in a chair to avoid symptoms of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. A history of such a sleep pattern should raise concern about the patient's cardiovascular status.\n\nSystemic Hypertension\n\nMild to moderate systemic hypertension is three to six times more frequent in obese than in lean patients and is seen in approximately 50% to 60% of obese patients.
