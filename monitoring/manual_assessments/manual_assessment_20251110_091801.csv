what is the initial treament for SVT,"**Initial Treatment for SVT:** The initial treatment for SVT in a hemodynamically stable patient can consist of vagal maneuvers such as carotid sinus massage or Valsalva's maneuver. These maneuvers can terminate the arrhythmia in a significant proportion of cases [Source: 04_Stoelting.md]. If vagal maneuvers are not effective, pharmacologic treatment directed at blocking AV nodal conduction is indicated. **Pharmacologic Treatment Options:** The choice of pharmacologic treatment depends on clinical factors, but common options include: * Adenosine: a rapid-acting agent with a brief duration of action, making it an ideal choice for terminating SVT [Source: 04_Stoelting.md].
* Calcium channel blockers: can be used to slow AV nodal conduction and terminate SVT.
* β-blockers: can be used to slow heart rate and terminate SVT. **Algorithm for Treatment of Adult Tachycardia (with Pulse):** The following algorithm is suggested for treatment of adult tachycardia (with pulse): 1. Vagal maneuvers (carotid sinus massage or Valsalva's maneuver)
2. Adenosine
3. Calcium channel blockers
4. β-blockers
5. Cardioversion (if pharmacologic treatment is not effective) **Important Considerations:** * Hemodynamic stability is a priority in the management of SVT.
* Patients with SVT should be monitored for potential aggravating factors, such as electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased sympathetic tone.
* Anesthetic management should focus on avoiding factors that may induce ectopy, such as increased sympathetic tone, electrolyte imbalances, and acid-base disturbances. **References:** * [Source: 04_Stoelting.md] (entire document)",vagal maneuvers like carotid sinus massage or valsalva maneuvers.

what is the definition of pulmonary artery hypertension?,"**Definition of Pulmonary Artery Hypertension (PAH)** Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is defined as an elevation of mean pulmonary arterial pressure to ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest. [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md] **Classification of PAH** PAH is further classified on the basis of the presumed mechanism, including: * Elevation of pulmonary venous pressure (denoted as 'postcapillary pulmonary hypertension')
* Parenchymal or restrictive lung disease
* Rheumatologic disease
* Portal hypertension
* Toxin exposure
* Thromboembolism PAH is also classified by developmental or acquired anatomic abnormalities of decreased pulmonary arterial capacitance, impedance, or stenosis throughout the pulmonary arterial vascular bed. [Source: 2018 AHA_ACC Guidelines on Adult Congenital Heart Disease.md] **Pathophysiology of PAH** PAH develops as a result of pulmonary vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and elevated pulmonary artery pressure. [Source: 05_Stoelting.md] **Diagnostic Studies for PAH** The laboratory evaluation and diagnostic studies used in the workup of pulmonary hypertension of any cause include: * Right-sided heart catheterization to determine disease severity and response to vasodilator therapy
* 6-minute walk test to assess functional status and follow the progress of therapy
* Computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate pulmonary vascular anatomy and exclude other causes of pulmonary hypertension
* Ventilation/perfusion scan to evaluate lung function and exclude other causes of pulmonary hypertension [Source: 05_Stoelting.md] **Vasodilator Test for PAH** The vasodilator test is used to determine the potential response to vasodilator therapy. A potent vasodilator such as prostacyclin, NO, adenosine, or prostaglandin E1 is administered, and the result is considered positive if PVR and mean pulmonary arterial pressure both decrease acutely by 20% or more. Only about one-fourth of patients show a favorable response to the vasodilator test. [Source: 05_Stoelting.md] **Prognosis and Management of PAH** PAH is a devastating clinical condition with a median period of survival after diagnosis of 2.8 years. Patients with idiopathic PAH are at risk of perioperative right ventricular failure, hypoxemia, and coronary ischemia. Effective therapies may be specific to the primary mechanism of pulmonary hypertension in a given patient, and patients with congenital heart disease should have thorough investigation for all potential contributing etiologies to pulmonary hypertension that may require specific therapy.

what are intraoperative events that have a significant impact on mitral stenosis,"**Intraoperative Events Impacting Mitral Stenosis** Mitral stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by the narrowing of the mitral valve opening, impeding blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Several intraoperative events can have a significant impact on the management and outcome of patients with mitral stenosis. According to the 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients with Valvular Heart Disease, the following intraoperative events are crucial to consider: * **Pulmonary hypertension**: Elevated pulmonary artery pressure is a significant predictor of adverse outcomes in patients undergoing balloon mitral commissurotomy. A study by Otto et al. (1993) [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md] found a relation between pulmonary artery pressure and mitral stenosis severity in patients undergoing balloon mitral commissurotomy. Therefore, careful monitoring of pulmonary artery pressure is essential during surgery.
* **Systemic embolism**: Systemic embolism is a known complication of mitral stenosis. A prospective study by Chiang et al. (1998) [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md] identified predictors of systemic embolism in patients with mitral stenosis, emphasizing the need for careful anticoagulation management during surgery.
* **Tricuspid regurgitation**: Severe tricuspid regurgitation can impact the surgical approach for mitral stenosis. A study by Song et al. (2007) [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md] compared percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty with surgical treatment in patients with mitral stenosis and severe tricuspid regurgitation, highlighting the importance of considering tricuspid regurgitation in the surgical plan.
* **Mitral annular calcium**: Mitral annular calcium can cause mitral stenosis and impact surgical outcomes. A study by Pressman et al. ( [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]) reported on mitral annular calcium causing mitral stenosis, emphasizing the need for careful preoperative evaluation and surgical planning. In summary, intraoperative events such as pulmonary hypertension, systemic embolism, tricuspid regurgitation, and mitral annular calcium can significantly impact the management and outcome of patients with mitral stenosis. Careful monitoring and planning are essential to ensure optimal outcomes in these patients. **References:** [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]

how long do you need to wait after stopping clopidogrel before performing a neuraxial technique?,"**Recommendations for Neuraxial Technique Following Discontinuation of Antiplatelet Therapy** For patients receiving clopidogrel, the recommended time interval between discontinuation of therapy and neuraxial blockade is 5 to 7 days [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md]. This recommendation is based on expert opinion and is categorized as grade 1C. A more conservative approach may be to wait 7 to 10 days before performing a neuraxial technique, as this may further mitigate any potential bleeding risk [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md]. However, this recommendation is based on pharmacodynamic evidence and has a lower level of evidence compared to the 5-7 day recommendation. It is essential to note that these time intervals are not sufficient to have a return to baseline activity in all patients, and residual effects of clopidogrel may be present beyond these intervals [Source: ASRA Guidelines 2025.md]. **Residual Antiplatelet Effect and Platelet Function Assays** Although platelet function assays (e.g., PFA II, P2Y12 assay) can be used to assess residual antiplatelet effect, only a normalized value would be useful, and an acceptable level of residual antiplatelet effect remains undetermined [Source: ASRA Guidelines 2025.md]. **Clinical Considerations** Antiplatelet therapy management in the perioperative period should be based on a balanced assessment of the risks of coronary thrombotic complications versus the risk of perioperative bleeding in discussion with the surgeon, interventional cardiologist, attending physician/cardiologist, and the patient [Source: 2018 CCS Antiplatelets.md]. In summary, the recommended time interval between discontinuation of clopidogrel therapy and neuraxial blockade is 5 to 7 days, with a more conservative approach being 7 to 10 days. However, the presence of residual antiplatelet effects beyond these intervals highlights the need for individualized risk assessment and discussion among healthcare professionals. **Sources:** * [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md]

is mitral valve prolapse usual a concern?,"In the context of the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a significant concern in the management of patients with mitral regurgitation (MR). **Prevalence of Mitral Valve Prolapse** Mitral valve prolapse is a common cause of chronic primary MR in developed countries, with a wide spectrum of etiology and presentation. Younger populations often present with severe myxomatous degeneration, characterized by gross redundancy of both anterior and posterior leaflets and the chordal apparatus (Barlow's valve). In contrast, older populations are more likely to have fibroelastic deficiency disease, which involves chordal rupture due to a lack of connective tissue [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]. **Clinical Significance of Mitral Valve Prolapse** The differentiation between myxomatous degeneration and fibroelastic deficiency disease is crucial for operative intervention. Myxomatous degeneration is often associated with a more severe form of MR, which can lead to myocardial damage, heart failure, and eventual death if left untreated [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]. Correction of the MR is curative in these cases, highlighting the importance of prompt surgical intervention. **Comparison with Secondary MR** In contrast to chronic primary MR, chronic secondary MR is often caused by severe left ventricular dysfunction, which can result from coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, or idiopathic myocardial disease [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]. In these cases, the mitral valve is usually normal, and the abnormal left ventricle causes papillary muscle displacement, leaflet tethering, and annular dilation, leading to MR. **Conclusion** In conclusion, mitral valve prolapse is a significant concern in the management of patients with mitral regurgitation, particularly in cases of chronic primary MR. Prompt surgical intervention is essential to prevent myocardial damage, heart failure, and eventually death. The differentiation between myxomatous degeneration and fibroelastic deficiency disease is crucial for operative planning, and further research is needed to better understand the pathophysiology and optimal treatment strategies for these conditions. **References:** [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline for the Management of Patients With Valvular Heart Disease.md]

What is the recommend respiratory rate under OLV?,"Based on the provided context, the recommended respiratory rate under one-lung ventilation (OLV) is 12-16 breaths per minute. [Source: step by step management of onelung ventilation CJA 2014.md]
The respiratory rate needs to be increased slightly upon initiation of OLV to avoid excessive hypercapnia with a protective Vt. High RR, however, will decrease both inspiratory and expiratory time. Therefore, the recommended respiratory rate is 12-16 breaths per minute [1]. Additionally, the inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio may be adjusted to afford maximum exhalation time (1:4-1:6) for the patient with obstructive lung disease and maximum inspiratory time (1:1-2:1) for the patient with restrictive lung disease [1]. It is also worth noting that permissive hypercapnea is routinely employed during OLV to avoid significant air trapping, and PaCO2 levels as high as 70-135 mmHg have been observed during OLV [1]. **Important Considerations:** * The respiratory rate should be adjusted according to the patient's lung disease (obstructive or restrictive).
* The I:E ratio should be adjusted to afford maximum exhalation time for obstructive lung disease and maximum inspiratory time for restrictive lung disease.
* Permissive hypercapnea is routinely employed during OLV to avoid significant air trapping. **References:** [1] Brassard CL, Bussieres JS, Lohser J, Donati F.

how long should infants and children fast after clear fluids?,"Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, the recommended fasting duration for infants and children after clear fluids is: * One hour before elective procedures for infants and children This recommendation is based on the 2025 Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society Practice Resources: Choosing Wisely Canada Guidelines [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md], which states that ""One hour after ingestion of clear fluids for infants and children."" It is essential to note that fasting policies should vary to account for age and preexisting medical conditions, and fasting guidelines may be modified at the discretion of the physician [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]. Additionally, conditions that delay gastric emptying require individual patient assessment. When caring for children with severe febrile illness in settings with limited access to critical care resources, administration of bolus intravenous fluids should be undertaken with extreme caution because it may be harmful [Source: 2015 ACC_AHA PALS Guidelines.md]. Providers should reassess the patient after every fluid bolus (Class I, LOE C-EO). Please also note that the administration of fluid boluses is potentially dangerous and should be administered slowly and with caution, unless the patient is truly shocky [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md].",one hour,3,3,20251110_091801,manual
Should crystalloids be given during uncontrolled haemorrhage?,"Based on the provided context from clinical guidelines and medical literature, here's a comprehensive, evidence-based answer to the question: **Should crystalloids be given during uncontrolled haemorrhage?** According to the Blood components updated V2 final.md guidelines, **crystalloids should only be given where there is profound hypotension and no imminent availability of blood components** [53, 54]. Additionally, the guidelines emphasize that **during active haemorrhage, implement major haemorrhage protocols for volume resuscitation** [53], which may not necessarily involve the use of crystalloids. In contrast, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md recommend **using crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation** in adults with sepsis or septic shock [32], but this is in a different clinical context. Therefore, based on the provided context, the recommendation is to avoid giving crystalloids during uncontrolled haemorrhage, unless there is profound hypotension and no imminent availability of blood components. **Important considerations:** * Early haemorrhage control is a key principle in managing uncontrolled haemorrhage [53, 54].
* The use of vasopressors should be avoided during active haemorrhage [53, 54].
* Blood pressure management should prioritize achieving a lower acceptable blood pressure with volume resuscitation alone, rather than normalizing blood pressure during active haemorrhage [53]. **References:** [53: Blood components updated V2 final.md]

Should single-unit RBC transfusions be used in stable adults?,"**Recommendations for Single-Unit RBC Transfusions in Stable Adults** According to the provided context, single-unit RBC transfusions are recommended in adult patients who are haemodynamically stable and without any evidence of active bleeding [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. The haemoglobin concentration should be measured before and after every RBC unit transfused, along with a clinical assessment [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. **Key Recommendations:** * Haemodynamically stable patients without active bleeding should receive single-unit RBC transfusions [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* Haemoglobin concentration should be measured before and after every RBC unit transfused [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* Clinical assessment should be performed alongside haemoglobin measurement [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. **Clinical Considerations:** * Patients who are actively bleeding should receive RBC transfusions guided by haemodynamic response rather than haemoglobin concentration [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md].
* Point-of-care haemoglobin measurement may be useful in limited resource settings, but laboratory measurement remains the gold standard [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md]. **References:** [1] Available from: https://www.shotuk.org/ [Accessed 17 Jan 2025].

what are the consequences of postdural puncture headache?,"**Consequences of Postdural Puncture Headache** Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) is a common complication of neuraxial anesthesia, particularly in the obstetric population. The consequences of PDPH can be significant and include: * **Increased risk of neurologic complications**: PDPH is associated with an increased risk of neurologic complications, including subdural hematoma, cerebral venous thrombosis, and bacterial meningitis. [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]
* **Long-term morbidity**: PDPH can increase the risk of long-term morbidity, including postpartum depression, chronic headache, and low back pain. [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]
* **Difficulty with ADLs**: 75% of women with PDPH after birth have difficulty with activities of daily living (ADLs). [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* **Postural component**: PDPH is characterized by a postural component, with symptoms worsening when upright and improving when horizontal. [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* **Timing**: PDPH typically occurs within 1-2 days after dural puncture and can last < 1 week, although 7% of cases can last > 1 week. [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md]
* **Other associated symptoms**: PDPH can be associated with nausea (60%), vomiting (24%), neck stiffness (43%), ocular symptoms (13%), auditory symptoms (12%), and occasional cranial nerve palsy. [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md] **Diagnosis and Management** Diagnosis of PDPH is primarily clinical, with a focus on the patient's history, physical examination, and symptoms. The International Headache Society's criteria for PDPH include: * Appearance within 5 days of dural puncture
* Occurs within 15 minutes of sitting or standing and resolves within 15 minutes of lying down
* Associated with one of the following symptoms: neck stiffness, tinnitus, hypacusis, photophobia, nausea [Source: Anesthesia Notes.md] Management of PDPH typically involves conservative treatments, including: * Combination of bed rest and hydration (oral or intravenous)
* Oral analgesics, including acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and opioids as needed
* A single 300-mg dose of oral caffeine
* Sphenopalatine ganglion blocks performed by a skilled operator [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md] **Prophylaxis** Prophylaxis after unintentional dural puncture is not effective and may not be a good idea in this hypercoagulable population.

should patients with a recent myocardial infarction wait before undergoing noncardiac surgery?,"**Timing of Elective Noncardiac Surgery in Patients with Recent Myocardial Infarction** According to the 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md], patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) should delay elective surgery for some time. **Delayed Surgery after Myocardial Infarction** * Acute MI (1-7 days previously) is associated with the highest risk of perioperative myocardial ischemia, MI, and cardiac death.
* Recent MI (8-30 days previously) also carries a high risk of perioperative cardiac complications.
* It is common practice to delay elective surgery for at least 30 days following MI. **Specific Recommendations for PCI and CABG** * For patients with bare metal stent (BMS) placement, elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed for 6 weeks after PCI.
* For patients with drug-eluting stent (DES) placement, elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed for at least 12 months after PCI.
* For patients who have undergone coronary bypass surgery (CABG), elective noncardiac surgery should be delayed for at least 6 weeks. **Additional Considerations** * The presence of aortic stenosis increases the risk of perioperative cardiac morbidity and mortality.
* Patients with critical aortic stenosis should have their surgery delayed or postponed if possible.
* Mitral valve disease is associated with less risk of perioperative complications.
* Prosthetic valves require perioperative endocarditis prophylaxis and adjustment of anticoagulation regimens. **Recommendations for Noncardiac Surgery** * Class I recommendations: + Delay elective noncardiac surgery for 14 days after balloon angioplasty. + Delay elective noncardiac surgery for 30 days after BMS implantation. + Delay elective noncardiac surgery for 365 days after DES implantation.
* Class IIa recommendation: + In patients in whom noncardiac surgery is required, a consensus decision among treating clinicians as to the relative risks of surgery and discontinuation or continuation of antiplatelet therapy can be useful.
* Class IIb recommendation: + Elective noncardiac surgery after DES implantation may be considered after 180 days if the risk of further delay is greater than the expected risks of ischemia and stent thrombosis.
* Class III: Harm + Elective noncardiac surgery should not be performed within 30 days after BMS implantation or within 12 months after DES implantation in patients in whom dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) will need to be discontinued perioperatively. + Elective noncardiac surgery should not be performed within 14 days of balloon angioplasty in patients in whom aspirin will need to be discontinued perioperatively. **Practical Tip** Although routine echocardiography before noncardiac surgery is not recommended, it may be necessary in patients with suspected severe obstructive intracardiac abnormalities or severe pulmonary hypertension. **Source Citations** [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]

how long should a patient fast after infant formula or non-human milk?,"**Fasting Guidelines for Infant Formula or Non-Human Milk** According to the Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society Practice Resources: Choosing Wisely Canada [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md], the minimum duration of fasting before elective procedures for infants and children is: * One hour after ingestion of clear fluids However, for infant formula or non-human milk, the fasting period is six hours as stated in the same guidelines. **Prevention of Aspiration of Gastric Contents** To minimize the risk of aspiration of gastric contents, it is essential to follow the recommended fasting guidelines. For patients ingesting infant formula or non-human milk, a six-hour fasting period is recommended. This allows for sufficient time for gastric emptying and reduces the risk of aspiration. **Neonatal Hypocalcemia** In the context of neonatal hypocalcemia, it is essential to note that ingestion of cow's milk, which contains high levels of phosphorus, can lead to late neonatal hypocalcemia [Source: 27_Stoelting.md]. This condition is not seen in breast-fed infants, as human breast milk has a lower phosphate content. **Clinical Considerations** When managing patients who have ingested infant formula or non-human milk, it is crucial to consider their individual medical status, age, and potential risk factors for aspiration. In some cases, a shorter fasting period may be acceptable, but this should be determined on a case-by-case basis. **Recommended Fasting Periods** The recommended fasting periods for patients ingesting infant formula or non-human milk are: * Six hours after ingestion of infant formula, non-human milk, or expressed breast milk fortified with additions [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md] **References** [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md]

is perioperative initiation of alpha-2 agonists recommended to reduce cardiac risk?,"**Perioperative Initiation of Alpha-2 Agonists to Reduce Cardiac Risk** **Summary:** Based on the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, the perioperative initiation of alpha-2 agonists is not recommended to reduce cardiac risk in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. **Key Findings:** * A 2008 meta-analysis of 31 trials enrolling 4578 patients, which included alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and mivazerol), found a reduction in death and myocardial ischemia, but this was mainly seen in vascular surgery patients [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md].
* A 2004 prospective, double-blinded, clinical trial on patients with or at risk for CAD found that prophylactic clonidine reduced myocardial ischemia during the intraoperative and postoperative period, as well as the postoperative mortality rate for up to 2 years [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md].
* However, a large international trial of 10,010 patients that randomized patients to clonidine or placebo found that clonidine had no effect on myocardial infarction or death and increased the risk of clinically important hypotension and bradycardia and nonfatal cardiac arrest [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. **Recommendations:** * The 2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery recommends against the use of alpha-2 agonists for prevention of cardiac events in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery [Source: 2014 ACC_AHA Guideline on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md].
* The 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery also recommend against preoperative initiation of alpha-2 agonists for the prevention of perioperative cardiovascular events (Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence) [Source: 2017 CCS Guidelines on Cardiac Risk for Non-Cardiac Surgery.md]. **Conclusion:** While alpha-2 agonists may have some benefits in reducing cardiac risk in certain patient populations, the available evidence does not support their routine use in the perioperative period for non-cardiac surgery. The potential risks associated with alpha-2 agonist therapy, such as hypotension and bradycardia, outweigh any potential benefits. Therefore, the perioperative initiation of alpha-2 agonists is not recommended to reduce cardiac risk in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. **References:** * Wallace AW, Galindez D, Salahieh A, et al.

""In settings where norepinephrine is not available, epinephrine or dopamine can be used as an alternative, but we encourage efforts to improve the availability of norepinephrine."" For adults with septic shock on norepinephrine with inadequate MAP levels, we suggest adding vasopressin instead of escalating the dose of norepinephrine. [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines Updates.md] The rationale for this recommendation is that epinephrine targets the same α1 receptors as norepinephrine and may be of limited utility in this scenario [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. In an indirect comparison, a network meta-analysis did not find any significant difference between epinephrine and vasopressin in terms of mortality (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.47-1.88) [Source: 2021 Surviving Sepsis Guidelines.md]. Therefore, vasopressin is suggested as the second drug to add for adults with septic shock on norepinephrine with inadequate MAP levels. **Clinical Safety Considerations:** * Vasopressin may have higher costs and lower availability compared to norepinephrine.
* Epinephrine might be useful in refractory septic shock patients with myocardial dysfunction.
* Combination therapy of vasopressors in septic shock requires further evidence to properly address its role. **Critical Clinical Recommendations:** * Use norepinephrine as the first-line agent for adults with septic shock.
* Add vasopressin instead of escalating the dose of norepinephrine for adults with septic shock on norepinephrine with inadequate MAP levels.
* Consider epinephrine in refractory septic shock patients with myocardial dysfunction.

What platelet threshold is recommended for neurosurgery?,"**Recommended Platelet Threshold for Neurosurgery** According to the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature, the recommended platelet threshold for neurosurgery is: * 100 × 10^9/L [Source: Blood components updated V2 final.md] This recommendation is based on the necessity to minimize the risk of bleeding during neurosurgical procedures, which can be life-threatening. Maintaining a platelet count above this threshold is crucial to ensure patient safety and optimal surgical outcomes. **Important Considerations** * The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) also provides guidelines on the management of patients receiving antiplatelet medications, emphasizing the importance of careful preoperative assessment to identify potential bleeding risks [Source: 2018 ASRA Regional Anesthesia and Antithrombotics.md].
* The Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society (CAS) Revised Guidelines also recommend a platelet count of 100 × 10^9/L for patients undergoing neurosurgery or posterior segment ophthalmic surgery [Source: 2025_CAS_Revised_Guidelines.md].
* However, it is essential to note that these guidelines do not apply to all patients, and individual circumstances may require adjusted platelet thresholds. **Patient Safety Considerations** * Maintaining a platelet count above the recommended threshold is crucial to minimize the risk of bleeding during neurosurgical procedures.
* Patients with platelet counts below the recommended threshold should be carefully evaluated and managed to reduce the risk of bleeding complications.
* Anesthesiologists should work closely with other healthcare professionals to ensure optimal patient care and minimize the risk of adverse outcomes. **Conclusion** In conclusion, the recommended platelet threshold for neurosurgery is 100 × 10^9/L, as supported by the provided clinical guidelines and medical literature. Anesthesiologists should carefully evaluate patients with platelet counts below this threshold and work to maintain optimal platelet counts to minimize the risk of bleeding complications.",A platelet count of at least 100 × 10⁹/L is recommended for neurosurgery.,3,3,20251110_091801,manual

what is the equation for ideal body weight in men?,"To determine the equation for ideal body weight in men, we need to look at the provided sources. [Source: 16_Stoelting.md]
The definition of obesity is mentioned, but it does not provide a specific equation for ideal body weight. However, it does mention the calculation of BMI, which is weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (BMI = kg/m^2).

This source does not provide an equation for ideal body weight. [Source: Management-of-One-lung-Ventilation-Impact-of-Tidal-Volume-on-Complications-after-Thoracic-Surgery.md]
This source mentions the use of predicted body weight (PBW) and actual body weight (ABW) in the selection of tidal volume (V_T). It states that patients of short stature, high body mass index, and female sex received higher V_T than the general population when normalized to predicted or ideal body weight. However, it does not provide an equation for ideal body weight. [Source: One Lung Ventilation.md]
This source provides a table with height and DLT (Double-Lumen Tube) information, but it does not provide an equation for ideal body weight. Unfortunately, the provided sources do not contain a clear equation for ideal body weight in men. However, we can infer that the ideal body weight may be related to the predicted body weight, which is often used in anesthesia calculations. A commonly used equation for predicting ideal body weight is: Ideal Body Weight (IBW) = 50 kg + 0.91 (height in cm - 152) or IBW = 45.5 kg + 0.91 (height in cm - 152) for males Please note that this equation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, but it is a commonly used formula in anesthesia and medicine. It's essential to consult current clinical guidelines and protocols for accurate information on ideal body weight calculations. References:

Should children receive blood components prescribed in units?,"**Should children receive blood components prescribed in units?** According to the clinical guidelines and medical literature, it is recommended that blood components in children should be prescribed as a volume (ml.kg-1) rather than in units . This is based on the fact that children have varying blood volumes depending on their age and size, and prescribing in units may not accurately reflect the actual amount of blood needed . **Guidelines for prescribing blood components in children** The guidelines suggest that blood components should be prescribed based on the child's weight, with the following recommendations: * RBCs: 10ml.kg-1 * Cryoprecipitate: 5-10 ml.kg-1 * Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP): guidelines are not clearly defined, but FFP should be given if INR > 1.5 **Volume of blood needed in children** The volume of blood needed should be modified depending on the size of the patient. A formula is provided to calculate the volume of RBCs to transfuse : Volume (ml) = (Desired haemoglobin - Actual haemoglobin) / (Weight in kg) x 10 **Other guidelines and recommendations** Other guidelines and recommendations for children who require blood components include: * Restrictive thresholds (< 70 g.l-1) for RBC transfusion are appropriate for almost all children over 3 months of age * Higher transfusion thresholds are often applied to neonates and children with congenital heart disease * Neonates should receive components specified for neonatal use, including cytomegalovirus-negative blood components **Importance of precise prescribing** Precise prescribing of blood components is crucial in children to ensure that the correct amount of blood is administered to prevent adverse effects such as hemolysis or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) . **Limitations of current guidelines** The guidelines acknowledge that evidence to guide the use of blood components in children is limited, and often extrapolated from adult practice . **Conclusion** In conclusion, children should receive blood components prescribed in volumes (ml.kg-1) rather than in units, taking into account their age, size, and clinical condition. This ensures that the correct amount of blood is administered to prevent adverse effects and optimize patient outcomes.","No, children should receive blood components prescribed as volume (ml/kg).",3,3,20251110_091801,manual
