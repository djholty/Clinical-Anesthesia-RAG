ABSTRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antiplatelet therapy (APT) has become an important tool in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic events, particularly those associated with coronary artery disease. A large evidence base has evolved regarding the relationship between APT prescription in various clinical contexts and risk/bene /uniFB01 t relationships. The Guidelines Committee of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology publishes regular updates of its recommendations, taking into consideration the most recent clinical evidence. The present update to the 2011 and 2013 Canadian

This statement was developed following a thorough consideration of medical literature and the best available evidence and clinical experience. It represents the consensus of a Canadian panel comprised of multidisciplinary experts on this topic with a mandate to formulate disease-speci /uniFB01 c recommendations. These recommendations are aimed to provide a reasonable and practical approach to care for specialists and allied health professionals obliged with the duty of bestowing optimal care to patients and families, and can be subject to change as scienti /uniFB01 c knowledge and technology advance and as practice patterns evolve. The statement is not intended to be a substitute for physicians using their individual judgement in managing clinical care in consultation with the patient, with appropriate regard to all the individual circumstances of the patient, diagnostic and treatment options available and available resources. Adherence to these recommendations will not necessarily produce successful outcomes in every case.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular Society APT guidelines incorporates new evidence on how to optimize APT use, particularly in situations in which few to no data were previously available. The recommendations update focuses on the following primary topics: (1) the duration of dual APT (DAPT) in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome and non-acute coronary syndrome indications; (2) management of DAPT in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery; (3) management of DAPT in patients who undergo elective and semiurgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery; (4) when and how to switch between different oral antiplatelet therapies; and (5) management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients who undergo PCI. For PCI patients, we speci /uniFB01 cally analyze the particular considerations in patients with atrial /uniFB01 brillation, mechanical or bioprosthetic valves (including transcatheter aortic valve replacement), venous thromboembolic disease, and established left ventricular thrombus or possible left ventricular thrombus with reduced ejection fraction after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In addition to speci /uniFB01 c recommendations, we provide values and preferences and practical tips to aid the practicing clinician in the day to day use of these important agents.

Scope of the 2018 Antiplatelet Therapy Guideline Update

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This update to the 2011 and 2013 Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) antiplatelet therapy guidelines incorporates new evidence on how to optimally use antiplatelet therapy, particularly in conditions in which few to no data were previously available. 1,2 The recommendations focused on the following topics:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and non-ACS indications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of DAPT in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of DAPT in patients who undergo elective and semiurgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When and how to switch between oral antiplatelet therapies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients who undergo PCI with atrial /uniFB01 brillation (AF), mechanical or bioprosthetic valves (including transcatheter aortic valve replacement [TAVR]), venous thromboembolic disease, and established left ventricular (LV) thrombus (LVT) or possible LVT with reduced ejection fraction after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Development of the Guidelines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The CCS appointed co-chairs, a primary panel, and a secondary panel to develop this guideline update. The primary panel developed the scope of the document, identi /uniFB01 ed topics les plus r /C19 ecentes. La mise à jour des lignes directrices sur le TAP de la Soci /C19 et /C19 e canadienne de cardiologie de 2011 et 2013 intègre de nouvelles donn /C19 ees probantes sur la façon d ' optimiser l ' utilisation du TAP, particulièrement dans les situations où il existait peu ou pas de donn /C19 ees. La mise à jour des recommandations porte principalement sur les sujets suivants : 1) la dur /C19 ee du double TAP (DTAP) chez les patients qui subissent l ' intervention coronarienne percutan /C19 ee (ICP) en raison d ' un syndrome coronarien aigu ou d ' un syndrome coronarien non aigu ; 2) la prise en charge du DTAP chez les patients qui subissent une intervention chirurgicale non cardiaque ; 3) la prise en charge du DTAP chez les patients qui subissent un pontage aortocoronarien non urgent ou semi-urgent ; 4) le moment et la façon de passer d ' un traitement antiplaquettaire par voie orale à un autre ; 5) la prise en charge du TAP et de l ' anticoaguloth /C19 erapie chez les patients qui subissent une ICP. Chez les patients qui subissent l ' ICP, nous analysons notamment les consid /C19 erations particulières chez les patients qui souffrent de /uniFB01 brillation auriculaire, qui portent des valves m /C19 ecaniques ou bioproth /C19 etiques (y compris ceux qui ont subi un remplacement valvulaire aortique par cath /C19 eter), qui souffrent d ' une maladie thromboembolique veineuse et dont le diagnostic de thrombus ventriculaire gauche est /C19 etabli ou dont le diagnostic de thrombus ventriculaire gauche avec fraction d ' /C19 ejection r /C19 eduite après l ' infarctus du myocarde avec sus-d /C19 ecalage du segment ST est possible. En plus des recommandations particulières, nous donnons des valeurs, des pr /C19 ef /C19 erences et des conseils pratiques pour aider le clinicien praticien dans l ' utilisation quotidienne de ces importants agents.

for review, performed the literature review and critical appraisal of the identi /uniFB01 ed literature, drafted the recommendations, and voted on the recommendations. Peer review was provided by the secondary panel and the CCS Guidelines Committee. The /uniFB01 nal draft was presented and approved by the CCS Executive Committee.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The committee used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, which started by de /uniFB01 ning the question or issue of interest, including the patient population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes. 3,4 A systematic search was performed to identify all relevant studies, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The committee reviewed the information from the systematic search and evaluated the quality of evidence for each outcome across the studies. Recommendations were then formulated according to the factors outlined in the GRADE approach. Summaries of the literature review are provided online at www.ccs.ca.

1.1. Duration of DAPT in patients treated with PCI for ACS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The recommended duration of DAPT after ACS and PCI was 12 months on the basis of the results of C lopidogrel in U nstable Angina to Prevent R ecurrent Ischemic E vents (CURE) and C lopidogrel in U nstable Angina to Prevent R ecurrent Ischemic E vents in Patients Undergoing P ercutaneous C oronary I ntervention (PCI-CURE), respectively. 1,2,5,6 Although a number of recent randomized trials have suggested that DAPT duration may be shortened to 3-6 months after

PCI, 7-12 particularly with the use of newer generation drugeluting stents (DESs), most patients enrolled had stable coronary artery disease (CAD) or low-risk ACS with fewer patients having high-risk ACS or STEMI. In one meta-analysis, 67% of ACS patients had biomarker-negative ACS. 6 Despite the enrollment of low-risk ACS patients in these trials, shorter durations of DAPT compared with 1 full year of DAPT were still associated with higher rates of myocardial infarction (MI) and stent thrombosis at 1 year. 6 This suggests that ACS patients who are not at high risk of bleeding should receive at least 12 months of DAPT (Fig. 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clopidogrel or prasugrel, in addition to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), beyond 1 year after PCI was studied in the DAPT trial 13 and the use of ticagrelor long-term after previous MI was studied in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54 (PEGASUS-TIMI 54) trial. 14 In the DAPT trial, 9961 patients with a DES who received PCI (43% for ACS) who did not have a bleeding event within the /uniFB01 rst year were randomly assigned to continue thienopyridine treatment beyond 1 year or to receive placebo. Continued treatment with thienopyridine, compared with placebo, reduced the rates of stent thrombosis (0.4% vs 1.4%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.29; P < 0.001) and major adverse cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular events (4.3% vs 5.9%; HR, 0.71; P < 0.001). The rate of death from any cause was 2.0% in the group that continued thienopyridine therapy and 1.5% in the placebo group (HR, 1.36; 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval [CI], 1.00-1.85; P ¼ 0.05). The rate of moderate or severe bleeding was increased with continued thienopyridine treatment (2.5% vs 1.6%; P ¼ 0.001).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial, 21,162 patients who experienced an MI 1-3 years earlier were randomized in a double-blind fashion to ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily (BID), ticagrelor 60 mg BID, or placebo. 14 All the patients were to receive low-dose ASA and were followed for a median of 33 months. The 2 ticagrelor doses each reduced the composite of CV death, MI or stroke (7.85% ticagrelor 90 mg, 7.77% ticagrelor 60 mg, 9.04% placebo; HR 90 mg ticagrelor vs placebo: 0.85; P ¼ 0.008; HR 60 mg ticagrelor vs placebo: 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.95; P ¼ 0.004). Rates of T hrombolysis i n M yocardial I nfarction (TIMI) major bleeding were higher with ticagrelor (2.60% with 90 mg and 2.30% with 60 mg) than with placebo (1.06%; P < 0.001 for each dose vs placebo); the rates of intracranial hemorrhage or fatal bleeding in the 3 groups were 0.63%, 0.71%, and 0.60%, respectively. Because the reduction in ischemic events was offset by an increase in bleeding in DAPT and PEGASUS, patients who have risk factors for recurrent ischemic events might have a more favourable bene /uniFB01 t to risk ratio. Clinical and angiographic variables that place a patient at higher risk of ischemia are shown in Table 1. 14,15,19

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factors associated with increased risk of bleeding are shown in Table 2. Other strategies to improve the bene /uniFB01 t-risk ratio currently being evaluated in randomized trials include using P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy without ASA to reduce the risk of bleeding after PCI. 20,21

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with ACS (STEMI or NSTEMI) who receive PCI:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend DAPT with ASA 81 mg daily with either ticagrelor 90 mg BID or prasugrel 10 mg once daily over clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for 1 year (Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend that, in patients who tolerate 1 year of DAPT without a major bleeding event and who are not at high risk of bleeding, DAPT should be extended beyond 1 year (Strong Recommendation; HighQuality Evidence for up to 3 years of treatment). After 1 year, we recommend a DAPT regimen of ASA 81 mg daily plus either ticagrelor 60 mg BID or clopidogrel 75 mg once daily (Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence) or prasugrel 10 mg once daily (Weak Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. These recommendations place greater emphasis on reduction of major CV events and stent thrombosis vs an increase in bleeding complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Recommendations on duration of DAPT apply speci /uniFB01 cally to duration of P2Y 12 inhibitor therapy. ASA should be continued inde /uniFB01 nitely in most patients with CAD who are not receiving oral anticoagulant therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Patients who have clinical or angiographic features for an increased risk of a thrombotic CV event might derive greater absolute bene /uniFB01 t from extended DAPT beyond 1 year (Table 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Quantitative risk scores have been developed. 19,21-24 These scores might help identify higher-risk patients with greater absolute bene /uniFB01 t of extended DAPT (Table 3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. An ongoing assessment of bleeding and ischemic risk should be performed at least annually to determine whether DAPT should be continued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Prasugrel should be avoided in patients with previous transient ischemic attack or stroke.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. For patients who have a bleeding event during ticagrelor or prasugrel treatment, but for whom continuation of a P2Y12 agent is believed to be warranted, please refer to the de-escalation recommendations in section 2.3.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. In patients with STEMI who receive /uniFB01 brinolytic therapy, clopidogrel is currently the recommended P2Y12 inhibitor within the /uniFB01 rst 24 hours. A recent randomized trial showed a higher level of platelet inhibition with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel. 25 Ongoing trials are evaluating clinical outcomes with ticagrelor in this setting (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02298088).

These groups include previous ACS, 40 multivessel disease, 17 and complex PCI. 15

Over a mean follow-up of 23 months, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg with ASA reduced the composite outcome of CV death, MI, or stroke by 24% (4.1% vs 5.4%; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66-0.86; P < 0.001), reduced all-cause mortality by 18% (3.4% vs 4.1%; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.96; P ¼ 0.01), increased major bleeding by 70% (3.1% vs 1.9%; HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.40-2.05; P < 0.001), but did not signi /uniFB01 cantly increase intracranial or fatal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients undergoing PCI for a non-ACS indication (eg, stable ischemic heart disease):

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend 6 months (and up to 1 year) of DAPT with ASA and clopidogrel (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We suggest that in patients who have additional highrisk clinical or angiographic features for thrombotic CV events and who are at low risk of bleeding, it is reasonable to extend the duration of DAPT to > 1 year (Weak Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence for up to 3 years of treatment).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We suggest that in patients who are at high risk of bleeding, the duration of DAPT be shortened to a minimum of 1 month (if a bare-metal stent [BMS] is used) or 3 months (if a DES is used) (Weak Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. These recommendations place greater emphasis on reduction of major CV thrombotic events and stent thrombosis vs an increase in bleeding complications. These recommendations presume that patients who experience a clinically signi /uniFB01 cant bleed or at high risk of bleeding would be reassessed for the appropriateness of continuation of DAPT at 1 year.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. A general principle to consider when deciding on the duration of DAPT is a balanced assessment of the risk of thrombotic CV events and bleeding. Patients at lower risk of thrombotic events and higher risk of bleeding can be considered for a shorter duration of DAPT whereas patients at higher risk of thrombotic events and lower risk of bleeding should be considered for a longer duration of DAPT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. As in the ACS setting, patients who undergo PCI for a non-ACS indication might derive greater absolute bene /uniFB01 t of extended DAPT if they have clinical or angiographic features associated with increased risk of thrombotic CV events (Table 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1.3. Risk scores to inform DAPT duration after PCI

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Three risk scores to quantify bleeding and/or ischemic events have been published and retrospectively validated. 19,22,23 To date, no score has been prospectively validated. Table 3 provides a summary of these scores and links to online calculators for each. Scores combining bleeding and ischemic events assume equal clinical importance to each type of event. Risk scores should complement available clinical and angiographic data, and are not a substitute for clinical judgement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
1.4. Interrupting DAPT for noncardiac surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who are being treated with DAPT after a PCI with a BMS or DES, 2 issues need to be addressed: timing of surgery and perioperative DAPT management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The only randomized trial in noncardiac surgery to assess perioperative antiplatelet drug management is P eri o perative Is chemic E valuation (POISE)-2, which showed that perioperative ASA use did not affect the incidence of CV events or mortality but conferred a small but statistically signi /uniFB01 cant

increased risk for major bleeding (4.6% vs 3.8%; P ¼ 0.04). 43 However, only 4% of patients had a coronary stent. In a U.S. observational study of 20,590 patients who had noncardiac surgery within 2 years of PCI and 41,180 matched control participants with coronary stents who did not have surgery, there was a clustering of cardiac events within the /uniFB01 rst 3 months after PCI, with the highest risk if surgery occurred within 4-6 weeks post-PCI. 44 Among patients having surgery between 6 weeks and 6 months post-PCI, the absolute risk for cardiac events was higher after complex surgery than for less complex inpatient surgery or outpatient surgery (5.3% vs 3.7% vs 0.1%). A key limitation of this study was that perioperative DAPT management was not speci /uniFB01 ed. In a Danish study of 4031 patients with drug-eluting coronary stents and 20,232 control participants without CAD having noncardiac surgery, the risk for adverse cardiac events appeared highest within the /uniFB01 rst month postPCI. 45 Beyond 1 month post-PCI, the risk for cardiac events was not affected by the time interval between PCI and surgery. However, information on perioperative antiplatelet management was lacking. Finally, in a registry of 880 post-PCI patients who had noncardiac surgery, in whom ASA and DAPT was continued in approximately 70% and approximately 10% of patients, respectively, 30-day rates of perioperative adverse cardiac and major bleeding events were 3.5% and 5.6%, respectively. 46 Overall, in post-PCI patients receiving DAPT having noncardiac surgery, the perioperative increased risk of bleeding with ASA continuation appears modest, and until patient management data are available it is reasonable to suggest continuing ASA, whereas in most patients, interrupting P2Y 12 therapy.

Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients undergoing PCI who are treated with a BMS and who require elective noncardiac surgery, we recommend delaying surgery for at least 1 month after PCI (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients undergoing PCI who are treated with a DES and who require elective noncardiac surgery, we recommend delaying surgery for at least 3 months after PCI (Strong Recommendation; ModerateQuality Evidence). If there is a need for semiurgent noncardiac surgery, we suggest delaying surgery for at least 1 month after PCI (Weak Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients undergoing PCI who are treated with either a BMS or DES and who require elective noncardiac surgery, we suggest continuing ASA perioperatively whenever possible (Weak Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients undergoing PCI who are treated with a BMS or DES and who require elective noncardiac surgery, we suggest withholding clopidogrel and ticagrelor for 5-7 days preoperatively, and prasugrel for 7-10 days preoperatively (Weak Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients undergoing PCI who are treated with a BMS or DESandwhohaveundergonenoncardiacsurgery,we suggest restarting maintenance-dose DAPT after surgery, as soon as it is deemed safe by the surgeon (Weak Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. The risk and consequences of perioperative bleeding will vary considerably depending on the type of surgery performed. Some minor surgical procedures carry a low risk of bleeding, whereas others a very high risk of bleeding. For example, some dental, ophthalmological, and endoscopic procedures carry a low risk of bleeding and can be performed without stopping antiplatelet therapy.

1.5. Elective or semiurgent CABG surgery after ACS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who are receiving DAPT and require elective or semiurgent CABGsurgeryposea special challenge, especially after an ACS because of the high bleeding risk associated with CABG and the potentially serious consequences of bleeding (eg, pericardial tamponade). The only randomized trial to assess perioperative use of ASA before CABG is A ntithrombotic T herapy in A cute C oronary S yndromes (ATACAS), which reported that preoperative use of ASA was not associated with an increased risk for bleeding or transfusion requirements but also did not mitigate the risk for ACS or mortality. 47 The neutral /uniFB01 ndings of this trial might have arisen from the study design whereby ASA was initiated 1-2 hours before CABG, after a /C21 4-day interruption period, which is not done in clinical practice. The /uniFB01 ndings suggest, in concert with older studies, 48-50 that it is reasonable to continue ASA in patients with or without an ACS who require CABG. In a registry of ASA-treated patients with an ACS who required CABG surgery, of whom 1266 were receiving ticagrelor and 978 receiving clopidogrel, it appeared that stopping ticagrelor for at least 3 days and stopping clopidogrel for 5 days before CABGwasneeded to mitigate the risk for perioperative bleeding, compared with a shorter interruption interval. 51 Additional

2. Switching Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No large randomized trial with de /uniFB01 nitive clinical outcomes data has been performed to support switching between P2Y12 inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In large international registries, intensi /uniFB01 cation of therapy from clopidogrel to a more potent P2Y12 inhibitor has been reported in 5%-50% of patients, whereas de-escalation from a more potent agent to clopidogrel was undertaken in up to 11% of patients. 58-66 Common reasons for switching are outlined in Supplemental Table S1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The predominant evidence for switching between P2Y12 inhibitors is on the basis of pharmacodynamic data from small, randomized studies, which lack power to de /uniFB01 nitively assess ischemic or bleeding outcomes. Registry data consisting of > 4000 patients with switching did not show a signal for increased major bleeding complications. 58-65,67

2.1. Intensi /uniFB01 cation strategies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.1.1. Switching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor. In the Plat elet Inhibition and Patient O utcomes (PLATO) trial, 47.1% (n ¼ 4396) of patients randomized to ticagrelor received clopidogrel in the 24 hours preceding randomization (Supplemental Table S1). 68 From pharmacodynamic studies, a ticagrelor 180 mg loading dose resulted in early improvement in platelet inhibition compared with 90 mg, among patients receiving clopidogrel; this effect was abrogated by 72 hours. 69,70 No increase in bleeding was observed using the loading dose of 180 mg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients requiring a switch from clopidogrel to ticagrelor, we recommend a ticagrelor loading dose of 180 mg followed by 90 mg BID, regardless of the timing of the last clopidogrel dose (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.1.2. Switching from clopidogrel to prasugrel. In Tr ial to Assess I mprovement in T herapeutic O utcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibitio n With Prasugrel (TRITON), pretreatment with clopidogrel before randomization led to exclusion. 71 Consequently, clinical data from a large trial is lacking for a switch from clopidogrel to prasugrel. Accordingly, decisionmaking must be on the basis of smaller pharmacodynamic studies consisting of > 3000 patients (Supplemental Fig. S1). 64,72-76 Two randomized studies, Sw itching A nti P latelet Study (SWAP; n ¼ 139) and Tr ansferring From Clop i dogrel Loading Dose to P rasugrel L oading Dose in Acute Coronary Syndrome Pati e n t s (TRIPLET; n ¼ 282), evaluated the effects of a loading dose of prasugrel. 72,74 The 60-mg loading dose provided a signi /uniFB01 cant increase in platelet inhibition by 2 hours compared with the 10-mg maintenance dose alone. No increase in bleeding outcomes was observed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients requiring a switch from clopidogrel to prasugrel, we recommend a prasugrel loading dose of 60 mg followed by 10 mg daily, regardless of the timing of the last clopidogrel dose (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.2. Switching between prasugrel and ticagrelor

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Switching to another potent P2Y12 receptor inhibitor rather than de-escalation to clopidogrel would be preferred for patients deemed at higher risk for ischemic events (Supplemental Fig. S2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.2.1. Switching from prasugrel to ticagrelor. SWAP-3 was the only randomized study to evaluate the switch from prasugrel to ticagrelor. 77 In 82 ACS patients initially treated with prasugrel, a loading dose of 180 mg of ticagrelor followed by 90 mg BID vs direct initiation of a 90-mg BID dose was compared with a control arm of patients who continued to receive prasugrel. Both switching groups, irrespective of the use of the 180-mg loading dose, showed an early, but transient greater platelet inhibition present by 2 hours and maintained up to 48 hours. At 1 week, both arms were noninferior compared with patients maintained with prasugrel. There was no major or minor bleeding observed in either switching strategy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients requiring a switch from prasugrel to ticagrelor, we suggest ticagrelor 90 mg BID, without a loading dose, to be initiated at the time of the next scheduled prasugrel dose (Weak Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.2.2. Switching from ticagrelor to prasugrel. The SWAP-2 study randomized 110 patients with stable CAD initially treated with ticagrelor to receive a 60-mg loading dose of prasugrel vs direct initiation of a 10-mg daily dose and compared with a control arm of patients maintained with ticagrelor. 78 In both switching strategies, a transient increase in platelet reactivity was observed in the /uniFB01 rst 48 hours, an effect that was diminished in patients receiving a 60-mg loading dose of prasugrel. By 7 days, the 2 strategies had

For patients requiring a switch from ticagrelor to prasugrel, we suggest a prasugrel loading dose of 60 mg followed by 10 mg daily, to be initiated at the timing of the next scheduled ticagrelor dose (Weak Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.3. De-escalation strategies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When de-escalating from ticagrelor or prasugrel to clopidogrel, it is important to consider the rationale for switching to balance bleeding vs thrombotic risks (Supplemental Fig. S3). In patients who have suffered major bleeding during treatment with potent P2Y12 inhibitors, there might concerns for further bleeding, which might outweigh ischemic risks and in this context discontinuation might be considered. For patients with high-risk features (Table 1), de-escalation to clopidogrel should be considered to complete the recommended duration of DAPT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients receiving ticagrelor or prasugrel who experience a clinically signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding complication that has resolved, we suggest de-escalating to clopidogrel 75 mg daily (Weak Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may be switched because of side effects with prasugrel or ticagrelor treatment, in which case thrombotic risks might override concerns of bleeding. In the absence of features associated with high risk for thrombotic events (Table 1), de-escalation to clopidogrel can also be considered (in lieu of switching between potent agents in high-risk patients). Among prasugrel- or ticagrelor-treated patients, who subsequently develop a new indication for requiring concurrent treatment with an oral anticoagulant, de-escalation to clopidogrel should also be considered (refer to Section 3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.3.1. Switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel. The Opti mizing Cross over from Ticagrelor to Clopidogrel in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (OPTI-CROSS) study evaluated strategies for switching from ticagrelor to clopidogrel. 66 Sixty patients were randomized to receive either a 600 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg daily vs directly starting 75 mg daily. At 48 hours after randomization, a loading dose provided improved platelet inhibition compared with the maintenance dose alone; however, this difference was no longer present by 72 hours, thus suggesting an early protective effect with loading.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients receiving ticagrelor who are experiencing signi /uniFB01 cant side effects (excluding bleeding) or who are

<!-- PAGE=? -->
unable to tolerate the drug (and where prasugrel is not an option), we suggest de-escalating to clopidogrel with a loading dose of 600 mg followed by 75 mg daily, to be initiated at the time of the next scheduled ticagrelor dose (Weak Recommendation; Very LowQuality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. The loading dose of 600 mg conveys a shortterm (48 hours) pharmacodynamic advantage after the switch to clopidogrel that might be relevant in the early post-ACS/ PCI period. In patients who are stable, a loading dose of 300 mg or switching directly to 75 mg daily with no loading dose are also reasonable options, especially for patients believed to be at high risk for bleeding. T iming o f P latelet I nhibition after Acute C oronary Syndrome (TOPIC) study, switching from ticagrelor directly to clopidogrel 75 mg daily 1 month after ACS 79 was reported to decrease bleeding without an increase in ischemic events, with the caveat that the study was not powered for ischemic outcomes. 79

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. The optimal time for the initiation of clopidogrel has not been extensively studied. In OPTI-CROSS, the switch was made at the next scheduled ticagrelor dose; extending to the following morning (ie, 24 hours after the last ticagrelor dose) might also be reasonable on the basis of pharmacodynamics data from the Response to Ticagrelor in Clopidogrel Nonresponders and Responders and Effect of Switching Therapies (RESPOND) study. 80

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2.3.2. Switching from prasugrel to clopidogrel. Switching from prasugrel to clopidogrel 75 mg daily, without additional loading, was evaluated in the TOPIC study (in patients without adverse events by 1 month after ACS) and in the T esting R esp o nsiveness to P latelet I nhibition on C hronic A ntip l atelet Treatment for A cute C oronary S yndromes (TROPICAL-ACS) trial (initiated 1 week after ACS and then guided on the basis of platelet function testing). 79,81 There was lower bleeding with no signal for increased ischemic outcomes in the de-escalation groups, but it should be noted that both trials were underpowered to assess ischemic end points.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients receiving prasugrel who are experiencing signi /uniFB01 cant side effects (excluding bleeding) or who are unable to tolerate the drug (and for whom ticagrelor is not an option), we suggest de-escalating to clopidogrel directly at 75 mg daily (without a loading dose) at the time of the next scheduled prasugrel dose (Weak Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. The suggested strategies are formulated on the basis of a systematic review of the literature evaluating pharmacodynamic evidence for optimal platelet inhibition, balanced with an absence of signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding complications. Studies in which patients were identi /uniFB01 ed as nonresponders using platelet function testing before randomization were excluded because of generalizability concerns.

3. Patients With AF Who Undergo PCI

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 20% of patients with AF will require PCI at some time. 82 Up to 21% of ACS patients will have new or established AF. 83 In the absence of clear evidence for the optimal pharmacologic strategy to balance the risks of ischemic stroke and stent thrombosis, the use of ' triple therapy ' with 2 antiplatelet agents and an oral anticoagulant is commonly used. With PCI alone, DAPT is more effective than warfarin with ASA in reducing coronary events. 84 In ACS, DAPT reduces clinical events. 5,6,68,71,85 In patients with nonvalvular AF, oral anticoagulation (OAC) with warfarin reduces the risk of stroke 86 and is more effective than DAPT in preventing thrombotic complications. 87 Non-vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are preferred to warfarin in AF because of their greater convenience and, with some agents, the lower risks of bleeding events and mortality. 88-90

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although the rationale for ' triple therapy ' seems reasonable, the risk of bleeding events is concerning. Analyses from the NOAC AF trials suggest a 30%-60% increased bleeding risk in patients receiving a NOAC plus an antiplatelet agent. 91-94 In a large Danish registry of AF patients, greater nonfatal and fatal bleeds were observed with the combination of warfarin with ASA. Warfarin with clopidogrel as well as triple therapy conferred more than a threefold higher risk of bleeding compared with warfarin alone. 95 In a large metaanalysis (mostly observational studies), a combination of clopidogrel and OAC (a so-called ' dual pathway ' ) reduced the risk of bleeding compared with triple therapy with no difference in major adverse cardiac events. 96

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The W hat Is the O ptimal Antiplat e let and Anticoagulation Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary S ten t ing (WOEST) trial (n ¼ 573) compared clopidogrel and warfarin (dual pathway) with ASA and clopidogrel with warfarin (triple therapy) in patients with a need for anticoagulation who underwent PCI. 97 In this open-label trial, a reduction in bleeding (most of which was minor bleeding) was observed with the dual pathway approach. The trial was not powered for ef /uniFB01 cacy. The I ntracoronary S tenting and A ntithrombotic R egimen-Testing of a 6-Week Versus a 6Month Clopidogrel Treatment Regimen in Patients With Concomitant Aspirin and Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Following Drug-Eluting Stenting (ISAR-TRIPLE) trial (n ¼ 614) randomized patients receiving OAC and PCI during concomitant warfarin and ASA treatment to either 6 weeks of clopidogrel (shorter triple therapy) or 6 months of clopidogrel (longer triple therapy). The trial showed no differences in bleeding or ef /uniFB01 cacy but was notably underpowered for these outcomes. In a post hoc landmark analysis after 6 weeks (with both arms of the study receiving triple therapy at 6 weeks), the 6-month group seemed to experience more major bleeding events. 98 The An O p en-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study Explor i ng Tw o Treatme n t Strat e gi e s of R ivaroxaban and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy in Subjects with A trial F ibrillation who Undergo P ercutaneous C oronary I ntervention (PIONEER AF-PCI) trial (n ¼ 2124) evaluated 2 recent concepts in antithrombotic therapy: the use of a NOAC in place of warfarin and the dual pathway with elimination of ASA as an alternative to a traditional triple therapy regimen. In this open-label study of AF patients receiving PCI, patients were randomized to a P2Y12 inhibitor (94.4% received clopidogrel and only 4.3% ticagrelor and 1.3% prasugrel) with rivaroxaban 15 mg daily (dual pathway) for 12 months, DAPT with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID (reduced-dose triple therapy) for 1, 6, or 12 months, or DAPT with warfarin (traditional triple therapy) for 1, 6, or 12 months. The dual pathway as well as the reduced-dose triple therapy strategies reduced clinically signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding compared with traditional triple therapy with warfarin. The main limitation of this trial was that it was not powered to detect moderate differences in ef /uniFB01 cacy, including stroke or stent thrombosis. 99 In a post hoc analysis, there was a reduction in the composite of all-cause death and rehospitalizations (CV hospitalizations as well as bleeding hospitalizations) with rivaroxaban-based strategies compared with traditional triple therapy with warfarin. 100 The R andomized E valuation of D ual Antithrombotic Therapy with Dabigatran versus Triple Therapy with Warfarin in Patients with Nonvalv u lar A tria l Fibrillation Undergoing P ercutaneous C oronary I ntervention (RE-DUAL PCI) 101 trial (n ¼ 2725) evaluated 2 doses of dabigatran in patients with AF who underwent PCI. Patients were randomized to dual pathway with dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg BID) with a P2Y12 inhibitor (88% received clopidogrel and 12% received ticagrelor) vs traditional triple therapy with warfarin with a P2Y 12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) and ASA. Both dual pathway approaches reduced clinically signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding compared with warfarin triple therapy and was noninferior with respect to risk of thromboembolic events d recognizing this study was also underpowered to detect differences in these events. The trials that evaluated a dual pathway regimen are summarized in Supplemental Table S2. Ongoing studies include AUGUSTUS (NCT02415400), which is evaluating apixaban, and E doxaba nTr eatment Vers us Vitamin K Antagonist in Pa t ients with A trial F ibrillation Undergoing P ercutaneous C oronary I ntervention (ENTRUST-AF-PCI) (NCT02866175), which is evaluating edoxaban.

We recommend that patients who have concomitant AF and symptomatic CAD receive a regimen of antithrombotic therapy based on a balanced assessment of their risk of: (1) ischemic stroke; (2) future coronary event(s); and (3) clinically signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding associated with the use of antithrombotic agents (Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence).

75 mg daily for 6 months (and up to 1 year; Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence).

Values and preferences. The risk of stroke varies from approximately 0.7% per year in patients younger than 65 years of age and CHADS2 score of 0, to approximately 2.1% per year in patients 65-74 years of age. The risk of stent thrombosis is greatest in the /uniFB01 rst month after PCI and declines thereafter. In patients with AF at lower risk of stroke, this recommendation gives greater weight to the prevention of future coronary events and less major bleeding with DAPT than with OAC, and less weight to the greater risk of stroke with DAPT than with OAC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. In patients who are at high risk of bleeding, the duration of DAPT should be shortened to a minimum of 1 month (if a BMS was used) or 3 months (if a DES was used) as per recommendation 5.

If age /C21 65 years or CHADS2 /C21 1, we suggest OAC plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for at least 1 month (and up to 12 months) after BMS implantation and for at least 3 months (and up to 12 months) after DES implantation (Weak Recommendation; ModerateQuality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. The risk of stroke is increased to 2.1% per year in 65- to 74-year-old patients and even higher in patients older than 75 years, providing a rationale for the inclusion of OAC in the regimen. The suggestion for OAC and clopidogrel (and omission of ASA) is on the basis of randomized trials that showed a lower risk of bleeding with this regimen vs warfarin with clopidogrel and ASA (traditional triple therapy). Although the evidence suggests a major compromise in ef /uniFB01 cacy is unlikely by omitting ASA, it is acknowledged that none of the randomized trials were individually powered to detect moderate differences in thrombotic events. Doses of OAC evaluated in randomized trials of patients with AF who undergo PCI are shown in Table 4. Rivaroxaban 15 mg daily (10 mg daily in patients with renal dysfunction) with clopidogrel and dabigatran 110 or 150 mg BID and clopidogrel have been evaluated in randomized trials vs traditional warfarin-based triple therapy. At the time this document was written, randomized trials evaluating apixabanand edoxaban-based regimens in patients with AF who undergo PCI were in progress, so no dose recommendations with these agents are provided.

After the initial period of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF without high-risk features who undergo elective PCI, if age is 65 years or older or CHADS2 /C21 1 we recommend long-term therapy with either OAC alone (Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence) or, if high-risk clinical or angiographic features for ischemic events develop and low risk of bleeding, OAC and single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor (Weak Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence).

Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with AF undergoing PCI for ACS or highrisk elective PCI :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If age < 65 years and CHADS2 ¼ 0, we recommend DAPT alone with ASA 81 mg daily plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (ticagrelor or prasugrel recommended for patients with ACS and clopidogrel recommended for patients who undergo elective PCI) for up to 12 months (Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. Patients with AF who are younger than 65 years and CHADS2 ¼ 0 who undergo PCI require DAPT to reduce thrombotic coronary events. OAC is not recommended in these patients with low risk of stroke.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. The duration of treatment with DAPT in patients with ACS (or those who undergo high-risk PCI) who also have AF with a low risk of stroke should depend on a balanced assessment of the risk of coronary thrombotic events (Table 1) and bleeding (Table 2). Patients at lower risk of coronary thrombotic events and higher risk of bleeding can be considered for shorter-duration DAPT and patients at higher risk of coronary thrombotic events and lower risk of bleeding should be considered for longer duration of DAPT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with AF undergoing PCI for ACS or highrisk elective PCI :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If age /C21 65 years or CHADS2 /C21 1*, we recommend an initial regimen of triple therapy with ASA 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus reduced intensity/dose OAC. ASA may be discontinued as early as the day following PCI or it can be continued for up to 6 months of treatment, depending on the risk of recurrent coronary thrombotic events versus major bleeding (Strong Recommendation, Moderate Quality Evidence). Following ASA discontinuation, we suggest that OAC plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily be continued for up to 12 months after the initial PCI (Weak Recommendation, Moderate Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
*If CHADS2 ¼ 1 and Age < 65 another option for initial treatment (especially if high-risk for ischemic events) is DAPT alone using ASA þ ticagrelor or prasugrel, similar to the recommendation for the CHADS2 ¼ 0 patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. In patients 65-74 years of age, the risk of stroke is approximately 2.1% per year and still higher beyond age 75 years, whereas the risk of coronary events is approximately 6%-10% per year after ACS (STEMI or non-STEMI), providing a rationale for the inclusion of OAC in the post-PCI antithrombotic regimen. Because the risk of bleeding is higher with triple therapy, a reduced intensity/dose of OAC is suggested when it is used in this context. The duration of triple therapy will vary depending on an individual patient ' s risk of ischemic (Table 1) vs bleeding events (Table 2). In patients with a low risk of thrombotic events and a high risk of bleeding, the duration of triple therapy can be short, with omission of ASAasearly as the day after PCI. In patients with a very high risk of thrombotic events and low bleeding risk, ASA could be continued longer, for up to 6 months of treatment. For patients at intermediate risk of ischemic and bleeding events the duration of aspirin will be somewhere in between (for example 1 month or 3 months).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. All patients should receive ASA 81 mg (or 160 mg if ASA-naive) on the day of the PCI procedure. Thereafter, ASA can be discontinued as early as the day after PCI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Factors associated with an increased risk of ischemic and bleeding events are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. When combining OAC with antiplatelet therapy, consider reducing the dose of OAC (or intensity of warfarin), with possible omission of ASA the day after PCI, because of the higher risk of bleeding in this context.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OAC regimens evaluated in the context of a triple therapy regimen include (Table 4):

<!-- PAGE=? -->
/C15 Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID with ASA and clopidogrel

<!-- PAGE=? -->
/C15 Warfarin (the recommended international normalized ratio target is 2.0-2.5)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The OAC regimens that have been evaluated in the context of a dual pathway regimen include (Table 4):

<!-- PAGE=? -->
/C15 Rivaroxaban 15 mg daily (10 mg in patients with renal dysfunction) and clopidogrel 75 mg daily

<!-- PAGE=? -->
/C15 Dabigatran 110 mg or 150 mg BID and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Note that in the RE-DUAL PCI trial, which evaluated dabigatran in patients with AF who underwent PCI, the dabigatran 110 mg BID was associated with a trend to a higher risk of death or thrombotic events (11% vs 8.5%; HR, 1.30, 95% CI, 0.98-1.73; P ¼ 0.07). This risk was not observed with the dabigatran 150 mg BID dose (7.9% vs 7.9%; HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.68-1.39; P ¼ 0.44). Therefore, in patients who are not at high risk of bleeding, the dabigatran 150 mg BID dose, when used in combination with clopidogrel 75 mg daily (ASA omitted), might be preferable

<!-- PAGE=? -->
/C15 Trials evaluating apixaban and edoxaban in patients with AF who undergo PCI are ongoing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Consider using a proton pump inhibitor for protection against gastrointestinal bleeding while patients are receiving a triple therapy regimen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. When a P2Y12 inhibitor is to be combined with OAC as part of a dual pathway or triple therapy regimen, then clopidogrel is suggested over ticagrelor or prasugrel because of its lower risk of bleeding complications and the lack of data on ticagrelor or prasugrel in combination with OAC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Several risk scores have been formulated to quantitate ischemic risk (Table 3). Although none of these scores have been validated in a population of patients with AF who undergo PCI, they might still be helpful to the clinician in estimating risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
After the initial period of antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF with high-risk features who undergo PCI for ACS or high-risk elective PCI the following recommendations are made (Fig. 4):

4. Other Reasons for Anticoagulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend that patients who have concomitant symptomatic CAD and another condition requiring OAC receive a regimen of antithrombotic therapy that is based on a balanced assessment of their risk of: (1) systemic embolism; (2) future coronary event(s); and (3) clinically signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding associated with the use of antithrombotic agents (Strong Recommendation; High-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4.1. Prosthetic heart valves

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and/or antiplatelet therapy is indicated to prevent thrombotic complications of a surgically implanted prosthetic heart valve (PHV). A careful assessment of the potential risks of valve thrombosis and systemic bleeding is required when considering a given antithrombotic regimen. As such the optimal combination of agents, duration of antithrombotic therapy, and optimal therapeutic international normalized ratio levels all differ for speci /uniFB01 c types of valves and are in /uniFB02 uenced by valvular as well as patient-level characteristics. 102,103 Studies of patients with mechanical 104,105 as well as bioprosthetic heart valves 106,107 haveshownanincreasedriskofvalvethrombosis early in the postoperative period, highlighting the importance of adequate antithrombotic regimens early after surgical valve replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Currently the combination of a VKA and low dose ASA (75-100 mg daily) is recommended for patients with a mechanical heart valve; a truncated dose of VKA followed by continuous use of low-dose ASA is recommended for patients with surgically implanted bioprosthetic valves, although it is reasonable to also consider use of antiplatelet therapy alone without OAC. 108 NOACs are contraindicated among patients with mechanical PHVs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 10% of patients in WOEST (49 of 563) and approximately 7% of patients in ISAR-TRIPLE (45 of 614) had a PHV as their indication for OAC 97,98 ; the subgroup of patients in WOEST with PHV appeared to derive a similar bene /uniFB01 t from double therapy as opposed to traditional triple therapy compared with the main WOEST population ( P for interaction ¼ 0.116). Retrospective cohort studies that compared traditional triple therapy to double that have included patients with PHV have not reported separate events among PHV patients because of small numbers (2%-11% of total cohort population). 109-116

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Randomized trials of TAVR compared with traditional surgical aortic valve replacement have used DAPT for at least 1 month postprocedure. 117-119 However, these regimens have not been on the basis of randomized data and as such the use

* In the RE-DUAL PCI trial, the 110 mg BID dabigatran dose was associated with a trend to a higher risk of death or thrombotic events (11% vs 8.5%; hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 0.98-1.73; P ¼ 0.07). This risk was not observed with the 150 mg BID dose (7.9% vs 7.9%; hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 0.68-1.39; P ¼ 0.44). Therefore, in patients who are not at high risk of bleeding, the dabigatran 150 mg BID dose, when used in combination with clopidogrel 75 mg daily (ASA omitted), might be preferable.

of DAPT after TAVR is given a relatively weak recommendation. 108

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with a previous valve replacement who undergo PCI for an ACS or non-ACS indication the following recommendations are made.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with a previous valve replacement who undergo PCI for an ACS or non-ACS indication :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with a mechanical valve replacement, we suggest an initial regimen of ASA 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus a VKA (triple therapy). ASA may be discontinued as early as the day after PCI or it can be continued up to 6 months of treatment, depending on the risk of recurrent thrombotic events vs major bleeding (Weak Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with a mechanical valve replacement, we recommend against the use of a NOAC regardless of whether it is in combination with antiplatelet therapy or used alone (Strong Recommendation; ModerateQuality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. After PCI, the uninterrupted use of a VKA (warfarin) is critical to minimize the risk of valve thrombosis in patients with a mechanical valve. A NOAC should not be used in this setting. The duration of triple therapy will vary depending on an individual patient ' s risk of thrombotic vs bleeding events. In patients with low risk of thrombotic events and high risk of bleeding, the duration of triple therapy can be short, with omission of ASA as early as the day after PCI. In patients with high risk of thrombotic events and low bleeding risk, the duration of triple therapy can be longer, for up to 6 months of treatment. Patients at intermediate risk of thrombotic and bleeding events the duration of triple therapy will be somewhere in between.

Practical tip. In patients with a mechanical heart valve, warfarin is speci /uniFB01 cally indicated. Other OACs are not recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with a previous valve replacement who undergo PCI for an ACS or non-ACS indication, note the following recommendations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with a surgical bioprosthetic valve replacement , (implanted < 6 months), we suggest DAPT with ASA 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for at least 6 months (and up to 12 months) (Weak Recommendation; Very LowQuality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with a TAVR (implanted < 6 months), we suggest DAPT with ASA 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 3-6 months (Weak Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4.2. Venous thromboembolic disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous thromboembolic disease (VTE), comprising deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, carries a signi /uniFB01 cant risk of shortand long-term mortality if left untreated. 120 In addition, up to 50% of untreated patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) will have recurrent thrombosis within 3 months of the index event. 121,122 Therefore, oral and parenteral anticoagulants are necessary to prevent as well as treat VTE. 123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although antiplatelet therapy is not indicated for the initial treatment of VTE, the extended use of ASA is given a weak recommendation for the prevention of recurrent VTE after the initial period of anticoagulant therapy. 123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 7.5% of patients in the ISAR TRIPLE trial had VTE as their indication for OAC; no separate outcomes were reported for this subgroup of patients 98 ; the WOEST trial did not report the numbers of enrolled patients who had VTE. Relatively few patients with VTE are described among retrospective cohort studies that compared traditional triple therapy with double therapy among patients who require OAC as well as DAPT. 109-116

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The following recommendations are made for patients with venous thromboembolism who undergo PCI for an ACS or non-ACS indication (in selected patients who require extended VTE prophylaxis (ie, orthopaedic surgery or surgical oncology), the same recommendations can be followed as for VTE therapy. When VTE prophylaxis is discontinued, DAPT can be resumed if minimum duration has not been completed as per other clinical risk pro /uniFB01 le).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with venous thromboembolism undergoing PCI for an ACS or non-ACS indication :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We suggest an initial regimen of ASA 81 mg daily plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily with either parenteral or

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OAC (in accordance with DVT/PE recommendations). ASA may be discontinued as early as the day after PCI or it can be continued up to 6 months of treatment, depending on the risk of recurrent ischemic events vs major bleeding. After ASA discontinuation, we suggest that OAC plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily be continued for up to 12 months after the initial PCI (Weak Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients requiring an elective PCI, we recommend delaying PCI if appropriate until the completion of parenteral or OAC for VTE (Strong Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. This recommendation places emphasis on optimizing the prevention and treatment of DVT and PE with either a parenteral or oral anticoagulant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
4.3. LVT formation after MI

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LVT formation is a feared complication after acute STEMI, with the risk being highest in the /uniFB01 rst 3 months after an index event. 124 The risk of LVT formation has remained signi /uniFB01 cant even in the era of primary PCI and DAPT, 125 leading to a class IIa recommendation for anticoagulant therapy for STEMI patients with asymptomatic LVT and a class IIb recommendation for those with anterior/apical akinesis or dyskinesis. 126

<!-- PAGE=? -->
However, several studies have failed to show a clear bene /uniFB01 t of routine anticoagulation in addition to DAPT after anterior STEMI. A substudy of the H armonizing O utcomes With R evascular iz ati on and S tents in A cute M yocardial I nfarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial showed no bene /uniFB01 t of triple therapy among STEMI patients treated with primary PCI for the reduction shortor long-term ischemic outcomes but did show signi /uniFB01 cant increases in major bleeding. 127 Udell et al. showed no bene /uniFB01 t of warfarin use for up to 3 months among a cohort of elderly patients after acute MI, and furthermore showed no difference in the risk of stroke between patients who presented with an anterior MI compared with those with a nonanterior MI. 128

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le May et al. identi /uniFB01 ed 460 patients with anterior STEMI who had undergone primary PCI and received DAPT with (n ¼ 131) and without (n ¼ 329) warfarin. 129 Patients in the warfarin group had a higher rate of net adverse clinical events (all-cause mortality, stroke, reinfarction, and major bleeding) at 180 days compared with those in the no-warfarin group (14.7% vs 4.6%; P ¼ 0.001). Use of warfarin therapy was an independent predictor of net adverse clinical events after propensity scoring analysis (odds ratio, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.157.5). Shavadia et al. recently reported similar results with no bene /uniFB01 t for triple therapy in a series of consecutive STEMI patients with anterior LV dysfunction. 130

In patients with established LVT who undergo PCI for an ACS or non-ACS indication we make the following recommendation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with established left ventricular thrombus who undergo PCI for an ACS or non-ACS indication:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We suggest an initial regimen of triple therapy with ASA 81 mg daily with clopidogrel 75 mg daily plus OAC. ASA may be discontinued as early as the day after PCI or it can be continued up to 6 months of treatment, depending on the risk of recurrent coronary ischemic events vs major bleeding. After ASA discontinuation, we suggest treatment with OAC plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily for up to 1 year. If there is evidence of LV thrombus resolution /C21 3 months after PCI, we suggest discontinuation of OAC and treatment with ASA 81 mg daily plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for up to 1 year after PCI (Weak Recommendation; Very Low-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Warfarin is the only anticoagulant evaluated for the treatment of established LVT. Although NOACS are generally safer than warfarin, they have not been evaluated speci /uniFB01 cally in this context.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We make the following recommendations for patients who undergo PCI for an ACS indication who are at high risk of developing LV thrombus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who undergo PCI for an ACS indication who are at high risk of developing LV thrombus :

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend DAPT with ASA 81 mg daily plus either ticagrelor 90 mg BID or prasugrel 10 mg once daily for up to 1 year (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We suggest routine use of triple therapy should be avoided because of the weak evidence for prevention of LV thrombus and higher risk of bleeding events (Weak Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).
