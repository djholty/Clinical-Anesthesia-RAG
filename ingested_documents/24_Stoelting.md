Th e human immune system is traditionally viewed as consisting  of  two  pathways: innate  immunity and adaptive  immunity (also  known  as acquired  immunity ).  Each  is  comprised of  a  series  of  unique  components,  all  of  which  function  to

protect the host against invading microorganisms. Th e innate immune response is rapid and nonspeci fi c,  that  is,  it  recognizes targets that are common to many pathogens and requires no prior exposure to a target antigen. Its noncellular elements include  physical  barriers  (epithelial  and  mucous  membrane surfaces),  complement  factors,  acute  phase  proteins,  and proteins of the contact activation pathway. Cellular elements include neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and a subset of lymphocytes called natural killer (NK) cells (Figure 24-1). Th e adaptive immune response is an evolutionarily more mature system present only in vertebrates. Adaptive immunity has a more delayed onset of activation, but is capable of developing memory and more speci fi c antigenic responses. It consists of a humoral component mediated by B lymphocytes that produce antibodies and a cellular component composed of T lymphocytes. T cells are divided into two main subsets-cytotoxic (TC) cells and helper-modulatory (T H) cells-and are distinguished by their di ff erent combinations of surface antigens. T C cells express a predominance of CD8 antigen, whereas T H cells express a predominance of CD4 antigen. Precursor helper T lymphocytes  di ff erentiate  into  four  distinct  cell  lines:  T H1, TH2,  T H17,  and  regulatory  T  (T reg )  cells.  T H1  cells  produce interferon  and  promote  cell-mediated  immune  responses. TH2 cells  produce  speci fi c  interleukins  (ILs),  including  IL-4 and IL-10, which favor a humoral immune response and suppress cell-mediated immunity. T H17 cells are proin fl ammatory and appear to play a role in chronic in fl ammatory conditions, including some cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. In contrast, T reg cells promote tolerance and minimize autoimmune and  allergic  or  in fl ammatory  responses.  As  a  general  rule, cytotoxic  and  helper  T-cell  responses  are  most  important in  mounting an e ff ective  response to trauma, infection, and tumorigenesis. IL-4, IL-10, and T H2 cells tend to promote the humoral immune system and help to protect against immunemediated tissue injury; however, they may also activate immunoglobulin E (IgE) and contribute to hypersensitivity reactions (Table 24-1).

A common myeloid progenitor differentiates into the granule-containing cells of the immune system (monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils), as well as megakaryocytes and erythrocytes. A common lymphoid progenitor differentiates into the non-granule-containing cells of the immune system (T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells).

Neutropenia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neutropenia is de fi ned as a neutrophil granulocyte count of less  than  1500/mm 3 .  Normal  neutrophil  counts  vary  somewhat  by  age  and  ethnicity.  For  example,  newborns  tend  to have  higher  granulocyte  counts  in  the fi rst  few  days  of  life, and African Americans tend to have lower average granulocyte  counts  in  general  compared with whites. It is not until the granulocyte count decreases to less than 500/mm 3  that a patient is at signi fi cantly increased risk of pyogenic infections. Common infecting organisms include Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella species, which frequently produce infections of the skin, mouth, pharynx, and lung. Broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics are indicated in the management of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEUTROPENIA IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  neutropenic  syndromes  can  be  observed  in  newborns and children. Neonatal sepsis is the most common cause of severe neutropenia within the fi rst few days of life. A transient neutropenia may be seen in children born to mothers with autoimmune diseases and may also occur as a result of maternal hypertension or drug ingestion. Persistent neutropenia can occur as a result of defects in neutrophil production, maturation, or survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  autosomal  dominant  disorder cyclic  neutropenia is  a particularly  well-studied  cause  of  childhood  neutropenia.  It is characterized by recurrent episodes of neutropenia that are

not always associated with infection but that occur in regular cycles every 3 to 4 weeks. Each episode is characterized by 1 week of reduced granulocyte production, followed by a period of  reactive  mastocytosis  and  then  spontaneous  recovery  of normal granulocyte production. Th e granulocytopenia can be severe enough to result in recurrent, severe bacterial infection that requires antibiotic therapy. As the child grows up, chronic, persistent granulocytopenia may result. Th e postulated mechanism of this disorder is a defect in a feedback mechanism that normally stimulates precursor cells to respond to growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kostmann's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of neutrophil  maturation.  Patients  with  Kostmann's  syndrome appear to have a normal population of early progenitor cells that  somehow  become  suppressed,  which  inhibits  normal maturation. If the disorder is le ft untreated, mortality in the fi rst  year  of  life  approaches  70%.  Treatment  with  G-CSF  is e ff ective in 90% of patients; in patients who show no response to G-CSF, bone marrow transplantation may be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEUTROPENIA IN ADULTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acquired defects in the production of neutrophils in adults are very  common.  Typical  causes  include  cancer  chemotherapy and treatment of human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV) infection with zidovudine. Neutropenia usually re fl ects the impact of a drug on proliferation of stem cells and early myelocytic progenitors. In most cases, the marrow recovers once the drug is withdrawn. Many drugs have been associated with neutropenia. Among the most prominent of these are injectable gold salts, chloramphenicol, antithyroid medications (carbimazole and propylthiouracil), analgesics (indomethacin, acetaminophen,  and  phenacetin),  tricyclic  antidepressants,  and  phenothiazines.  However,  virtually  any  drug  can,  on  occasion, produce severe life-threatening neutropenia. Th erefore, when neutropenia  occurs  in  the  course  of  medical  treatment,  the possibility that it is drug induced must be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoimmune-related neutropenia can be observed as an isolated disorder or in the context of another known autoimmune condition.  Antineutrophil  antibodies  are  sometimes  present. Th e  two  most  common associations are with systemic lupus erythematosus (in which the neutropenia can occur alone or be accompanied by thrombocytopenia) and rheumatoid arthritis. Conditions associated with splenomegaly o ft en lead to granulocytopenia resulting from white cell sequestration. Felty's syndrome is  the triad of rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia.  Other  causes  of  splenomegaly  and  neutropenia include lymphoma, myeloproliferative disease, and severe liver disease with portal hypertension. In these latter situations, it is  o ft en  di ffi cult  to  decide  whether  the  granulocytopenia  is caused simply by splenic sequestration or whether it also has an autoimmune component. In some patients, splenectomy has been reported to signi fi cantly improve neutrophil production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute,  life-threatening  granulocytopenia  can  occur  as  a result of certain infections. A decreasing white cell count in a patient with sepsis is a bad prognostic sign. It re fl ects a rate of granulocyte use that exceeds the marrow's ability to produce new  cells.  Alcoholic  patients  are  especially  susceptible  to infection-induced  granulocytopenia.  Both  folic  acid  de fi -ciency and direct toxic e ff ects of ethanol on marrow precursor cells compromise the host's ability to produce new neutrophils in response to infection. HIV infection is a common cause of T-cell dysfunction. In these patients, loss of the T H subset and overexpression of the T reg subset is associated with abnormalities of neutrophil production and function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  benign  neutropenia is  a  condition  characterized by markedly reduced neutrophil counts, o ft en as low as 200 to  500/mm 3 .  Although  the  clinical  course  is  variable,  most patients have a benign course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormalities of Phagocytosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic granulomatous disease is a genetic disorder in which granulocytes lack the ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Th e granulocytes can migrate to a site of infection and ingest organisms but are unable to kill them. S. aureus and certain  gram-negative bacteria such as Serratia  marcescens and Burkholderia cepacia that are normally killed by phagocytosis and lysosomal digestion are responsible for most infections in patients with this disorder. Th e condition is usually diagnosed during childhood or early adult life when patients have recurrent  microabscesses  and  chronic  granulomatous  in fl ammation.  Persistent  in fl ammation and granuloma formation can lead to multiorgan dysfunction, including intestinal obstruction, glomerulonephritis, and chorioretinitis. Aggressive treatment of infectious complications, prophylaxis with antibiotics and antifungal agents, and use of recombinant interferonγ has signi fi cantly improved survival in patients with this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  primary  substrate  for  the  enzymatic  generation  of reactive oxygen species is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Patients with neutrophil  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (G6PD)  de fi ciency are unable to generate large amounts of NADPH, which limits their ability to produce the oxidase needed to kill ingested microorganisms.  Like  patients  with  chronic  granulomatous disease, neutrophil G6PD-de fi cient patients are at lifelong risk of infection with catalase-positive microorganisms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chédiak-Higashi  syndrome is  a  rare  multisystem  disease characterized  by  partial  oculocutaneous  albinism,  frequent bacterial infections, a mild bleeding diathesis, progressive neuropathy,  and  cranial  nerve  defects. Th e  neutrophils  of  these patients  contain  characteristic  giant  granules.  Patients  exhibit multiple  defects  of  immune  function,  including  impairment in  neutrophil  chemotaxis,  phagocytosis,  NK  cell  activity,  and T-cell cytotoxicity. Many white blood cells are destroyed before leaving  the  bone  marrow.  In  most  patients,  an  accelerated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leukocyte adhesion de fi ciency is a relatively rare de fi ciency of a subunit of the integrin family of leukocyte adhesion molecules. Th is  subunit  is  critical  for  cellular  adhesion  and  chemotaxis. Although clinical severity varies, patients with leukocyte adhesion  de fi ciency  experience  a  higher  risk  of  recurrent  bacterial infections. Persistent granulocytosis is o ft en present; however, the absence of pus is the most characteristic feature of this disease.

lymphoproliferative  syndrome  leads  to  death.  However,  bone marrow transplantation can reverse immunologic dysfunction in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Speci fi c granule de fi ciency syndrome is another rare congenital disorder characterized by neutrophils that exhibit impaired chemotaxis  and  bactericidal  activity.  Patients  are  prone  to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections with abscess formation. Skin and pulmonary infections appear to predominate, and most of these respond well to aggressive antibiotic therapy. A ff ected patients frequently survive into their adult years.

Management of Patients with Neutropenia or Abnormalities of Phagocytosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with neutropenia or a qualitative disorder of granulocyte function o ft en bene fi t signi fi cantly from treatment with G-CSF. Recombinant G-CSF therapy reduces the duration of absolute neutropenia  in  patients  receiving  ablative  chemotherapy  and autologous  bone  marrow  transplantation.  It  also  shortens  the length of antibiotic therapy and reduces the risk of life-threatening bacteremia and fungal infections. G-CSF therapy has been approved  for  the  reversal  of  the  neutropenia  associated  with HIV infection and the prevention of worsening neutropenia in patients receiving HIV therapy. Neutropenic patients undergoing elective surgery may bene fi t from a course of G-CSF preoperatively to reduce the risk of perioperative infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deficiencies in Components of the Complement System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complement refers to a family of serum proteins that are critical to the host response to infection. Complement activation may  occur  by  pathogen-dependent  (classical  or  lectin)  or pathogen-independent  (alternative)  pathways  (Figure  24-2). Complement  proteins  assist  in  clearing  microorganisms  by coating infectious agents with proteins that facilitate phagocytosis.  Complement  proteins  also  promote  the  in fl ammatory  response.  Certain  complement  components  are  unique to  a  particular  pathway,  but  all  pathways  lead  to  the  formation of C3 and the membrane-attack complex. De fi ciencies in virtually all of the soluble complement components have been described. Defects in early components of the classical pathway of complement activation (C1q, C1r, C2, and C4) predispose to autoimmune in fl ammatory disorders resembling systemic lupus  erythematosus.  De fi ciencies  in  the  common  pathway component C3 are usually fatal in utero. De fi ciencies in the terminal complement components C5 through C8 are associated with recurrent infection and rheumatic diseases. Patients with  de fi ciencies  in  C9  and  components  of  the  alternative pathway (factor D and properdin) are predisposed to neisserial infection. Factor H de fi ciency is associated with familial relapsing hemolytic uremic syndrome. Th e liver is the primary organ  of  complement  protein  synthesis. Th erefore,  patients with advanced liver disease are o ft en at increased risk of infection, especially pneumonia and sepsis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,  S.  aureus, and E.  coli. Prompt  recognition  and treatment  of  infection  and  careful  maintenance  of  routine immunizations are the hallmarks of treating these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tight regulation of complement activation prevents misdirected activation of the in fl ammatory and immune response. Th e main inhibitor compound is C1 esterase inhibitor. De fi -ciency  of  C1  esterase  inhibitor  is  responsible  for  hereditary angioedema,  an  autosomal  dominant  condition  marked  by episodes  of  subcutaneous  and  submucosal  edema  caused primarily  by  excessive  concentrations  of  bradykinin,  which increases vascular permeability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyposplenism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Splenectomy  is  the  most  common  cause  of  splenic  dysfunction, although various clinical conditions may lead to impaired splenic functioning. Perhaps the most common of these is sickle cell anemia, which causes autoinfarction of the spleen as a result of vasoocclusive disease. S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial sepsis in postsplenectomy patients.  Splenic  dysfunction  also  increases  the  risk of infection with Neisseria meningitidis, E. coli, Haemophilus  in fl uenzae, and  malaria. As recommended for patients with complement de fi ciencies, management of hyposplenic patients relies heavily on prevention, mainly through immunization against S. pneumoniae, H. in fl uenzae type b, and N. meningitidis in particular. Penicillin prophylaxis was once  widely  recommended  a ft er  splenectomy  in  children younger  than  age  5.  However,  this  practice  is  falling  out of  favor  because  of  concern  over  the  spread  of  penicillinresistant  species  and  the  e ff ectiveness of immunization in most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EXCESSIVE INNATE IMMUNITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neutrophilia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e earliest response to an infection is the migration of granulocytes  out  of  the  circulation  and  into  the  site  of  bacterial invasion. Th e  rapidity  and  magnitude  of  the  increase  in  the number of circulating granulocytes in response to infection is remarkable. Within hours of the onset of a severe infection, the granulocyte count increases twofold to fourfold. Th is increase represents a change in the marginated and circulating pools of granulocytes as well as the delivery of new granulocytes from the bone marrow. Neutrophilia is de fi ned as an absolute neutrophil count higher than 7000/mm 3 . Major causes of neutrophilia are listed in Table 24-2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  increase  in  the  granulocyte  count  does  not  produce speci fi c symptoms or signs unless the count exceeds 100,000/ mm 3 .  Such  marked  leukocytosis  can  produce  leukostasis resulting  in  infarction  of  the  spleen  and  a  reduction  in  the oxygen-di ff using capacity of the lungs. Granulocytes can also accumulate in the skin to produce nontender, purplish nodules called chloromas. Unlike immature blasts, mature granulocytes do not invade brain tissue, so neurologic complications do not result from reactive granulocytosis.

FIGURE 24-2 Activation of the complement cascade. Complement activation can occur via classical and lectin pathways or by alternative pathways. In the classical pathway, binding of an antigen-antibody complex to C1q is the triggering event. In the lectin pathway, mannose residues on bacteria bind to mannose binding lectin (MBL), setting off complement activation. The alternative pathway can be activated by microbes or tumor cells. All pathways lead to the formation of C3, which is important in immune complex modification, opsonization, and lymphocyte activation. The terminal common pathway that flows from all three activation pathways leads to production of the membrane-attack complex C5b-9, which lyses cells. C1inh , C1 inhibitor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.

Th e clinical features associated with moderate granulocytosis vary depending on the primary disease underlying the condition.  Deep-seated  infections  and  peritonitis  are  associated with  granulocyte  counts  of  10,000  to  30,000/mm 3 or  more. Reactive  monocytosis  is  seen  in  patients  with  tuberculosis, subacute  bacterial  endocarditis,  or  severe  granulocytopenia. Parasitic infestations are typically associated with an elevated eosinophil count, whereas basophilia is seen in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. As a general rule, sustained granulocyte counts of 50,000/mm 3  or higher indicate a noninfectious, malignant disease process such as a myeloproliferative disorder. Th e appearance of very immature myelocytic cells in the circulation and accompanying changes in other cell lines (increased or decreased platelets or red blood cells) are also signs of hematologic malignancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Granulocytosis is an expected side e ff ect of glucocorticoid therapy,  because  glucocorticoids  interfere  with  the  egress  of granulocytes from the circulation into tissues. Patients receiving prednisone 60 to 100 mg/day o ft en have white blood cell counts of 15,000 to 20,000/mm 3 . Other causes of granulocytosis include physiologic stress, exposure to certain drugs, and cigarette smoking.

Monocytosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monocytosis occurs in conjunction with in fl ammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,  and  sarcoidosis  and  in  the  context  of  certain  infections, including tuberculosis, syphilis, and subacute bacterial endocarditis. Monocytosis can also be seen in patients with primary neutropenic disorders or hematologic malignancies. Although monocytes are important components of the immune system, the association between the circulating monocyte count and the  propensity  for  infection  is  not  as  clear  as  in  the  case  of neutrophils.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma is characterized by an exaggerated bronchoconstrictor response to certain stimuli (see Chapter 9). Triggers for bronchospasm unrelated to the immune system produce intrinsic asthma. Placement of an endotracheal tube may trigger this type  of  asthma;  other  common  triggers  are  cold,  exercise, stress, and inhaled irritants. Mediators of intrinsic asthma are components of the innate immune system. By contrast, triggers that activate the immune system and release IgE produce extrinsic asthma and are part of adaptive immunity. Inhaled allergens such as pollen and pet dander are common causes of extrinsic asthma. Symptoms of extrinsic or allergic asthma are highly variable and can include cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Treatment consists of administration of β -agonists, anticholinergics, corticosteroids, and leukotriene inhibitors.

MISDIRECTED INNATE IMMUNITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angioedema

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angioedema may be hereditary or acquired and is characterized by episodic subcutaneous and submucosal edema formation, o ft en involving the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal tract.  Two  types  of  angioedema  can  be  distinguished.  One is  caused by release of mast cell mediators and is associated with  urticaria,  bronchospasm, fl ushing,  and  even  hypotension. Th e  other  results  from  bradykinin  release  and  does not  cause  allergic  symptoms. Th e  most  common  hereditary form  of  angioedema  results  from  an  autosomal  dominant de fi ciency  or  dysfunction  of C1  esterase  inhibitor. Th is  serine protease inhibitor (serpin) regulates complement, contact activation, and fi brinolytic pathways. Th e absence of C1 esterase inhibitor also leads to release of vasoactive mediators that increase vascular permeability and produce edema via bradykinin. Patients de fi cient in this regulatory enzyme experience repeated bouts of facial and/or laryngeal edema lasting 24 to 72 hours. Th ese episodes usually begin in the second decade of life and may be triggered by menses, trauma, infection, stress, or  estrogen-containing  oral  contraceptives.  Dental  surgery can be an important trigger of laryngeal attacks. Abdominal attacks usually present with excruciating pain, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C1 esterase inhibitor de fi ciency can be acquired by patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Th ese patients have antibodies to C1 inhibitor, and this gives rise to a syndrome that closely mimics hereditary angioedema. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure can also precipitate angioedema in about  0.5%  of  patients. Th is  drug-induced  angioedema  is thought  to  result  from  increased  availability  of  bradykinin made  possible  by  the  ACE  inhibitor-mediated  blockade  of bradykinin  catabolism.  Interestingly,  angioedema  provoked by ACE inhibitors may develop unexpectedly a ft er prolonged drug use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Androgens such as danazol and stanozolol have been the mainstay of prophylactic therapy, both long term and preoperatively, in patients with angioedema. Anti fi brinolytic therapy (e.g., ε -aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid, or aprotinin) has also been used. Anabolic steroids (androgens) are believed to increase  hepatic  synthesis  of  C1  esterase  inhibitor,  whereas anti fi brinolytics  are  thought  to  act  by  inhibiting  plasmin activation. Th e  preferred  treatment  for  an  acute  episode  of angioedema is C1 inhibitor concentrate (25 units/kg) or fresh frozen plasma (2 to 4 units) to replace the de fi cient enzyme. It is important to note that androgens, catecholamines, antihistamines, and anti fi brinolytics are not useful in the treatment of acute episodes of angioedema. Should upper airway obstruction  develop  during  acute  attacks,  tracheal  intubation  until the edema subsides may be lifesaving. When laryngoscopy is undertaken, it is important to have personnel and equipment available  to  perform  tracheostomy  if  needed,  but  tracheostomy itself may be extremely di ffi cult or impossible in the face of massive airway edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients experiencing recurrent angioedema, whether hereditary  or  acquired,  require  prophylaxis  before  a  stimulating procedure  such  as  dental  surgery  or  any  surgery  requiring endotracheal  intubation.  It  is  prudent  to  ensure  the  ready

Defects of Antibody Production

<!-- PAGE=? -->
X-linked  agammaglobulinemia is  an  inherited  defect  in  the maturation of B cells. Mature B cells are missing or reduced in the circulation and lymphoid tissues have no plasma cells; therefore, functional antibody is not produced. A ff ected boys have  recurrent  pyogenic  infections  during  the  latter  half  of their fi rst year of life as maternal antibodies wane. Treatment with  intravenous  immunoglobulin  every  3  to  4  months  to maintain plasma IgG levels near 500 mg/dL allows the majority of these children to survive into adulthood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is due to proliferation of a malignant plasma cell clone that secretes IgM, which results in marked increases in plasma viscosity. Th e bone marrow is in fi ltrated with malignant lymphocytes, as are the liver, spleen, and lungs. Anemia and an increased incidence of spontaneous hemorrhage are common fi ndings in these patients. In contrast to multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia rarely involves the skeletal system. As a result, renal dysfunction resulting from hypercalcemia is uncommon. Treatment consists of plasmapheresis to remove the abnormal proteins and reduce plasma viscosity. Chemotherapy may be instituted to decrease proliferation of the cells responsible for the production of abnormal immunoglobulins.

Selective  IgA  de fi ciency occurs  in  1  in  every  600  to  800 adults. In this condition, plasma IgA concentrations are less than 5 mg/dL, but the concentrations of other immunoglobulins  are  normal.  Recurrent  sinus  and  pulmonary  infections are common, although many patients remain asymptomatic. About 40% of a ff ected patients produce IgA antibodies. Th is subset of patients may experience life-threatening anaphylaxis when transfused with blood products containing IgA. Th erefore, these patients should receive blood or blood components obtained from IgA-de fi cient donors.

Cold  autoimmune  diseases are  characterized  by  the  presence  of  abnormal  circulating  proteins  (usually  IgM  or  IgA antibodies) that agglutinate in response to a decrease in body temperature. Th ese  disorders  include cryoglobulinemia and cold  hemagglutinin  disease. Hyperviscosity  of  the  plasma  is prominent,  and  microvascular  thrombosis  may  cause  acute end-organ  damage  during  a  period  of  hypothermia.  Symptoms  normally  do  not  occur  until  body  temperature  falls below  33° C.  Management  of  anesthesia  in  these  patients includes strict maintenance of normothermia. Patients scheduled  for  surgery  requiring  cardiopulmonary  bypass  present signi fi cant  challenges.  Use  of  systemic  hypothermia  may  be contraindicated,  and  cold  cardioplegia  solutions  may  precipitate intracoronary hemagglutination with consequent thrombosis, ischemia, or infarction. Alternatives to cold cardioplegia  include fi brillatory  arrest  for  brief  time  periods. Plasmapheresis may also be helpful in reducing plasma concentrations of these immunoglobulins.

Amyloidosis encompasses  several  disorders  characterized by the accumulation of insoluble fi brillar proteins (amyloid) in various tissues, including the heart, vascular smooth muscle, kidneys, adrenal glands, gastrointestinal tract, peripheral nerves, and skin. Primary amyloidosis is a plasma cell disorder marked by the accumulation of immunoglobulin light chains. Secondary amyloidosis is observed in association with several other  conditions,  including  multiple  myeloma,  rheumatoid arthritis, and a prolonged antigenic challenge, such as may be produced by chronic infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia  is  a  classic  feature  of  patients  with  amyloidosis,  occurring  in  about  20%  of  patients. Th e  enlarged, sti ff tongue  may  impair  swallowing  and  speaking.  Involvement  of  the  salivary  glands  and  adjacent  tissue  may  cause upper airway obstruction that mimics angioedema. Cardiac involvement is fairly common and may cause intraventricular conduction delays, including heart block. Sudden death is not uncommon.  Cardiac  dysfunction  classically  involves  rightsided  heart  failure,  with  relative  sparing  of  le ft -sided  heart function until late in the disease. Accumulation of amyloid in the kidneys may produce nephrotic syndrome. Deposition in joint spaces may lead to limited range of motion as well as peripheral nerve entrapments such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Amyloidosis of the gastrointestinal tract may lead to malabsorption, ileus, and impaired gastric emptying. Hepatomegaly is common, although hepatic dysfunction is rare. Th e  diagnosis  is  based  on  clinical  suspicion  con fi rmed  by tissue  biopsy. Th e  frequent presence of amyloid deposits in the rectum makes rectal biopsy a common initial diagnostic procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  amyloidosis  is  generally  directed  toward symptomatic  improvement  rather  than  cure.  Airway  management  may  be  challenging  due  to  an  enlarged  tongue. Perioperative management of these patients requires careful preoperative  evaluation  for  signs  of  end-organ  dysfunction such  as  renal  insu ffi ciency  and  heart  failure  or  conduction defects. Gastric motility drugs may be useful in some patients. Of note, amyloid deposits have the potential to trap factor X or evoke fi brinolysis, which predisposes these patients to hemorrhagic complications.

DiGeorge syndrome (thymic hypoplasia) is the result of a gene deletion. Features include absent or diminished thymus development,  hypoplasia  of  the  thyroid  and  parathyroid  glands, cardiac malformations, and facial dysmorphisms. Th e degree of immunocompromise correlates with the amount of thymic tissue  present.  Complete  absence  of  the  thymus  produces  a severe  combined  immunode fi ciency  syndrome-like  phenotype, and bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections can all be problems. Complete DiGeorge syndrome is treated by thymus

Combined Immune System Defects

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Severe combined immunode fi ciency syndromes are caused by a number of genetic mutations that a ff ect T, B, or NK cell functions. Th e most common form of severe combined immunodefi ciency syndrome is the X-linked form, which has a prevalence of  approximately  1  in  50,000  live  births  and  accounts  for approximately  half  of  severe  combined  immunode fi ciency syndrome cases in the United States. Th e disease is caused by a mutation in a gene that encodes for a protein subunit shared by several of the interleukin receptors. Absence of these receptors  results  in  defective  interleukin  signaling,  which  in  turn blocks normal di ff erentiation of NK, B, and T cells. Th e only treatment that substantially prolongs life expectancy is bone marrow or stem cell transplantation from an HLA-compatible donor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ataxia-telangiectasia is  a  syndrome  consisting  of  cerebellar  ataxia,  oculocutaneous  telangiectasias,  chronic  sinopulmonary disease, and immunode fi ciency. Th e genetic basis of this disorder is a gene mutation in the surveillance system that monitors  DNA  for  double-strand  breaks.  In  this  syndrome, DNA damage that occurs during cell division is missed, and defective  cells  are  released  into  the  circulation.  One  consequence of this defect is the production of dysfunctional lymphocytes. Th ese patients also have a signi fi cant predisposition to  malignancy,  especially  leukemia  and  lymphoma.  Patients with  ataxia-telangiectasia  are  so  susceptible  to  radiationinduced injury that bone marrow transplantation is not possible. Supportive therapy includes intravenous administration of immunoglobulin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenosine deaminase de fi ciency is  another  form of severe combined immunode fi ciency syndrome, accounting for approximately 15% of cases. Th e adenosine deaminase enzyme is most abundant in lymphocytes, and de fi ciency allows toxic levels of purine intermediates to accumulate, which leads to T-cell  death. Th ere  is  profound  lymphopenia  together  with skeletal abnormalities of the ribs and hips. Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation or enzyme replacement with bovine adenosine deaminase enzyme is of bene fi t  in  increasing  life expectancy.

Allergic Reactions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immune-mediated allergic reactions are classi fi ed according to their mechanism. Type I allergic reactions are IgE mediated and involve mast cells and basophils. Th e majority of cases of anaphylaxis are IgE-mediated events. Type II reactions mediate cytotoxicity via IgG, IgM, and complement. Type II reactions usually manifest as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia, since these are the cell types that are most o ft en a ff ected.  Clinical  presentation  and  severity  vary  widely,  and presentation may be delayed for several days. Type III reactions produce tissue damage via immune complex formation and  deposition,  and  o ft en  lead  to  glomerulonephritis,  urticaria, vasculitis, and arthralgias. Type IV reactions are marked by T lymphocyte-mediated delayed hypersensitivity. Cutaneous symptoms are the most common physical manifestation of drug allergy. Clinical severity ranges from simple contact dermatitis to Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, two types of severe exfoliative dermatitis that can be life threatening. Drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), also called drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), is another severe form of type IV delayed drug hypersensitivity marked by eosinophilia, rash, fever, and multiple organ system failure. Patients with certain viral infections  such  as  Epstein-Barr  virus  or  cytomegalovirus  infection experience an increased incidence of some type IV drug reactions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Not all drug allergies are mediated by the immune system. Nonimmune anaphylaxis (formerly called anaphylactoid reactions) occurs when mediator is released from mast cells and basophils as a result of direct interaction with the o ff ending drug rather than immune system activation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaphylaxis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaphylaxis  is  a  life-threatening  condition  marked  by  cardiovascular  collapse,  interstitial  edema,  and  bronchospasm. Anaphylaxis may occur by immune-mediated or  nonimmune-mediated  mechanisms. Th e  most  common  type  of immune-mediated  anaphylaxis  results  when  previous  exposure to antigens in drugs or foods evokes production of antigen-speci fi c IgE antibodies. Subsequent exposure to the same or  a  chemically  similar  antigen  results  in  antigen-antibody interactions that initiate marked degranulation of mast cells and basophils. Approximately 60% of anaphylactic reactions are mediated by IgE antibodies. Less commonly, IgG or IgM antibody reactions are to blame. Non-immune-mediated anaphylaxis  results  from  direct  release  of  histamine  and  other mediators  from  mast  cells  and  basophils.  Initial  manifestations of anaphylaxis usually occur within 5 to 10 minutes of exposure  to  the  antigen.  Vasoactive  mediators  released  by degranulation of mast cells and basophils are responsible for the  clinical  indicators  of  anaphylaxis  (Table  24-3).  Urticaria and pruritus are common. Primary vascular collapse occurs in approximately 25% of cases of fatal anaphylaxis. Laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, and arterial hypoxemia may accompany  anaphylaxis.  Extravasation  of  up  to  50%  of  the  intravascular fl uid volume into the extracellular space re fl ects the extent  of  microvascular  permeability  that  can  accompany anaphylaxis. Indeed, hypovolemia is a likely cause of hypotension in these patients, although leukotriene-mediated negative inotropism may also be a factor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e estimated incidence of all immune- and non-immunemediated episodes of anaphylaxis during anesthesia is between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 20,000 anesthetic cases. Th e wide variability re fl ects  the  di ffi culty  in  determining  the  denominator  (total

number of anesthetic cases) as well as inconsistencies in event reporting. Estimated mortality from perioperative anaphylaxis ranges  from  3%  to  6%.  Risk  factors  include  asthma,  longer duration of anesthesia, female sex (especially for neuromuscular blocking drugs and hypnotic induction drugs), multiple past surgeries or procedures (especially for incidents involving latex and ethylene dioxide), and the presence of other allergic conditions or systemic mastocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis  of  anaphylaxis  can  be  suggested  by  the  o ft en dramatic nature of the clinical manifestations in close temporal  relationship  to  exposure  to  a  particular  antigen.  Cardiovascular, respiratory, and cutaneous manifestations are most common.  Typical  signs  include  tachycardia,  bronchospasm, and laryngeal edema. Recognition of an allergic reaction that occurs during anesthesia may be compromised by inability of the patient to communicate early symptoms such as pruritus. Covering of the patient by surgical drapes may obscure recognition of cutaneous signs. Consequently, cardiovascular collapse may be the fi rst detectable signal of the event.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immunologic  and  biochemical  evidence  of  anaphylaxis is  provided  by  an  increased  plasma  tryptase  concentration within 1 to 2 hours of the suspected event. Tryptase, a neutral protease stored in mast cells, is liberated into the systemic circulation during immune-mediated but not non-immunemediated reactions. Its presence veri fi es that mast cell activation  and  mediator  release  have  occurred,  and  thus  it  serves to distinguish immunologic from chemical reactions. Plasma histamine concentration returns to baseline within 30 to 60 minutes  of  an  anaphylactic  reaction,  so  plasma  histamine concentration must be measured immediately a ft er treatment of  anaphylaxis  to  capture  the  change  in  plasma  histamine concentration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases of IgE-mediated anaphylaxis, identi fi cation of the o ff ending agent can be established by a positive response to a  skin  prick  or  intradermal  test  (wheal  and fl are  response), which con fi rms the presence of speci fi c IgE antibodies. Skin testing  should  not  be  performed  within  6  weeks  of  an  anaphylactic  reaction  because  mast  cell  and  basophil  mediator depletion may lead to a false-negative result. Because of the risk of inducing a systemic reaction, testing must be done with a  dilute,  preservative-free  solution  of  suspected  antigen  and performed only by trained personnel with appropriate resuscitation equipment available. In vitro immunoassays for allergen-speci fi c  IgE  are  commercially  available  for  some  drugs. Th is type of testing is most commonly used in the evaluation of potential reactions to neuromuscular blockers, latex, penicillin, and other β -lactam antibiotics. Skin testing remains the more sensitive and preferred method of testing in the majority of cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  immediate goals of treatment of anaphylaxis are reversal of  hypotension  and  hypoxemia,  replacement  of  intravascular volume,  and  inhibition  of  further  cellular  degranulation  and release  of  vasoactive  mediators  (Table  24-4).  Several  liters  of crystalloid and/or colloid solution must be infused to restore intravascular fl uid volume and blood pressure. Epinephrine is indicated in doses of 10 to 100 mcg IV . Early intervention with epinephrine is critical for reversing the life-threatening events characteristic of anaphylaxis. Epinephrine, by increasing intracellular  concentrations  of  cyclic  adenosine  monophosphate, restores  membrane  permeability  and  decreases  the  release  of vasoactive mediators. Th e β -agonist e ff ects of epinephrine relax bronchial smooth muscle and reverse bronchospasm. Th e dose of epinephrine can be doubled and repeated every 1 to 2 minutes until a satisfactory blood pressure response has been obtained. If anaphylaxis is not life threatening, subcutaneous rather than intravenous epinephrine may be used in a dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg. In cases where cardiovascular collapse is unresponsive to epinephrine, the use of alternative vasopressors such as vasopressin, glucagon, or norepinephrine should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antihistamines  such  as  diphenhydramine  compete  with membrane receptor sites normally occupied by histamine and may  decrease  some  manifestations  of  anaphylaxis,  including pruritus and bronchospasm. However, administration of an antihistamine is not e ff ective in treating anaphylaxis once vasoactive mediators have been released. β 2 -Agonists such as albuterol delivered by metered-dose inhaler or nebulizer are useful  for  the  treatment  of  bronchospasm  associated  with anaphylaxis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Corticosteroids  are  o ft en  administered  intravenously  to patients  experiencing  life-threatening  anaphylaxis. Th ese drugs have no known e ff ect on degranulation of mast cells or  antigen-antibody interactions, and the favorable impact observed with corticosteroid  therapy  may  re fl ect  enhancement of the β -agonist e ff ects of other drugs or inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid responsible for the production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. Corticosteroids may

EPIDEMIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug  sensitivity  has  been  implicated  in  3.4%  to  4.3%  of anesthesia-related  deaths. Th e  incidence  of  allergic  and  anaphylactic drug reactions during anesthesia may be increasing, probably because of the frequent administration of several drugs to a patient and cross-sensitivity among drugs. It is not possible to reliably predict which patients are likely to experience anaphylaxis a ft er administration of drugs that are usually innocuous. However, patients with a history of allergy  (extrinsic  asthma, allergy to tropical fruits or drugs) have an increased incidence of  anaphylaxis,  possibly  related  to  a  genetic  predisposition  to form increased amounts of IgE antibodies. Patients allergic to penicillin have a threefold to fourfold greater risk of experiencing an allergic reaction to any drug. A history of allergy to speci fi c drugs elicited during the preoperative evaluation is helpful, but previous uneventful exposure to a drug does not eliminate the possibility of anaphylaxis on subsequent exposure. In addition, anaphylaxis can occur on fi rst exposure to a drug because of cross-reactivity with other environmental agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Allergic  drug  reactions  must  be  distinguished  from  drug intolerance,  idiosyncratic  reactions,  and  drug  toxicity. Th e occurrence of undesirable pharmacologic e ff ects at a low dose of  drug  re fl ects  intolerance,  whereas  idiosyncratic  reactions are undesirable responses to a drug independent of the dose administered. Evidence of histamine release along veins into which drugs are injected indicates localized and nonimmunologic release of histamine insu ffi cient to evoke systemic symptoms. Patients manifesting such a localized response should not be categorized as allergic to a drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ALLERGIC DRUG REACTIONS DURING THE PERIOPERATIVE PERIOD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Allergic  drug  reactions  have  been  reported  to  almost  any drug that may be administered during anesthesia. Most druginduced  allergic  reactions  manifest  within  5  to  10  minutes of exposure. An important exception is the allergic response to latex, which is typically delayed for as long as 30 minutes. When signs appear during maintenance of anesthesia, attention  should be directed to the possibility of allergy to latex, volume expanders, or dyes (Table 24-5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle Relaxants

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle  relaxants  are  responsible  for  approximately  60% of  drug-induced  allergic  reactions  during  the  perioperative period. Cross-sensitivity among muscle relaxants emphasizes the structural similarities of these drugs. Approximately half of patients who experience an allergic reaction to one muscle relaxant are also allergic to other muscle relaxants. IgE antibodies  develop  to  quaternary  or  tertiary  ammonium  ions. Many  over-the-counter  drugs  and  cosmetics  contain  these ammonium ions and are capable of sensitizing an individual. Consequently, anaphylaxis may develop on the fi rst exposure to  a  muscle  relaxant  in  a  patient  sensitized  by  one  of  these products.  Neostigmine  and  morphine  contain  ammonium ions  that  are  also  capable  of  cross-reacting  with  antibodies to  muscle  relaxants.  Antibodies  that  develop  against  muscle relaxants remain present for decades. Th erefore, a patient with a history of anaphylaxis to any muscle relaxant should be skin tested  preoperatively  for  all  drugs  that  are  likely  to  be  used in  future  anesthetic  management,  and  ideally  an  alternative

agent to which the patient has been skin tested and found to be nonallergic should be utilized. Avoidance is preferred if an alternative means of providing anesthesia is available. Desensitization is theoretically possible but is not practical given that it would require prolonged exposure to a paralytic agent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonimmune reactions to muscle relaxants include direct mast cell degranulation that causes release of histamine and other mediators. Benzyl isoquinolinium compounds such as D-tubocurarine,  metocurine,  atracurium,  and  mivacurium are  more likely  to  cause  direct  mast  cell  degranulation  than aminosteroid  compounds  like  pancuronium,  vecuronium, and rocuronium. Skin testing is not useful in the investigation of  non-immune-mediated  allergic  reactions.  Reactions  that are not IgE mediated may be reduced in frequency or intensity by pretreatment with antihistamines and glucocorticoids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately  5%  of  perioperative  anaphylactic  events are caused by hypnotic induction agents, more commonly by barbiturates than by nonbarbiturates. Most reported cases of barbiturate  allergy  have  occurred  in  patients  with  a  history of previous uneventful exposure to a barbiturate. Cross-reactivity among barbiturates is possible, but there is no evidence of  cross-reactivity  between  barbiturate  and  nonbarbiturate agents. Propofol has been implicated in allergic reactions both on fi rst and repeated exposure. It has been advised that propofol be used with caution in patients with a history of egg or soy allergy because of the presence of lecithins in the propofol emulsion that may elicit allergic responses. Allergic reactions to midazolam, etomidate, and ketamine are extremely rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Local Anesthetics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
True allergy to local anesthetics is rare, despite the common labeling of patients as allergic to drugs in this class. It is estimated that only about 1% of purported allergic reactions to local anesthetics are in fact truly allergic; the remainder represent adverse but known responses to inadvertent intravascular injection (hypotension and seizure) or systemic absorption of epinephrine added to local anesthetic (hypertension and tachycardia). Careful history and review of past medical records are most useful in discerning the true mechanism responsible for the  event.  Urticaria,  laryngeal  edema,  and  bronchoconstriction suggest a true allergic response.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ester-type  local  anesthetics  more  commonly  cause  allergic  reactions  than  amide-type  anesthetics.  Ester-type  local anesthetics  are  metabolized  to  compounds  related  to  paraaminobenzoic  acid,  which  is  a  highly  antigenic  compound. Preservatives used in local anesthetic solutions such as methylparaben,  propylparaben,  and  metabisul fi te  also  produce allergic  reactions.  As  a  result,  anaphylaxis  may  actually  be due to stimulation of antibody production to the preservative rather than to the local anesthetic itself.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  not  uncommon  to  be  presented  with  the  question of  the  safety  of  administering  a  local  anesthetic  to  a  patient with a purported history of allergy to this class of drugs. It is generally agreed that cross-sensitivity does not exist between ester-type  and  amide-type  compounds.  It  is  also  advisable to use only preservative-free local anesthetic solutions, since preservatives may evoke allergic reactions. It is reasonable to recommend intradermal  testing  with  preservative-free  local anesthetic in the occasional patient with a convincing history

of allergy in whom failure to document a safe local anesthetic drug  would  prevent  the  use  of  local  or  regional  anesthesia when clinically indicated.

Opioids

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaphylaxis  a ft er  administration  of  opioids  is  very  rare, which perhaps re fl ects the similarity of these drugs to naturally  occurring endorphins. Certain opioids, including morphine, codeine, and meperidine, may directly evoke the release of histamine from mast cells and basophils, which mimics an allergic response. Th ese reactions are usually limited to cutaneous manifestations such as pruritus and urticaria, consistent with the fact that opioid receptors have been found on dermal mast cells but not on mast cells from any other organs. Fentanyl is unique among narcotics in that it lacks the ability to stimulate mast cell degranulation; this makes it a good option for patients with cutaneous reactions to other narcotics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aspirin and Other Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pseudoallergic reactions a ft er administration of aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are well documented. Patients with a history of asthma, hyperplastic sinusitis, and nasal polyps are at increased risk of experiencing  these  reactions.  Common symptoms include rhinorrhea and  bronchospasm;  airway  compromise  and  severe  angioedema may also occur. For the most part, these reactions are attributable  to  inhibition  of  the  cyclooxygenase-1  (COX-1) enzyme that promotes the synthesis of leukotrienes and the subsequent release of mediators from basophils and mast cells. Th is is substantiated by the fact the reactions are far less severe when selective COX-2 inhibitors are employed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volatile Anesthetics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical features of halothane-induced hepatitis suggest a drug-induced  allergic  reaction. Th ese  include  eosinophilia, fever, rash, and previous exposure to halothane. Th e plasma of  patients  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  halothane  hepatitis may  contain  antibodies  that  react  with  halothane-induced liver  antigens  (neoantigens). Th ese  neoantigens  are  formed by  the  covalent  interaction  of  reactive  oxidative  tri fl uoroacetyl halide metabolites with hepatic microsomal proteins. Acetylation of liver proteins changes these metabolites so that they are no longer recognized as "self" but rather are regarded as "nonself." As a result antibodies are formed against these now foreign proteins.  It  is  postulated  that  subsequent  antigen-antibody interactions are responsible for the liver injury associated with halothane hepatitis. Similar oxidative halide metabolites are produced a ft er exposure to en fl urane, iso fl urane, and des fl urane, which indicates the possibility of crosssensitivity to volatile anesthetics in susceptible patients. Based on the degree of metabolism of these volatile anesthetics, it is predictable that the likelihood of anesthetic-induced allergic hepatitis would be greatest for halothane, intermediate for en fl urane, minimal for iso fl urane, and remote for des fl urane. Unlike the other volatile agents, sevo fl urane does not produce these oxidative halide metabolites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiocontrast Media

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Contrast media injected intravenously for radiographic studies evoke allergic reactions in approximately 3% of patients. Th e risk of an allergic reaction is increased in patients with a history of asthma or allergies to other drugs or foods. However, the pathogenesis of allergy to contrast material is unrelated to that of "seafood" allergy, which is attributed to high concentrations of iodine. Most reactions to contrast material appear to be non-immune mediated. Th erefore,  in  patients  with  a  history of contrast agent allergy, pretreatment with corticosteroids and histamine antagonists is usually e ff ective. A common regimen is oral prednisone 50 mg administered at 13, 7, and 1 hour before exposure  and  diphenhydramine  50  mg  administered  1  hour before contrast agent administration. Allergic reactions are most common with the use of ionic contrast agents; use of nonionic agents substantially reduces the incidence of allergic reactions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  rare,  severe  progressive  nephrogenic fi brosis  has been reported in patients exposed to gadolinium-based contrast agents. An immunologic reaction to gadolinium chelates appears to be involved; delayed gadolinium excretion resulting from preexisting renal failure is an important predisposing factor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Latex

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Latex is a saplike substance produced by the commercial rubber  tree, Hevea  brasiliensis. Several  di ff erent Hevea proteins may cause an IgE-mediated antibody response that can lead to cardiovascular collapse during anesthesia and surgery. A  feature  that  distinguishes  latex-induced  allergic  reactions from other drug-induced allergic reactions is its delayed onset, typically longer than 30 minutes a ft er  exposure to the latex. Th is may re fl ect the time needed for the responsible antigen to be eluted from rubber gloves and absorbed across mucous membranes into the systemic circulation in amounts su ffi cient to  cause  an  allergic  reaction.  Contact  with  latex  at  mucosal surfaces is the most signi fi cant route of latex exposure. However, inhalation of latex antigens is an alternative route. Cornstarch powder in gloves is not immunogenic but can act as an airborne vehicle for latex antigens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sensitized patients develop IgE antibodies directed speci fi -cally against latex antigens. Skin testing can con fi rm latex hypersensitivity, but anaphylaxis has occurred during skin testing, so this test must be performed with great caution. A radioallergosorbent test and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are available for in vitro detection of latex-speci fi c IgE antibodies. Th ese tests are virtually equal in sensitivity and speci fi city and avoid the risk of anaphylaxis associated with skin testing.

Questions  about  itching,  conjunctivitis,  rhinitis,  rash,  or wheezing  a ft er  in fl ating  balloons  or  wearing  latex  gloves  or a ft er  undergoing  dental  or  gynecologic  examinations  performed using latex gloves may be helpful in identifying sensitized patients. Operating room personnel and patients with spina bi fi da have an increased incidence of latex allergy that is  thought to re fl ect  frequent exposure to latex devices such as bladder catheters and protective outerwear. Th e incidence of  latex  sensitivity  in  anesthesiologists  may  exceed  15%. Latex  sensitivity  most  o ft en  manifests  as  contact  dermatitis

or  bronchospasm  resulting  from  inhalation  of  latex  allergens. Prevalence of latex allergy peaked in the 1990s and has declined since then. Factors responsible for the increase during that period probably include the widespread adoption of universal  precautions  in  the  1990s  so  that  latex  gloves  were worn much more o ft en than before. In addition, the tapping of  younger  rubber  trees  and  the  use  of  stimulant  chemicals to  increase  latex  production  probably  increased  the  amount of allergenic protein in the raw material and ultimately in the fi nished goods of production, which also contributed to the increase in allergic responses. Th e reduction in the frequency of latex allergy over the past several years is probably a result of the transition to the use of latex-free products and avoidance of powdered latex gloves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients at high risk of latex sensitivity (those with spina bi fi da, multiple previous operations, or history of fruit allergy, as  well  as  health  care  workers)  should  be  questioned  for symptoms related to exposure to natural rubber during their daily routines or previous surgical procedures. Intraoperative management  of  these  patients  includes  strict  maintenance of  a  latex-free  environment,  including  the  use  of  nonlatex gloves  (styrene,  neoprene)  by  all  personnel  in  contact  with the patient. In addition, medications should not be drawn up through latex caps or injected through latex ports on intravenous delivery tubing.

Protamine

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protamine  is  capable  of  causing  direct  histamine  release from  mast  cells  and  activating  the  complement  pathway  to produce  thromboxane,  which  causes  bronchoconstriction, pulmonary  artery  hypertension,  and  systemic  hypotension. Th is is a predictable response and is directly related to the rate of injection. It is not an allergic reaction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immune-mediated anaphylactic reactions to protamine are rare. Th e  presence  of  serum  antiprotamine  IgE  and  IgG  antibodies can be demonstrated in these patients. Protamine allergy is more likely to occur in patients who are allergic to seafood, which re fl ects the fact that protamine is derived from salmon sperm. A ft er vasectomy, men may be at increased risk of allergic reactions to protamine because they develop circulating antibodies  to  spermatozoa.  Diabetic  patients  treated  with  protaminecontaining  insulin  preparations  such  as  neutral  protamine Hagedorn (NPH) are also at increased risk. Patients known to be allergic to protamine present a therapeutic challenge when neutralization of heparin is required, because no e ff ective alternative to protamine is commonly available. In the rare instances when patients with protamine allergy require anticoagulation, the use of a direct thrombin inhibitor such as bivalirudin instead of heparin can be considered. Heparinase, a heparin-neutralizing enzyme from the gram-negative bacterium Flavobacterium heparinum, has also been used as a substitute for protamine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotics

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotics  are  the  second  most  common  cause  of  anaphylaxis in the perioperative period, accounting for approximately 10% to 15% of all episodes. Penicillin allergy is most common, and in the general population, penicillin accounts for most fatal anaphylactic drug reactions. Approximately 10% of patients report a penicillin allergy; however, it has been estimated that up to 90% of these patients are in fact able to tolerate penicillin. Th is is due in part to an initial misattribution of clinical signs to a penicillin reaction rather than to the underlying medical illness being treated with penicillin. In addition, IgE antibodies to penicillin wane over time; therefore many patients diagnosed as penicillin allergic in childhood are able to tolerate penicillin as adults. Elective skin testing should be considered for any patient with a convincing history of IgEmediated penicillin allergy to avoid inappropriate avoidance of β -lactam antibiotics and unnecessary use of more expensive and broader-spectrum antibiotics. Th e negative predictive value of penicillin skin testing is high; that is, a negative skin test result for penicillin does reliably indicate that the patient is  not allergic to penicillin. Patients with a positive skin test result are candidates for drug desensitization. Th is is accomplished by administration of escalating challenge doses of an allergen or drug to an allergic patient so that the patient eventually becomes desensitized to the allergen or drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e structural similarity between penicillin and the cephalosporins (both contain β -lactam rings) suggests the possibility of cross-sensitivity. However, the incidence of life-threatening allergic reactions following administration of cephalosporins is  low  (0.05%).  Historically,  the  incidence  of  allergic  reaction  to  cephalosporins  in  patients  with  a  history  of  penicillin allergy was reported to be in the range of 7%. More recent research suggests a much lower rate of cross-reactivity (0.2%). Cross-reactivity  is  seen  most  o ft en  in  patients  reporting  an allergy to amoxicillin who are given fi rst-generation cephalosporins or cefamandole. Cross-reactivity is seen less o ft en if later-generation cephalosporins are administered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Allergy to sulfonamide antibiotics is the second most commonly  reported  antibiotic  allergy. Th ese  reactions  manifest most o ft en as delayed cutaneous rashes, and sulfonamides are the most common cause of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. In HIVpositive  patients,  the  incidence  of  skin  rash  to  sulfonamides is  approximately ten times higher than that in HIV-negative patients. Because trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the drug of  choice  for  the  treatment  and  prophylaxis  of Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly  called Pneumocystis  carinii )  pneumonia  in HIV-positive patients, drug desensitization is advised.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most purported cases of vancomycin allergy are non-IgEmediated  reactions  involving  direct  histamine  release  from mast cells and basophils, and are directly related to the rate of drug infusion. In most cases, these patients are able to tolerate repeat administration utilizing slower infusion rates and antihistamine premedication. However, in rare cases IgE-  mediated allergy has been reported on repeat exposure to this drug.

Blood, Blood Products, and Synthetic Volume Expanders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Minor urticarial allergic reactions to properly cross-matched blood products may occur in 1% to 3% of patients. Th e cause is  unknown,  but  may  involve  soluble  antigens  in  the  donor unit  to  which  the  recipient  has  been  previously  sensitized.

Anaphylactic reactions are rare, occurring in approximately 1 in 20,000 to 50,000 transfusions. Th ese may result from antibodies against IgA, HLA, or complement proteins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  leading  cause  of  transfusion-related  morbidity  and mortality  is  transfusion-related  acute  lung  injury  (TRALI). Diagnostic  criteria  for  TRALI  include  hypoxia  and  bilateral pulmonary edema that occur within 6 hours of transfusion and in the absence of intravascular fl uid overload or heart failure. Th e pathogenesis of TRALI appears to be activation of neutrophils on the pulmonary vascular endothelium as a result of donor leukocyte antibodies, particularly anti-HLA and antineutrophil antibodies. Th ese antibodies are contained in the plasma component of transfused blood products. Th erefore, TRALI is most commonly seen a ft er  transfusion  of  plasmarich components such as fresh frozen plasma and platelets. Th e reported incidence of TRALI varies signi fi cantly  since  diagnostic criteria have only recently been agreed upon. Treatment is supportive, and most patients recover spontaneously within a few days. Neither steroid therapy nor diuresis is bene fi cial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolytic  transfusion  reactions  occur  in  1  in  10,000  to 50,000 blood component transfusions. Th ese reactions appear to be mediated by immunoglobulins, particularly IgM and IgG.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e estimated incidence of allergic reactions to plasma volume expanders is between 0.03% and 0.22%. All synthetic colloids have been implicated, but reactions are more common with dextrans and gelatins than with albumin and hydroxyethyl  starch.  Both  immune-  and  non-immune-mediated mechanisms have been implicated, with manifestations ranging from rash and modest hypotension to bronchospasm and shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other Agents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several other drugs have been implicated in cases of perioperative drug allergy. Th ese include the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin, formerly used in cardiac surgery to reduce blood loss, as well as antiseptic solutions such as chlorhexidine, vital dyes, heparin, and insulin. Th is  underscores the importance of including drug allergy as part of the di ff erential diagnosis of any case of cardiovascular collapse that occurs during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eosinophilia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinically  signi fi cant  eosinophilia  is  de fi ned  as  a  sustained absolute  eosinophil  count  of  more  than  1000  to  1500/mm 3 . Moderate eosinophilia is commonly seen in a wide spectrum of disorders, including parasitic infestations, systemic allergic disorders,  collagen  vascular  diseases,  various  forms  of  dermatitis,  drug  reactions,  and  tumors.  Hodgkin's  disease  and both  B-  and  T-cell  non-Hodgkin's  lymphomas  can  present with eosinophilia. Even when there is no obvious sign of an underlying lymphoma, up to 25% of patients with apparent idiopathic eosinophilia have an expanded clone of aberrant T cells that produce high levels of IL-5.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypereosinophilia is associated with tissue damage secondary  to  release  of  basic  protein  by  the  eosinophil.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Irreversible  endomyocardial fi brosis  producing  a  restrictive cardiomyopathy is common in patients who maintain eosinophil counts higher than 5000/mm 3 . In patients with eosinophilic  leukemia  or  idiopathic  hypereosinophilic  (Lö ffl er's) syndrome,  eosinophil  counts  can  reach  20,000  to  100,000/ mm 3 .  Widespread  organ  dysfunction  and  rapidly  progressive heart disease are associated with these conditions. Th ese patients need aggressive treatment with both corticosteroids and hydroxyurea. Leukapheresis can be used to acutely lower eosinophil counts.

MISDIRECTED ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoimmune Disorders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e challenge of adaptive immunity is the need for immune cells to be capable of responding e ffi ciently to a wide variety of foreign antigens yet still be able to recognize and tolerate "self " antigens. Th ere is growing evidence that major immunologic stimuli,  such  as  certain  infections,  can  activate  selfreactive  lymphocytes.  In  general,  these  primed  self-reactive lymphocytes tend to undergo apoptotic elimination once the immunologic challenge has been controlled. Indeed, transient autoimmunity appears to be a relatively common byproduct of major immune system activation. Th e speci fi c defects that cause autoimmunity to persist and develop into a chronic, selfdestructive immune disorder are not well understood. Genetic predisposition may play a role. Table 24-6 lists some diseases with a known autoimmune basis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthetic implications of autoimmune disorders can be divided into three categories. Th e fi rst includes the anesthetic  considerations  involving  certain  vulnerable  organs speci fi c to the particular immune disorder. Examples include cervical instability with rheumatoid arthritis, renal injury with systemic lupus erythematosus, and liver failure with chronic autoimmune hepatitis. Th e second category is related to the consequences of therapy used to treat the autoimmune disorder. Th e potential for addisonian crisis in patients treated long  term  with  corticosteroids  is  well  recognized.  Newer therapies for autoimmune disorders inhibit speci fi c facets of the immune response, which places patients who take these medications at increased risk of perioperative infection. Th e third category, especially in patients with long-standing autoimmune disorders, concerns the risk of accelerated  atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular complications such as heart disease and stroke. Some studies suggest that the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is increased by as much as 50-fold in the presence of an autoimmune disease. Some of this added risk may be due to the agents used to treat the autoimmune disease itself. For example, long-term steroid therapy is  associated  with  hypertension  and  diabetes  mellitus, both of which are powerful risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Th erefore, patients with long-standing autoimmune conditions  warrant  thorough  cardiovascular  evaluation  and consideration of the increased risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications.

Transfusion-Related Immunomodulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  recent  years,  it  has  come  to  be  appreciated  that  transfusion of allogeneic blood products has a measurable impact on immune function. Such transfusion-related immunomodulatory (TRIM) e ff ects include increased susceptibility to infection and promotion of tumor growth. Conversely, a TRIM e ff ect is likely to explain improved renal allogra ft survival in transplant patients. Speci fi c TRIM e ff ects include decreased NK cell and phagocytic function, impaired antigen presentation, and suppression  of  lymphocyte  production. Th e  mechanism  underlying  TRIM  e ff ects  remains  unclear  but  may  involve  donor leukocytes present in transfused blood products and soluble

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HLA class I peptides. Partial HLA compatibility between donor leukocytes and the recipient induces a state of microchimerism that prompts the release of IL-4, IL-10, and other in fl ammatory mediators that impair cell-mediated immunity and cytotoxicity. An extreme manifestation of microchimerism is the development  of  transfusion-associated  gra ft -versus-host  disease, a  rare  but  o ft en fatal  condition in which immunocompetent donor (gra ft )  cells  attack  the  recipient's  cells,  which  leads  to pancytopenia and liver failure. Application of leukoreduction techniques to stored blood appear to mitigate some but not all TRIM e ff ects. Th e  presence  in  stored  blood  of  other  soluble mediators such as histamine and other proin fl ammatory cytokines that are not removed by leukoreduction may account for the incomplete e ff ect of leukoreduction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Neuroendocrine Stress Response

<!-- PAGE=? -->
By far the most important in fl uence on immune function in the perioperative period is the neuroendocrine stress response initiated by activation of the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Surgical stress induces release of  catecholamines,  corticotropin,  and  cortisol.  Monocytes, macrophages,  and  T  cells  possess β 2 -adrenergic  and  glucocorticoid  receptors.  Activation  of  these  receptors  results  in net inhibition of T H1 cytokine production and promotion of TH2 antiin fl ammatory cytokine release. Monocyte and macrophage activation lead to the release of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factorα , which further stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Th e bene fi t of this immunosuppression is to minimize the in fl ammatory response caused by surgical trauma. Th e downside of this immunosuppression is an increased vulnerability to infection and tumor proliferation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Numerous other perioperative factors weaken the immune system.  Acute  pain  suppresses  NK  cell  activity,  probably  as a  result  of  activation  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary  axis  and autonomic  nervous  system.  Hypothermia  exacerbates  the neuroendocrine  stress  response  and  induces  thermoregulatory vasoconstriction. Tissue hypoxia impairs oxidative killing by neutrophils and prolongs wound healing. Hypothermia has also been shown to suppress NK cell activity and lymphocyte function. Elevated plasma cortisol and catecholamine concentrations  during  surgery  result  in  hyperglycemia,  which  can provide a medium for bacterial growth. Hyperglycemia itself also  has  deleterious  e ff ects  on  the  immune  system.  Hyperglycemia  induces  changes  in  the  vascular  endothelium  that impede  lymphocyte  migration.  It  also  reduces  immune  cell proliferation by interfering with critical enzymatic functions, and it impairs neutrophil phagocytosis.

Effects of Anesthetics on the Immune Response

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  well  established  that  immunocompetence  is  essential for  a  host  to  resist  cancer.  For  example,  recipients  of  solid organ transplants who have a history of cancer experience a higher  rate  of  cancer  recurrence  following  the  initiation  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
immunosuppressive  therapy.  Surgical  excision  remains  the treatment of choice for most locally contained solid organ cancers, but there is concern that exposure to surgery and anesthesia may actually promote tumor progression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several mechanisms are likely at play. Surgical disruption of the tumor may release tumor cells into the circulation, which provides the seeds for micrometastases. Th e presence of a primary tumor may itself inhibit angiogenesis; therefore,  tumor removal may paradoxically favor the survival of minimal residual disease. Release of growth factors and suppression of antiangiogenic factors may also contribute. In addition, tissue injury depresses  cell-mediated  immunity,  including  the  function  of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. Allogeneic red blood cell transfusion in the perioperative period may also play a role in increasing  the  risk  of  tumor  recurrence.  Laboratory  investigation  of TRIM has demonstrated a reduction in T H and NK cell counts and decreased levels of the T H1 cytokines IL-2 and interferon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Considerable  in vitro  and  in vivo  evidence  from  animal studies  suggest  that  anesthetics  and  analgesics  also  have  an impact  on  the  immune  response  (Table  24-7). Th e  magnitude  of  this  e ff ect  is  probably  considerably  less  than  that  of the surgical stress itself, but an additive e ff ect may be important. Ketamine, thiopental, and all of the volatile anesthetics appear  to  reduce  NK  cell  activity  and/or  number.  Volatile anesthetics also impair neutrophil function by inhibiting the respiratory oxidative burst mechanism and reducing lymphocyte proliferation. Nitrous oxide impairs DNA and nucleotide synthesis  and  has  been  observed  to  depress  hematopoietic and mononuclear cell synthesis and depress neutrophil chemotaxis. Th e impact of propofol on immune function is less clear, but propofol bears a chemical resemblance to the antioxidant α -tocopherol and may possess antiin fl ammatory and antioxidative properties that tend to inhibit neutrophil, monocyte,  and  macrophage activity. Recently interest has focused on propofol conjugates in the treatment of breast cancer since they  have  been  shown  to  inhibit  cellular  adhesion  and  promote apoptosis of breast cancer cells.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e immunosuppressive e ff ects of opiates have been known for  decades.  Opioid  receptors  in  the  hypothalamic-pituitary axis  promote  the  release  of  corticotropin  and  cortisol.  Sympathetic nervous system activation and catecholamine release further suppress NK cell, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and macrophage functions. Immune cells also possess a speci fi c subset of µ receptors, the activation of which leads to increased intracellular calcium gradients and activation of nitric oxide synthase. Elevated nitric oxide concentrations appear to mediate many of the antiin fl ammatory e ff ects of naturally occurring opioids. Morphine also impairs antibody formation and the synthesis of proin fl ammatory cytokines. As expected, many of the immunomodulatory e ff ects of opioids can be blocked by administration of the µ-receptor antagonist naloxone. Th ere is some evidence to suggest that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and remifentanil have less of an impact on immune function, possibly related to their di ff erential activation of speci fi c opioid receptors.

Nonopioid analgesics seem to have less e ff ect on immune function  than  opiates.  In  fact,  there  is  some  evidence  to

suggest  that  tramadol,  which  has  noradrenergic  and  serotoninergic activity in addition to µ-receptor a ffi nity, may promote NK cell activity. NSAIDs that inhibit the COX enzyme have been shown in an animal model to possess antitumor and antiangiogenic properties. COX-2 inhibitors such as etodolac and celecoxib may attenuate the deleterious e ff ects of opioidinduced tumor growth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some  retrospective  studies  have  shown  that  the  use  of regional anesthesia instead of intravenous morphine for postoperative  pain  control  is  associated  with  measurable  reductions in cancer recurrence. Several mechanisms may account for this observation. Regional anesthesia attenuates the neuroendocrine  surgical  stress  response  by  blocking  a ff erent transmission to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In addition, patients who receive regional anesthesia or regional analgesia have reduced requirements for drugs with known immunosuppressive  e ff ects,  such  as  general  anesthetics  and  opioids. Local  anesthetic  agents  may  also  possess  intrinsic  antitumor  properties.  Both  lidocaine  and  ropivacaine  have  been shown to exert antiproliferative e ff ects on tumor cells. Not all research has supported a bene fi t  of  regional  anesthesia  over general anesthesia in terms of cancer prognosis. Th e impact may di ff er depending on tumor type. Th erefore, despite these promising fi ndings, more research is needed before de fi nitive conclusions can be drawn about the optimal anesthetic choice in cancer patients.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e immune system is divided into innate and adaptive or acquired pathways.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e innate immune pathway mounts the initial response to any infection, recognizes targets that are common to many pathogens, and has no speci fi c memory. Its cellular components are neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells,  and  its  main  noncellular  elements  are  the  complement proteins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e adaptive immune pathway has a more delayed onset of action and may take days to activate when challenged by an unfamiliar antigen. However, adaptive immunity is capable of developing memory and is more rapidly induced by antigen when memory is present. Adaptive immunity consists of a humoral component mediated by B lymphocytes that produce antibodies and a cellular  component  dominated by T lymphocytes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Angioedema may be hereditary or acquired and is characterized by episodic edema resulting from increased vascular permeability. Th e condition commonly involves swelling of the face and mucous membranes and may lead to airway compromise. Th e  most  common  hereditary  form  results from  an  autosomal  dominant  de fi ciency  of  C1  esterase inhibitor, which results in a build-up of the vasoactive compound  bradykinin.  Treatment  of  acute  episodes  involves administration of C1 inhibitor concentrate or fresh frozen plasma  to  replace  the  de fi cient  enzyme.  Androgens,  catecholamines, antihistamines, and anti fi brinolytics  are not useful in the treatment of acute episodes of angioedema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening condition caused by massive  release  of  vasoactive  mediators  via  degranulation  of mast cells and basophils through either immune- or nonimmune-mediated mechanisms. Treatment requires reversal  of  hypotension  through  replacement  of  intravascular fl uid volume and inhibition of further release of vasoactive mediators.  Early  intervention  with  epinephrine  is  critical.  Epinephrine  increases  intracellular  cyclic  adenosine monophosphate  and  thereby  reduces  vasoactive  mediator  release.  It  also  relaxes  bronchial  smooth  muscle  and relieves bronchospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Muscle  relaxants  are  responsible  for  more  than  60%  of drug-induced allergic reactions in the perioperative period, and cross-sensitization among di ff erent muscle relaxants is common. Reaction may occur on fi rst exposure (presumably  caused  by  sensitization  from  other  environmental agents) or a ft er previous uneventful exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Almost all allergic reactions occur within 5 to 10 minute of exposure to an antigen. An important exception to this rule is the allergic response to latex, which typically occurs at least 30 minutes a ft er exposure. Preoperative referral for skin testing is appropriate for patients with a strong clinical history of previous latex allergic reaction. Latex sensitivity is  an  occupational  hazard  for  health  care  workers.  Other groups with a higher than average risk of latex allergy are patients with a history of spina bi fi da, multiple prior surgeries, or fruit allergy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Autoimmune disorders result in immune-mediated endorgan dysfunction because of inappropriate activation of antibody  against  self-antigens.  Each  disorder  is  accompanied by a distinct set of multisystem features. Patients with  autoimmune  disorders  also  have  an  increased  risk of  cardiovascular  disease. Th erefore,  careful  preoperative evaluation is imperative to prevent excess perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality.  Many of these patients are treated  with  exogenous  glucocorticoids  and  may  require "stress-dose"  steroids  prior  to  major  surgery  to  prevent addisonian crisis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Many  factors  related  to  surgery  and  anesthesia  impair immune  function,  which  may  precipitate  infection  and cancer  progression  in  susceptible  patients. Th e  principal factor appears to be the neuroendocrine response to surgical stress, which includes release of catecholamines and glucocorticoids that impair both innate and adaptive immune responses. Anesthetic agents, including volatile anesthetics and opioids, also impair immune function. Regional and neuraxial anesthesia with local anesthetics may help preserve immune system function.
