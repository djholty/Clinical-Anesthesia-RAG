UNIQUE CONSIDERATIONS IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Much of the focus in pediatrics is on growth and development. Not only are children di ff erent from adults, they are also very di ff erent from one another. Newborn medicine and adolescent medicine  are  two  di ff erent  subspecialties  within  pediatrics, each requiring an extensive medical fellowship, yet the anesthesiologist is called upon to care for patients from a preterm newborn who could weigh less than 1 kg to a vigorous adolescent athlete tipping the scales at 100 kg. Although it is quite obvious that special considerations apply in caring for preterm newborns, there are also many unique aspects of adolescents that should be borne in mind when caring for them despite their physical and physiologic similarities to adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Psychology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  the  physical  and  physiologic  di ff erences  between children and adults are paramount and are reviewed in detail, the  perianesthetic  experience  of  pediatric  patients  and  their parents  is  undoubtedly  in fl uenced by how the anesthesiologist  manages the psychologic assessment and preparation of the  child  and  family.  All  patients  experience  anxiety  before undergoing  anesthesia  and  surgery.  Quite  frequently,  children undergo anesthesia so that a diagnostic and not a surgical  procedure  can  be  performed.  In  these  cases,  nearly  all of the preprocedure anxiety is focused on the anesthesia. An appreciation of circumstances that contribute to preanesthetic anxiety is an important fi rst step in designing an approach that minimizes  apprehension  and  potential  psychologic  trauma. Factors associated with a greater likelihood and degree of perianesthetic anxiety in children include the following:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Age of 1 to 5 years

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Unsatisfactory prior medical experiences

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Shy temperament

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Anxious parents

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ A noisy and busy preoperative environment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children and adolescents all have some degree of anxiety, but speci fi c fears will di ff er depending on age group and the related developmental stage (Table 27-1). Toddlers and young children fear separation from their caretakers. Separation anxiety typically begins at 8 to 10 months of age. Preschool-aged children  still  fear  separation,  but  they  have  enough  understanding  of  medical  procedures  also  to  fear  pain  and  discomfort, particularly needles. Th ey also fear a loss of control. Allowing them to choose a hospital gown color or a favorite mask scent may help them regain a small sense of control of an unfamiliar environment. Younger children have a concrete thought process, and they cannot put it into perspective that any  discomfort  is  temporary  and  that  their  lives  will  soon return to normal. In addition to the aforementioned concerns, adolescents also fear death but are o ft en afraid to ask questions about the risk of mortality. An explicit delineation of the expected perioperative course, from induction to emergence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and recovery in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), is o ft en helpful to allay their fears.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preanesthetic programs including play and simulation of the  anesthetic  induction,  videos,  or  separate  preanesthetic visits scheduled ahead of time all can help to alleviate anxiety. Th e timing of these visits should take into account the child's age  and  developmental  stage.  Patient-centered  approaches involve a preanesthetic interview with the child and parents, the use of anxiolytic premedication, and the choice of induction  of  anesthesia  with  a  parent  present.  Although  many parents  report  increased  satisfaction  with  such  a  process, data are con fl icting regarding the e ff ect on the child's own anxiety. Discussion must be held and preparations made for cases in which parents become overly emotional during the induction or the induction does not proceed as smoothly as planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Finally, allowing parental visits in the PACU can o ft en contribute to a positive perioperative experience for both the child and family. As with parental presence during the induction of anesthesia, parental presence in the PACU should be permitted only a ft er careful consideration of the viewpoints of all involved caregivers.  Educating  the  parents  regarding  potential  emergence delirium and probable postoperative-postanesthetic problems is also important.

BODY SIZE AND THERMOREGULATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pediatric patients can weigh from less than 1 kg to more than 100 kg. Physical aspects of the care of larger adolescents are similar to those encountered in the care of adult patients. Th e younger,  smaller  patients  present  di ff erent  challenges.  Neonates  and  infants  are  vulnerable  to  becoming  hypothermic during the perioperative period. Body heat is lost more rapidly in this age group than in older children or adults because of the high ratio of body surface area to body weight and volume, the thin  layer  of  insulating  subcutaneous  fat,  and  the  decreased ability to produce heat. Shivering plays little or no role in heat production  in  neonates,  whose  primary  mechanism  of  heat generation is nonshivering thermogenesis mediated by brown fat.  Brown  fat  is  a  specialized  type  of  adipose  tissue  located

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
585

<!-- PAGE=? -->
in the posterior neck and interscapular and vertebral areas, as well as surrounding the kidneys and adrenal glands. Metabolism of brown fat is stimulated by norepinephrine and results in triglyceride hydrolysis and thermogenesis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For all patients, children as well as adults, general anesthesia  is  associated  with some degree of heat loss as a result of exposure to the cold environment and the anesthetic e ff ects of central thermoregulatory inhibition and reduction of metabolic rate. It is very di ffi cult to reestablish normothermia once hypothermia  develops  in  newborns  and  infants.  Because  of this,  prevention  of  hypothermia  is  essential.  Hypothermia may be protective in selected circumstances, but normothermia should be maintained in general. Complications that have been  associated  with  intraoperative  hypothermia  include surgical wound infection, negative nitrogen balance, delayed wound  healing,  delayed  postoperative  anesthetic  recovery, impaired coagulation, and prolonged hospitalization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To  minimize  oxygen  consumption,  newborns  should  be in a neutral thermal environment (one in which heat is neither gained or lost). Th e temperature required for a newborn to have the lowest oxygen consumption is quite warm and is rarely achieved in the operating room. For example, the neutral  thermal  environment  for  an  unclothed  3-kg  newborn is  32°  to  33°  C.  Steps  aimed  at  decreasing  loss  of  body  heat include transporting neonates in heated isolettes; increasing the ambient temperature of operating rooms; using a heating mattress,  radiant  warmer,  or  convective  forced-air  warming device; and humidifying and warming inspired gases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A newborn's brain comprises approximately 10% of the total body weight. In comparison, an adult's brain constitutes only 2% of total body weight. Myelinization and synaptic connections  are  not  complete  until  the  child  reaches  the  third  or fourth birthday. From birth to 2 years of age, a child's brain undergoes the most rapid phase of growth, achieving 75% of its adult size. Th e location of the spinal cord within the vertebrae changes with growth. At birth, the spinal cord reaches the level of the third lumbar vertebra but migrates to the normal adult level at L1 and L2 by the third year of life.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AIRWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  airway  of  a  term  newborn  di ff ers  in  several  ways  from that of an adult. Th e larynx has a higher position in the neck. Newborns have a proportionately larger head and tongue, a short and mobile epiglottis, and vocal cords whose anterior commissure is slanted inferiorly. Airway obstruction occurs more readily in the newborn and infant because of the larger tongue size relative to the oral cavity. Th e cricoid cartilage (as opposed to the vocal cords in adults) is the narrowest portion of  the  larynx  in  pediatric  patients.  As  in  adults,  angulation of the right main bronchus favors right endobronchial intubation if the tracheal tube is inserted beyond the carina. Th e importance of the smaller absolute dimensions of the upper and lower airways in newborns and infants cannot be overemphasized.  In  the  equations  describing  turbulent  (upper

<!-- PAGE=? -->
airway)  and  laminar  (lower  airway) fl ow,  air fl ow is  directly proportional to the airway radius raised to the fift h and fourth power, respectively. As the newborn grows into infancy and young  childhood,  the  relative  size  of  the  head  and  tongue decreases, and the location of the larynx in the neck shi ft s to the lower position seen in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  functional  aspects  of  the  respiratory  system,  such  as respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation, re fl ect a crucial physiologic di ff erence between children and adults. Oxygen consumption ( ˙ 7 o 2 ) is much greater on a per-  kilogram basis in children than in adults (Table 27-2). Th is is due to the di ff erence in the ratio of surface area to volume. Th e higher ˙ 7 o 2 explains  the  speed  with  which  infants  and  children exhibit hypoxemia (by pulse oximetry) with interruption in oxygen supply. In addition, the high compliance of both lung parenchyma and chest wall in newborns and infants predisposes to alveolar collapse with resultant ˙ 7/7 mismatching and hypoxemia. Recall also that the ˙ 7 o 2 noted in Table 27-2 is resting consumption. ˙ 7 o 2 increases 15% for every 1° C rise in body temperature and also increases dramatically with anxiety and/or struggling as may occur during a di ffi cult inhalation induction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  adaptations  occur  at  birth  with  respect  to  the cardiovascular  system. Th e  lungs  take  over  the  role  of  gas exchange  from  the  placenta.  Pulmonary  vascular  resistance gradually  decreases  over  the fi rst  several  months  of  life  but remains reactive and can increase dramatically under conditions  of  acidosis,  hypoxemia,  and  hypercarbia. Th e  foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus can reopen under these circumstances, and the circulation can revert to fetal patterns with signi fi cantly decreased pulmonary blood fl ow and profound

<!-- PAGE=? -->
586

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypoxemia.  Anatomic  closure  of  the  foramen  ovale  occurs between 3 months and 1 year of age, although 20% to 30% of  adults  have  probe-patent  foramen  ovale.  Functional  closure of the ductus arteriosus normally occurs 10 to 15 hours a ft er birth, with anatomic closure taking place in 4 to 6 weeks. Constriction of the ductus arteriosus occurs in response to the increased arterial oxygenation that develops a ft er birth. Nevertheless, the ductus arteriosus may reopen during periods of arterial hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart rate is the main determinant of cardiac output and systemic blood pressure in neonates and young infants. Contractility of the myocardium is lower in neonates than in older children and adults because of a relative decrease in contractile elements. Stroke volume is also relatively fi xed due to a paucity of elastic elements. Th e Frank-Starling mechanism is not operational under most circumstances. Because of this, increase in cardiac output in the newborn is dependent on increases in heart rate for the most part. At very high heart rates, however, cardiac output will decrease because of reduced diastolic fi lling times. An approximation of stroke volume for the newborn and children is 1 mL/kg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FLUIDS AND RENAL SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Total  body  water  content  and  extracellular fl uid  (ECF)  volume  are  increased  proportionately  in  neonates. Th e  ECF volume  is  equivalent  to  approximately  40%  of  body  weight in neonates compared with approximately 20% in adults. By 18 to 24 months of age, the proportion of ECF volume relative  to  body  weight  is  similar  to  that  in  adults.  In  addition to fl uid replacement (usually with Ringer's lactate or normal saline), newborns and young infants may also require glucose supplementation. Th e  maintenance  glucose  requirement  for newborns is 6 to 8 mg/kg/min. Term newborns are capable of  maintaining  normoglycemia  for  up  to  10  hours  with  no exogenous glucose administration. However, since the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia such as jitteriness, lethargy, and poor tone are masked by general anesthesia, most practitioners supply some of the required glucose to infants while they are anesthetized. Five percent dextrose in normal saline at  maintenance  (Table  27-3)  will  supply  approximately  50% of the requirement. In surgical procedures of any signi fi cant length, glucose measurements should be used to guide the rate of administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative fl uid  administration  for  pediatric  patients can be divided into several components:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Replacement of fl uid de fi cits from fasting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Maintenance fl uid requirement

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Replacement of blood loss

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Replacement of evaporative losses

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid  maintenance  and  replacement  of  de fi cits  are  based on  the  Holliday  and  Segar  formula  for  caloric  expenditure of  children  of  di ff erent  sizes.  Caloric  expenditure  based  on weight and water requirement is approximately 1 mL per kcal expended per day. Th is is the basis for the 4:2:1 rule used by anesthesiologists (see Table 27-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 27-3 ■ Holliday-Segar formula for caloric expenditure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
*Fluid maintenance rates are additive. For example, a 25-kg child requires 4 mL/kg/hr for the first 10 kg (40 mL/hr) plus 2 mL/kg/hr for the second 10 kg (20 mL/hr) plus 1 mL/kg/hr for each additional kg above 20 kg (5 mL/hr), for a total of 65 mL/hr (40 + 20 + 5) for the hourly fluid maintenance rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood  loss  is  generally  replaced  3:1  for  each  milliliter  of blood  loss  with  isotonic  crystalloid,  and  replenishment  for evaporative loss is guided by estimations based on type of procedure and associated area of surgical exposure (Table 27-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e glomerular fi ltration rate is greatly decreased in term newborns but increases nearly fourfold by 3 to 5 weeks. Preterm newborns may show delayed increases in glomerular fi ltration rate. Newborns are obligate sodium losers and cannot concentrate urine as e ff ectively as adults. Th erefore, adequate exogenous  sodium  and  water  must  be  provided  during  the perioperative  period.  Conversely,  newborns  excrete  volume loads  more  slowly  than  adults  and  are  therefore  more  susceptible to fl uid overload. Decreased renal function can also delay  excretion  of  drugs  dependent  on  renal  clearance  for elimination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEPATIC SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At term, the liver actually has signi fi cant glycogen stores that can be converted to glucose for use by the neonate. Th e newborn's glycogen stores, on a per-kilogram basis, are at least equal to the stores in most adults. Details regarding administration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of intravenous glucose have already been discussed in the previous section on fl uids and renal physiology. Hepatic capacity for biotransformation and metabolism of drugs, however, is  diminished  until  several  months  of  postnatal  life.  Even though vitamin  K-dependent and other coagulation  factors are at approximately 50% of adult levels, signi fi cant bleeding is uncommon in newborns who have adequate vitamin K levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMATOLOGIC SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hematologic  system  undergoes  signi fi cant  changes  a ft er birth. In fetal life, fetal hemoglobin (Hb) has a lower P 50 (partial pressure of oxygen at which Hb is 50% saturated), which is adaptive and allows the fetus to extract oxygen from maternal Hb. In the fi rst 2 months of life, as fetal Hb is replaced by adult Hb, the P 50 increases from 19 mm Hg to 22 mm Hg and then eventually to the typical adult level of 26 mm Hg. Not only does the Hb type change (fetal to adult), but the Hb concentration changes as well. Physiologic anemia occurs between 2 and 3 months of age. Th is decrease in Hb concentration is a result of  several  physiologic  changes.  Because  of  rapid  postnatal growth, shortened neonatal red blood cell (RBC) survival (70 to 90 days compared with the adult RBC life span of 120 days), and transient cessation of erythropoiesis (decreased erythropoietin release upon exposure to higher arterial oxygen content), there is a progressive decrease in RBC mass and Hb level. Th e nadir is typically seen between the eighth and tenth weeks of life. In view of the decreased cardiovascular reserve of neonates and the le ft ward shi ft of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, it may be useful to maintain the neonate's hematocrit closer to 40% than 30%, as is o ft en accepted for older children. Typical blood cell values are delineated in Table 27-5.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether or not routine preoperative Hb determination is needed is controversial. Routine preoperative Hb measurement in children younger than 1 year of age results in the detection of only a small number of patients with Hb concentrations of less than 10 g/dL, which rarely in fl uences management of anesthesia  or  delays  planned  surgery.  However,  preoperative  Hb measurement may be prudent in young infants coming for surgery at a time coincident with the typical period of physiologic anemia. Based on the estimated blood volume (Table 27-6), calculation of the maximal allowable blood loss is useful to guide intraoperative blood replacement (Table 27-7).

Pharmacology

Pharmacologic  responses  to  drugs  may  di ff er  in  pediatric patients  and  adults. Th ese  manifest  as  di ff erences  in  anesthetic requirements, responses to muscle relaxants, and pharmacokinetics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHETIC REQUIREMENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Full-term neonates require lower concentrations  of  volatile anesthetics  than  do  infants  1  to  6  months  of  age.  Furthermore,  minimal  alveolar  concentration  (MAC)  in  preterm neonates  decreases  with  decreasing  gestational  age.  Lowered  anesthetic  requirements  in  neonates  may  be  related to  immaturity of the central nervous system (CNS) and to increased  circulating  concentrations  of  progesterone  and β -endorphins. MAC steadily increases until 2 to 3 months of age, but a ft er 3 months, the MAC steadily declines with age, although there are slight increases at puberty.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sevo fl urane  is  unique  among  the  currently  used  volatile  anesthetics. Th e  MAC  of  sevo fl urane  in  neonates  and infants younger than 6 months (3.2%) and in infants older than 6 months and children up to 12 years (2.5%) remains constant. Th e reason that the MAC of sevo fl urane does not decline with advancing age in childhood, as is seen with the other volatile anesthetics, is unclear.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Morphologic and functional maturation of the neuromuscular junctions are not complete until approximately 2 months of age, but the implications of this initial immaturity on the pharmacodynamics of muscle relaxants are not clear. Because

<!-- PAGE=? -->
588

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of  immature  muscle  composition,  the  infant's  diaphragm is  paralyzed  at  the  same  time  as  the  peripheral  muscles  (as opposed to later, as in adults). Th is has led to the suggestion that infants may be more sensitive to the e ff ects of nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants,  but  the  relatively  large  volume  of distribution requires induction doses that are similar on a perkilogram basis to those for adults. Duration of action may be prolonged because of immature hepatic and renal drug handling and excretion. Antagonism of neuromuscular blockade is generally una ff ected in infants, and requirements for anticholinergics  may  be  decreased  because  of  longer  clearance times than in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonates  and  infants  require  more  succinylcholine  on  a per-kilogram basis than do older children to produce similar degrees of neuromuscular blockade because of the increased ECF volume and larger volume distribution characteristic of this  age  group.  Most  practitioners  limit  the  use  of  succinylcholine  to  cases  requiring  rapid-sequence  induction  and  to the treatment of laryngospasm because of the risks of severe bradycardia and potential malignant hyperthermia and other associated adverse e ff ects (rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia) in children (especially those younger than age 5) with undiagnosed myopathies and dystrophinopathies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOKINETICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacokinetics  di ff ers  in  neonates  and  infants  compared with adults. For example, uptake of inhaled anesthetics is more rapid in infants than in older children or adults because of the infant's high alveolar ventilation relative to functional residual capacity. More rapid uptake may unmask negative inotropic e ff ects  of  volatile  anesthetics,  resulting  in  an  increased  incidence of hypotension in neonates and infants upon inhalation induction of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An immature blood-brain barrier and decreased ability to metabolize drugs could increase the sensitivity of neonates to the  e ff ects  of  hypnotics.  As  a  result,  neonates  might  require lower doses of intravenous agents for induction of anesthesia. On the other hand, older children and adolescents generally require  a  higher  dose  of  intravenous  induction  agents  than adults (up to 3 mg/kg of propofol in children and teenagers compared with 1.5 to 2 mg/kg in adults).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased hepatic and renal clearance of drugs, which is characteristic of neonates, can produce prolonged drug e ff ects. Clearance rates increase to adult levels by 5 to 6 months of age and during early childhood may even exceed adult rates. Protein binding of many drugs is decreased in infants, which can result in high circulating concentrations of unbound and pharmacologically active drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pediatric Cardiac Arrest during Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority  of  children  tolerate  general  anesthesia  without incident. However, cardiac arrests do occur during anesthesia  in  children,  although  data  are  incomplete  regarding  the precise incidence. Many of these cardiac arrests are not due to poor or inadequate anesthetic care but rather result from either the critical health condition of the patient or complications  of  the  surgical  procedure.  Data  on  the  incidence  of anesthesia-related  cardiac  arrest  are  not  available  for  neonates as a separate group. Th e incidence of anesthesia-related cardiac arrest reported in infants is  15  in  10,000 anesthetics, with a range of 9.2 to 19 in 10,000. Overall, children experience anesthesia-related cardiac arrest at a rate of 3.3 in 10,000 anesthetics with a range of 0 to 4.3 in 10,000. Th e incidence of anesthesia-related cardiac arrest reported for all pediatric age groups is 1.8 in 10,000.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CAUSES OF CARDIAC ARREST

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e causes of cardiac arrest in children gathered from the Pediatric Perioperative Cardiac Arrest Registry are summarized in Table 27-8. One hundred and fift y cases of anesthesia-related cardiac  arrest  from  1994  to  1997  were  analyzed.  More  than 50% of arrests occurred among infants. Medications accounted for 37% of all arrests. Th e most common   medication-related cause  was  cardiovascular  depression  resulting  from  volatile anesthetic agents. During this reporting period, it is likely that halothane was the o ff ending agent in many of these cases. In present times, anesthetic overdose has decreased as halothane has  been  replaced  by  sevo fl urane,  and  related  cardiovascular  sequelae  (arrhythmias,  hypotension,  cardiac  arrest)  have also  decreased  accordingly.  Other  medication-related  causes included syringe swaps and succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia. In a follow-up period from 1998 to 2003, the registry analyzed data for more than 300 cases of perioperative cardiac arrest. More than half (163) were related to anesthetic causes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accidental  intravenous  injection  of  local  anesthetic  and/ or  local  anesthetic  toxicity  resulting  from  overdose  remain persistent problems. Th e promise of a signi fi cantly increased margin of safety with ropivacaine and L-bupivacaine has not been borne out. Until a local anesthetic with a much lower cardiovascular toxicity pro fi le becomes available, only meticulous care and constant vigilance in the administration of bupivacaine will lessen the incidence of its cardiotoxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  cardiac  arrest  in  the  perioperative  period depends, of course, on the cause. Initial management of a cardiac arrest that occurs in the perianesthetic period is guided by the same principles used in the management of any pediatric  cardiac  arrest.

Th e reader is referred to  the  latest  PALS  algorithm  as  published  by  the  American Heart Association (http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/). An underlying respiratory cause of cardiac arrest should always be sought.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THE PRETERM NEWBORN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Committee on Fetus and Newborn of the American Academy of Pediatrics has recently revised the classi fi cation of preterm newborns using gestational age instead of birth weight. Th is change was made because of advances in technology that allow  very  exact  determination  of  gestational  age.  Preterm morbidity also correlates better with gestational age than with birth weight. A preterm newborn is classically de fi ned as one born before 37 weeks of gestation. Table 27-9 illustrates the traditional classi fi cation of preterm newborns by weight and the  related  approximate  gestational  age.  Currently,  the  term extremely low gestational age newborn is used to refer to a newborn delivered at 23 to 27 weeks of gestation regardless of birth weight. As a group, extremely low gestational age newborns have immaturity of all organ systems and represent the most vulnerable of all pediatric patients with the highest morbidity and mortality. Terms related to the age of preterm neonates and infants are de fi ned in Table 27-10.

Although  newborns  are  categorized  by  gestational  age, weight  is  still  considered.  Newborns  are  classi fi ed  as  small, appropriate,  or  large  for  gestational  age,  based  on  normal

values  established  for  weight  at  various  gestational  stages. In general, newborns who are small for gestational age have experienced some sort of placental insu ffi ciency. Other causes for  a  newborn  to  be  small  for  gestational  age  are  congenital  infection,  maternal  chronic  disease,  and  maternal  nicotine abuse. Th ese newborns are also called growth restricted. A ff ected infants may have lower liver glycogen stores, which predisposes them to hypoglycemia, and less subcutaneous fat, which predisposes them to hypothermia. Th ey may also have polycythemia, which predisposes them to problems of hyperviscosity  such  as  necrotizing  enterocolitis  and  CNS  injury. Paradoxically, these infants, having been stressed in utero, may have advanced lung maturity compared with appropriate for gestational age newborns of the same gestational age. Large for gestational age newborns are at risk of hypoglycemia, because they have o ft en been born to diabetic mothers and have been exposed to higher levels of the growth-promoting hormone insulin in utero.

Respiratory Distress Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lack of the appropriate type of surface-active material or surfactant leads to the development of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Th e incidence is inversely proportional to the gestational age and birth weight. Mature levels of pulmonary surfactant are present in most cases by 35 weeks of gestation. Five percent of newborns with the diagnosis of RDS are born at term, however.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surfactant, produced by type II pneumocytes, helps maintain alveolar stability by reducing alveolar surface tension. Without surfactant, some alveoli collapse and others become overdistended. Functional residual capacity and residual volume are decreased, and ˙ 7/ ˙ 2 mismatching develops with resultant arterial hypoxemia and metabolic acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RDS  usually  becomes  apparent  within  minutes  of  birth. Respiratory  distress  is  evidenced  by  tachypnea,  prominent grunting,  intercostal  and  subcostal  retractions,  and  nasal fl aring.  Grunting  is  the  newborn's  e ff ort  to  keep  open  collapsing alveoli. Cyanosis and dyspnea progressively worsen. Before  surfactant  preparations  became  available,  treatment included  administering  higher  inspired  fractions  of  oxygen  and  providing  distending  airway  pressure.  If  RDS  is untreated, apnea and irregular respirations, signs of impending respiratory failure, develop. Without adequate treatment, hypotension,  hypothermia,  a  mixed  respiratory-metabolic acidosis,  edema,  ileus,  and  oliguria  may  ensue. Th e  clinical course, chest radiograph, and blood gas analysis help to establish  the  clinical  diagnosis  of  RDS. Th e  typical  radiographic appearance of the lungs is a fi ne reticular granularity of the parenchyma and air bronchograms. Blood gas fi ndings are  characterized  by  progressive  hypoxemia,  hypercarbia, and variable metabolic acidosis.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surfactant is now administered to preterm newborns, either immediately in the delivery room or later as a rescue treatment. Various types of naturally derived and synthetic preparations  are  used.  Surfactant  increases  lung  compliance  and stabilizes the alveoli at end exhalation. Surfactant administration  decreases  the  need  for  high  concentrations  of  inspired oxygen,  ventilatory  support,  and  high  ventilatory  pressures. Unfortunately,  it  has  not  decreased  the  incidence  of  subsequent chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In  addition  to  administration  of  surfactant,  newborns  with RDS are being treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in the delivery room in an e ff ort to minimize the loss of lung volume and obviate the need for both surfactant and endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. If CPAP therapy fails, the newborn is intubated and surfactant administered.  In  centers  that  successfully  employ  this  technique, surfactant use is decreased, but the long-term e ff ect, if any, on the incidence of chronic lung disease is yet unknown.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  anesthesia,  the  arterial  oxygen  saturation  should  be maintained near its preoperative levels. Placement of an arterial catheter (ideally in a preductal artery) is useful to monitor oxygenation, avoid hyperoxia (because these are preterm neonates predisposed to developing retinal damage), and prevent respiratory and metabolic acidosis during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Some patients may arrive with an in-situ umbilical artery catheter, which generally su ffi ces for monitoring  purposes  for  brief  procedures.  Pneumothorax from  barotrauma  is  an  ever-present  danger  and  should  be considered  if  there  is  sudden  cardiorespiratory  decompensation.  Maintaining  the  patient's  hematocrit  near  40%  helps to  optimize  systemic  oxygen  delivery.  Excessive  hydration should be avoided; therefore, smaller total volumes of colloids such as 5% albumin (in 10 to 20 mL/kg increments) should be used over crystalloids in case of hypovolemia. Postoperative mechanical ventilation is needed in most cases, but when extubation is possible, the patient must be monitored closely for postoperative respiratory distress and apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a form of chronic lung disease  of  infancy.  As  already  mentioned,  the  incidence  of chronic lung disease in children who were born preterm has not decreased despite the widespread use of surfactant in the treatment of neonatal RDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pathogenesis  of  BPD  is  complex  and  remains  poorly understood.  Nonetheless,  the  cause  is  likely  multifactorial involving insults sustained in both prenatal and postnatal life with resultant arrest of normal lung (alveolar) development.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e clinical entity of BPD is di ff erent in newborns treated with  surfactant,  however. Th e  lung  damage,  as  opposed  to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
being variable as was the case in the presurfactant era, is more uniform throughout. Airway injury and hyperreactivity with smooth  muscle  hyperplasia,  alternating  areas  of  overin fl ation, fi brosis, and atelectasis, seen in the presurfactant era, are not present in patients with the so-called new BPD. Although they may not exhibit the same degree of respiratory distress as infants with classic BPD, these patients still do have decreased compliance,  impaired  gas  exchange,  and  increased  oxygen consumption caused by increased work of breathing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preterm  infants  likely  to  develop  BPD  are  born  during the canalicular phase of lung development at 24 to 26 weeks. Despite the di ff erent clinical and radiographic picture of new BPD, this condition is thought to have causes similar to those of the classic form, including the use of mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen that initiates  a  cascade  of  cellular damage and in fl ammation. Other factors that may play a role in the development of BPD are listed in Table 27-11.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BPD is a clinical diagnosis de fi ned as oxygen dependence at 36 weeks' postconceptual age or oxygen requirement (to maintain Pa o 2 > 50 mm Hg) beyond 28 days of life in infants with birth weights of less than 1500 g. Th e radiographic appearance of the lungs gradually changes from a picture of almost complete opaci fi cation with air bronchograms and interstitial emphysema to one of small, round, radiolucent areas alternating with areas  of  irregular  density  resembling  a  sponge.  Pulmonary dysfunction in patients with BPD is most marked during the fi rst year of life. Infants with mild BPD may eventually become asymptomatic, but airway hyperreactivity may persist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of adequate oxygenation (with Pa o 2 > 55 mm Hg and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry > 94%) is necessary to prevent or treat cor pulmonale and to promote growth of lung tissue and remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed. Reactive airway  bronchoconstriction  is  treated  with  bronchodilating

agents. Diuretic administration is o ft en needed for treatment of interstitial fl uid retention and pulmonary edema to improve gas exchange.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  assessment  of  the  child  with  BPD  should focus  on  any  recent  respiratory  decompensation  and  need for  intervention.  Ongoing  drug  therapy  (bronchodilators, diuretics)  as  well  as  baseline  oxygen  saturation  measurements provide valuable clues to the severity of BPD and the child's clinical stability. Th e choice of drugs for anesthesia is not as important as management of the airway. In children with  a  history  of  mechanical  ventilation,  an  endotracheal tube one to one half size smaller than that predicted for age should be used because subglottic stenosis may be present. Tracheomalacia  and  bronchomalacia  may  also  present  as sequelae  of  previous  prolonged  intubation.  Airway  hyperreactivity is likely; thus, a deep plane of anesthesia must be established before airway instrumentation. Indeed, children who have or have had BPD can be assumed to have reactive airway disease and should be treated similarly to those with asthma. O ft en, increased peak inspiratory pressures are required,  which  re fl ects  decreased  pulmonary  compliance. Adequate  oxygen  should  be  delivered  to  maintain  a  Pa o 2 of 50 to 70 mm Hg. Patients with metabolic alkalosis from furosemide therapy may exhibit a compensatory retention of carbon dioxide. Fluid should be administered judiciously to avoid pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngomalacia and Bronchomalacia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngomalacia  is  a  congenital  or  acquired  condition  of excessive fl accidity of the laryngeal structures, especially the epiglottis and arytenoids. It can be caused by the lack of neural  control  of  laryngeal  muscles  or  result  from  pressure  on the  laryngeal  cartilage,  which  leads  to  inadequate  laryngeal rigidity  and  thus  structural  collapse  during  inspiration  and exhalation.  Laryngomalacia  accounts  for  more  than  70%  of persistent stridor in neonates and young infants. A congenital cause is found in 85% of cases of stridor in children who come to medical attention before the third birthday. A ft er laryngomalacia, which accounts for the majority of cases, congenital vocal cord paralysis is the most common cause and is seen in approximately 10% of infants with congenital stridor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchomalacia  is  seen  in  infants  who  have  had  a  prolonged stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NCU). Risk factors include long periods of mechanical ventilation, poor nutrition, intercurrent infections, and other impediments to normal growth and development. Th e cartilage of the major airways  is  weakened,  and  when  a ff ected  infants  bear  down, these airways can become partially or completely compressed. Infants  with  bronchomalacia  generally  also  have  a  component of BPD. Th ese two conditions together lead to signi fi cant respiratory di ffi culties. When the infant breathes more forcefully, the higher negative inspiratory forces cause further collapse of the airways a ff ected with bronchomalacia, which leads to worsening respiratory distress. Any mild viral respiratory infection may worsen the situation to the point that hospitalization  will  be  needed.  With  time  and  good  nutrition,  both bronchomalacia and laryngomalacia usually resolve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinopathy of Prematurity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinopathy  of  prematurity  (ROP),  formerly  known  as retrolental fi broplasia, is  a  vasoproliferative retinopathy of multifactorial etiology that occurs almost exclusively in preterm infants in whom retinal vasculogenesis is incomplete. It is the second  leading  cause  of  childhood  blindness  in  the  United States. Th e  risk  of  retinopathy  is  inversely  related  to  birth weight and gestational age. ROP occurs in up to 70% of newborns who weigh less than 1000 g at birth, but fortunately in many  of  these  cases  the  condition  regresses  spontaneously. Th e fi rst  few  weeks of life seem to be the period of greatest vulnerability to the development of ROP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most cited cause of ROP is exposure to elevated tension of oxygen with resultant injury to the developing retinal capillaries. Th e development of ROP is roughly divided into two phases.  In  phase  1,  oxygen  toxicity  to  the  immature  retina causes  an  arrest  of  normal  vascularization.  In  phase  2,  the increased metabolic demand of the growing retina is met with relative hypoxia caused by the paucity of blood vessels. Because of this, the retina undergoes reactive abnormal neovascularization that extends into the vitreous humor. Retinal and vitreal fi brous  tissue  formation  also  ensues.  Retinal  vasculogenesis normally begins at the sixteenth week of gestation and is complete by 44 weeks, a ft er which time the risk of ROP is negligible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ROP is classi fi ed into fi ve stages of disease severity. In stage 1, the mildest form, there is simply a more clear demarcation between vascular and avascular portions of the retina. In the most  severe  form,  stage  5,  there  is  total  detachment  of  the retina.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e risk factors associated with ROP are not fully known. Hyperoxia is a major risk factor. However, oxygen alone is not su ffi cient to produce ROP, because cases have been reported to occur even in the absence of oxygen therapy. Concentration,  duration,  timing,  and fl uctuation  of  oxygen  delivery may all play a role in the development of ROP. Th e one risk factor  that  outweighs  all  others  is  prematurity.  Other  identi fi ed  risk  factors  for  ROP  are  sepsis,  congenital  infections, congenital heart disease, mechanical ventilation, RDS, blood transfusions,  intra  ventricular  hemorrhage,  hypoxia,  hypercapnia and hypocapnia, asphyxia, and vitamin E de fi ciency. Approximately  80%  to  90%  of  mild  cases  of  ROP  undergo spontaneous regression with little or no residual visual disability. However, infants who develop ROP are at higher risk of experiencing ophthalmologic problems later in life, including  retinal  tears,  retinal  detachment,  myopia,  strabismus, amblyopia, and glaucoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary treatments for ROP include transscleral cryotherapy and laser photocoagulation. Th e goal is to destroy the peripheral avascular areas of the retina, which slows or even reverses the  abnormal  vasculogenesis  and  thus  reduces  the  risk  of retinal detachment. However, in those with severe ROP, laser treatment reduces the risks of retinal detachment and blindness by only approximately 25%. Central vision is preserved at  the  expense  of  some  peripheral  vision.  Surgical  options aimed  at  relieving  cicatrix-induced  traction  on  the  retina allow the retina to relax and reattach and may be considered in cases that do not respond to laser therapy or cryotherapy. A scleral buckle procedure may be performed on infants if a shallow retinal detachment develops as a result of traction from fi brovascular scar tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  oxygen  toxicity  is  recognized  as  a  major  risk  factor for  the  development  of  ROP,  the  anesthesiologist  is  o ft en faced  with  the  challenge  of  limiting  supplemental  oxygen while  maximizing  oxygen  delivery  in  this  group  of  vulnerable  patients. Th e  bene fi t  of  low  oxygen  saturation  for ROP is o ft en at odds with the potential ill e ff ects of hypoxemia  on  other  immature  organ  systems  such  as  the  CNS. Currently,  there  are  no  established  guidelines  for  speci fi c intraoperative  oxygen  saturation  goals  for  preterm  infants undergoing  surgery. Th ere  is  also  no  published  evidence to indicate that high oxygen saturation increases ROP risk a ft er 32 weeks' postconceptual age. However, use of supplemental oxygen likely  has  di ff erent  implications  depending on the infant's postconceptual age because it correlates with di ff erent  phases  of  ROP  as  described  previously.  In  phase 1,  high  oxygen saturation is likely to promote cessation of normal vasculogenesis and thus will increase the risk of and worsen ROP. In the second phase, however, in which abnormal neovascularization is driven by hypoxia, a higher oxygen saturation may be preferred. Several multicenter studies (Bene fi ts of Oxygen Saturation Targeting [BOOST], Supplemental Th erapeutic  Oxygen  for  Prethreshold  Retinopathy of  Prematurity  [STOP-ROP])  showed  that  higher  oxygen saturation (between 96% and 99%) did not worsen preexisting ROP and was associated with a nonsigni fi cant reduction in disease severity. It must be recognized that these studies included mostly infants who were well into the second phase of  ROP, in which higher oxygen saturation may be potentially protective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because the optimal intraoperative oxygen saturation for these patients is yet to be determined, it remains prudent to limit  oxygen  supplementation  to  preterm  infants  without  a diagnosis  of  ROP ,  especially  to  those  of  less  than  32  weeks' postconceptual age. Th is  must be balanced with the need to maintain hemodynamic stability and neurologic function, and thus oxygen should not be withheld in these circumstances. Although it is desirable to avoid hyperoxia, arterial hypoxemia can be life threatening and more deleterious. Infants undergoing peripheral retinal ablation have an increased incidence of apnea and bradycardia, both during the procedure and in the following 1 to 3 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Apnea of Prematurity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Just  as  RDS is a result of immaturity of the pulmonary system, apnea of prematurity (AOP) is a result of immaturity of the respiratory control centers in the newborn brainstem. Th e severity of AOP is inversely proportional to the gestational age of the newborn at birth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected newborns exhibit both primary (or central) apnea, in which there is simply lack of e ff ort to breathe in the absence of  any  obstruction,  and  obstructive  apnea.  In  obstructive apnea of the preterm newborn, there is immaturity of both the mechanisms that maintain airway patency and the mechanisms that detect physiologic sequelae of obstruction (hypercarbia,  hypoxemia)  to  bring  about  arousal  and  correct  the obstruction. Mixed episodes of central and obstructive apnea are  also  seen. Th e  carbon  dioxide  response  of  infants  with AOP has been measured and is decreased compared with that of infants without AOP. AOP is diagnosed on clinical grounds and the criteria are somewhat variable. Th e diagnosis is made if  an  infant  exhibits  apnea  of  longer  than  15  to  20  seconds, apnea associated with a heart rate of less than 80 to 100 beats per minute, or apnea associated with signi fi cant decreases in oxygen saturation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of AOP is begun once other causes of apnea such as infection or CNS disorder have been eliminated. Some cases of AOP are associated with lowered hematocrit levels and resolve a ft er  transfusion  with  packed  red  cells.  Other  nonpharmacologic treatments include nasal CPAP therapy and, in very severe cases, mechanical ventilation. Methylxanthines are the mainstay of drug therapy for AOP. Th ese  central  stimulants actually  increase  the  sensitivity  of  the  respiratory  centers  to carbon dioxide. Various forms of methylxanthines are used, including aminophylline, ca ff eine, and ca ff eine citrate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postanesthetic Apnea

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postanesthetic apnea has many similarities with AOP . Preterm newborns who are at risk for AOP based on their corrected postconceptual age are also at increased risk for  developing postanesthetic apnea. Postanesthetic apnea is seen mostly in infants born preterm (where preterm birth is de fi ned as birth at <37 weeks of gestation). Th e incidence is inversely related to postconceptual age. One of the most signi fi cant risk factors is a hematocrit of less than 30%. Infants who were small for gestational age but were born at term do not have an increased risk of postanesthetic apnea. In general, it is prudent to keep infants whose postconceptual age is less than 52 to 60 weeks for overnight observation because of the risk of this complication. Use of regional anesthesia, without the addition of any

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
systemic sedatives and opioids, appears to decrease the incidence of postanesthetic apnea in infants at risk, but the data are  insu ffi cient  to  recommend  against  overnight  admission and apnea monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoglycemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem occurring  in  newborn  infants.  Inadequate  glycogen  stores  and de fi cient gluconeogenesis are important risk factors. Th e incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia is highest in those born small for gestational age. Infants may be at risk of hypoglycemia as a result of maternal factors or intrinsic neonatal problems such as those related to prematurity and endocrine or metabolic dysfunctions (Table 27-12).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e absolute serum glucose concentration or duration of hypoglycemia that causes CNS injury in neonates in not known with certainty. Serum glucose levels are rarely less than 35 to 40 mg/ dL in the fi rst 24 hours of life or less than 45 mg/dL therea ft er. CNS or systemic signs of hypoglycemia such as jitteriness, seizures,  apnea,  lethargy,  or  mottling  and  pallor  will  usually  be observed when serum glucose concentrations decrease to less than 30 to 40 mg/dL in term infants during the fi rst 72 hours and to less than 40 mg/dL therea ft er. It may be prudent to keep serum glucose concentrations above 40 mg/dL in all newborns.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many neonates whose serum glucose levels  are  at  or  just below the lower limits of the normal range are asymptomatic. Th e clinical manifestations of mild hypoglycemia are subtle and nonspeci fi c, and a high index of suspicion must be maintained in neonates at high risk. Hypoglycemia that persists beyond the fi rst week of life is uncommon and is most o ft en due to congenital hyperinsulinism, endocrine de fi ciency, or other disorders of carbohydrate, amino acid, and fatty acid metabolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e prognosis for a normal outcome is good in asymptomatic neonates with transient hypoglycemia. Th e prognosis for subsequent normal intellectual development is more guarded in symptomatic infants, particularly low-birth-weight infants, those  with  persistent  hyperinsulinemic  hypoglycemia,  and infants of diabetic mothers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infants with symptoms other than seizures should receive an intravenous bolus of 2 mL/kg (200 mg/kg) of 10% dextrose. If the infant is experiencing convulsions, an intravenous bolus of  4  mL/kg  of  10%  dextrose  is  indicated.  Following  bolus administration, a 10% dextrose infusion should be given at 8 mg/kg/min and titrated to maintain the serum glucose level above 40 to 50 mg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  neonates  who  are  less  than  48  hours  old,  premature,  or small for gestational age, and in those born to diabetic mothers,  the  risk  of  intraoperative  hypoglycemia  is  signi fi cant. As  in  adults,  signs  and  symptoms  of  hypoglycemia  may  be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
masked by anesthetic drugs. For this reason, preemptive glucose monitoring is essential in at-risk neonates. Maintenance fl uid  requirements  may  be  met  with  a  glucose-containing solution of 5% dextrose in 0.2 normal saline 4 mL/kg/hr or 10% dextrose in water 2  to  3  mL/kg/hr  to  prevent  intraoperative hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia (plasma glucose level ≥ 150  mg/dL)  may  occur  in  stressed  neonates  receiving  infusions of glucose-containing solutions intraoperatively or those already receiving parenteral nutrition. Th us, fl uid de fi cits,  blood, and third-space losses should be replaced using   dextrose-free solutions. Serum glucose concentrations in excess of 125 mg/ dL can result in osmotic diuresis from glucosuria with subsequent dehydration as well as further release of insulin leading to  rebound  hypoglycemia.  In  addition,  a  hyperosmolar  state in neonates, especially premature very-low-birth-weight neonates, increases the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonates  at  particular  risk  of  hypocalcemia  are  those  born prematurely  or  with  low  birth  weight,  particularly  infants

with intrauterine growth retardation, infants of mothers with insulin-dependent  diabetes,  and  infants  with  birth  asphyxia associated  with  prolonged,  di ffi cult  deliveries.  Late  neonatal hypocalcemia occurring 5 to 10 days a ft er birth is usually due to ingestion of cow's milk, which contains high levels of phosphorus.  It  is  not  seen  in  breast-fed  infants,  because  human breast milk has a lower phosphate content.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypocalcemia  occurs  in  newborns  for  a  variety  of  reasons, and in many cases, ionized calcium is decreased even as total  calcium  remains within normal limits. Risk factors for neonatal  hypocalcemia  include  maternal  factors  and  factors intrinsic to the newborn. Examples of maternal factors are use of  medications  such  as  anticonvulsants  or  calcium  antacids, and  vitamin  D  de fi ciency.  Factors  intrinsic  to  the  newborn include  parathyroid  hormone  abnormalities,  malabsorption, hypomagnesemia, inadequate intake, and inadequate calcium replenishment  a ft er  transfusion  of  citrated  blood  products. Other notable causes of hypocalcemia in the newborn include maternal hypercalcemia and DiGeorge's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  manifestations  of  hypocalcemia  include  irritability,  jitteriness,  seizures,  and  lethargy. Th e  classic  signs  of hypocalcemic tetany are  seen  only  rarely.  Under  anesthesia, hypocalcemia manifests as hypotension and depressed cardiac performance. Newborns have little stored calcium within the sarcolemma. Extracellular calcium is a much more important determinant of myocardial contractility than it is in older children and adults. Treatment with intravenous calcium should be considered for newborns who have hypotension without an obvious cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e laboratory de fi nition of hypocalcemia varies depending on the speci fi c range of normal values at each institution. Regardless, it is important to evaluate both total and ionized calcium levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of hypocalcemia involves correction of hypocalcemia as well as hypomagnesemia and any other metabolic or acid-base abnormalities. An intravenous infusion of calcium is the most e ff ective means to correct symptomatic hypocalcemia in the neonatal ICU and the operating room. Th e dose used to correct hypocalcemia should be based on the amount of elemental calcium administered. Th e starting dose is 10 to 20 mg/kg of elemental calcium. Calcium gluconate 10% provides  9  mg/mL  of  elemental  calcium  and  calcium  chloride provides 27.2 mg/mL of elemental calcium. Th ese doses have been shown to increase ionized calcium levels, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cases of bradycardia and even asystole have been seen with rapid intravenous administration of calcium. Intravenous calcium should be given over 5 to 10 minutes with electrocardiographic monitoring. Extravasation of calcium from a faulty peripheral intravenous catheter can have severe consequences such as tissue sloughing and necrosis. If calcium is given via an umbilical venous line, the tip should be con fi rmed to be in  the  inferior  vena  cava  and  not  too  near  the  right  atrium; administration of calcium too close to the heart can result in arrhythmias.  Calcium  in  intravenous  preparations  will  precipitate with solutions containing bicarbonate or phosphorus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative metabolic derangements such as alkalosis from hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate administration can lead to hypocalcemia by causing albumin binding of calcium that  decreases  ionized  calcium  concentration.  Hypocalcemia can also occur during infusions of albumin and citrated blood products resulting from calcium chelation. Hypotensive e ff ects of citrate-induced hypocalcemia can be minimized by administering calcium gluconate (1 to 2 mg IV) for each milliliter of blood transfused.

SURGICAL DISEASES OF THE NEWBORN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a defect in the diaphragm that is associated with a variable amount of intraabdominal  organ  extrusion  into  the  thoracic  cavity.  It  has  an incidence between 1 in 2500 and 1 in 3000 live births. CDH may be an isolated lesion, or it may be associated with other anomalies or syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, CHARGE association ( c oloboma, h eart defects, a tresia of the choanae, r etardation, g enital anomalies, and e ar anomalies), and various chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 21 or 18.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CDH is an early gestational event with incomplete closure of the diaphragm. Th is defect is usually associated with bilateral pulmonary  hypoplasia  resulting  from  in  utero  compression of  the  developing lungs by the herniated viscera, pulmonary hypertension,  and  increased  airway  reactivity.  In  addition to the e ff ects of lung compression, there may be an underlying  primary  abnormality  in  airway  branching  that  results  in pulmonary  hypoplasia. Th e  most  common  and  largest  diaphragmatic defect occurs through the le ft posterolateral pleuroperitoneal  canal  (foramen  of  Bochdalek)  and  accounts  for 75% of all cases. Th e remainder of defects occur at the right posterolateral foramen of Bochdalek, at the anterior foramen of Morgagni, and in paraesophageal locations.

Prenatal diagnosis of CDH has increased from approximately 10% of cases in 1985 to nearly 60% in present day. Th e most common fi ndings include displacement of the heart and fl uidfi lled gastrointestinal segments into the thorax. Both stomach and small bowel are o ft en present. Ultrasonographic fi ndings that  suggest  a  poorer  prognosis  include  a  dilated  intrathoracic stomach or the presence of the le ft lobe of the liver in the chest. However, prenatal ultrasonography can generate a high number of false negatives. Postnatal lung volume is of some

prognostic signi fi cance and can be estimated from the prenatal ultrasonographic fi ndings. At birth, a newborn with CDH will  exhibit  cyanosis,  dyspnea,  and  apparent  dextrocardia. Physical fi ndings  will  include  decreased  breath  sounds,  distant or right-displaced heart sounds, and bowel sounds in the chest. Because of a reduction in the intraabdominal visceral content, the newborn will have a scaphoid abdomen. A chest radiograph typically shows a bowel gas pattern (and perhaps part of the liver) in the chest and a mediastinal shi ft .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese infants can have profound hypoxemia, which re fl ects right-to-le ft shunting through the ductus arteriosus; the cause is  persistent  fetal  circulation  resulting  from  lung  parenchymal and vascular hypoplasia with resultant high pulmonary vascular  resistance.  A  vicious  cycle  is  set  in  place  in  which the already elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is further exacerbated  by  the  severe  arterial  hypoxemia,  hypercarbia, and acidosis. Th e ductus arteriosus remains patent and fetal circulation patterns persist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Care of a newborn with a severe CDH starts immediately in the delivery room. If spontaneous respiratory e ff orts are inadequate,  endotracheal  intubation  with  institution  of  gentle ventilatory  support  and  decompression  of  the  stomach  are undertaken. Th ese interventions may prevent further distention of the gastrointestinal tract and further pulmonary compression by the displaced abdominal contents. In contrast to earlier  approaches,  which  considered  CHD  a  surgical  emergency, current management is aimed at medically stabilizing the cardiorespiratory status of the newborn as well as possible (correcting hypoxia and acidosis, and achieving cardiovascular stability) before surgical repair.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e speci fi c timing of surgery is not as important as stabilization of the neonate's condition. Speci fi c goals of preoperative medical management include achievement of a preductal oxygen saturation of at least 90% and correction of metabolic acidosis.  Crystalloid fl uid  and  blood  products  are  administered to maintain intravascular volume and RBC mass. Adequate sedation is achieved in an e ff ort to minimize increases in  pulmonary vascular resistance.  Dopamine and milrinone may  be  needed  to  maintain  hemodynamic  stability.  When mechanical ventilation is used in the preoperative period, the settings  should  be  as  low  as  possible  to  allow  for  moderate permissive hypercarbia to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. Surgery should be delayed for as long as 5 to 15 days until pulmonary vascular resistance has decreased and ventilation can be maintained with low peak inspiratory pressures and fraction of inspired oxygen (F io 2 ).  If  pulmonary hypertension persists or recurs, then trials of inhaled nitric oxide and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) are initiated. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is also considered. Th ese maneuvers have been variably e ff ective in reversing  pulmonary  hypertension.  Although  inhaled  nitric oxide has been used with good success in infants with pulmonary hypertension associated with meconium aspiration or congenital heart disease, its e ffi cacy in newborns with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in the setting of CDH has not been conclusively demonstrated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For newborns with CDH who exhibit clinical deterioration, ECMO and HFOV have been used in di ff erent centers; survival rates with these two rescue modalities are nearly identical  (53% and 55%, respectively). At some centers, ECMO is used as a rescue therapy for infants who have persistent preductal hypoxemia in spite of inotropic and ventilatory support (including HFOV and inhaled nitric oxide). Signi fi cant risks are associated with ECMO, including bleeding at surgical or chest tube insertion sites, intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, and complications of the extracorporeal circuit, including clotting and embolism. HFOV also can lead to signi fi cant morbidity. In view of the improved survival with gentle ventilation, sedation,  and  pharmacologic  cardiovascular  support,  extraordinary maneuvers such as HFOV and ECMO have assumed a less central role in the management of infants with CDH.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If mechanical ventilation has not already been initiated, anesthetic care of neonates with CDH begins with either an awake or a rapid-sequence tracheal intubation following preoxygenation. Induction medications appropriate for rapid-sequence intubation  in  critically  ill  newborns  include  propofol  or  an opioid and succinylcholine. Th e dose of the induction agent is based on the newborn's cardiovascular condition. Atropine may  be  added  depending  on  the  infant's  clinical  status.  In addition to routine monitoring devices, two pulse oximeters (in  preductal  and  postductal  locations)  are  useful  to  monitor the degree of shunting. Placement of a preductal arterial cannula (right radial artery) is recommended for monitoring systemic  blood  pressure,  acid-base  status,  and  other  blood parameters.  Venous  access  should  be  avoided  in  the  lower extremities, because venous return may be impaired as a result of compression of the inferior vena cava following reduction of the hernia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia  can  be  induced  and  maintained  with  an  opioid, a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, and, if tolerated, low concentrations of inhaled anesthetics. Nitrous oxide should be avoided, because its di ff usion into loops of intestine present in the chest may result in distention with subsequent compression of functional lung tissue. If arterial oxygenation is satisfactory, the delivered concentration of oxygen can be diluted by adding air to the gas mixture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Repair  of  CDH  via  minimally  invasive  techniques  is becoming  more  common,  but  open  repair  is  still  the  preferred method. Infants with CDH, almost by de fi nition, have pulmonary dysfunction, and this pathophysiologic condition limits the ability of the newborn to tolerate thoracoscopy and one-lung ventilation. Th e primary advantage of thoracoscopic repair is the much smaller surgical wounds and the associated reduction in postoperative pain. However, thoracoscopic procedures tend to be lengthier and are very challenging for the anesthesiologist, since compromise of cardiorespiratory functions may be even more signi fi cant than with open repairs. For example, carbon dioxide insu ffl ation can cause overwhelming

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypercarbia  with  signi fi cant  respiratory  acidosis  requiring intermittent de fl ation to allow for ventilation. In the open surgical technique, reduction of the diaphragmatic hernia is usually accomplished through a le ft subcostal abdominal incision, although the repair can be performed through a thoracotomy incision as well. Use of the abdominal approach facilitates the correction of intestinal malrotation. Depending on the size of the defect, prosthetic material may be used to close the diaphragm. During intraoperative mechanical ventilation of the lungs, airway pressures should be monitored and maintained at less than 25 to 30 cm H 2 O to minimize the risk of barotrauma and  pneumothorax.  A  sudden  decrease  in  lung  compliance or  deterioration  of  oxygenation  or  blood  pressure  suggests a  pneumothorax. Hypothermia must be avoided. Complications associated with hypothermia include increased pulmonary vascular resistance with resultant right-to-le ft shunting and increased oxygen consumption; this may result in inadequate oxygen delivery and acidosis, which further increases pulmonary vasoconstriction and worsens arterial hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft er  the  abdominal  contents  are  returned  to  the  abdomen, an attempt to in fl ate the hypoplastic lung is not recommended, because the lung is unlikely to expand and excessive positive airway pressures may damage the contralateral lung. In addition to a hypoplastic lung, these neonates are likely to have an underdeveloped abdominal cavity; thus, a tight surgical abdominal closure causes increased intraabdominal pressure, with cephalad displacement of the diaphragm, decreased functional residual capacity, and compression of the inferior vena cava. To prevent excessively tight abdominal surgical closures in infants with large defects, it is o ft en necessary to create a ventral hernia (which can be surgically repaired later) and close the skin or to place a silastic pouch. A pulse oximeter applied to a lower extremity may forewarn of abdominal compartment syndrome and circulatory compromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In some institutions, surgery for CDH may be performed in the neonatal ICU to avoid the stresses of transport and sudden changes in ventilation parameters. If surgery is performed in the neonatal ICU without a conventional anesthesia machine and/or while the patient is undergoing unconventional modes of ventilation or ECMO, a high-dose intravenous opioid and muscle relaxant technique is chosen. If the newborn is undergoing ECMO, it is crucial to communicate the anesthetic plan to both the ECMO perfusionist and the neonatologist who will care for the patient postoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  management  of  neonates  with  CDH  presents signi fi cant challenges. Th e long-term outcome for these newborns is  ultimately  determined  by  the  degree  of  pulmonary hypoplasia. Unfortunately, there is no e ff ective treatment for pulmonary hypoplasia other than provision of adequate nutrition and oxygen supplementation to allow for remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature and growth of more lung tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilatory  support  is  minimized  to  the  extent  possible. Neonatal pressure-support ventilation with low pressures and the lowest safe F io 2 are employed. Sedation and analgesia are provided to allow the infant to tolerate intubation and ventilation. Some centers use epidural analgesia to minimize splinting and any respiratory depression from systemic opioids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the long term, infants with CDH face a number of challenges. Gastroesophageal re fl ux occurs in many infants with CDH and is more common in those with larger defects and those  with  a  synthetic  patch  repair.  Developmental  delay, behavioral problems, and hearing de fi cits, among other neurologic problems, are common in survivors of CDH. In addition, these children o ft en develop chest wall deformities and scoliosis.  Recurrence  of  hernia  can  occur  and  is  most  o ft en seen in those with large defects with a patch in place. Because survivors of CDH have undergone major invasive care in the neonatal ICU and multiple surgical interventions, structured long-term multidisciplinary follow-up care is essential.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal Atresia and Tracheoesophageal Fistula

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal atresia (EA) is the most frequent congenital anomaly of the esophagus, with an approximate incidence of 1 in 4000 neonates (Figure 27-1). More than 90% of a ff ected individuals  have  an  associated  tracheoesophageal fi stula  (TEF). Th e  most  common  form  of  EA/TEF  (type  C),  representing 90% of all cases of this anomaly, manifests as a blind upper esophageal pouch and a distal esophagus that forms a fi stula with the trachea. In this variant of EA/TEF, the fi stula is connected to the trachea on the posterior aspect near the carina.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In various series, 25% or more of infants with EA have other congenital anomalies, most o ft en the VATER association ( v ertebral defects, imperforate a nus, t racheo e sophageal fi stula, and r enal dysplasia) or VACTERL association (similar to VATER but also including c ardiac and l imb anomalies). In addition, TEF and EA are known to be common in some chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 13, 18, and 21. Approximately 20% of neonates with EA have major co-existing cardiovascular anomalies (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta), and 30% to 40% are  born  prematurely.  Survival  of  neonates  with  EA  and  no associated defects approaches 100%. Th e mortality of infants with EA/TEF varies depending on the birth weight and the presence of a cardiac anomaly. Newborns born weighing more than 1500 g with EA/TEF but without a cardiac anomaly have a survival rate of more than 95%, whereas those with a birth weight of less than 1500 g and a major cardiac anomaly have only a 50% survival rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EA should be suspected if maternal polyhydramnios is present. However, EA is usually diagnosed soon a ft er birth when an oral catheter cannot be passed into the stomach or when the neonate exhibits cyanosis, coughing, and choking during oral feedings. Plain radiographs of the chest and abdomen will reveal coiling of a nasogastric tube in the esophageal pouch and  possibly  an  airfi lled  stomach  in  the  presence  of  a  coexisting TEF. In contrast, pure EA may present as an airless,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial therapeutic measures include maintaining a patent airway and preventing aspiration of secretions. Th e infant is kept under orders to receive nothing by mouth (NPO), given intravenous fl uids, and placed in a head-up position to minimize regurgitation of gastric secretions through the fi stula. Continuous suctioning of the proximal esophageal segment prevents aspiration of pharyngeal secretions. Endotracheal intubation is  avoided,  if  possible,  because  of  the  potential  to  worsen distention of the stomach, which can lead to gastric rupture. Gastric  distention  can  be  of  su ffi cient  magnitude  to  impair ventilation and venous return, and result in cardiopulmonary arrest.  Should  life-threatening  gastric  distention  occur,  onelung ventilation may be necessary until the stomach can be decompressed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  repair  without  initial  gastrostomy  is  routine. Repair of a TEF is urgent. However, neonates with EA, particularly  those  who  are  premature,  may  exhibit  signi fi cant associated anomalies or have severe lung disease, and in these neonates,  a  thorough  evaluation  for  associated  anomalies, particularly  congenital  heart  disease,  should  be  undertaken. If the newborn's condition is considered too unstable to allow a  complete  primary  repair,  a  staged  surgical  approach  with an initial gastrostomy created under local anesthesia may be selected. De fi nitive repair of the TEF can then be delayed until the neonate's condition has improved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Awake intubation with spontaneous ventilation allows optimal positioning  of  the  endotracheal  tube  while  minimizing  the risk of ventilatory impairment associated with gastric distention resulting from positive pressure ventilation and passage of gases through the fi stula. However, awake intubation may be  di ffi cult  and  traumatic  in  a  vigorous  infant.  If  inhalation induction is chosen, the trachea can be intubated without the use of muscle relaxants and the neonate allowed to breath spontaneously. If induction by the intravenous route is chosen, care must be exercised during ventilation to minimize peak inspiratory pressure and potential gastric distention, especially in the absence of a gastrostomy. Proper placement of the tracheal tube is critical; it should be above the carina but below the TEF. It is important that the tracheal tube be above the carina, because the right lung is compressed during thoracotomy. Accidental intubation  of  the  right  main  bronchus  results  in  precipitous severe hypoxemia, especially during surgical retraction of the lung. Th e endotracheal tube can be gently advanced into the right main bronchus and then withdrawn until bilateral breath sounds are heard. Alternatively, once induction is completed, the surgeon can perform rigid bronchoscopy to clearly demonstrate the anatomy. Once the fi stula is identi fi ed, o ft en near the carina, a Fogarty catheter can be passed outside the lumen of the bronchoscope and through the fi stula into the stomach. Th e balloon of the Fogarty catheter is then in fl ated and pulled back to the stomach wall and fi xed in that location to isolate the lungs before positive pressure ventilation is begun.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selection  of  anesthetic  technique  during  surgical  correction of EA/TEF depends on the physiologic status of the neonate.  Low-dose  volatile  anesthetics  in  conjunction  with  air, oxygen, and an opiate are usually well tolerated if the neonate is  adequately  hydrated.  A  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxant can be administered a ft er the airway is secured and ventilation is deemed satisfactory. In addition to routine monitoring, placement of a catheter in a peripheral artery permits continuous monitoring of systemic blood pressure and measurement of arterial blood gas concentrations. Since pulse oximetry and end-tidal  carbon  dioxide  monitors  are  standard,  precordial stethoscopes are used less o ft en. In these cases, however, a precordial stethoscope placed in the le ft axillary area can be very helpful in detecting inadvertent right main bronchus migration  of  the  endotracheal  tube.  Ligation  of  the  TEF  and  primary esophageal anastomosis is usually performed via a right thoracotomy.  During  surgery,  lung  retraction  may  impair

<!-- PAGE=? -->
598

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ventilation and surgical manipulation of the trachea may cause airway  obstruction.  Close  communication  between  the  surgeon and anesthesiologist is mandatory. Intermittent release of lung and trachea retraction may be necessary to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Accumulation of secretions and blood may also cause airway obstruction. Frequent tracheal suctioning may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative insensible and third-space fl uid losses should be replaced with crystalloid at a rate of 6 to 8 mL/kg/hr. Blood loss may be replaced with 5% albumin and packed red cells to maintain a hematocrit of higher than 35%. Hypothermia should be avoided with use of a warming mattress, forcedair warming devices, and warming of all fl uids and gases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extubation of term infants at the end of surgery is preferable, but is usually not feasible. A full-term infant who has undergone an uneventful simple ligation of a TEF is the best candidate for immediate extubation. Tracheomalacia, resulting from in  utero  compression  by  the  dilated  esophageal  pouch,  may cause partial upper airway obstruction. Aspiration of gastric secretions may lead to chemical pneumonitis or pneumonia. Th ese and other factors, such as the length of the procedure and possible damage to the airway from rigid bronchoscopy, may in fl uence  the  decision  the  continue  postoperative  mechanical ventilation. Infusions of opioids and/or regional analgesia techniques have been used for pain management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omphalocele and Gastroschisis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omphalocele and gastroschisis are congenital defects of the anterior  abdominal  wall  that  permit  external  herniation  of abdominal  viscera. Th ey  are  the  most  common  abdominal wall  defects. Th ese  conditions  have  important  di ff erences, however  (Table  27-13).  Approximately  95%  of  cases  can  be detected by ultrasonography in the early weeks of gestation. In utero diagnosis allows planned delivery at a medical center with resources for obstetric, surgical, anesthetic, and neonatal care in high-risk cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omphalocele

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omphalocele manifests as external herniation of abdominal viscera through the base of the umbilical cord. By de fi nition, the defect is larger than 4 cm. A defect smaller than 4 cm is termed an umbilical hernia. Th e abdominal contents are contained within a sac formed by the peritoneal membrane internally  and  the  amniotic  membrane  externally,  without overlying skin. Th e incidence of herniation of intestines into the cord is approximately 1 in 5000 live births, whereas herniation of liver and intestines occurs in 1 in 10,000 live births. Approximately  three  quarters  of  cases  are  associated  with other  congenital  defects,  including  cardiac  anomalies,  trisomy 21, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (omphalocele, organomegaly,  macrosomia,  macroglossia,  and  hypoglycemia). Approximately 33% of neonates with omphaloceles are preterm. Cardiac defects and prematurity are the major causes of mortality (approximately 30%).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroschisis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroschisis manifests as external herniation of abdominal viscera through a small (usually less than 5 cm) defect in the anterior abdominal wall. In most cases, the defect occurs laterally,  just  to  the  right  of  the  normally  inserted  umbilical cord. Unlike in omphalocele, a hernia sac does not cover the  herniated  abdominal  viscera. Th e  bowel  is  exposed  to the  intrauterine  environment  without  a  protective  covering, which causes its loops to become matted, thickened, and o ft en covered with an in fl ammatory coating or peel. In most cases, only intestines are herniated. Gastroschisis is rarely associated with  other  congenital  anomalies. Th e  incidence  of  preterm birth, however, is higher than in neonates with omphalocele.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decompressing the stomach with an orogastric or nasogastric tube decreases the risk of regurgitation, aspiration pneumonia, and further bowel distention. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are started along with intravenous fl uid therapy with isotonic solution at a rate su ffi cient to replace the large fl uid de fi cits and ongoing losses (150 to 300 mL/kg/day). Th ese neonates experience considerable protein loss and third-space fl uid translocation. To maintain normal oncotic pressure, protein-containing solutions (5% albumin) should constitute approximately 25% of the replacement fl uids. Without such vigorous fl uid resuscitation, severe hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis may ensue. A urinary catheter should be placed to monitor achievement of the goal of 1 to 2 mL/kg/hr of urine output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroschisis requires urgent repair. Th e sooner the bowel is reduced, the more likely primary closure can be achieved and the less severe the degree of bowel wall edema and accumulation of fi brinous coating. Placing the infant's lower body and exposed intestine into a plastic drawstring bowel bag immediately  a ft er  delivery  reduces  evaporative fl uid loss and heat loss from the large surface area of exposed bowel. Although omphalocele also requires urgent corrective surgery, the frequency of associated cardiac anomalies warrants preoperative cardiologic evaluation. Primary closure is not always possible. Staged closure is very successful and avoids potential complications of increased abdominal pressure following reduction of  herniated  viscera.  Primary  closure  may  cause  respiratory  compromise,  decreased  venous  return,  and  circulatory

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
dysfunction if the abdomen is too tense. A profound decrease in cardiac output and organ perfusion can result in acidosis, anuria, and bowel necrosis. Lower extremity congestion and cyanosis  may  also  be  seen  if  venous  return  from  the  lower body is impaired. If primary closure is deemed not feasible, the viscera should be covered with a prosthetic silo and then slowly reduced over a period of several days to 1 week.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Important aspects of the anesthetic management for omphalocele and gastroschisis closure include preservation of body temperature  and  continuation  of fl uid  replacement.  A ft er decompression of the stomach and preoxygenation, the airway is best secured by rapid-sequence induction. Opioids or an intravenous hypnotic should be dosed based on the clinical condition of the newborn. Th e endotracheal tube should allow for ventilation with peak inspiratory pressures of more than 20 cm H2O. Primary closure may require the ability to provide ventilation with high peak inspiratory pressures into the postoperative period. Repair of a large defect will require maximal relaxation during the procedure and during the initial postoperative period. Anesthesia is maintained with volatile anesthetics and/or opioids (fentanyl or sufentanil) titrated to avoid hypotension. Nitrous oxide is avoided because of its potential to di ff use into the intestinal tract and interfere with the reduction of eviscerated bowel back into the abdomen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It must be remembered that these neonates have an underdeveloped  abdominal  cavity;  tight  surgical  abdominal  closure can result in compression of the inferior vena cava and decreased  diaphragmatic  excursion,  resulting  in  impaired abdominal  organ  perfusion  and  decreased  lung  compliance. Monitoring of airway pressures is helpful for detecting changes in pulmonary compliance during abdominal closure. If inspiratory pressures are greater than 25 to 30 cm H 2 O or intravesical  or  intragastric  pressures  are  greater  than  20  cm H2O, primary closure is  not  recommended.  Although  measurement of various pressures can be helpful in determining whether or not to close the abdomen, clinical assessment of the neonate's condition is equally important. Any changes in ventilatory parameters and oxygen requirement must be communicated to the surgeon throughout the procedure and will impact the decision to perform primary closure of the abdomen. High ventilatory pressures and excessive F io 2 are indications for postponing immediate abdominal closure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evidence of unacceptable intraabdominal pressure requires removal of fascial sutures and closure of only the skin or addition of a prosthesis, such as a silo chimney or silastic silo. Th e silo consists of a silastic or Te fl on mesh that is sutured to the fascia of the defect. Th e synthetic material used to cover the lesion and the speci fi c technique for placing the organs into the abdomen vary from center to center. A ft er the silo is in place, the extraabdominal organs are gradually returned to the peritoneal cavity over the ensuing days. Th is gradual reduction can be done in the neonatal ICU and requires no anesthesia. When the abdominal contents have been largely returned, the infant is brought back to the operating room for complete closure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  ICU  care  is  recommended  with  continuation of direct monitoring of arterial blood gas concentrations to  guide fl uid  replacement  and  management  of  mechanical ventilation. Fluid requirements will be less than those in the period before repair or silo placement but still will likely exceed maintenance requirements.

Hirschsprung's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hirschsprung's disease, or congenital aganglionic megacolon, is the most common cause of lower intestinal obstruction in full-term neonates. Th e incidence is approximately 1 in 5000 live births, with a pronounced male predominance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hirschsprung's disease may be evident at birth, and the diagnosis  is  made  during  the  neonatal  period  in  up  to  80%  of patients.  A ff ected newborns show delayed passage of meconium, irritability, failure to thrive, and abdominal distention. Th e presentation of Hirschsprung's disease in older children includes  constipation,  fecal  soiling,  and  diarrhea.  Suction rectal biopsy fi ndings con fi rm the diagnosis. Th e  pathologic features in Hirschsprung's disease include absence of ganglion cells  and  the  presence  of  hypertrophied  nerve  bundles  that stain positively for acetylcholinesterase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e surgical approaches are varied and have undergone many modi fi cations  over  time;  they  include  the  Swenson,  Soave, Boley,  and  Duhamel  operations.  A  primary  pull-through procedure in which the diseased portion is removed and the normally  innervated  bowel  segments  are  reanastomosed  is the preferred surgical treatment for a ff ected infants. However, a  decompressive colostomy is indicated in infants who have severe enterocolitis or who have a markedly dilated proximal colon  that  might  make  a  primary  pull-through  procedure unfeasible.  Laparoscopically  assisted  repairs  are  becoming more  popular  and  have  produced  successful  outcomes  in selected patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected  newborns  have  partial  or  complete  intestinal obstruction  and  require  early  decompression. Th e  infants are kept on NPO status and given intravenous fl uid replacement. If the infant has enterocolitis and/or systemic infection, antibiotics  and  even  inotropic  support  may  be  needed. Th e outcomes for patients with surgically treated Hirschsprung's disease are reasonably good. Most patients attain fecal continence. However, in patients with retained aganglionic bowel or acquired aganglionosis, sequelae such as severe strictures, dysfunctional  bowel,  or  intestinal  neuronal  dysplasia  may occur, requiring reoperation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In elective procedures, either the inhalational or intravenous route  may  be  used  to  induce  general  anesthesia.  In  urgent cases,  such  as  in  the  situation  of  concomitant  enterocolitis, full-stomach precautions should be taken. Anesthesia can be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
maintained with a mixture of air, oxygen, volatile agent, and muscle  relaxant.  Extra  care  should  be  taken  in  positioning, since these operations can be quite lengthy. A lithotomy position  is  required  for  anorectal  pull-through  procedures  that involve  both  abdominal  and  perineal  incisions.  Intravenous catheters should be placed in the upper extremities, because the  lower  extremities  may  be  included  in  the  surgical fi eld. Intraoperative blood loss is usually low, but third-space fl uid losses can be signi fi cant. Patients may require an initial intravenous bolus of 10 to 20 mL/kg of crystalloid to o ff set the volume de fi cit resulting from bowel preparation and fasting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural  anesthesia  provides  excellent  intraoperative  as well  as  postoperative  analgesia  in  patients  undergoing  open abdominal  procedures.  Extubation  at  the  end  of  surgery  is routine. If regional techniques are not used, intravenous opioids are the mainstay of postoperative analgesia. Postoperative fl uid requirements may be greater than maintenance requirements in the fi rst 24 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorectal Anomalies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of anorectal malformations is approximately 1 in 5000 live births. Anorectal anomalies include a spectrum of defects, most of which involve a fi stula between the lower intestinal  tract  and  the  genitourinary  structures.  Additional genitourinary abnormalities are seen in many of these patients. Imperforate anus without fi stula occurs in a small number of patients, especially in association with Down's syndrome and most commonly with the VACTERL association. Spinal and vertebral anomalies also occur in up to 50% of patients with anorectal  malformations.  Tethered  cord  is  seen  in  approximately 25% of these patients. Cardiovascular anomalies such as  atrial  septal  defect,  patent  ductus  arteriosus,  tetralogy  of Fallot, and ventral septal defect are present in approximately one third of patients with imperforate anus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Anorectal  malformations  are  apparent  upon  examination  of the perineum. Th e neonate may fail to pass meconium in the fi rst 24 to 48 hours of life. Male infants with imperforate anus usually  require  emergent  surgery  (diverting  colostomy)  to relieve the obstruction, whereas in females, the presence of a rectovaginal (rectovestibular) fi stula will allow passage of stool. Rectovesicular fi stula is frequently seen in males and requires antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent urinary tract infection even a ft er decompressive surgery until de fi nitive repair is performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected  newborns  have  partial  or  complete  intestinal obstruction and require decompression. Th e infants are kept on NPO status and given intravenous fl uids and nutritional supplements (peripheral nutrition and lipids). If the infant has a fi stula as well, there may also be obstructive uropathy and associated systemic infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preliminary  treatment  for  high  lesions  is  a  diverting  colostomy followed at a later date by a posterior sagittal surgical repair that involves placing the rectum within the pelvic muscles with division and closure of rectourinary or rectovestibular fi stulas. Low lesions such as perineal fi stulas, on the other hand,  may  be  repaired  during  the  neonatal  period  without an initial diverting colostomy. Th e majority of patients with perineal fi stula and rectal atresia can attain full urinary and fecal  continence  a ft er  de fi nitive  repairs.  More  severe  sacral malformations are associated with a lower rate of full bowel and bladder control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  of  patients  undergoing  decompressive colostomy or primary repair should be conducted as for any  infant  with  bowel  obstruction.  Rapid-sequence  induction  is  o ft en  employed,  particularly  if  abdominal  distention is  signi fi cant.  De fi nitive  anorectal  reconstruction  is  usually performed 1 to 12 months later. All defects can be repaired through a posterior sagittal approach, although some patients may  also  require  an  abdominal  incision  to  mobilize  a  high rectum or vagina. Extra care should be taken in positioning and  padding  for  these  lengthy  procedures.  Neuromuscular blocking agents should be avoided, because electrical muscle stimulation is used throughout the procedure to identify muscle structures and to de fi ne the anterior and posterior limits of  the  new  anus.  Blood  loss  and  third-space fl uid losses are usually moderate. Intravenous catheters should be placed in upper extremities, because surgical positioning of the legs may impede venous fl ow or limit access to the intravenous catheter insertion sites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients can usually be extubated at the end of the surgery. Analgesia can be provided with opioids, but these should be given to newborns and young infants in a monitored setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pyloric Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pyloric stenosis is one of the most common gastrointestinal abnormalities appearing in the fi rst 6 months of life. Th is disorder  has  a  polygenic  mode  of  inheritance  and  occurs  four times  more  commonly  in  males,  more  o ft en  in fi rst-born infants, and more frequently in white infants. Th e incidence is approximately 1 in 300 live births. It is usually an isolated fi nding,  and  fewer  than  10%  of  a ff ected  infants  have  other anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e lesion is a thickening of the circular muscles of the pylorus, with a gradually increasing obstruction of the gastric outlet. Pyloric stenosis presents as relentless postprandial, nonbilious projectile vomiting beginning at 2 to 5 weeks of age. Symptoms  may  develop  as  early  as  the fi rst  week  and  as  late  as the fift h month of life. Jaundice may occur in some infants. With continued vomiting of gastric contents, which contain sodium, potassium, chloride, and hydrogen, the infant classically develops a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.  With  persistent  vomiting,  volume  contraction  ensues, and  the  kidneys  respond  by  defending  extracellular  volume

in preference to serum pH by conserving sodium and excreting hydrogen ions. Th e initially alkaline urine thus becomes acidic, and this paradoxic aciduria worsens the existing metabolic alkalosis. Th e severity of dehydration can be assessed by physical examination of skin turgor, mucous membranes, and anterior  fontanelle,  and  measurement  of  resting  vital  signs. Th e  more severe the fl uid and electrolyte loss, the lower the serum chloride concentration. Th e diagnosis can be con fi rmed by palpation of an olivelike mass just below the xiphoid process, although this may be di ffi cult to do in a struggling infant. Abdominal ultrasonography is both sensitive and speci fi c  in detecting a hypertrophied pylorus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initial therapeutic approach is aimed at repletion of intravascular  volume and correction of electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities. Severely dehydrated infants should receive an initial intravenous bolus (20 mL/kg) of isotonic normal saline to reexpand the intravascular volume. Further resuscitation is given as 5% dextrose in 0.45% NaCl at 1.5 times the maintenance rate. Potassium chloride 10 to 40 mEq/L can be added to the fl uids if necessary when adequate urine output is demonstrated. Fluid resuscitation should be guided by measurement of serum electrolyte concentrations, which is essential for estimating the degree of dehydration, alkalosis, and metabolic derangements in these patients. Although this condition is  considered  a  medical  urgency  and  the  corrective  surgery elective once rehydration is complete and electrolyte levels are normalized, pyloromyotomy is done at all hours to minimize the duration of hospitalization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All patients with pyloric stenosis should be regarded as having full stomachs. Pulmonary aspiration of gastric fl uid is a de fi -nite risk in infants with gastric outlet obstruction. Fortunately, barium swallow studies are rarely, if ever, done to con fi rm the diagnosis, and there is no added risk of contrast aspiration in most cases. Th e stomach should be emptied as completely as possible  with  a  large-bore  orogastric  catheter  before  induction of anesthesia. O ft en, several passes of the suction catheter are needed to accomplish this. Th e airway can be secured by awake intubation or by use of a rapid-sequence technique a ft er administration of a hypnotic and succinylcholine. Atropine may be given before induction or kept immediately available  in  case  of  bradycardia.  Maintenance  of  anesthesia  with volatile agents or low-dose inhaled anesthetics along with an infusion of remifentanil is acceptable. Muscle relaxation may be needed for surgical exposure. A ft er tracheal intubation, an orogastric tube is reinserted and le ft in place during surgery so that air can be insu ffl ated into the stomach to test for mucosal perforation a ft er the hypertrophied muscle is split. An acetaminophen suppository can be administered a ft er intubation. Alternatively,  intravenous  acetaminophen  may  be  given  if available. Longer-acting opioids are generally not needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  traditional  open  Ramstedt  pyloromyotomy  is  a  relatively  simple  procedure  in  the  hands  of  skilled  pediatric surgeons and completely resolves the problem. Th e operative mortality is less than 0.5%. Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy has become the dominant approach in most centers. Th is  technique may require longer operative times but produces smaller surgical scars, and the patient may have an even more rapid recovery and resumption of full enteral nutrition. In fi ltration of the incision sites with local anesthetics generally provides su ffi cient postoperative analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  patient  can  be  extubated  once  the  usual  criteria  are met at the conclusion of the procedure. However, postoperative respiratory depression o ft en occurs in infants with pyloric stenosis. Th e cause may be related to cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) alkalosis  that  persists  beyond  correction  of  the  serum  pH. Infants anesthetized using a remifentanil infusion may have a  decreased  incidence  of  postoperative  apnea.  Occasionally, hypoglycemia may occur 2 to 3 hours a ft er surgical correction of pyloric stenosis. Th is is most likely due to inadequate liver glycogen  stores  and  cessation  of  intravenous  dextrose  infusions. Postoperatively, infants should remain in a monitored environment for several hours. Depending on the preference of the surgeon and the speci fi cs of the procedure, infants usually can begin oral feedings 8 hours a ft er the surgical repair. Hospital discharge o ft en occurs within 24 hours of the end of the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing Enterocolitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing  enterocolitis  (NEC)  is  characterized  by  varying degrees  of  mucosal  or  transmural  necrosis  of  the  intestine, most frequently  involving  the  terminal  ileum  and  proximal colon.  It  is  the  most  common  neonatal  surgical  emergency, resulting in substantial perinatal morbidity and mortality. Th e overall incidence is 1 to 3 in 100 live births, with 90% of cases seen  in  preterm  newborns. Th e  incidence  and  case  fatality rates are inversely related to gestational age and birth weight. Neonates at greatest risk are those who are born at less than 32 weeks' gestation and who weigh less than 1500 g. NEC with bowel perforation carries a mortality rate of 30% to 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early signs and symptoms are o ft en nonspeci fi c and include recurrent  apnea,  lethargy,  temperature  instability,  and  glucose level instability. If therapy is not undertaken (and o ft en even  a ft er prompt  treatment),  cardiovascular  instability follows.  More  speci fi c  clinical  manifestations  of  NEC  are abdominal  distention,  high  gastric  residuals  a ft er  feeding, evidence of malabsorption, and bloody or mucoid diarrhea. Metabolic  acidosis  is  very  common  secondary  to  generalized peritonitis and hypovolemia. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are usually present and appear to be associated with gram-negative sepsis and platelet binding by endotoxin. Th e diagnosis of NEC is made clinically in correlation with abdominal plain radiographic fi ndings.  Pneumatosis  intestinalis (air in the intestinal wall), air within the portal system, or free air within the peritoneal cavity are diagnostic of NEC in newborns. Pneumoperitoneum indicates intestinal

perforation. However, perforation is frequently present without evidence of free air in the peritoneal cavity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical treatment, consisting of cessation of feeding, gastric decompression, and administration of intravenous fl uids and antibiotics, can be successful in the management of neonates with NEC. However, there is pressure to resume enteral feeding  in  these  ill  preterm  newborns,  since  recovery  from  the complications  of  preterm  birth  requires  adequate  nutrition. If  abdominal distention is signi fi cant enough to impair ventilation,  endotracheal  intubation  and  mechanical  ventilation are  indicated.  Hypotension  is  treated  with  crystalloid  and blood  products.  Ionotropic  agents  such  as  dopamine  may be required to improve cardiac output and bowel perfusion. Umbilical artery catheters should be removed, if present, to avoid  compromising  mesenteric  blood fl ow.  Placement  of percutaneous abdominal drains in the neonatal ICU (without sedation or general anesthesia) is occasionally done. Surgery is reserved for neonates for whom medical management fails, as  evidenced  by  bowel  perforation,  sepsis  (peritonitis),  and progressive metabolic acidosis indicating bowel necrosis. As many as 50% of infants with NEC require surgical intervention. Th e infants who do come to the operating room exhibit signi fi cant cardiovascular instability. NEC carries a high mortality,  especially  when  medical  management  fails,  in  which case  mortality  approaches  25%.  Some  infants  may  require repeat bowel resections, which predisposes them to short-gut syndrome as well as complications from long-term parenteral nutrition,  such  as  catheter-related  infection  and  sepsis,  and total parenteral nutrition cholestasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative care of the critically ill newborn is o ft en more a resuscitation e ff ort than management of general anesthesia. Newborns  with  NEC  are  usually  hypovolemic  and  require aggressive fl uid  resuscitation  with  crystalloid  and  colloid solutions  before  induction  of  anesthesia.  Blood  and  platelet  transfusions  are  o ft en  necessary.  Adequate  monitoring of fl uid resuscitation is  critical.  A  peripheral  artery  catheter provides the ability to measure systemic blood pressure continuously  and  to  monitor  arterial  blood  gas  concentrations, hematocrit, and electrolyte levels. It is very important to have adequate vascular access. If postoperative intravenous nutrition is planned, placement of a central venous line before the start of the surgery will provide excellent access for the procedure (although the small catheter diameter and long catheter length preclude rapid fl uid or blood administration). It must be appreciated that rapid administration of fl uid to preterm neonates may cause intracranial hemorrhage or reopening of the ductus arteriosus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese  infants  are  usually  undergoing  mechanical  ventilation  before  surgery.  If  the  infant  is  not  already  intubated, induction should proceed with full-stomach precautions and awareness of the infant's  depleted  intravascular  volume  and possible impaired contractility. Preoxygenation and, typically, premedication with atropine should be accomplished before induction and laryngoscopy. An endotracheal tube should be chosen  to  allow  ventilation  with  peak  in fl ating  pressures  of more than 20 cm H 2 O, because high intraabdominal pressures and decreased pulmonary compliance are likely to be encountered. Th e ventilator from the neonatal ICU usually allows for more e ff ective ventilation in these tiny patients than most conventional ventilators used in operating rooms. Consideration should be given to bringing the neonatal ICU team (neonatologist, neonatal nurse, respiratory therapist) to help with transportation as well as intraoperative management. Maintenance of  anesthesia  is  generally  limited  to  the  use  of  short-acting intravenous opioids (fentanyl) as tolerated, muscle relaxation, and replenishment of intravascular volume as needed. Inotropes such as dopamine may be required to maintain adequate cardiac  output  and  bowel  perfusion.  Massive  third-space losses  necessitate  aggressive  volume  resuscitation.  All fl uids and the operating room should be appropriately warmed to  prevent  hypothermia.  Postoperative  mechanical  ventilation is usually required because of abdominal distention and co-existing RDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Even if there is minimal cardiovascular instability and fl uid administration  is  not  excessive,  it  is  safer  to  transport  the infant with a secure, protected airway until the patient's condition is determined to be stable in the neonatal ICU. Given the risk  of  bacteremia,  neuraxial  analgesia  is  not  recommended for these patients. Postoperative pain is usually managed with intravenous  opioids,  o ft en  as  continuous  infusions  in  the neonatal ICU.

Biliary Atresia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Biliary atresia is characterized by obliteration or discontinuity of the extrahepatic bile duct system with resultant obstruction to bile fl ow. It has an overall incidence of 1 in 16,000 live births in Europe and North America but a much higher incidence in east  Asian  countries (e.g.,  1  in  5000  in  Taiwan).  Associated anomalies such as intestinal malrotation, situs inversus, and polysplenia are seen in 10% to 15% of patients with biliary atresia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Biliary  atresia  typically  presents  in  the  early  weeks  a ft er birth  with  persistent  jaundice  accompanied  by  dark  urine and acholic stool. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly can both be seen, but the latter is usually a late sign. Any term infant who has jaundice  for  longer  than  14  days  should  be  evaluated for underlying hepatobiliary disease. Of note, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is seen in most biliary diseases, whereas unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is found in physiologic and breast-milk jaundice. However, a mixed picture of unconjugated and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can occur in biliary atresia when the obstruction is so severe that bile spills into the systemic circulation before undergoing conjugation. Th ere is relentless bile fl ow obstruction, and if the condition is le ft untreated, liver cirrhosis ensues and death occurs by 2 years

of age. Initial diagnostic evaluation includes laboratory testing  (bilirubin  level,  transaminase  level,  liver  synthetic  function  tests, γ -glutamyltransferase  level)  and  ultrasonography. Endoscopic  retrograde  cholangiopancreatography  and  even magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are occasionally performed, but these are limited in terms of both equipment size  and  availability  at  treatment  centers.  Diagnosis  is con fi rmed by liver biopsy fi ndings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early recognition and diagnosis are essential, because the success  rate  of  surgical  treatment  depends  largely  on  early restoration of bile fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kasai's operation (portoenterostomy) and liver transplantation are the cornerstones of treatment for biliary atresia. Portoenterostomy involves excision of the porta hepatis to expose microscopic ductular continuity that allows for bile fl ow, and results are best if it is performed by 8 weeks of age. A jejunal Roux loop is anastomosed to the exposed patent ductules to restore normal bile drainage into the intestinal tract. Although Kasai's portoenterostomy can achieve complete resolution of jaundice and restoration of hepatic metabolic and synthetic functions, progressive in fl ammation of the hepatobiliary tree may persist, leading to recurrence of bile fl ow obstruction. Because of this, a signi fi cant number of patients redevelop signs and symptoms of liver disease a ft er an initial period of clinical improvement. Cholangitis  is  another  common  complication  a ft er  Kasai's portoenterostomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver transplantation is a curative treatment for biliary atresia and remains as the last resort for patients in whom Kasai's procedure has failed. Indeed, biliary atresia is the most common indication for liver transplantation in children younger than 2 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation and correction of coagulopathy is  important.  Vitamin  K  may  be  given  1  to  2  days  before the  scheduled  procedure.  A  coagulation  pro fi le  should  be obtained,  and  a  complete  blood  count  and  electrolyte  panel should be performed and any abnormalities corrected accordingly. Most patients will arrive with a functioning intravenous catheter, and an intravenous induction technique is used, with the appropriate dose of a hypnotic agent and nondepolarizing muscle relaxant given to facilitate tracheal intubation. If ascites is present, rapid-sequence induction is indicated. Adequate venous access is important, and if it cannot be obtained, a central venous catheter should be placed. Insertion of a peripheral arterial catheter is recommended for both hemodynamic monitoring and frequent blood sampling to guide anesthetic and fl uid management. Anesthesia can be maintained with low doses of inhaled agents along with opioids and muscle relaxants. Nitrous oxide should be avoided. Temperature maintenance is  important  and  can  be  a  challenge  in  these  lengthy procedures with a large area of exposure. A moderate amount of blood loss is to be expected, but there is usually signi fi cant evaporative fl uid loss. Of note, bleeding can be excessive with liver transplantation. Th e reader is referred to Chapter 13 for a detailed discussion of the management of anesthesia for liver transplantation. Severe, sudden hypotension may occur if the inferior  vena  cava  is  compressed  during  surgical  manipulation. Th e importance of keen observation and close communication between the surgeon and anesthesiologist cannot be overemphasized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  infant  should  receive  postoperative  care  in  the  ICU. Management of the patient will vary depending on the details of the procedure. If blood and evaporative losses were small and  the  infant  demonstrates  a  stable  hemodynamic  pro fi le, consideration can be given to early extubation. In many cases, postoperative  mechanical  ventilation  is  appropriate.  Better pain control can also be achieved with more liberal doses of intravenous opioids in infants undergoing mechanical ventilation.  Placement of an epidural catheter at the conclusion of the procedure can be considered only when there has been no coagulopathy.

Congenital Lobar Emphysema and Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONGENITAL LOBAR EMPHYSEMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital lobar emphysema is the postnatal overdistention of an otherwise normal lobe of the lung that compresses adjacent  normal  lung  units  and  leads  to  atelectasis.  If  this  process continues, mediastinal shi ft with impairment of venous return  can  occur.  Congenital  lobar  emphysema  is  a  rare cause of respiratory distress in newborns. Th e a ff ected bronchus allows passage of air on inspiration but limits expulsion of  air  on  exhalation,  which  leads  to  air  trapping  and  lobar overexpansion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathologic causes of congenital lobar emphysema include collapse of bronchi resulting from hypoplasia of supporting cartilage, bronchial stenosis, mucous plugs, obstructing cysts, and vascular compression of bronchi. Th e most frequent site of involvement is the le ft upper lobe (40% to 50% of cases), followed  by  the  right  middle  lobe  (30%  to  40%),  and  then the right upper lobe (20%). Acquired lobar emphysema may result  from  barotrauma  associated  with  the  treatment  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Right lower lobe involvement is common in these cases as a result of endotracheal tube positioning. Th ere is an increased incidence of congenital heart disease,  particularly  ventral  septal  defect  and  patent  ductus arteriosus,  in  patients  with  congenital  lobar  emphysema. Twentyfi ve percent of cases of congenital lobar emphysema are  diagnosed  at  birth  and  50%  of  cases  are  diagnosed  by 1 month of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e clinical presentation may range from mild tachypnea and wheezing to severe dyspnea and cyanosis. Th e chest radiograph  typically  shows  faint  bronchovascular  markings  and herniation of the a ff ected lobe across the midline. With pneumothorax or congenital cysts, these marking are absent. Treatment consists of resection of the diseased lobe in infants who are symptomatic or who show disease progression. Long-term outcomes are generally excellent.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONGENITAL CYSTIC ADENOMATOID MALFORMATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  of  congenital  cystic  adenomatoid malformation depends on the size of the lesion. Congenital cystic  adenomatoid  malformations  are  abnormal  congenital cystic  pockets  that  communicate  with  the  tracheobronchial tree and may become overdistended because of air trapping. Up to 80% of a ff ected infants exhibit respiratory distress in the newborn period as a result of compression of adjacent normal lung tissue. In this sense, the pathophysiology is similar to that seen with congenital lobar emphysema as described earlier.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital  cystic  adenomatoid  malformations  are  structurally  similar  to  bronchioles  but  do  not  have  alveoli,  bronchial glands, or cartilage. Th e clinical manifestations includes tachypnea, grunting, use of accessory muscles of respiration, and cyanosis. In infants who have multiple cystic adenomatoid malformations, the radiographic appearance may be similar to  that  in  patients  with  a  congenital  diaphragmatic  hernia. Infants with small lesions may not come to medical attention until early childhood when a chest radiograph is done to evaluate pneumonia. Treatment is surgical resection of the a ff ected lobe, and prognosis depends on the amount and health of the remaining lung tissues, which may be hypoplastic because of compression in utero.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  preoperative  period,  supplemental  oxygen  is  administered  and  positive  pressure  should  be  studiously  avoided. Infants in respiratory distress are kept on NPO status to minimize the risk of choking and aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  recommended  induction  technique  for  infants  with either congenital lobar emphysema or congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations is inhalation, and induction represents the most critical phase of the perioperative period. In a struggling and distressed infant who may also be crying, the amount of trapped gas can increase. In addition, any positive pressure ventilation of the lungs before the chest is opened may cause abrupt, exaggerated expansion of emphysematous lobes or cystic spaces (gas enters but cannot leave because of a ballvalve e ff ect), with sudden mediastinal shi ft and cardiac arrest. Because of this, the optimal technique is a smooth inhalation induction  with  sevo fl urane  and  oxygen  without,  if  possible, any  positive  pressure  ventilation.  However,  the  infant  o ft en develops apnea under deep levels of anesthesia, which necessitates the use of some positive pressure. Tracheal intubation without  muscle  relaxants  and  maintenance  of  spontaneous breathing  with  minimal  positive  airway  pressures  is  recommended. Use of nitrous oxide is contraindicated because it can lead to rapid and untoward expansion of the emphysematous and cystic areas. Th e surgeon should be present at induction in  the  event  that  sudden  cardiopulmonary  decompensation necessitates  urgent  thoracotomy.  If  the  induction  goes  well, without  excessive  expansion  of  the  emphysematous  lobe  or adenomatoid malformation, general anesthesia may be supplemented with local anesthesia until the chest is opened and the pathologic lobe or cyst is delivered through the incision. A  peripheral  arterial  catheter  should  be  placed  to  monitor hemodynamic changes during surgical lung retraction and to allow for repeat blood gas sampling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meticulous attention must be paid to avoidance of nerve and other compression injuries during positioning (usually lateral decubitus with the infant's ipsilateral arm placed directly over the head). If a thoracoscopic approach is planned, one-lung ventilation  is  needed.  In  these  small  patients,  lung  isolation can be accomplished either with endobronchial intubation or with placement of a bronchial blocker (the smallest bronchial blocker,  size  2F,  can  be  placed  through  endotracheal  tubes with an inner diameter as small as 3.5 to 4 mm but may also be placed outside of the endotracheal tube). Once the abnormal lung is resected, these infants may be paralyzed and mechanical ventilation begun. Infants who show sudden deterioration may require emergent needle aspiration or thoracotomy for decompression of the a ff ected lung tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since the remaining lung tissue in patients with congenital lobar  emphysema  is  normal,  many  of  these  infants  demonstrate dramatic improvement once the emphysematous lobe is resected. Results are more variable in infants with congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations, since the remaining lung tissue may or may not be hypoplastic. Generally, the patient can be safely extubated at the end of the procedure. Postoperative atelectasis is common, however. Observation in a closely monitored setting is indicated in the immediately postoperative period. Analgesia can be provided with either neuraxial techniques or intermittent administration of intravenous opioids, but only practitioners with expert skills in the placement of  infant  thoracic  epidural  catheters  should  undertake  this procedure.

CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral Palsy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral palsy is a generic term used to describe a group of nonprogressive disorders characterized by kinetic and postural abnormalities. Although causes may di ff er, they all represent a common phenotype of motor dysfunction resulting from  abnormalities  that  occurred  in  the developing brain. Th erefore,  clinical  pictures  similar  or  identical  to  cerebral palsy that are due to brain injuries that occurred from age 3  years  through  adulthood  are  not  considered  as  cerebral palsy.  Since  cerebral  palsy  is  a nonprogressive disorder  of the CNS, it is also termed static encephalopathy, the clinical expression of which may vary over the course of the child's lifetime.  Additional  disturbances  of  sensation,  perception, cognition,  behavior,  and  electrical  activity  (seizures)  are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebral palsy can be generally categorized based on the resting tone, extremities involved, and presence of kinetic abnormalities.  For  example, spastic  quadriplegia denotes  baseline spasticity with impaired motor function of all four extremities  and spastic  diplegia denotes  a  spastic  resting  tone  with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
motor dysfunction of either the two upper or the two lower extremities. Spastic monoplegia, triplegia, and hemiplegia also exist. If dyskinesia (abnormal movement) is the de fi ning feature, then the term dyskinetic cerebral palsy is used. Th e speci fi c movement abnormalities may be athetoid (slow, writhing movements),  choreoathetoid  (jerky,  rhythmic  movements alternating with athetosis), or dystonic. Less commonly, cerebellar dysfunction predominates and is categorized as ataxic cerebral palsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spastic cerebral palsy types are  the  most  common. A ff ected individuals manifest initial hypotonia (usually from age 6 months to 1 year) that later changes into spasticity. True hypotonic  cerebral  palsy  is  rare.  A  history  of  gross  motor delays is almost universal and is commonly associated with delays  in  reaching  other  milestones  ( fi ne  motor  skills,  language, social interaction). Intelligence can range from normal to severely impaired.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Truncal tone is o ft en a ff ected, which results in spinal curvature deformities such as scoliosis. Patients may experience recurrent aspiration pneumonia as a result of poor pharyngeal muscle tone and a high incidence of gastroesophageal re fl ux. Spasticity can lead to severe contractures that require medical therapy  (baclofen,  dantrolene,  botulinum  toxin  A  injection) and surgical interventions. Selective dorsal rhizotomy is occasionally performed to decrease the re fl exive motor activation that  occurs  in  response  to  the  loss  of  descending  inhibitory input.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Seizure  disorder  is  common,  and  some  children  may  be given antiepileptic medications even in the absence of seizures for  o ff -label  treatment  of  conditions  such  as  spasticity  and behavioral issues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis is mostly based on clinical fi ndings in conjunction  with  a  thorough  investigation  of  the  patient's  prenatal, perinatal,  and  postnatal  history  as  well  as  the  intrapartum maternal history. Diagnostic imaging, including cranial ultrasonography (for neonates), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is helpful in identifying associated structural abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with cerebral palsy can come for a variety of surgical procedures that may be simple or complex. Examples are ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for hydrocephalus, dental  restoration  for  poor  dental  hygiene,  Nissen's  fundoplication for severe re fl ux, posterior spinal fusion for scoliosis, and Achilles  tenotomy  for  contractures. Th ere  is  no  single  best anesthetic plan, because each patient will have a di ff erent combination of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurobehavorial problems.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost  any  anesthetic  technique  can  be  used;  volatile agents need not be avoided, because cerebral palsy is not associated  with  malignant  hyperthermia.  Succinylcholine  is  not contraindicated but should be used with discretion. In general, children with cerebral palsy require a lower MAC of volatile anesthetics and have a longer emergence time than their healthy counterparts. Th is may be due in part to the intrinsic brain abnormality, but another contributor is o ft en the sedative e ff ects of many medications used to treat the various complications of cerebral palsy.

Low pharyngeal tone and a high incidence of gastroesophageal re fl ux disease call for a low threshold of endotracheal intubation to protect against aspiration, even for brief procedures. Administration and dosing of muscle relaxants should be done with caution, because these patients generally have prolonged recovery from neuromuscular blockade. Positioning is o ft en di ffi cult because of severe contractures; avoidance of compression injury to bony and so ft tissues requires vigilance from all members of the perioperative team. For patients with seizure disorders,  drug-drug  interactions  (e.g.,  cytochrome  P-450 induction  by  antiepileptics)  and  the  epileptogenic  e ff ects  of some anesthetic agents (etomidate, ketamine) must be recognized. Extubation must occur only when the patient has fully recovered from neuromuscular blockade with as little residual anesthesia  as  possible. Th is  is  especially  true  for  those  with developmental  disabilities,  because  these  children  are  more likely to develop sedation-related hypoventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  pain  management  must  be  meticulously planned  and  coordinated,  since  impaired  communication  is common and the child may not be able to voice complaints. Diazepam is an important adjunct in managing pain related to muscle spasm. Supplemental regional and epidural continuous analgesia  are  ideal,  since  they  provide  superior  pain  control and  can  help  limit  the  use  of  medications  with  respiratorydepressant e ff ects.

Hydrocephalus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus is a disorder of CSF accumulation that results in  ventricular  dilation  resulting  from  increased  intracranial pressure (ICP). Th is is a di ff erent entity from ventricular dilatation resulting from parenchymal loss (periventricular white matter atrophy) with passive fi lling by CSF. Accumulation of CSF in hydrocephalus is due to an imbalance between CSF production and absorption. Hydrocephalus has many causes and can be congenital or acquired.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus  results  from  overproduction,  impaired  circulation,  or  underabsorption  of  CSF  (Table  27-14).  CSF  is produced by the choroid plexus, a collection of highly vascularized and epithelium-lined villous folds located in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. CSF fl ows from the lateral ventricles  into  the  midline third ventricle via the interventricular  foramen  of  Monro.  From  there,  CSF  drains  through  the aqueduct of Sylvius into the midline fourth ventricle, which is  connected  to  the  posterior  fossa  cisterns  by  a  pair  of  laterally located foramina of Luschka and a midline foramen of Magendie. Cisterns are focally enlarged intracranial subarachnoid spaces that channel CSF from the ventricular system and the spinal subarachnoid space up to the hemispheric convexity, where CSF is absorbed into the systemic circulation by the subarachnoid villi. Any disturbance in the normal production,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
fl ow, and absorption in the aforementioned pathway will lead to accumulation of CSF and increased ICP with resultant ventriculomegaly.  Although  hydrocephalus  is  characterized  by ventricular  dilation,  a  signi fi cant  rise  in  ICP  usually  occurs before demonstrable change in ventricular size.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus is rarely caused by CSF production but can be  seen  in  choroid  plexus  disorders  such  as  choroid  plexus papillomas. Th e  most  common  cause  of  congenital  hydrocephalus is impaired circulation or obstruction of fl ow caused by structural abnormalities such as stenosis of the aqueduct of  Sylvius,  tumors,  malformations  (Chiari's  malformation, Dandy-Walker  malformation),  and  trauma-related  defects. Th e most common genetic cause of congenital hydrocephalus is X-linked hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis, which is associated with other CNS structural abnormalities as well as characteristic adducted thumbs. Hydrocephalus caused by decreased  CSF  absorption  is  infrequent  and  is  seen  mostly a ft er CNS infections that cause in fl ammation of the subarachnoid villi. Intrauterine TORCHES infections ( to xoplasmosis, r ubella, c ytomegalovirus  infection, he rpes  simplex, s yphilis) are classic examples.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrocephalus can be acute,  subacute,  or  chronic. Th e  rate at  which  CSF  accumulates  and  the  compliance  of  the  CNS determine the clinical presentation. In general, symptoms are nonspeci fi c  and  are  independent  of  the  underlying  cause.  If hydrocephalus  occurs  before  the  closure  of  cranial  sutures (approximately 18 to 24 months of age), the rise in ICP is generally mitigated by expansion of the intracranial space. Once cranial sutures have closed, the noncompliance of the system can lead to a rapid rise in ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In newborns and infants, hydrocephalus most o ft en manifests as an enlarged head resulting from separation of the cranial bone plates. Th e anterior fontanelle can be full or bulging, and the scalp  veins  may  be  prominent  because  of  increased venous  pressure. Th e  infant  may  also  display  so-called  sunsetting  eyes,  an  impaired  ability  to  gaze  upward  caused  by compression of the midbrain. Other signs and symptoms of CNS parenchymal compression include third and sixth nerve palsy,  papilledema,  bradycardia,  systemic  hypertension,  disturbances  in  respiratory  pattern,  endocrine  abnormalities, and impaired fl uid and electrolyte balance. Headaches along with nausea and vomiting result from stretching of the meninges and intracranial vessels. Infants may be irritable and then become progressively lethargic with increasing ICP . Stretching of the motor cortex can also occur if hydrocephalus is severe, resulting in spasticity. A continued rise in ICP that exhausts ventricular  expansion  capacity  can  cause  disruption  of  the ventricular  ependymal  lining,  which  leads  to  parenchymal edema and necrosis with resultant white matter atrophy (periventricular leukomalacia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any  newborn  or  infant  with  an  enlarged  head  should undergo  evaluation  for  hydrocephalus.  Serial  head  circumference measurement is an easy and e ff ective means of monitoring the progression of hydrocephalus. Most infants can be treated conservatively if head circumference increases at a slow and steady rate unless clinical  symptoms are present. Rapid increase in size usually requires surgical intervention even if the  child  is  relatively  asymptomatic.  Diagnosis  is  con fi rmed with neuroimaging (head ultrasonography for newborns, CT and MRI for infants and older children).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical therapy mainly consists of diuretic treatment (furosemide and acetazolamide decrease CSF production), although this  remains  controversial  in  children.  Serial  lumbar  punctures  have  also  been  tried,  but  are  only  a  temporizing  measure and do not signi fi cantly reduce the need for subsequent shunt surgery. Hydrocephalus associated with intracranial and intraventricular hemorrhage has been treated with fi brinolysis at some centers, but the bene fi ts have not been shown to outweigh the potential risks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e majority of children require surgical treatment in the form of either shunt placement or shuntless endoscopic third ventriculostomy  (ETV). Th e  former  consists  of  inserting  a catheter into the lateral ventricle that is connected to a oneway  valved  shunt  system  that  drains  into  the  right  atrium (ventriculoatrial  shunt)  or  the  peritoneal  space  (ventriculoperitoneal shunt). Shunt malfunction can be due to infection or mechanical failure and occurs most frequently in the fi rst year a ft er placement (approximately 40% failure rate). In ETV, an endoscope is placed via a burr hole fi rst into the lateral ventricle and then into the third ventricle, where a blunt perforation is made through its fl oor. Th is  allows shuntless CSF drainage from the ventricular system into the cisterns beneath the third ventricle. Choroid plexectomy is sometimes performed at the same time to decrease overall CSF production. ETV is most successful in children older than 1 year of age.  Finally,  any  structural  cause  of  hydrocephalus  such  as tumor or Chiari's malformation must also be addressed.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important anesthetic considerations in the child with hydrocephalus relate to the presence and severity of increased ICP. Positional change (head down, head fl exion), behavioral change  (crying),  and  physiologic  change  (hypercarbia)  all can a ff ect ICP. For this reason, the child should be kept in a head-up position with as few agitating maneuvers as possible. A  delicate  balance  must  be  maintained  between  promoting calmness by pharmacologic means and minimizing the risk of hypoventilation. A careful preoperative assessment, consisting of history taking, review of current clinical symptoms, and physical examination, usually provides the most useful information about the severity of ICP and its impact on the child's neurologic status. Speci fi cally, it is important to note the mental status (lethargy, drowsiness) as well as any focal neurologic de fi cits the child may have.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhalation induction may be acceptable in a child without clinical  and/or  radiographic  evidence  of  severe  intracranial hypertension. Volatile agents are potent cerebral vasodilators and increase ICP by increasing cerebral blood fl ow. Th is e ff ect can be attenuated by preinduction hyperventilation, but this is not an easily accomplished or feasible task in most children. Children with signi fi cantly increased ICP are usually lethargic, which permits easier awake intravenous catheter placement. With the exception of ketamine, virtually all intravenous anesthetic agents lower ICP by decreasing cerebral blood volume and generally preserve cerebral perfusion pressure better than volatile agents. Ketamine is contraindicated because it can precipitate a sudden increase in ICP and rapid neurologic decompensation. Th e neurophysiologic e ff ects of dexmedetomidine, an α 2 -agonist, is not as well understood. Studies show that it generally decreases cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood fl ow and has minimal e ff ect on the cerebral metabolic rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Succinylcholine may be used if necessary. It can increase cerebral blood fl ow and ICP, but the e ff ects are transient and can be attenuated by premedication with a "defasciculating" dose of a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normocapnia  should  be  maintained  for  patients  with normal  ICP,  whereas  mild  hypocapnia  is  helpful  to  prevent further  increases  in  ICP;  severe  hypocapnia  can  precipitate cerebral ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive blood pressure monitoring is not needed in most cases of shunt surgery or ETV , but may be useful to help guide anesthetic management to optimize cerebral perfusion pressure, particularly if an ICP monitor is in place (cerebral perfusion pressure = mean arterial pressure -ICP).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Finally, positional changes can have serious consequences. Extreme positioning of the head ( fl exion, lateral rotation) can cause further displacement of a structural abnormality (Chiari's malformation) and impair venous drainage, which leads to increased ICP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular Anomalies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular  anomalies  are  uncommon  in  the  pediatric population. However, they are an important cause of pediatric stroke  and  intracranial  hemorrhage,  each  with  signi fi cant morbidity  and  mortality.  Stroke,  commonly  regarded  as  a problem limited to the adult population, is among the top 10 causes  of  death  in  children.  Vascular  abnormalities  such  as arteriovenous malformations, cavernous malformations, and aneurysms  are  the  most  important  causes  of  hemorrhagic stroke,  which  accounts  for  nearly  half  of  all  stroke  cases  in children.  Cerebrovascular  arteriopathy,  such  as  moyamoya disease, has recently become recognized as a major cause of ischemic stroke in children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Minimizing  the  risk  of  intracranial  bleeding  and  preventing  cerebral  ischemia  are  the  most  important  goals  in  the perioperative management of children with cerebrovascular anomalies. For children with moyamoya disease, a thorough preoperative assessment, particularly of the neurologic status, is extremely important; any de fi cits should be noted. It is  also  important to obtain a baseline trend of blood pressures during both awake and asleep states to determine the lowest pressure that the child may tolerate. Th e child should not  be  subjected  to  prolonged  periods  of  fasting,  because dehydration  may  precipitate  cerebral  ischemia. Th us,  preoperative  hydration  is  prudent  to  minimize  hypotension upon  induction  of  anesthesia.  Preoperative  anxiolysis  is recommended;  hyperventilation  with  anxiety  or  with  crying must be avoided, because hypocarbia will lead to cerebral  vasoconstriction, which further compromises cerebral perfusion. If an intravenous catheter is not in place, a slow inhalation  induction  is  acceptable  as  long  as  the  agent  is titrated to minimize change in systemic blood pressure. An arterial line should be placed as soon as possible to establish  uninterrupted blood pressure monitoring. Th roughout the  intraoperative  course,  blood  pressure  must  be  maintained within the child's baseline range. Ventilation parameters  should  be  set  to  maintain  normocarbia.  Hypocarbia is detrimental because it will induce cerebral vasoconstriction; hypercarbia should also be avoided because vasodilation of the normal vasculature may create a steal from the a ff ected  vessels.  Intraoperative  electroencephalography  is sometimes  performed  to  detect  potential  ischemia  related to surgical manipulation. Any changes in anesthetic level or drug administration should be communicated to the surgical team to avoid misinterpretation of potential anestheticrelated signal changes as ischemia. Th e  child is  still  at  risk for cerebral ischemia even a ft er the completion of the surgery, because several months are required for new collateral formation to become fully established a ft er indirect bypass procedures. Direct bypass procedures may reestablish fl ow immediately,  but  there  is  an  attendant  risk  of  reperfusion injury  that  may  lead  to  cerebral  edema.  For  this  reason,  a smooth emergence with adequate analgesia is important to avoid extreme hemodynamic changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  same  principles  apply  to  children  with  arteriovenous malformations who come for surgery; they are also at risk of ischemia.  In  addition,  it  is  important  to  avoid  hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
perioperatively to minimize risk of bleeding or rupture, because the vessels of the malformation have weakened walls and may even  have  aneurysmal  dilatations.  Sudden  hemorrhage  can occur during the dissection and resection of arteriovenous malformations; thus, large-bore intravenous access must be established and reserved blood products arranged. If criteria are met, the child should be extubated as soon as possible to allow for neurologic examination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spina Bifida

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spina bi fi da is the most common form of neural tube defect (Figure 27-2), characterized by a cle ft in the spinal column. Th e  defect  results  from  abnormal  fusion  of  one  or  more vertebral posterior arches. Th is cle ft can be covered by normal-appearing skin, which results in a hidden defect ( spina bi fi da occulta ) without involvement of the underlying neural structures.  Meninges  can  herniate  through  the  spinal  cle ft , creating a CSFfi lled sac ( meningocele ) with or without skin covering. More o ft en, both the spinal cord and meninges herniate through the spinal cle ft ( myelomeningocele )  forming a defect that lacks a skin, and sometimes dural, covering. Overall, spina bi fi da represents the second most common type of congenital defect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally, the neuroectoderm invaginates and closes to form the  primary neural tube from which the future brain, spinal cord, spinal column, and overlying skin derive. Failure of neural tube closure, an event that normally is completed by 28 days' gestation, results in abnormal formation or fusion of any of the aforementioned  elements. Th e  precise  causes  of  neural  tube defects are not known. Over the years, multiple teratogens and vitamin de fi ciencies have been implicated. Th e clearest causal relationship that has been established is between folic acid de fi -ciency and myelomeningocele. However, the exact mechanism by which folic acid may be protective against myelomeningocele  formation  is  unclear.  Valproic  acid  and  carbamazepine have  also  been  strongly  associated  with  neural  tube  defects. A likely explanation for the e ff ect of valproic acid is that it is a known folate antagonist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  varies  widely  and  depends  on  the elements involved and the severity of the defect. Spina bi fi da occulta,  as  its  name  implies,  is  sometimes  discovered  only incidentally,  because  normal  skin  hides  the  defect  and  the mild spinal cle ft does not usually cause neurologic de fi cits. In most cases, however, the overlying skin displays an abnormal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meningoceles  are  normally  diagnosed  prenatally  by  fetal ultrasonography or at birth by the presence of a dorsal spinal mass.  By  de fi nition,  only  the  meninges  are  a ff ected  without nerve tissue involvement. For this reason, these patients generally  do  not  have  neurologic de fi cits  and  are  not  at  noticeable risk of developing long-term neurologic sequelae. Once the meningocele is discovered, expeditious surgical repair is needed to prevent sac injury, infection, and CSF leak. Although nerves are not involved, there can be nerve root entrapment by fi brous bands in the sac. Th us, nerve injury is a potential problem during surgical sac ligation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myelomeningocele, in which a portion of the spinal cord is extruded into the herniated meningeal sac, is the most common type of spina bi fi da.  O ft en the spinal cord ends in the sac with the spinal canal exposed in a splayed-open fashion, a  condition  known  as neural  placode. Children  born  with  a myelomeningocele have varying degrees of motor and sensory de fi cits as well as bowel and bladder dysfunction. Any damage to the cord and spinal nerves evident at birth is usually irreversible. In severe cases, children may be born paraplegic and are bound for a wheelchair-dependent life. Over 90% of children born with a myelomeningocele also have a Chiari II malformation  (also  known  as Arnold-Chiari  malformation ) which consists of caudal displacement of the cerebellar vermis, fourth ventricle, and medulla down through the foramen magnum into  the  cervical  spinal  canal.  Hydrocephalus  and other developmental brain abnormalities are also common. In addition, myelomeningoceles are associated with a high incidence of cardiac, esophageal, intestinal, renal, urogenital, and orthopedic anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meticulous care at birth is needed to prevent sac rupture and damage to the spinal cord. If the spinal canal is exposed, the myelomeningocele also requires moistened sponge coverage to avoid drying of the neural tissues. Surgical closure usually takes  place  within  24  to  48  hours  of  birth.  Hydrocephalus, if  present,  may  also  require  surgical  intervention.  A  recent study comparing prenatal with postnatal repair of myelomeningocele showed that prenatal repair was associated with a lower  rate  of  need  for  shunt  surgery  as  well  as  a  lower  rate of death at 12 months of postnatal age. It was also associated with improved long-term mental and motor function. Prenatal surgery, however, is o ff ered only at a few centers, has many exclusion  criteria,  and  is  associated  with  preterm  birth  and maternal morbidity. Th e majority of children with myelomeningocele have lifelong motor and sensory neurologic impairment as well as fecal and urinary incontinence.

Positioning  is  one  of  the  most  critical  aspects  in  the  perioperative  care  of  the  child  with  open  spina  bi fi da  lesions

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(meningocele and myelomeningocele). Maintaining the patient in the prone or lateral decubitus position is essential to avoid sac and nerve injury, particularly for myelomeningoceles. In some cases, the patient may be elevated on so ft rolls or a donut-shaped gel support to avoid compression of the defect, so that endotracheal intubation can be accomplished with the patient in the supine position. However, some defects may be too large to risk supine positioning, and the anesthesiologist must  always  be  prepared  for  a  di ffi cult  intubation  with  the patient  in  the  lateral  decubitus  position.  Regardless  of  positioning during induction, surgical repair is always performed with the patient in the prone position. Because of this, meticulous attention must be paid to avoid compression injury to the eyes, brachial plexus, and any ventral defects such as bladder exstrophy,  as  well  as  compression  of  the  inferior  vena  cava with resultant impaired venous return.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  comprehensive  preoperative  assessment  is  needed  to identify speci fi c anesthetic risks, because myelomeningoceles are o ft en associated with other congenital anomalies. Although an Arnold-Chiari malformation is present in almost all cases of myelomeningocele, a clinically signi fi cant increase in ICP is  rare;  nevertheless,  this  must  always  be  a  consideration  in the management of anesthesia. Respiratory insu ffi ciency and apnea  are  also  important  perioperative  concerns  because  of potential  brainstem  compression. Th us,  tracheal  extubation must take place only a ft er the patient has regained adequate spontaneous respiratory e ff ort and ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  neuromonitoring  is  usually  carried  out  to guide surgical repair. For this reason, an anesthetic plan that minimizes signal interference is important. Latex precautions should be observed for all of these patients, because repeated exposure to latex products throughout their lifetime predisposes these children to the development of severe latex allergy. Finally, myelomeningocele repair can be associated with signi fi cant  blood  and  evaporative fl uid  loss. Th is  is  especially true for large defects that require extensive skin undermining for closure. Adequate intravenous access must be established before the start of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniosynostosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniosynostosis  is  de fi ned  as  premature  closure  of  one  or more cranial sutures. At birth, the cranium consists of fl oating  bone  plates  that  allow  for  rapid  postnatal  brain  growth require  a  proportionate  increase  in  the  intracranial  space. Four  major  sutures  separate  these  bone  plates:  (1)  metopic suture  separates  the  frontal  bones,  (2)  sagittal  suture  separates the parietal bones, (3) coronal suture separates the frontal from the parietal bones, and (4) lambdoid suture separates the parietal bones from the occipital bone (Figure 27-3). Th e sagittal suture is a ff ected in over half of all cases of premature closure.  Craniosynostosis  can  involve  one  or  more  sutures. Single-suture craniosynostosis is usually an isolated fi nding. Multiple-suture  closure  is  o ft en  associated  with  other  skull base suture abnormalities as seen in Apert's and Crouzon's syndromes.

PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniosynostosis can be a primary or a secondary event. In primary  craniosynostosis,  intrinsic  bone  ossi fi cation  abnormalities cause premature closure of one or more sutures. In the  secondary  form,  premature  closure  is  due  to  slowed  or arrested brain growth because bone plates are normally kept apart only by the outward force exerted by a growing brain. Brain growth failure causes premature closure of all sutures, resulting  in  a  relatively  normal-shaped  but  microcephalic head.  On  the  other  hand,  closure  of  a  single  or  an  unbalanced  combination  of  sutures  results  in  various  abnormal head shapes (Table 27-15). Because brain growth is restricted in one direction, brain growth can continue only along unrestricted  suture  lines,  usually  in  a  direction  perpendicular  to the a ff ected axis. For example, premature closure of the sagittal  suture  prevents  normal  lateral  brain  growth. Th erefore, the brain can expand only in an anterior-posterior direction, which results in an elongated head shape or scaphocephaly. Th e  exact  mechanisms  for  primary  craniosynostosis  are unclear,  but  major  theories  include  abnormal  dural  attachment that prevents bone plate separation and abnormal osteoblastic activity that causes accelerated bone fusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniosynostosis is usually evident at birth or during the fi rst 2 years of life when rapid brain growth takes place (the brain achieves 75% of its adult size by 2 years of age; the rest occurs between 2 and 18 years of age). An increase in ICP occurs when brain growth continues against a nonexpanding calvaria. Th us, increased ICP is not usually seen in secondary craniosynostosis  since  there  is  little  or  no  brain  growth.  Craniosynostosis involving one and even two sutures is also not associated with increased  ICP  because  the  brain  can  still  expand  in  at  least one  other  direction.  Premature  closure  of  multiple  sutures frequently leads to increased ICP; children may present with lethargy, nausea and vomiting, and papilledema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Head  shape  depends  on  the  suture(s)  involved.  Scaphocephaly  was  discussed  earlier.  Other  examples  of  abnormal head  shapes  are  brachycephaly  ( fl at,  broad  head  resulting from  coronal  suture  closure),  plagiocephaly  ("twisted  head" resulting from unbalanced closure of the coronal or lambdoid suture),  and  trigonocephaly  (triangular  head  shape  with  a peaked forehead resulting from metopic suture closure). Th e cloverleaf  skull  deformity,  also  known  as kleeblattschädel, is the most severe type of craniosynostosis in which all sutures except the metopic and squamosal ones are fused.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In most cases of nonsyndromic craniosynostosis with only one or two sutures a ff ected, the skull deformity poses only a cosmetic problem with no physiologic sequelae. However, the physical  deformity  can  adversely  impact  the  child's  psychologic and social development if le ft untreated. Multiple-suture craniosynostosis is o ft en associated with some degree of mental delay as well as hydrocephalus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  repair  may  be  done  endoscopically  (strip  craniectomy)  or  may  involve  extensive  calvarial  reconstruction depending  on  the  deformity. Th e  latter  usually  requires  a collaboration  between  specialists  in  neurosurgery  and  craniofacial plastic surgery and is associated with a much longer operative time and recovery period. Timing of the repair depends  on  the  surgeon;  some  prefer  to  perform  repair between  3  and  6  months  of  age  and  others  between  8  and 12 months of age. Regardless, surgical correction is preferably performed before the age of 1 year to take advantage of the malleable  skull,  to  optimize  the  potential  for  reossi fi cation, and to decrease the risk of neurologic damage, because this time period is associated with the greatest neural plasticity. Early intervention is also necessary to provide room for rapid brain growth during the fi rst 2 years of life.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A thorough preoperative evaluation is necessary, with particular attention to potential intracranial hypertension as well as co-existing morbidities. Associated anomalies of other organ systems (e.g., congenital heart disease) must be well delineated. In syndromic craniosynostosis other craniofacial abnormalities  (midface  and  mandibular  hypoplasia)  are  o ft en  present that  can  make  airway  management  extremely  challenging. For this reason, equipment for handling a potentially di ffi cult airway must be prepared before the induction of anesthesia. When relevant, the anesthetic plan must also be tailored to avoid ICP increase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once  the  trachea is intubated, controlled ventilation should be set to maintain normocarbia unless hypocarbia is needed  to  minimize  preexisting  intracranial  hypertension. Large-bore  intravenous  access  is  necessary,  as  is  real-time blood pressure monitoring via an intraarterial catheter. Th e latter also allows for frequent blood sampling. Even in strip craniectomy procedures, excessive blood loss can still occur. Large-volume blood loss is usually the norm in open cranial vault  reconstructive  procedures  (as  high  as  one  half  to  one blood volume in the majority of cases). Blood products must be available (preferably already in the operating room) before skin incision. Because most patients undergoing craniosynostosis repair are young infants, techniques to reduce blood loss  (acute  normovolemic  hemodilution)  and  to  minimize exposure to allogeneic blood (autodonation) are not feasible. Cell salvage can be done for small infants, because relevant cell  saver  reservoir  sizes  (as  small  as  25  mL)  are  now  available. Use of anti fi brinolytics such as aminocaproic acid and tranexamic  acid  have  shown  success  in  decreasing  intraoperative blood loss and reducing the total transfusion volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
However,  large-scale  studies  involving  the  craniosynostosis population are lacking.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other  major  intraoperative  concerns  are  hypothermia, hypovolemia (large area of exposure for an extended period of time), and venous air embolism. Some practitioners elect to  place  a  central  venous  catheter  to  evacuate  air  from  the right atrium should a large air embolism occur. However, the small-sized catheter used in infants does not permit rapid air evacuation. Precordial Doppler imaging has a high sensitivity for detecting air embolism before hemodynamic changes are evident and is a valuable tool in all cases of open cranial vault reconstruction. Nitrous oxide should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  much of  the  infant's  body  as  possible  should  be  covered  with  forced-hot-air  blankets  to  minimize  hypothermia because of the large area of exposure, lengthy surgical time, and  large-volume fl uid  and  blood  resuscitation.  Signi fi cant periorbital  and  facial  edema  can  occur  and  may  preclude immediate extubation. Unless there are concomitant craniofacial anomalies, most infants can be considered for extubation in the operating room if the edema is limited to the upper half of the face. Except for otherwise healthy infants who have undergone endoscopic repair, postoperative care in the ICU is required.

CRANIOFACIAL ANOMALIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cleft Lip and Palate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orofacial cle ft s are a heterogeneous group of tissue approximation defects  manifesting  as  cle ft lip,  cle ft lip  and  palate, and  cle ft palate. Th ese  defects  can  occur  in  isolation  or  in association with a congenital syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cle ft lip is thought to result from failure of the fusion between the medial nasal and maxillary processes in early gestation. Th e defect usually occurs at the junction between the central and lateral portions of the upper lip on either side. Cle ft lip may be limited to the upper lip or may extend into the alveolar ridge.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cle ft palate results from partial or complete failure in the apposition and fusion of the palatal shelves, which normally occurs  between  8  and  12  weeks  of  gestation. Complete cle ft palate denotes involvement of the uvula, so ft palate, and hard palate. In some cases of cle ft palate, the hard palate defect may be covered by a mucous membrane that may extend to partially cover the so ft palate cle ft as well; such defects are termed submucous cle ft palate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Newborns with orofacial cle ft s should have immediate evaluation and early referral to a craniofacial specialist. Depending on the defect, the child may be at risk for aspiration and airway obstruction, particularly if additional craniofacial anomalies are  present.  Feeding  di ffi culty  is  universal,  because  the  cle ft defect prevents the generation of adequate negative pressure necessary  for  sucking.  For  this  reason,  failure  to  thrive  is  a common problem in children with cle ft lip  and  cle ft palate. Special feeding bottles and nipples are available that help to restore a more e ff ective and energy-e ffi cient feeding process. A multidisciplinary team of physicians, dentist,  nutritionist, and speech therapist is recommended to address the physical and psychologic concerns that arise in di ff erent developmental stages of childhood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cle ft palates are associated with a higher incidence of otitis media, because abnormal palatal muscle insertion impairs middle ear drainage. Th e  threshold for performing myringotomy with ear tube placement is generally lower in these children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cle ft lip repair is typically performed between 6 and 12 weeks of age, whereas cle ft palate repair is done at a later age, between 9  and  14  months.  Timing  and  sequence  of  surgical  repair (primary vs. staged repair) depend on surgeon preference in most cases. Timing of cle ft palate repair is aimed at preventing further speech abnormalities and at minimizing distortion in facial growth (as can occur if repair is done too early).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Velopharyngeal insu ffi ciency may persist even a ft er complete cle ft palate repair. Th e velopharyngeal sphincter or so ft palate and the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls normally appose to create velopharyngeal closure during speech, which prevents air from escaping out the nasal passage. Velopharyngeal insu ffi ciency leads to a hypernasal voice, improper escape of air through the nose during speech, and improper pronunciation of certain consonants. Pharyngoplasty is performed to treat velopharyngeal insu ffi ciency in older children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with cle ft lip  or  palate  generally  undergo  standard inhalation induction of anesthesia followed by endotracheal intubation via direct laryngoscopy uneventfully. Concurrent cle ft lip and palate defects as well as syndromic orofacial cle ft s may  portend  di ffi cult  intubation,  and  appropriate  preparations for a di ffi cult airway must be made in advance. If a laryngeal mask airway is considered to aid intubation, the device must be placed carefully to prevent disruption of any previous cle ft palate repairs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preformed oral RAE tracheal tubes are preferred for their low  pro fi le  and  better fi t  with  the  Dingman-Dott  mouth retractor used during surgery. Meticulous attention must be paid to securing the endotracheal tube, because frequent surgical  manipulations  predispose  to  unintentional  extubation. Cle ft repair  may  also  be  done  in  positions  that  increase  the risk of unplanned extubation (e.g., Rose's position, in which the patient's head is pulled over the edge of the operating table and placed in the surgeon's lap).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant edema of the tongue, palate, and pharyngeal tissues can occur from compression by the mouth retractor and may preclude immediate extubation. Placement of a nasopharyngeal airway by the surgeon in patients with known di ffi cult airway  or  anticipated  di ffi cult  extubation  may  be  helpful  in some cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pain control must be balanced against the risk of respiratory depression.  Intravenous  or  rectal  acetaminophen  as  well  as regional anesthesia (infraorbital blocks) should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mandibular Hypoplasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoplasia of the mandible is a common congenital anomaly. Its  presentation  varies  greatly  depending  on  the  cause  and whether it is associated with other craniofacial skeletal and so ft tissue  abnormalities.  It  may  arise  as  a  result  of  extrinsic  intrauterine constraint on development or intrinsic growth disturbance. Th e majority of cases occur as part of a co-existing syndrome; nonsyndromic  isolated  defects  are  rare.  A  universal  feature in  congenital  mandibular  hypoplasia  is  airway  compromise resulting  from  the  constricted  mandibular  space  with  resultant glossoptosis (posterior prolapse of the tongue). Th e  following sections discuss several congenital disorders that share mandibular hypoplasia as a prominent feature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PIERRE ROBIN SEQUENCE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pierre  Robin  sequence,  previously  termed Pierre  Robin  syndrome, consists  of  three  congenital  orofacial  abnormalities: micrognathia (small mandible) or retrognathia (posterior displacement of mandible), glossoptosis, and cle ft palate (present in  almost  all  cases).  It  is  more  appropriately  termed sequence rather than syndrome because the latter is reserved to describe disorders of morphogenesis in which a single cause (e.g., chromosomal deletion) produces multiple defects simultaneously. In Pierre Robin sequence, the events occur in sequence, with one defect leading to the next. Th e most widely accepted theory for the cause of Pierre Robin sequence is one of mechanical constraint. Mandibular hypoplasia, either from physical intrauterine compression or intrinsic genetic growth de fi ciency, is thought to be the initial event. Mandibular crowding displaces the tongue

<!-- PAGE=? -->
posteriorly and superiorly, and thereby prevents closure of the palatal shelves with resultant cle ft palate.  Autosomal recessive and  X-linked  inheritance  patterns  are  possible.  Pierre  Robin sequence can be syndromic or nonsyndromic. Some congenital disorders associated with Pierre Robin sequence are Stickler's syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome, hemifacial microsomia, and fetal alcohol syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ff ected newborns have varying degrees of airway obstruction, o ft en in association with feeding di ffi culties and gastroesophageal re fl ux. Intervention is mostly aimed at restoring a patent airway. Additional anomalies that independently cause feeding  problems  are  also  addressed.  Treatments  for  airway obstruction range from simple lateral or prone positioning to tongue-lip adhesion, mandibular distraction, and even tracheostomy. Particularly in nonsyndromic cases, airway obstruction decreases over time with mandibular growth, but most patients  still  require  early  surgical  intervention  to  address glossoptosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMIFACIAL MICROSOMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemifacial microsomia is the one of the most common congenital facial anomalies (second only to cle ft lip  and palate). It is a facial asymmetry disorder that unilaterally a ff ects bone, muscle,  and  so ft tissue  structures.  Hemifacial  microsomia typically  a ff ects  the  lower  half  of  the  face  with  prominent hypoplasia  of  the  malar-maxillary-mandibular  complex  and variable involvement of the ear, temporomandibular joint, and orbit as well as the cervical spine. Goldenhar's syndrome (oculoauriculovertebral syndrome or OAV) can be considered the most severe form of syndromic hemifacial microsomia, characterized by colobomas and vertebral anomalies in addition to facial asymmetry. Beyond the obvious structural abnormality,  osseous  impingement  on  nerves  can  lead  to  neurologic de fi cits  such  as  hearing  loss.  Some  experts  advocate  the  use of classi fi cation systems like OMENS ( o cular/orbital anomaly, m andibular hypoplasia, e ar anomaly, n erve involvement, s o ft tissue de fi ciency) to better categorize disease presentation, as this may allow for more targeted treatment plans. Th e exact cause of hemifacial microsomia is yet to be determined, but it is generally thought to be related to developmental abnormalities of the fi rst and possibly second branchial arches.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treacher  Collins  syndrome,  also  known  as mandibulofacial dysostosis (defective ossi fi cation or formation of bone), is a rare craniofacial  anomaly  with  an  autosomal  dominant  disorder mode of inheritance and variable expression. Th ere is bilateral and symmetric underdevelopment of structures deriving from the fi rst and second pharyngeal arch, groove, and pouch leading to hypoplasia of the supraorbital rims, zygoma, midfacial bones, and mandible as well as ear deformities and cle ft palate (seen in 30%). Th e Treacher Collins syndrome facies features downward-sloping  palpebral fi ssures,  small  or  absent  cheek bones,  a  normal-sized  nose  that  may  appear  large  against background hypoplasia, malformed pinnae, ear tags, abnormal external auditory canal, and receding chin. Occasionally, choanal  atresia  may  be  present.  Intelligence  is  usually  not a ff ected  unless  hearing  loss  is  not  promptly  recognized  and addressed. A small percentage of patients with Treacher Collins syndrome may have concomitant congenital heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immediate  concerns  revolve  around  airway  protection. Tracheostomy  may  be  needed  at  birth  to  restore  airway patency. Swallowing di ffi culties lead to failure to thrive, and early gastrostomy is frequently needed for feeding. Children with  Treacher  Collins  syndrome  typically  require  multiple craniofacial and dental corrective surgeries throughout their childhood and adolescence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Concerns  central  to  the  perioperative  care  of  patients  with mandibular hypoplasia relate mainly to airway management. A  detailed  preoperative  assessment  will  reveal  co-existing abnormalities, which occur in the majority of cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with mandibular hypoplasia, especially in association with Treacher Collins syndrome and hemifacial microsomia,  not  only  are  di ffi cult  to  intubate  but  may  be  nearly impossible to mask ventilate. Th erefore, it is not always feasible to perform endotracheal intubation a ft er the induction of general anesthesia. When anesthesia can be safely induced, maintenance of  spontaneous  ventilation  is  of  utmost  importance before  the  airway  is  secured.  Maneuvers  to  pull  the  tongue forward are helpful, since glossoptosis is a major component of  airway  obstruction.  A  laryngeal  mask  airway  may  serve well to assist with ventilation and as a conduit for intubation. Intubating laryngeal mask airway devices such as the Air-Q now exist in pediatric sizes that accommodate most neonates and infants. Direct laryngoscopy is generally di ffi cult regardless of blade type. Alternative means for visualizing the vocal cords such as traditional fi berscope, videolaryngoscope, and optical laryngoscope must be prepared and ready for use from the outset. Several surgical procedures speci fi c to mandibular hypoplasia require nasotracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs with respiratory-depressant e ff ects  should  be  used sparingly.  Analgesic  adjuncts  including  dexmedetomidine, ketamine,  acetaminophen,  and  regional  analgesia  should  be considered  whenever  possible.  Timing  of  extubation  is  as important as, if not more important than, initial airway management, since signi fi cant postsurgical edema and in-situ distraction devices may be present that will make rescue mask ventilation  and  intubation  extremely  di ffi cult  or  impossible. Some patients should be kept intubated for several days until better extubation conditions exist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Midface Hypoplasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whereas syndromes with mandibular hypoplasia have underdevelopment of the lower half of the face, disorders with midface hypoplasia result in underdevelopment of the eye sockets, cheek bones, and upper jaw. Growth de fi ciency of the midface produces  a  characteristic  concave  appearance  with  wide-set eyes (hypertelorism) that are o ft en proptotic, fl attened nasal bridge,  as  well  as  a  large  underbite.  Isolated  mild  forms  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
midface hypoplasia can occur and do not require treatment unless there is signi fi cant proptosis (predisposing to keratoconjunctivitis),  severe  malocclusion,  and  obstructive  sleep apnea. Syndromic midface hypoplasia is frequently associated with multiple other congenital anomalies such as craniosynostosis, syndactyly, and congenital heart disease. Achondroplasia (dwar fi sm) is a well-recognized disorder featuring midface hypoplasia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
APERT'S SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Apert's syndrome is a rare inherited disorder (autosomal dominant) characterized by acrocephalosyndactyly. Th e cranium, midface, and bones and so ft tissues of the hands and feet are a ff ected. Th e result is a combination of craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, and symmetric syndactyly of the extremities with  cutaneous  and  bony  fusion.  Turribrachycephaly  (towering  of  the  skull),  hypertelorism,  and  low-set  ears  are  also prominent  features.  Occasionally,  choanal  atresia,  tracheal stenosis,  cervical  spine  fusion,  congenital  heart  defects,  and genitourinary anomalies are also present. Premature closure of the skull bones causing increased ICP may be an important cause of developmental delay.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  patients  with  Apert's  syndrome  experience  some degree of airway obstruction as a result of small nasopharyngeal  and  oropharyngeal  dimensions,  particularly  if  choanal atresia and/or tracheal stenosis are present. Obstructive sleep apnea is common and must be addressed early to avoid development of cor pulmonale. Eye complaints include proptosis and exophthalmos predisposing to corneal injury, amblyopia, strabismus, and optic nerve atrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CROUZON'S SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Crouzon's syndrome  shares many  clinical features with Apert's syndrome, but the viscera and extremities are spared. Also  known  as craniofacial  dysostosis (malformation  of  the face and skull bones), it is a hereditary disorder (autosomal dominant) characterized by craniosynostosis, midface hypoplasia, mandibular prognathism, and shallow eye sockets with hypertelorism and proptosis. As a result of frequent premature fusion of the coronal sutures, brachycephaly (short and broad head)  is  usually  seen.  Mental  delay  is  not  an  intrinsic  part of Crouzon's syndrome but may occur due to increased ICP and hearing impairment. Conductive hearing loss is common due  to  ear  canal  abnormalities  (atresia  or  stenosis).  Airway obstructive problems are similar to those seen in Apert's syndrome. Of note, acanthosis nigricans is seen in approximately 5% of patients with Crouzon's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with midface hypoplasia typically come to the operating room for midface advancement procedures, adenotonsillectomy, and cranial vault reconstruction if craniosynostosis is present. Some may require tracheostomy at an early age to establish airway patency. A thorough preoperative assessment is  important to evaluate for degree of airway obstruction as well as presence of comorbid conditions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with mandibular hypoplasia, mask ventilation and tracheal intubation may be extremely di ffi cult, especially if there are  cervical  spine  abnormalities  that  limit  neck  extension. Preparations for a potentially di ffi cult airway must be made, as would be done in any case with an anticipated challenging airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Given the characteristic  proptosis,  special  attention  must be paid to the eyes to avoid corneal and compression ophthalmic injury. A history of headache, vomiting, and somnolence should  raise  suspicion  of  increased  ICP ,  and  the  anesthetic plan should be tailored accordingly. Finally, intravenous access may be extremely di ffi cult in patients with Apert's syndrome depending on the severity of syndactyly.

UPPER AIRWAY DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Epiglottitis (Supraglottitis)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute epiglottitis, also termed supraglottitis, is a life-threatening infection of the epiglottis and adjacent supraglottic structures. Speci fi cally, it is a cellulitis of the strati fi ed squamous epithelium of these structures, including the lingular surface of the epiglottis, the aryepiglottic folds, and the arytenoids. Occasionally, the uvula is also a ff ected. Subglottic structures, including the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, are generally spared.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute epiglottitis results from direct bacterial invasion of the epithelial layer of the supraglottic structures, which leads to rapid and severe in fl ammation. Th e causative organism can be bacterial, viral, or fungal, and the posterior nasopharynx serves  as  the  primary  source  of  pathogens  in  many  cases. A  bacterial  origin  is  most  common  in  otherwise  healthy children.  Historically, Haemophilus  in fl uenzae type  b  (Hib) was the main pathogen and accounted for over 75% of cases. Th e  institution  of  widespread  immunization  against  Hib  in the  late  1980s  has  since  dramatically  decreased  the  overall incidence of epiglottitis. Today, immunization against Hib is recommended for all children younger than 5 years of age, with  the fi rst  dose  given  at  2  months  of  age.  Nonetheless, epiglottitis can still occur in fully Hib-immunized children, which may be due to the acellular composition of some Hib vaccines. In the postvaccination era, the primary pathogens include Haemophilus  parain fl uenzae, group  A  streptococci, pneumococci,  and  staphylococci.  In  immunocompromised patients, atypical pathogens such as Candida species, herpes simplex type 1, varicella-zoster virus, and parain fl uenza virus must also be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  highest  incidence  of  epiglottitis  has  historically  been seen  in  children  aged  2  to  6  years,  although  this  trend re fl ects  mostly  the  pre-Hib  vaccination  era.  Epiglottitis can  also  occur  in  infants,  older  children,  and  occasionally adults. Th e classic presentation of acute epiglottitis is that of a  toxic-appearing, agitated child with a high fever and the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
615

<!-- PAGE=? -->
so-called 4 Ds: dysphagia, dysphonia, dyspnea, and drooling. Parents typically report a history of the child's complaining of  severe  sore  throat  with  mu ffl ed voice and sudden onset of  high  fever.  Typical  symptoms  of  upper  respiratory  tract infection such as rhinorrhea and cough are usually absent, although a croupy cough may be present in rare cases; the cough  may  confuse  the  clinical  picture  and  make  it  more di ffi cult  to  distinguish  the  condition  from  laryngotracheobronchitis,  a  di ff erent  infectious  entity  (Table  27-16). Th e child o ft en assumes a characteristic tripod posture with the trunk leaning forward supported by the arms and a hyperextended neck with the chin thrust forward in an e ff ort to maximize air fl ow. Inspiratory stridor is a late feature and should alert  the  practitioner to impending complete upper airway obstruction.  Indeed,  the  course  of  acute  epiglottitis  spirals downward rapidly, and the condition may be fatal within 6 to 12 hours of onset of initial symptoms. Th ere is considerable variability among clinicians regarding the use of imaging in making  the  diagnosis.  A  lateral  neck  radiograph  typically shows the thumb sign, representing the shadow created by a swollen epiglottis obstructing the airway. Because this is a rapidly fatal disease, the diagnosis is based principally on the clinical picture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common and feared complication of acute epiglottitis  is  airway  obstruction,  thus  the  need  for  expeditious  diagnosis  and  airway  control.  Other  complications  of epiglottitis  include  epiglottic  abscess,  secondary  infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(e.g.,  pneumonia,  cervical  adenitis,  meningitis,  and  bacteremia leading to distant infections such as septic arthritis), and necrotizing epiglottitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mainstay in the management of acute epiglottitis is airway control, and its achievement should always involve a team of a pediatric anesthesiologist, a pediatric intensivist, and an otolaryngologist. Th e child should be kept in the tripod posture. Any fear- or agitation-provoking maneuver or procedure such as establishment of intravenous access should be deferred until de fi nitive airway protection is established. Expeditious transfer to the operating room should be undertaken with oxygen, pulse oximetry, and other resuscitative tools available, including medications and intubation equipment. Th e child should always  be  accompanied  by  a  physician  with  expert  airway management  skills  during  transfer.  Equipment  for  tracheal intubation and possible emergent tracheostomy-needle cricothyrotomy must be immediately available. Styletted endotracheal tubes in one to two sizes smaller than that predicted by the child's age must be prepared, because the airway caliber will invariably be reduced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia is induced via inhalation with the child in a sitting position. A calm induction with maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is paramount to safe practice. Application of moderate continuous positive pressure (10 to 15 cm H 2 O) will help to minimize further reduction in airway caliber caused by collapse of the pharyngeal so ft tissues with anesthesia induction.  Once  the  child  is  adequately  anesthetized,  intravenous access can be established, followed by direct laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation. An air leak around the endotracheal tube at or below 25 cm H 2 O of pressure must be demonstrated to prevent additional tracheal damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative ICU care is mandatory. Timing of extubation depends on resolution of clinical signs and symptoms (abatement of fever, neutrophilia, and increasing air leak around the endotracheal  tube)  con fi rmed by  repeat  examination  of  the supraglottic structures by direct vision or fl exible fi broscopy. In most cases, the child can be extubated in 24 to 48 hours a ft er  initiation  of  appropriate  therapy  (antibiotics  with  or without corticosteroids).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Croup (Laryngotracheitis and Laryngotracheobronchitis)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Croup is a common infectious disease of the subglottic airway structures, including but not limited to the larynx and trachea. Because of the variability in the level of involvement, the  term croup has  been  used  in  the  general  literature  to describe a variety of upper airway disorders, including laryngitis,  laryngotracheitis,  laryngotracheobronchitis,  bacterial tracheitis, and spasmodic croup. For the purpose of this discussion, croup refers to laryngotracheitis and laryngotracheobronchitis  (involvement  of  the  bronchi  in  addition  to the larynx and trachea) because the two are o ft en clinically indistinguishable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
616

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whereas  acute  epiglottitis  is  primarily  a bacterial infection of the supraglottic structures, croup is primarily a viral infection of the subglottic structures. Th e inhaled pathogen initially infects  the  nasal  and  pharyngeal  mucosal  epithelium  and then  eventually  spreads  to  the  larynx  and  trachea.  Cellular in fi ltration of the mucosal and submucosal layers of the subglottic structures leads to edema and in fl ammation, most pronounced at the cricoid ring because this is the narrowest part of the pediatric trachea. Since the in fl ammation is surrounded by a relatively fi rm and nonstretchable tube of cartilaginous ring structures, there is inward narrowing with early air fl ow obstruction. Fibrinous exudates and pseudomembranes may form, which further exacerbate airway narrowing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  parain fl uenza  virus  family  (mostly  type  1)  accounts for  the  majority  of  cases.  Other  important  viral  pathogens are  respiratory  syncytial  virus,  in fl uenza viruses type A and B, adenovirus, and less frequently human metapneumovirus, coronavirus,  rhinovirus,  and  even  measles  during  measles outbreaks. In the minority of cases attributable to a bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma pneumoniae is  the  main  culprit.  Secondary bacterial infections leading to more severe laryngotracheobronchitis and even laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  acute  epiglottitis  with  its  rapid  progression, croup has a gradual onset starting with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection that progress to include upper airway  obstructive  symptoms  over  days  to  sometimes  longer than a week. Croup occurs between 6 months and 3 years of age with a peak incidence around the second year of life. Th e child usually has a several-day history of rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, and low-grade fever that progresses to the distinctive  barking  or  seal-like  cough  along  with  hoarse  voice  and inspiratory stridor.  Symptoms are worse in the supine position, and thus the child with croup prefers to sit or to be held upright.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis  is  made  clinically;  radiologic  and  laboratory con fi rmatory  tests  are  not  needed.  When  radiographs  are taken, one may see the classic steeple sign on an anteroposterior projection, which represents a long area of narrowing in the subglottic region. However, radiographic fi ndings are not pathognomonic and generally do not correlate well with clinical severity. Inspiratory stridor is the key element in determining disease severity. Although determination of the causative agent is not needed to make the diagnosis of croup, such testing is useful in planning appropriate methods of patient isolation and potentially initiating antiviral therapy (particularly if in fl uenza is suspected).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment is guided by disease severity based on a number of  clinical  parameters,  including  stridor,  air  entry,  retractions, cyanosis, and level of consciousness. For much of the twentieth century, mist therapy (treatment with humidi fi ed air) was the cornerstone of the management of croup, but it has become largely obsolete with the introduction of steroid therapy.  All  experts  now  recommend  routine  administration  of  corticosteroid  in  the  treatment  of  croup. Th e  most cited  regimens are (1) single-dose dexamethasone (0.6 mg/ kg PO or IM) and (2) nebulized budesonide (2 mg in 4 mL of water). Th ere is still some debate over the bene fi t of single versus multiple doses of corticosteroids as well as the exact dose of dexamethasone required (0.15 mg/kg vs. 0.6 mg/kg). Regardless, corticosteroid therapy has emerged as the single most important outpatient treatment of croup and has signi fi cantly reduced the rates of hospitalization. Children with severe  croup  should  be  treated  with  nebulized  epinephrine (0.5 mL of 2.25% racemic epinephrine in 4.5 mL of normal saline or L-epinephrine diluted in 5 mL of normal saline at a ratio of 1:1000). Even if the plan is for potential discharge, children should be observed for at least 2 to 4 hours a ft er the last  nebulized  epinephrine  treatment  for  possible  return  of obstructive  symptoms.  O ft en  nebulized  epinephrine  treatment needs to be repeated several times to minimize the need for endotracheal intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless there is extensive distal spread to the lower airways, croup is generally a self-limited infection that lasts approximately  72  hours.  However,  life-threatening  airway  obstruction can occur in rare cases (<1%) and requires endotracheal intubation. As in the case of acute epiglottitis, children with croup should be intubated with a smaller endotracheal tube than that predicted for their age given the expected subglottic narrowing. Timing of extubation will depend on resolution of croup symptoms as well as treatment of any associated complications such as bacterial superinfection of the lower airways. Of note, children with recurrent croup should be evaluated for occult conditions such as subglottic stenosis, laryngeal cle ft s, and laryngomalacia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endotracheal intubation in a child with croup, as in any child with airway disorders, should be carried out in a controlled setting such as the operating room with all necessary drugs and equipment available. Th e induction of anesthesia is carried out in a manner to similar that described for a child with acute epiglottitis.

Postintubation Laryngeal Edema

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postintubation  laryngeal  edema,  also  termed postintubation croup (not to be confused with infectious croup), is a potential complication of all tracheal intubations regardless of age. It is most commonly discussed in the context of pediatric patients, because  infants  and  children  have  smaller  absolute  tracheal diameters  and  thus  have  the  highest  incidence  of  developing clinically signi fi cant  postintubation  laryngeal  edema. Although there may be predisposing factors (Table 27-17), this is an iatrogenic disorder resulting directly from endotracheal intubation.

PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority of cases of postintubation laryngeal edema are due to the use of an inappropriately large endotracheal tube. Th e tracheal mucosa requires perfusion just as do all other living tissues. Tracheal mucosal perfusion is impaired at pressures above 25 cm H 2 O, and tracheal mucosal ischemia ensues once the pressure exceeds 30 cm H 2 O. Severe consequences such as deep tracheal ulceration and tracheal rupture can also occur. Postintubation laryngeal edema has the highest incidence in children between the ages of 1 and 4 years. Th e pressure from a  tightly fi tting  endotracheal  tube  causes  tracheal  mucosal ischemic damage, which leads to edema and narrowing of the subglottic airway. Occasionally, edema may also occur at the glottic level. Although a di ff erent entity from infectious croup, postintubation  croup  shares  a  similar  pathophysiology  with the same outcome of a reduction in the airway caliber.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postintubation croup typically manifests within 30 to 60 minutes of extubation and is characterized by a barking or croupy cough, hoarseness, and stridor. As severity increases, nasal fl aring, respiratory retractions, hypoxemia, cyanosis, and a decrease in the level of consciousness may also be observed. Treatment is aimed at reducing airway edema. Keeping the child calm is also important,  because  crying  will  further  exacerbate  symptoms. In mild cases of postintubation croup, mist therapy with cool, humidi fi ed air may be helpful. In general, repeated nebulized epinephrine treatments are needed to produce mucosal vasoconstriction to help shrink the swollen tissue. As in infectious croup, the recommended dose of nebulized racemic epinephrine is 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution diluted in 3 to 5 mL of normal saline. Th e patient must be observed for up to 4 hours a ft er the last nebulized epinephrine treatment in case rebound obstructive  symptoms  occur.  In  severe  cases,  treatment  with  heliox (helium and oxygen mixture) may also be tried. Th e use of dexamethasone in both the treatment and prevention of postintubation laryngeal edema is widespread, but one must keep in mind the slower onset of action (4 to 6 hours to achieve maximum e ff ect). Resolution of symptoms usually occurs within 24 hours; a child with persistent and recurrent respiratory distress should be admitted for further observation and management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  important  anesthetic  consideration  in  postintubation  laryngeal  edema  is  its prevention. Although  use  of uncu ff ed  endotracheal  tubes  is  traditionally  recommended in children younger than 8 years of age, repeat laryngoscopy may be needed to exchange for a larger-sized uncu ff ed tube in cases of large air leaks, and this may result in more laryngeal trauma. On the other hand, cu ff ed endotracheal tube use may be associated with overzealous cu ff in fl ation, which also leads to  tracheal  mucosal  injury.  Although  no  consensus  position or  guidelines  on  endotracheal  tube  cu ff pressure  monitoring have been published, use of a manometer to directly and accurately  determine  cu ff pressure,  particularly  in  pediatric patients, should always be considered. Regardless of whether a cu ff ed or uncu ff ed endotracheal tube is used, one must be able to demonstrate an air leak around the tube at or below a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O to prevent impaired perfusion to the tracheal mucosa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subglottic Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subglottic stenosis is a congenital or acquired narrowing of the subglottic airway. It is the most common type of laryngeal stenosis; others are supraglottic and glottic stenosis. Speci fi cally, subglottic stenosis refers to narrowing at the level of the cricoid ring. It is de fi ned as a luminal diameter of less than 4 mm in the full-term neonate and less than 3 mm in those born prematurely. Most cases are acquired as a result of trauma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the congenital form, subglottic stenosis lies on a spectrum of  diseases  that  result  from  recanalization  abnormalities  of the  laryngeal  lumen  during  embryogenesis.  Recanalization defects  can  also  lead  to  laryngeal  atresia,  laryngeal  stenosis, and laryngeal webs. Congenital subglottic stenosis is divided into the membranous type and the cartilaginous type. Th e former consists of fi brous so ft tissue thickening at the subglottic region and is generally a circumferential defect. Th e cartilaginous type is a consequence of thickening or deformity of the cricoid cartilage, the simplest form of which may be a mere change in the ring shape (e.g., unevenly large anterior or posterior lamina, elliptical shape) with little physical narrowing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acquired  subglottic  stenosis  usually  results  from  trauma associated with intubation, including pressure necrosis from use of an inappropriately large endotracheal tube and direct injury  to  the  laryngeal  structures  during  intubation.  Additional  factors  suspected  to  play  a  role  in  causing  subglottic stenosis include prematurity, duration of intubation, endotracheal tube movement, and concurrent conditions that increase local in fl ammatory response (gastroesophageal re fl ux disease, systemic infection, hypoxia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical presentation varies depending on the severity of the narrowing  and  can  range  from  stridor  to  complete  airway obstruction. Mild cases of congenital subglottic stenosis may

<!-- PAGE=? -->
618

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
not be clinically evident from the outset and may be diagnosed only a ft er the child experiences recurrent croup. Subglottic stenosis should always be considered in neonates and infants in whom multiple attempts at successful extubation have failed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis  of  subglottic  stenosis  is  made  by  endoscopic examination. Th e  degree  of  stenosis  correlates  well  with  the ability to detect an air leak at pressures of less than 20 cm H 2O using endotracheal tubes of various sizes. Subglottic stenosis is graded on a severity scale from I to IV , with grade I indicating less than 50% luminal obstruction, grade II 50% to 70% obstruction, grade III 71% to 91% obstruction, and grade IV no discernible lumen. Congenital subglottic stenosis is a diagnosis  of  exclusion  made  only  in  the  absence  of  trauma  and other apparent postnatal causes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Grades I  and  II  subglottic  stenosis  generally  do  not  require surgical treatment and may be amenable to medical therapy alone  using  antiin fl ammatory  and  vasoconstrictive  agents such as a corticosteroid and nebulized epinephrine. Grades III and IV subglottic stenosis need one or more forms of surgical treatment. Clinical symptoms ultimately dictate the need for surgical intervention regardless of grade. Concurrent gastroesophageal re fl ux disease must also be addressed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Less severe subglottic  stenosis  may  be  treated  endoscopically with steroid injection, serial dilations, and carbon dioxide laser ablation with or without topical mitomycin C. More severe subglottic stenosis may require an open surgical procedure. Th ese  procedures  include  anterior  cricoid  split, laryngotracheoplasty with cartilage  gra ft (laryngotracheal reconstruction), and tracheotomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  most  acquired  cases  of  subglottic  stenosis  result  from intubation-related trauma, extreme vigilance and caution must be used in every intubation, particularly intubation of infants and young children. One must always be able to demonstrate an air leak around the endotracheal tube at or below a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O to minimize the risk of pressure ischemia and necrosis of the tracheal mucosa. With cu ff ed endotracheal tubes, in fl ated cu ff pressure should also be kept below the predicted safe maximum of 25 cm H 2 O, which can be easily and accurately achieved with commercially available manometers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients coming for surgery to correct subglottic stenosis, standard anesthetic considerations pertaining to airway surgery are applicable. In particular, the risk of airway fi re in the setting of laser use and electrocauterization must always be kept in mind. As with all airway surgeries, close communication between the anesthesiologist and surgeon is important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In cases of open reconstruction, the postoperative management is  as  important  as  the  actual  surgery.  Patients  usually have in place an endotracheal tube (o ft en larger than that predicted for age) that acts as a stent once the stenosis has been repaired and the lumen enlarged with a cartilage gra ft . Adequate sedation and frequently muscle relaxation are required to  prevent  patient  movement,  which  may  prove  disastrous should  sutures  lines  be  disrupted  or  accidental  extubation occur with resultant complete airway obliteration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Foreign Body Aspiration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Foreign body aspiration occurs when an object or substance nonnative to the laryngotracheobronchial pathway is inhaled and embedded anywhere from the level of the larynx down to the distal bronchus and beyond.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Commonly  aspirated  objects  in  the  pediatric  population include  peanuts  (up  to  55%  of  all  foreign  body  aspirations in  Western  societies),  seeds,  popcorn,  other  food  particles, small toy parts, and metal objects. Th e size and shape of the aspirated  object  usually  determine  the  level  of  entrapment. Although objects lodged at proximal locations can cause complete  airway  obstruction  and  lead  to  death  from  asphyxiation, smaller and more streamlined objects may travel down to the distal airways and cause milder and more subtle signs and symptoms. In addition to the physical airway obstruction posed by the aspirated foreign body, a secondary chemical or in fl ammatory reaction to the foreign body and postobstruction  infection  may  occur.  Over  half  of  all  aspirated  foreign bodies are located in the right main bronchus, followed by the right lobar bronchi, le ft bronchi, trachea or carina, larynx, and bilateral locations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children between the ages of 1 and 3 years represent the overwhelming majority of patients with foreign body aspiration. Th is  age  period  coincides  with  the  intellectual  and  physical developmental  stages  of  the  typical  inquisitive  toddler,  who explores the environment via the oral route and who has the locomotive ability to fi nd objects and the fi ne motor skills to put such objects in the mouth. In older children and teenagers,  neurologic  disorders  and  substance  abuse  predispose  to foreign body aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms  of bronchial aspiration include coughing,  wheezing,  dyspnea,  and  decreased  air  entry  into the a ff ected side. Laryngeal or tracheal foreign body aspiration presents with frank or impending respiratory failure with severe  dyspnea,  stridor,  cyanosis,  and  altered  mental  status, and  is  associated  with  increased  morbidity  and  mortality. Overall, the classic triad of cough, wheezing, and decreased breath  sounds  is  present  in  fewer  than  60%  of  all  children with foreign body aspiration. A reported history of choking is highly suggestive of foreign body aspiration, but it may be missed because it is an early symptom typically lasting only seconds to minutes immediately a ft er the incident. Chronically retained  airway  foreign  bodies  have  a  much  more  insidious presentation and are o ft en misdiagnosed as upper respiratory tract  infections,  asthma,  pneumonia,  and  unde fi ned  airway abnormalities. Th e diagnosis of foreign body aspiration can be easily  established  with  plain  radiographs  when  the  object  is radiopaque. However, most aspirated objects (nuts, other food

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
items) are radiolucent and will not be obvious on radiographs unless there is evidence to suggest aspiration, such as postobstructive atelectasis, in fi ltrate or consolidation, or air trapping, in conjunction with the history and clinical fi ndings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rigid bronchoscopy is the procedure of choice for both the diagnosis  and  treatment  of  foreign  body  aspiration  because it permits airway control, optimizes visualization, and allows removal of the foreign body with a variety of forceps. Dislodgment  or  fragmentation  of  the  object  into  the  contralateral bronchus  is  a  potentially  lethal  complication  if  the  initially a ff ected side remains obstructed by the object and/or in fl ammation. When the foreign body cannot be removed, it is sometimes necessary to push it to a more distal location to restore ventilation to as large a portion of the lungs as possible. Rarely, aspirated foreign bodies require thoracotomy for retrieval.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Flexibility in management and close communication between the  anesthesiologist  and  surgeon  are  paramount  to  the  safe care  of  children  with  foreign  body  aspiration. Th ere  is  no gold standard anesthetic approach, and controversy still exists regarding whether to maintain spontaneous ventilation or to initiate controlled ventilation. It is best to remember that each child requires an individualized approach depending on the severity of symptoms and the location of the aspirated object. Th erefore,  a  thorough  history  taking  and  physical  examination  as  well  as  a  review  of  radiographic fi lms  must  be  performed in planning anesthetic care. For example, the location of the object and associated fi ndings such as air trapping may alert the anesthesiologist to avoid sudden changes in position (an object in the right main bronchus may dislodge proximally to  cause  complete obstruction) as well as the use of nitrous oxide (air trapping and areas of emphysema may expand rapidly).  Urgent  or  emergent need for bronchoscopic examination takes precedence over NPO status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhalation  induction  of  anesthesia  with  maintenance  of spontaneous ventilation is generally preferred, because positive  pressure  ventilation  may  force  the  foreign  body  into  a potentially  more  precarious  position.  Intravenous  induction may be acceptable in patients  with  relatively  stable  airways. Total intravenous anesthesia using propofol, remifentanil, and possibly dexmedetomidine, or a combination thereof, should be established as early as possible a ft er induction to provide an uninterrupted source of anesthesia. Topical anesthesia of the larynx and trachea with up to 3 mg/kg of lidocaine (2% to 4%) is extremely useful in preventing laryngospasm and reaction  to  endoscopic  manipulation.  Anticholinergics  such  as atropine (10 to 20 mcg/kg IV) or glycopyrrolate (3 to 5 mcg/ kg IV) should be readily available in case of pronounced vagal stimulation  during  bronchoscopy.  Once  the  bronchoscope passes  the  glottis,  the  anesthesia  circuit  should  immediately be connected to the side port to provide supplemental oxygen  and  to  assist  spontaneous  ventilation  or  initiate  gentle manual ventilation as needed. Close attention must be paid to the patient's respiratory excursions, and use of a precordial stethoscope can be invaluable in assessing respiratory  e ff ort and quality in these cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous ventilation is  desirable  until  the  nature  and location  of  the  foreign  body  have  been  elucidated.  Muscle relaxation is sometimes required to prevent movement during retrieval of the aspirated object. Th is may be particularly true when the foreign body is passing through the glottis along with the forceps and bronchoscope for removal as a unit. Any sudden movement from light anesthesia or lack of muscle relaxation may cause premature dislodgment of the object from the forceps. A ft er completion of the bronchoscopic procedure, the child is usually intubated to allow for de fi nitive airway control as well as tracheal and esophageal suctioning. In general, the child can be promptly extubated once appropriate criteria are met. Pneumothorax can be a complication, although it is rare, and should always be considered in case of rapid deterioration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dexamethasone (0.4 to 1.0 mg/kg, maximum of 20 mg) is given prophylactically to reduce subglottic edema. Nebulized epinephrine treatment may be needed to treat postoperative croup. Chest radiographs are sometimes obtained a ft er bronchoscopy if dictated by clinical symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal Papillomatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal papillomatosis is one of the most common causes of hoarseness and airway obstruction in children. Also known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (warts), it is a benign neoplasm of the larynx and trachea caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal  papillomatosis  is  thought  to  occur  as  a  result  of ororespiratory  exposure  to  HPV  during  vaginal  birth. Th e etiology is not entirely clear, however, because adults who are exposed to HPV rarely develop warts of the larynx and trachea, and laryngeal papillomatosis is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease. HPV infects the epithelial cell layer of the target site (cutaneous, anogenital, oral, or respiratory mucosa) producing benign, well-demarcated growths. In laryngeal papillomatosis, the larynx is the most commonly involved location, but distal spread to the trachea and lungs can also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children between the ages of 6 months and 10 years can have symptoms of an upper airway disorder at presentation. Dysphonia or change in voice quality (or altered cry in infants) is  o ft en  the fi rst  and  most  prominent  symptom.  If  lesions are le ft untreated, continued growth will lead to stridor, dyspnea,  and  airway  obstruction.  Although  lesions  in  children and  adults  appear  similar  histologically  and  pathologically, the clinical course is quite di ff erent in the two patient populations. Th e main di ff erence is the highly recurrent nature of the wart lesions in children, and o ft en numerous surgical excisions are required over the course of childhood. Adults usually

<!-- PAGE=? -->
620

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
require only a few surgical procedures for complete eradication. Despite its being an aggressive "benign" disease, laryngeal papillomatosis in children tends to become quiescent in adolescence. Malignant degeneration is rare but can occur in older children (distal seeds may transform into squamous cell carcinoma of the airway).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical excision is the current standard of care in the treatment of laryngeal papillomatosis. Although not all warts seen during surgery may be removed, any symptomatic or clinically signi fi cant  lesion  must  be  excised.  Adjuvant  antiviral  medical therapy (such as with cidofovir) has been tried but is still undergoing  investigation.  Carbon  dioxide  laser  ablation  in suspension microlaryngoscopy is the most common surgical modality. Th e procedure must be performed by experienced hands to minimize scarring, fi brosis, and potential laryngeal web formation. Th e laryngeal microdébrider, an adaptation of the endoscopic sinus instrument, has gained popularity in the treatment of many types of airway lesions including juvenile laryngeal papillomatosis. Some advocate its use over carbon dioxide laser ablation because of its more precise application and  reported  advantages  such  as  better  postsurgical  voice quality, quicker recovery, and longer asymptomatic intervals between operations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In rare cases of large obstructive lesions, tracheotomy may have to be performed to restore air fl ow. However, tracheotomy is strongly discouraged because of the risk of inducing distal spread of disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Suspension microlaryngoscopic airway surgeries are some of the most challenging cases in pediatric anesthesia and require close cooperation between the otolaryngologist and anesthesiologist.  Meticulous  attention  must  be  paid  to  the  airway, because patients are usually turned 90 degrees away from the anesthesia  station  and  are  suspended  in  a  hands-free  laryngoscope setup that allows for microscopic binocular operative intervention.  Traditionally,  intubation  with  a  smaller  endotracheal tube during surgery has been the standard approach. However,  the  endotracheal  tube  may  pose  a  problem  in  a number of ways. It can act as a fuel for combustion during laser surgery, and thus modi fi ed devices such as metal-, rubber-,  or  silicone-coated  tubes  wrapped in re fl ective  foil  may have to be used to minimize the risk of airway fi re. In addition, the  presence  of  the  endotracheal  tube  may  compromise  the visualization and excision of the lesion. Tubeless techniques with or without spontaneous ventilation have become more popular to address these concerns.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children generally undergo inhalation induction of general anesthesia with the aim of establishing intravenous access and a steady level of total intravenous anesthesia as early as possible. Topical anesthesia with weight-based doses of lidocaine, preferably delivered via an atomizer device for even distribution, should be instituted to further decrease reaction to surgical  stimuli.  Spontaneous ventilation should be maintained at least until the nature and location of the lesion have been determined.  Muscle  relaxation  for  vocal  cord  paralysis  is sometimes required for precise surgical excision of vocal cord lesions.  Most  children  are  intubated  a ft er  completion of  the surgery,  even  when  tubeless  techniques  are  used,  and  then allowed to awaken for extubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal Clefts

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laryngeal  cle ft s  are  a  group  of  rare  congenital  abnormalities in the separation between the posterior laryngotracheal wall and the adjacent esophagus. As a result, varying degrees of  communication  exist  between  the  larynx,  trachea,  and esophagus. Albeit rare, laryngeal cle ft s  represent an important occult cause of chronic respiratory complaints in children.  Laryngeal  cle ft s  have  an  incidence  of  1  in  10,000  to 20,000  live  births  with  a  slight  male  predominance  (male/ female ratio of 5:3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e trachea and esophagus share a common lumen embryologically until they are divided by the tracheoesophageal septum. Defects in the development of the septum or incomplete division of the lumen can lead to a variety of defects, including laryngeal cle ft ,  tracheoesophageal fi stula, and esophageal atresia.  Laryngeal  cle ft s  are  graded  according  the  level  of involvement, ranging from type I (interarytenoid defect superior to the true vocal folds) to type IV (defect extending into the posterior wall of the thoracic trachea with possible carinal involvement) (Figure 27-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e timing and nature of presentation depend on cle ft severity. Stridor, choking, and regurgitation are typical manifestations. Some children may have recurrent croup or aspiration pneumonia and the cle ft may remain undiagnosed for years. Diagnosis  requires  a  high  index  of  suspicion. Th e  presence of a laryngeal cle ft should be considered in any child with a history  of  feeding  problems  in  association  with  respiratory complaints.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Microlaryngoscopic  examination  remains  the  gold  standard in the diagnosis of laryngeal cle ft s. Symptoms and extent of the cle ft defect will determine the timing and type of surgical  repair.  Minor  cle ft s  are  usually  amenable to minimally invasive surgery (suspension microlaryngoscopy, robotic surgery). Severe cle ft s such as those involving the thoracic trachea may require median sternotomy or lateral pharyngotomy with right thoracotomy to optimize exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All patients with laryngeal cle ft s should undergo complete examination  of  the  tracheobronchial  tree  and  esophagus  to rule out other associated abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous ventilation under general anesthesia is optimal for endoscopic examination because spontaneous movement of the vocal cords and surrounding structures is maintained.

A tubeless procedure also allows for the best visualization of the area of concern, because some defects are subtle and may be easily masked by an in-situ endotracheal tube. Of course, the safety of the patient ultimately dictates the anesthetic technique. Anesthetic concerns discussed under laryngeal papillomatosis also apply here. A ft er laryngeal cle ft repair surgery, the child is usually transferred to the pediatric ICU for postoperative monitoring and management.

Macroglossia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia  is  true  enlargement  of  the  tongue. Th is  is  to be di ff erentiated from glossoptosis, in which a normal-sized tongue causes obstructive symptoms in an abnormally small oral cavity. Macroglossia can be focal or generalized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  child's  ability  to  swallow,  breath,  and  speak  may  be impaired to varying degrees depending on the extent of macroglossia. Taste sensation may also be a ff ected and cause feeding aversions. In addition, the impingement on surrounding structures  may  lead  to  facial  and  dental  problems  such  as prognathism,  bite  deformities,  malocclusion,  and  temporomandibular joint pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drooling,  speech  impairment,  failure  to  thrive,  and  stridor are all  symptoms of macroglossia, with airway obstruction being the most feared consequence. In mild cases, speech therapy may be all that is needed. Surgical reduction is aimed at restoring normal functions such as mastication, deglutition, and articulation as well as restoring a patent airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preparations for a di ffi cult airway must be made for any child with macroglossia coming for surgery. In some cases, induction of anesthesia may occur only a ft er endotracheal intubation, because the tongue is both enlarged and relatively fi xed in position, as is seen in advanced Hurler's syndrome. For children at an appropriate developmental stage, surgeries that can be performed under local anesthesia should be attempted with minimal sedation to avoid airway obstruction. Spontaneous ventilation is essential until a de fi nitive airway is established.

Adenotonsillar Hypertrophy and Sleep-Disordered Breathing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenotonsillar  hypertrophy  is  the  most  common  cause  of snoring  in  children.  Snoring  may  or  may  not  be  associated with  actual  obstructive  hypopnea  and  obstructive  apnea. Sleep-disordered breathing represents a spectrum of nocturnal  air fl ow-restrictive problems that may range in presentation from physiologically inconsequential snoring to complete obstructive sleep apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e smallest cross-sectional area of the pediatric pharyngeal space is the retropalatal area where the tonsils and adenoids overlap. Hypertrophy of one or both groups of lymphoid tissue leads to expected decrease in airway caliber with resultant resistance and/or obstruction to air fl ow. However, the degree of hypertrophy does not necessarily predict or correlate with the severity of obstructive symptoms. Some children with large tonsils  and  adenoids  display  few  or  no  symptoms  of  sleepdisordered breathing, whereas others with severe obstructive symptoms  are  found  to  have  relatively  normal-sized  tonsils and adenoids. It is clear from these cases that obstruction to air fl ow also depends on the tone and volume of surrounding tissues. Th us,  the  presence  of  comorbid  conditions  such  as obesity, craniofacial anomalies, and neuromuscular disorders must be considered in understanding the pathophysiology in each child. Whether the obstruction results from adenotonsillar hypertrophy alone or from additive collapse of surrounding tissues, the child must increase respiratory e ff ort to maintain air fl ow. Increased intraluminal negative pressure against compliant pediatric airway structures leads to airway collapse and cessation of air fl ow via the Bernoulli e ff ect. Abnormal peripheral and central neuromuscular regulation of respiratory function also contributes to the development of sleep-disordered breathing and obstructive symptoms.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children  and  adolescents  with  adenotonsillar  hypertrophy have a range of symptoms, including mouth breathing, snoring,  and  symptoms  of  obstructive  sleep  disorder.  Whereas daytime  sleepiness  is  frequently  reported  in  adults  with obstructive sleep apnea, children more o ft en have nonspeci fi c behavioral di ffi culties such as hyperactivity and learning disability.  Parents  may  also  report  a  history  of  chronic  rhinorrhea, allergic rhinitis, and poor appetite. Examination of the child may reveal audible mouth breathing, dry lips, hyponasal speech, and the so-called adenoid face, an elongated or oblong face with the mouth open and an expression of being lost or apathetic.

Tonsillar hypertrophy is graded on a numeric scale from 0 to 4. Th e lowest grade denotes normally sized tonsils that fi t within the tonsillar fauces and the highest indicates hypertrophic tonsils that obstruct at least 75% of the lateral oropharyngeal  dimension.  Flexible  endoscopy  and  lateral  radiography are helpful in diagnosing adenoid hypertrophy, although most cases  are  diagnosed  clinically  with  examination  of  the  adenoids performed at the time of surgery. Adenoids are located midline in the nasopharynx in close proximity to the opening of the eustachian tubes. For this reason, adenoid hypertrophy is frequently associated with chronic middle ear e ff usion, otitis media, and sinusitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History and physical examination alone are poor at di ff erentiating simple snoring from obstructive sleep apnea. Snoring,  as  estimated  from  history,  and  adenotonsillar  size  on examination have relatively low positive and negative predictive values in the evaluation of children with sleep-disordered breathing.  Polysomnography  remains  the  gold  standard  for diagnosing  obstructive  sleep  apnea.  Breathing  parameters that  are  usually  monitored  in  pediatric  patients  include  airfl ow, respiratory e ff ort, and oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry. End-tidal carbon dioxide concentration, brain electrical potentials (via electroencephalography), chin muscle electrical potentials (vis electromyography), and leg movements may also be monitored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstructive  sleep  apnea  is  usually  de fi ned as  cessation  of air fl ow with continued respiratory e ff ort for at least two breaths or 10 seconds. Hypopnea is de fi ned as at least 50% reduction in air fl ow with associated respiratory e ff ort for at least two breaths or  more  than  3%  decrease  in  oxygen  saturation.  Apnea  and apnea-hypopnea indices (number of events divided by number of hours of sleep) are calculated for the entire duration of sleep. Ideally,  all  children  suspected  of  having  sleep  apnea  should undergo polysomnography, but young age is a limiting factor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recognizing and treating sleep-disordered breathing is important,  because  untreated  obstructive  sleep  apnea  has neurocognitive,  in fl ammatory,  and  cardiovascular  sequelae. Adenotonsillectomy has been the treatment of choice, sometimes even in the absence of signi fi cant adenotonsillar hypertrophy when there are concomitant predisposing conditions to obstructive sleep apnea. In general, adenotonsillectomy is e ff ective  in  relieving  obstructive  symptoms  and  can  signi fi -cantly improve quality of life. Despite being one of the most commonly performed surgeries in children (second only to myringotomy) with many advances in surgical technique, adenotonsillectomy is not without risk. Bleeding, laryngospasm, vomiting, pain, and dehydration are among the most common postoperative complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenotonsillar hypertrophy in association with obstructive sleep disorder is not a contraindication to administering preoperative anxiolytic medication. As in all cases, the child should be closely monitored a ft er pharmacologic intervention. Unless an intravenous catheter is already in place, induction of general anesthesia is usually accomplished with inhalation of sevo fl urane and oxygen with or without nitrous oxide. Rapid airway obstruction can be expected, and oral airways of several sizes should always be readily available. Moderate continuous positive pressure is o ft en needed to counteract the e ff ects of a reduced upper airway muscle tone. Cu ff ed endotracheal tubes may be preferable to uncu ff ed tubes to minimize the chance of aspiration of blood. Air leak at or below a pressure of 25 cm H2O should be con fi rmed and cu ff pressure  monitored. Th e choice of opioid is not as important as appropriate drug dosing; lower dosages are given to children who have symptoms or  have  obstructive  sleep  apnea  documented  by  sleep  study to minimize risks of prolonged emergence and postoperative upper airway obstruction. Th e use of nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory  drugs  remains  controversial  and  varies  widely  from center  to  center. Th e  intravenous  form  of  acetaminophen  is becoming more available in U.S. centers and may become an important analgesic adjunct given its lack of bleeding risk and respiratory-depressant  e ff ect.  High-dose  intravenous  dexamethasone  (up  to  1  mg/kg,  maximum  of  25  mg)  has  been shown to reduce postoperative swelling as well as nausea and vomiting. Most adenotonsillectomy procedures are not associated with excessive bleeding, but the amount of blood loss can  be  hard  to  estimate  and  is  o ft en  larger  than  predicted. Fluid de fi cits must be replaced appropriately. Rarely, massive hemorrhage can occur when the carotid vessels are torn during the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e traditional approach of postponing elective surgery for 1 to 2 weeks in children with mild active or recent upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and for 4 to 6 weeks in those with more severe symptoms (such as productive cough) may be too conservative and is o ft en unrealistic. It may be di ffi cult to fi nd a  block  of  completely  "healthy"  time  lasting  4  to  6  weeks  in peak URI seasons, because most children either have an active cold or are recovering from one.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  urgency  and  type  of  surgery  must  be  considered. Emergent procedures must proceed regardless of the severity  of  the  URI.  Type  of  surgery  is  also  an  important

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
623

<!-- PAGE=? -->
consideration,  because  some  procedures  such  as  myringotomy and adenotonsillectomy may help to relieve chronic URI-like symptoms. In fact, many children coming for such procedures will have chronic symptoms that are di ffi cult to distinguish from those of a URI. A detailed parental interview  usually  provides  a  helpful  comparison  of  the  child's current health status to baseline condition. In general, elective surgeries should be postponed if the child has high fever, croupy cough, general malaise, or evidence of lower respiratory tract infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia via mask or laryngeal mask airway is preferable  to  endotracheal  intubation  and  has  been  shown to be associated with a lower incidence of intraoperative and postoperative respiratory complications. Regional anesthesia should also be considered in appropriate cases. If intubation is  required,  the  trachea  should  be  instrumented  only  under a deep plane of anesthesia. A smaller than expected endotracheal tube should be considered, because children with active or recent URI have a higher incidence of postintubation laryngeal edema. Dexamethasone may also be given prophylactically to reduce postintubation croup.

GENITOURINARY DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vesicoureteral Reflux

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vesicoureteral re fl ux (VUR) is the abnormal re fl ux of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract, including the ureters and kidneys, and can be unilateral or bilateral. It is the  most  common  urologic  disorder  in  children.  Prenatal hydroureter  and  hydronephrosis  may  suggest  the  presence of VUR.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  children  have  a  febrile  urinary  tract  infection  (UTI). Some are found to have VUR based on testing prompted by prenatal urologic abnormalities or a signi fi cant family history. Evaluation for VUR should be done in children with recurrent UTIs, any male child with a fi rst UTI, any child younger than 5 years with a febrile UTI, and children with signi fi cant renal anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis of VUR is most commonly based on the results of  contrast  voiding  cystourethrography,  which  can  be  done with  relative  ease  in  most  children.  It  does  involve  urethral catheterization for contrast injection, and some children may require sedation or even general anesthesia for catheter placement. VUR is diagnosed based on evidence of contrast re fl ux and is graded into one of fi ve levels of severity (Table 27-18). Grades I and II are considered mild, grade III moderate, and grades IV and V severe. Treatment di ff ers for primary and secondary VUR and is also dictated by re fl ux severity. A majority of children with mild VUR (80%) will experience spontaneous resolution by 5 years of age. Spontaneous resolution can also occur in moderate VUR but with variable rates; younger age at presentation and unilateral disease are favorable prognostic factors, whereas older age at presentation and bilateral disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
predict  a  low  chance  of  spontaneous  resolution. Th e  most severe cases of VUR (grade V) rarely resolve without surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  is  aimed  at  preventing  UTI  with  antibiotic  prophylaxis and restoring ureterovesical junction competence or relieving  downstream  bladder  obstruction.  Untreated  re fl ux increases the risks of pyelonephritis and renal scarring with subsequent  re fl ux  nephropathy. Th e  most  common  surgical procedure for VUR is ureteral reimplantation or ureteroneocystostomy. Th e  a ff ected  ureter  is  repositioned  and  retunneled  into  the  bladder  wall  to  create  a  new  ureterovesical junction with the proper length/diameter ratio. Injection of a polysaccharide-based gel (De fl ux) is a less invasive procedure that may be tried in less severe grades of VUR until spontaneous resolution occurs or until de fi nitive surgical intervention is deemed necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most children with VUR are otherwise healthy and undergo general  anesthesia  without  problems.  For  those  with  severe VUR and/or co-existing renal anomaly, baseline renal indices should be checked to assess kidney function. Advanced VUR may be accompanied by symptoms of chronic renal disease, including hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with VUR may become frequent visitors to the operating  room  for  repeat  cystoscopic  procedures  and  can exhibit overwhelming anxiety. A gentle approach in conjunction  with  appropriate  preoperative  anxiolysis  is  helpful  in most cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cystoscopic procedures are generally short, but a relatively deep plane of anesthesia must be established to minimize risk of laryngospasm during urethral stimulation. Care must also be taken to secure the airway device, since the child is usually moved to the far end of the operating table for cystoscopy.

Caudal or lumbar epidural analgesia is recommended for reimplantation procedures to treat both peri-incisional pain and postsurgical bladder spasm.

Posterior Urethral Valve

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posterior urethral valve is a common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male children. Malformation of the posterior urethra in the form an obstructive membrane results in varying degrees of urethral obstruction. Urine out fl ow obstruction can cause bladder, ureteral, and renal damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless the obstruction is mild, posterior urethral valve is usually diagnosed prenatally via ultrasonography during evaluation for antenatal megaureter and hydronephrosis. Pulmonary insu ffi ciency  may  be  present.  Symptoms  of  delayed  presentation  include  dysuria,  abnormal  urinary  stream,  diurnal enuresis, UTI, and an abdominal mass representing a markedly  distended  bladder.  Bladder  hypertrophy  causes  abnormally high intravesicular pressure, which predisposes to VUR. Occasionally, the fi rst presenting problem is renal failure with associated  uremic  symptoms.  Approximately  one  third  of patients  with  posterior  urethral  valve  progress  to  end-stage renal disease, requiring lifelong renal replacement therapy or renal transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bladder  outlet  obstruction  is  usually  addressed  immediately at birth by placement of a urethral catheter. Th e obstructive  valves  can  be  incised  in  the fi rst  few  days  of  life.  If  the urethra  is  too  small  to  accommodate  the  necessary  surgical instruments, direct vesicocutaneous or ureterocutaneous urinary diversion procedures may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children with posterior urethral valve come for a wide range of surgical procedures from simple valve incision to renal transplantation. Anesthetic care must be tailored to each individual with particular attention to fl uid and electrolyte management, especially in the setting of advanced renal insu ffi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cryptorchidism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cryptorchidism (hidden or  obscure  testis)  is  the  congenital absence of one or both testes in the scrotum resulting from incomplete  testicular  descent.  Undescended  testes  have  an increased  risk  of  malignant  transformation  compared  with normally descended ones. In addition, there is usually a concurrent hernia with attendant risks of bowel incarceration and strangulation, as well as increased risk of infertility and testicular torsion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cryptorchidism is diagnosed by inability to palpate the testis or palpation of a malpositioned testis (e.g., inguinal canal location). Physical examination must be performed in a warm environment  to  prevent  cold-induced  testicular  retraction, which  may  confound  the  clinical  picture.  Nonpalpable  testes  account for only one fift h of all cases of cryptorchidism; in 40% of cases the testis has an intraabdominal location, in another 40% a high inguinal location, and in the remainder shows  atrophy  or  congenital  absence.  Most  palpable  undescended testes will spontaneously descend during infancy, but this rarely continues a ft er 9 months of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orchiopexy is the treatment for all cases of cryptorchidism and involves identi fi cation, mobilization, and fi xation of the malpositioned testis to the scrotum. Orchiopexy can be performed via  an  inguinal,  suprainguinal,  or  laparoscopic  approach.  In cases in which the testis is in a high intraabdominal position and spermatic vessels  are  short,  a  two-stage  procedure  may be required to allow time for collateral vessel formation a ft er initial  vessel  clipping,  followed  by  mobilization  and  scrotal fi xation of the testis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unless the child has comorbid conditions, there are few special anesthetic  considerations.  An  intense  vagal  response  can  be seen with surgical traction and manipulation of the spermatic cord and testicle; this may also occur with pneumoperitoneum as  in  all  laparoscopic  procedures.  A  high  incidence  of  postoperative nausea and vomiting is observed, and thus prophylactic antiemetic treatment should be routinely given. Caudal analgesia is highly recommended in appropriate patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypospadias

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypospadias  is  congenital  malpositioning  of  the  urethral meatus  on  the  ventral  aspect  (underside)  of  the  penis. Th e abnormal opening can occur anywhere from the glans penis to the penile sha ft and even down to the scrotum and perineum. Hypospadias involving the glans penis, also known as coronal hypospadias, is the most common (50% of cases). Chordee, an abnormal ventral  curvature  of  the  penis,  is  commonly  seen with hypospadias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e defect is thought be an early gestational event, but the exact mechanism is still under investigation. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely. Distal and coronal  hypospadias  impose  mostly  cosmetic  problems;  more proximal lesions can a ff ect urination and fertility. Treatment for hypospadias is surgical repair and in the majority of cases can  be  accomplished  in  a  single  stage.  Multiple  corrective surgeries  are  needed  for  proximal  meatal  locations  (scrotum and perineum) and o ft en preputial skin gra ft ing is o ft en required.  Concurrent  chordee  deformity  is  also  corrected. Most surgeons perform hypospadias repair between the ages of 4 and 18 months before the child has full genital awareness to minimize psychologic impact.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypospadias is generally an isolated fi nding, and most children do not have additional health problems that pose speci fi c anesthetic  concerns.  General  anesthesia  supplemented  with caudal analgesia is the preferred technique.

ORTHOPEDIC-MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS

Clubfoot (Talipes Equinovarus)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clubfoot  is  a  common  congenital  foot  deformity  caused  by malalignment  of  the  calcaneotalar-navicular  complex  with a  resultant  combination  of  (1)  excessive  plantar fl exion, (2)  medially  deviated  forefoot,  and  (3)  inward-facing  sole. Bilateral involvement is seen in 30% to 50% of cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clubfoot is evident at birth and can be diagnosed prenatally in some cases. All patients exhibit some degree of calf atrophy. Concomitant shortening of the tibia and fi bula can also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonoperative treatment includes taping and serial casting for positional clubfoot. Although normal alignment is maintained in some cases, there is a high rate of recurrence. For this reason, surgical Achilles tenotomy (clipping or release of the Achilles tendon) is o ft en needed. Ponseti's method is the most popular treatment scheme for clubfoot and involves initial weekly stretching and casting (5 to 10 sessions), followed by  percutaneous  Achilles  tenotomy,  long  leg  casting  with the foot in abduction and dorsi fl exion, and fi nally a bracing program for 3 to 5 years. Rigid clubfoot deformities usually require  more  invasive  surgical  realignment  such  as  anterior tibial  tendon transfer. Prognosis depends on how severe the defect is and whether there are underlying structural and/or chromosomal abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  considerations  di ff er  for  cases  of  isolated  clubfoot and those associated with genetic or congenital disorders. Th e  most  obvious  concern  is  the  potential  anesthetic impact on patients whose neuromuscular integrity is compromised. Risks of pulmonary aspiration, prolonged muscle weakness, and delayed emergence must be considered. Some procedures  are  done  with  the  patient  in  prone  position, which  requires  special  precautions  to  prevent  the  injuries commonly  associated  with  prone  positioning. Th e  patient must  be  kept adequately anesthetized,  sometimes  with neuromuscular blockade, to allow  adequate  stretching  and casting. Continuous epidural analgesia (in some cases with combined  regional  anesthesia)  is  highly  recommended  for invasive procedures, because there is o ft en signi fi cant postoperative pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) literally means a slippage of the femoral end cap ( epi, "over"; physis, "growth plate") over the femoral neck as a result of a fracture in the growth plate. Th is is a disorder of adolescence, a period of rapid bone growth  predisposing  to  increased  growth  plate  instability. More and more cases are seen at an earlier age presumably because of early maturation and childhood obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SCFE typically presents between the ages of 10 and 16 years and a ff ects boys more than girls. Obesity is a risk factor. Medical disorders that are associated with a higher risk of SCFE, as well as an earlier age at onset, include Down's syndrome, endocrinopathies (hypothyroidism, precocious puberty, pituitary tumors), and renal osteodystrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients have groin, thigh, and knee pain and o ft en hold the a ff ected hip in an externally rotated position. Gait pattern and  weight-bearing  ability  may  be  a ff ected.  Twenty  percent of patients have bilateral involvement even if only unilateral symptoms are present. Patients who are younger than 10 years, older than 16 years, or have short stature should undergo evaluation  for  an  underlying  medical  cause.  Diagnosis  is  made from fi ndings of the physical examination and plain radiography. Treatment involves surgical pinning of the growth plate to prevent further displacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical treatment for SCFE is mostly done on an urgent basis to prevent further displacement with the attendant risk of vascular compromise. Full-stomach precautions must be observed when indicated, particularly for obese patients. Th ere are few special anesthetic considerations unless comorbid conditions are present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blount's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blount's  disease  is  a  disorder  of  abnormal  cartilage  growth at  the  proximal  tibial  growth  plate  resulting  in  genu  varum (bowleg)  deformity  that  may  lead  to  leg  length  discrepancy and joint instability. It is important to distinguish Blount's disease from other causes of genu varum (e.g., physiologic genu varum seen in children younger than 2 years of age, rickets) because treatment di ff ers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are two forms of Blount's disease: infantile and adolescent. Th e infantile form typically presents before the age of 3 years  and  is  usually  bilateral  (80%  of  cases). Th e  adolescent form can be unilateral or bilateral. Risk factors include walking at an early age, African descent, and obesity. In addition to  the  obvious  abnormal  bowing,  the  physical  examination o ft en reveals a nontender prominence on the medial side of the proximal tibia. Radiography is the primary modality for diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  infantile  form  is  o ft en  amenable  to  nonoperative  treatment,  namely,  corrective  bracing.  If  the  condition  is  le ft untreated, surgical realignment may be needed. Th e  adolescent form usually requires operative treatment. Hemiepiphysiodesis,  better  understood  as  a  growth-guiding  procedure, involves placement of screws into the growth plate on the side opposite the defect,  to  limit  continued  outward  growth  and bowing. Tibial osteotomy is a much more invasive procedure

that  may  be  needed  to  correct  severe  deformities  and  those that present a ft er the growth spurt period. Th is procedure can have serious complications, including nonunion, neurovascular injury, and compartment syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  postoperative  pain  is  expected  with  osteotomy procedures.  However,  surgeons  typically  oppose  the  use  of regional and neuraxial analgesia to avoid masking of symptoms  related  to  potential  nerve  injury  and  compartment syndrome.  A  well-planned  scheme  of  intraoperative  and postoperative  pain  control  should  be  implemented,  o ft en  in consultation  with  the  acute  pain  management  team.  As  in the  SCFE  population,  adolescents  with  Blount's  disease  are o ft en obese, and appropriate anesthetic precautions (related to potential delayed gastric emptying and restrictive respiratory dysfunction) must be observed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) refers to abnormal growth of the hip caused by a combination of joint laxity and acetabular dysplasia (abnormal shape) resulting in joint instability and dislocation. It is also known as hip dysplasia and congenital hip dislocation; however, the latter term is inaccurate since DDH can occur at any point from the antenatal period to the time of skeletal maturity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Otherwise healthy newborns can have DDH, which is usually due to ligamentous laxity and immature development of the acetabulum associated with young age. Th us, over half of cases will resolve by the fi rst week of life and up to 90% will resolve by 2 months of age. DDH can be diagnosed and monitored using the Barlow (hip adduction with posterior pressure) and Ortolani (abduction and anterior pressure on the greater trochanter) maneuvers, which detect dislocation and reduction, respectively. Leg length discrepancy and gluteal fold asymmetry are also clues to possible DDH. Ultrasonography is the primary diagnostic modality until 5 months of age, at which time su ffi cient ossi fi cation permits adequate radiographic examination. Arthrograms are used infrequently in older children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Untreated  hip  joint  instability  can  lead  to  repetitive  and chronic  dislocations,  contractures  of  adjoining  muscles  and tendon, as well as early hip osteoarthritis. DDH in association with connective tissue and neuromuscular disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos  syndrome  and  cerebral  palsy  are  particularly di ffi cult to treat.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DDH in otherwise healthy infants is treated with bracing (Pavlik's harness) and body casting (spica cast), both of which are abduction  devices  aimed  at  stabilizing  the  femoral  head  in the hip joint socket. Children in whom DDH presents a ft er 2 years of age generally need open reduction. Residual DDH may even require pelvic  and  femoral  osteotomy  to  remodel joint  architecture.  Unfortunately,  chronic  dislocations  and DDH associated with neuromuscular disorders are generally not amenable to surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  spica  casting,  infants  are  o ft en  elevated  on  a  wood frame for cast application. Particular attention must be paid to securing any airway device and preventing accidental fall from the wood frame. In addition, any respiratory compromise caused by the spica cast must be communicated to the surgeon so the cast can be modi fi ed. Th ere are few other speci fi c anesthetic concerns for standard DDH-related surgeries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thoracic Insufficiency Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th oracic insu ffi ciency syndrome is the inability of the thorax to  support  postnatal  lung  growth  and  respiratory  function. Th ere are multiple causes but all belong to a spectrum of thoracospinal abnormalities. Th ere can be isolated rib abnormalities (fused ribs, absence of ribs) and/or spinal deformities (shortened vertebrae, rotational deformities of the spine) that result in unilateral or bilateral defects. Regardless of cause, restrictive lung disease ensues. Th e most well-known causes of thoracic insu ffi ciency  syndrome  are  congenital  and  neuromuscular scoliosis;  other  important  causes  include  syndromes  associated with a shortened or narrowed thorax such as Jarcho-Levin syndrome and Jeune's  syndrome,  and  congenital  absence  of ribs with fl ail chest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Structural  development  of  the  thoracic  cage  (sternum,  ribs, and spine) directly impacts lung growth because the two are intimately  related  processes. Th is  is  particularly  true  during the early childhood period since the most rapid lung growth takes place in the fi rst 3 years of life. Th erea ft er, alveolar development continues until approximately 8 years of age and the lungs  continue  to  grow,  albeit  at  a  much  slower  pace,  until skeletal  maturity  is  reached.  Both  the  quantity  and  quality (shape)  of  the  intrathoracic  space  are  important  for  normal lung  development.  Studies  have  shown  that  thoracic  spinal growth is greatest during the fi rst 5 years of life (1.4 cm/yr from 0 to 5 years compared with 0.6 cm/yr from 5 to 10 years and 1.2 cm/yr from 10 to 18 years); thus, this is the most critical time period for overall lung and thoracospinal development. Restrictive  lung  dysfunction  results  from  a  combination  of lung hypoplasia, perfusion defects, and impaired rib mechanics.  Most  patients  with  thoracic  insu ffi ciency  syndrome  are demonstrated  to  have  consistently  higher  baseline  levels  of atelectasis than their healthy counterparts. In contrast to the high lung and chest wall compliance seen in healthy young children, low (sti ff ) lung and chest wall compliance are noted in children with thoracic insu ffi ciency syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
failure,  the  earliest  manifestations  of  which  are  intermittent nocturnal hypercarbia and hypoxemia. Recurrent lower respiratory  tract  infections  may  occur  due  to  increased  atelectasis  and decreased airway clearance from inadequate forceful exhalation, particularly if there is concomitant neuromuscular weakness. Ine ffi cient lung and rib cage mechanics also place higher metabolic demands on the child, which predisposes to poor nutritional status. Cardiovascular sequelae such as pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale may follow if thoracic insu ffi ciency syndrome is le ft untreated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung  perfusion  scan fi ndings  and  measures  of  structural spinal deformity, such as the Cobb angle, correlate poorly with degree of lung dysfunction. However, young children cannot participate in voluntary lung function testing such as spirometry  and  plethysmography.  Because  of  this,  medical  therapy must be initiated as early as possible based on clinical fi ndings to  mitigate  chronic  respiratory  failure. Th is  therapy  includes noninvasive ventilation and chest percussion with postural drainage. Tracheostomy may be needed for progressive hypoventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical therapy is aimed at correcting the skeletal deformities. Th e exact technique used depends on the age at presentation, the  severity  of  the  deformity,  and  the  underlying  cause.  Spinal fusion is the de fi nitive treatment for spinal abnormalities; fusion stunts spinal growth, however. Nonfusion techniques are designed to stabilize spinal deformities while preserving spinal growth in young children until fusion can be done at a later time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  vertical  expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) procedure  (Figure  27-5)  is  an  example  of  nonfusion  spine surgery  and  is  indicated  for  thoracospinal  deformities  that also involve the rib cage. It is performed in skeletally immature children (ideally <5 years of age) to guide normal growth of  the  thoracic  cage  in  hopes  that  normal  lung  growth  and respiratory function will follow. Th e procedure starts with an open expansion thoracostomy in which separations are made between the ribs followed by rib cage expansion; congenitally fused  ribs  are  also  separated  if  needed.  Vertical  expandable titanium rods are then inserted onto healthy bony structures above and below the a ff ected area (rib to distal rib, rib to spine, or rib to pelvis) to hold the expanded thorax. Children return at regular intervals during their growth period for rod lengthening. Th e  immediate  and  long-term  e ff ects  on  pulmonary mechanics and function are still under investigation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic considerations relevant for any patient with restrictive lung dysfunction undergoing extensive spinal fusion apply here as well; these are discussed extensively in Chapter 21. Th e patient's preoperative respiratory function must be thoroughly investigated. Th e child's cardiac function should be assessed with  echocardiography  whenever  possible.  Recognition  of associated abnormalities is important, with particular attention paid to the baseline neurologic status. Surgery should be postponed if any acute respiratory illness is present, since most

Patients who have undergone the initial VEPTR procedure require  postoperative  ICU  care  with  or  without  mechanical ventilation.  In  general,  there  is  minimal  spinal  manipulation  during  VEPTR placement. Early assessment of postoperative neurologic function is important, however. Subsequent VEPTR lengthening procedures are typically brief and do not require postoperative ICU management.

Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis refers to all types of juvenile arthritis,  including what was formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid  arthritis and  other  arthritides  of  unclear  cause. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is  not  synonymous with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis because the latter denotes a speci fi c rheumatoid etiology and the former includes idiopathic conditions. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is the most common autoimmune disease of childhood and is de fi ned as joint pain, sti ff ness, and swelling that last longer than 6 weeks with the fi rst occurrence before the age of 16 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ree categories of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are identi fi ed: systemic,  polyarticular,  and  pauciarticular  or  oligoarticular. Th e latter two types a ff ect girls more than boys.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oligoarticular  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  accounts  for approximately 50% of all cases with a peak incidence around 2 years of age. Four or fewer joints are a ff ected a ft er 6 months of illness with the knees commonly involved, and up to three quarters  of  patients  test  positive  for  antinuclear  antibodies (ANAs). Clinical course is generally milder than in the other two variants and joint destruction is rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis refers to disease with involvement of more than four joints a ft er 6 months of illness and represents 30% to 40% of cases. Peak incidence occurs at 3 years of age. Small joints of the hands are commonly involved. Fewer than half of these patients demonstrate ANAs and only 10% test positive for rheumatoid factor. Subcutaneous nodules and moderate systemic symptoms are occasionally seen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic  juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (formerly  known  as Still's disease ) is the smallest subset (10% to 15% of cases) with clinical manifestations of symmetric polyarthritis, intermittent fever, macular rash, hematopoietic abnormalities (leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lymphadenopathy), and hepatosplenomegaly.  Any  joint  can  be  involved,  including  those  of  the  hands, hips,  and  shoulders.  Cervical  spine  and  temporomandibular joint involvement are not uncommon. Other systemic complications include uveitis, pleuritis, and pericarditis. Th e disorder can present a ft er the age of 16 years, at which point it is termed adult-onset  Still's  disease. Progression  of  systemic  and  joint symptoms does not always occur in a congruent fashion. Some children  can  have  years  of  persistent  rash  and  spiking  fevers with little progression of arthritis. Severe growth retardation, osteoporosis,  and  macrophage  activation  syndrome  are  the most important complications. Th e  latter  is  characterized  by unremitting fevers and a consumptive coagulopathy with resultant spontaneous bruising and bleeding that may lead to shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A potentially di ffi cult airway is one of the most important anesthetic concerns in the care of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.  T emporomandibular joint arthritis typically limits mouth opening and can be compounded by a micrognathic mandible that results from the growth-stunting e ff ect of the arthropathy. In addition, there may be concurrent cervical spine involvement that further complicates airway management because of limited neck range of motion. Th e patient must be evaluated for the presence of systemic complications such as pleuritis and pericarditis that a ff ect perioperative cardiopulmonary function so that appropriate anesthetic adjustments can be made. Finally, the physiologic implications  (e.g.,  immunosuppression)  of  medication  used  to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and corticosteroids must be considered.

CHILDHOOD MALIGNANCIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wilms's Tumor

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wilms's tumor, or nephroblastoma, is the most common type of renal cancer in children as well as the most common pediatric  abdominal  malignancy.  Overall,  it  is  the  fourth  most prevalent  childhood  cancer. Th e  overwhelming  majority  of patients have unilateral disease with only 6% showing bilateral renal involvement. Neonatal and adult presentations are rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wilms's tumor can occur as part of a syndrome or as a sporadic lesion, or it can be familial. It is thought to arise from persistent primitive  embryologic  cells  of  the  kidneys,  known  as metanephric blastema cells or nephrogenic rests. Nephrogenic rests that  later  undergo  spontaneous regression are seen in 1% of normal newborn kidneys. In comparison, up to 35% of kidneys with  unilateral  Wilms's  tumor  and  almost  100%  of  kidneys involved in bilateral disease have persistent nephrogenic rests. Loss of function of several tumor suppressor genes is thought to play a role, particularly in the familial form of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e peak incidence occurs between the ages of 1 and 3 years, and over 95% of cases are diagnosed before 10 years of age. Th e  most  common fi nding  is  an  abdominal  mass,  which may or may not be painful. Additional signs and symptoms include fever, anemia, hypertension, and hematuria. Associated congenital syndromes include WAGR syndrome ( Wilms's tumor, a niridia or agenesis of the iris and macular hypoplasia, g enitourinary anomalies, and r etardation or intellectual disabilities), Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, and Denys-Drash syndrome  (triad  of  progressive  renal  disease,  male  pseudohermaphroditism, and Wilms's tumor). Additional congenital anomalies that predispose to the development of Wilms's tumor are Perlman's syndrome (fetal gigantism), Sotos's syndrome (cerebral gigantism), and isolated hemihypertrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wilms's tumor is typically surrounded by a pseudocapsule that  may  rupture  with  aggressive  palpation,  manifesting  as  a rapidly  enlarging  abdominal  mass.  Gross  examination  may reveal cystic, hemorrhagic, and necrotic areas. Th e lungs are the most common sites for metastasis, although associated respiratory complaints are rare. Local invasion is uncommon, and metastatic disease is usually spread via lymphatic and hematogenous channels. Up to 40% of cases show tumor extension into  the  renal  vein;  invasion  into  the  inferior  vena  cava  and right atrium is much less common. Coincidental acquired von Willebrand's disease is seen in 8% of patients. Prognosis depends on tumor stage (I to V) with higher stage and unfavorable histologic features (anaplasia) predicting a lower chance of survival. With current therapy, children with tumors with favorable histologic features have over 90% chance of survival at 5 years and 80% to 90% chance of cure. Tumors with less favorable histologic  features  are  associated  with  an  average  lifetime  survival rate of 50%. Diagnosis usually begins with imaging studies to evaluate the primary tumor and potential metastatic disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According to the protocol of the National Wilms Tumor Study Group, surgical staging should take place before adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is begun to minimize the risk of treating a benign disease. Moreover, initiating chemotherapy before surgical staging may require changing what otherwise would have been the best treatment plan by necessitating the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
629

<!-- PAGE=? -->
use of di ff erent modalities (surgical resection, alternative chemotherapy, and radiotherapy). When feasible (well-con fi ned or relatively localized unilateral disease), radical nephrectomy is also performed at the time of staging. Extreme care to avoid tumor spillage during surgery is of utmost importance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients coming for Wilms's tumor staging and/or resection surgeries  may  be  at  higher  risk  of  aspiration  resulting  from abdominal  distention,  and  thus  full-stomach  precautions should be observed. Cardiopulmonary status must be determined for patients with known lung metastases and extensive caval involvement. Th e latter may be associated with sudden massive hemorrhage during dissection. For this reason at least one supradiaphragmatic large-bore intravenous line should be placed in case of inferior vena cava clamping. Speci fi c tests to assess preoperative cardiac function should be performed in patients who have undergone chemotherapy, because the standard regimen includes doxorubicin. Even with bilateral disease,  severe  renal  dysfunction is  rare.  Nonetheless,  standard laboratory tests to evaluate renal function and electrolyte balance as well as cell counts should be performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some surgeons use a laparoscopic approach, although most procedures are done with open incisions because of disease burden.  Continuous  epidural  analgesia  provides  excellent postoperative pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatoblastoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatoblastoma is the most common pediatric hepatic malignancy, although liver cancer is an uncommon childhood cancer  in  general.  It  is  a  disease  of  infants  and  young  children; adolescent and adult presentations are extremely rare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatoblastomas  arise  from  immature  liver  precursor  cells and  display  elements  resembling  normal  hepatic  structures (bile ducts, mature liver cells). Evidence of cirrhosis is uncommon.  Speci fi c  genetic  mutations  such  as  chromosomal  11 abnormalities and loss of APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) tumor suppressor gene function have been observed in hepatoblastomas that occur in association with particular congenital disorders. Tumors are typically unifocal and a ff ect the right lobe more o ft en than the le ft lobe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e median age at presentation is 1 year, and the overwhelming majority of hepatoblastomas occur in children younger than 3 years of age. Th ere is a slight male predilection (male/female ratio of 1.7:1), and white children are a ff ected fi ve times more frequently  than  African  American  children.  Children  born prematurely with low birth weight (<2500 g) have a signi fi -cantly increased risk of developing hepatoblastoma. A higher incidence is also observed in several congenital and genetic disorders, including Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, hemihypertrophy, and familial adenomatous polyposis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatoblastoma  most  commonly  presents  as  an  asymptomatic  abdominal  mass.  Anorexia  may  occur  in  advanced disease.  Some  hepatoblastomas  secrete β -human  chorionic gonadotropin  and  may  cause  penile  and  testicular  enlargement. Approximately 10% of children with hepatoblastomas have metastatic disease at presentation; the lungs are the most common sites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important laboratory marker for hepatoblastoma is α -fetoprotein,  although  it  is  not  speci fi c  to  this  disease. Regular monitoring of α -fetoprotein is important in assessing disease progression and response to treatment. Final diagnosis relies on tissue biopsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis is dependent on histologic features (anaplasia is unfavorable) and the ability to  completely  resect  the  tumor. Chemotherapy has emerged as an important part of a successful  treatment  plan.  Cisplatin  and  doxorubicin  are  the  most active agents against hepatoblastomas. Lesions that are amenable to complete resection at diagnosis are associated with a nearly 100% survival rate with adjuvant chemotherapy. Liver transplantation  has  become  important  in  the  treatment  of unresectable lesions and disease that has failed to respond to initial surgical and medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with hepatoblastomas can be in relatively robust health or can be acutely ill; speci fi c anesthetic techniques will di ff er accordingly. In addition to the usual preoperative assessment, speci fi c investigations to evaluate hepatic synthetic and metabolic functions should be carried out. In particular, coagulation status must be determined, and appropriate blood components reserved preoperatively, especially since hepatic resections are o ft en associated with signi fi cant bleeding. Preoperative cardiac function should be assessed in patients being treated with an anthracycline-based chemotherapeutic regimen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extreme  hemodynamic  perturbations  can  be  seen  in hepatic surgeries. Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring is  highly  recommended. In addition, large-bore intravenous access,  preferably  placed  in  the  supradiaphragmatic  venous circulation,  should  be  established.  Placement  of  a  central venous catheter is helpful for monitoring central venous pressure,  administering  vasoactive  drugs,  and  taking  frequent blood samples. Hypothermia is an important concern given the large area of surgical exposure as well as the potentially large volume resuscitation with fl uids and blood components. Unless preoperative coagulation abnormalities exist, continuous epidural analgesia should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroblastoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroblastoma refers  to  a  group  of  malignant  neoplasms  of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood and is the most common neoplasm seen in infants. Overall, it represents the third most common pediatric cancer, a ft er leukemia and intracranial tumors. It is a disease of extreme heterogeneity in both presentation and clinical course.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  in  the  case  of  many  cancer  types,  the  exact  mechanism and  triggers  for  the  development  of  neuroblastoma  are  not known. Neuroblastoma arises from primitive ganglion cells of the SNS. Since these primitive cells retain the potential for differentiation,  neuroblastoma represents a spectrum of tumor cell  types,  ranging  from  undi ff erentiated  small  round  cells (neuroblastoma) to mature ganglion (ganglioneuroblastoma). A  combination  of  genetic  and  environmental  factors  likely cause a cascade of mutational events in the prenatal and perinatal  period that ultimately lead to the formation of neuroblastic tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  hallmark  of  neuroblastoma  is  the  broad  range  of  tumor location and clinical behavior. Th ese tumors can occur anywhere  throughout  the  SNS. Th e  most  common  site  is  the adrenal glands (40% of cases), followed by abdominal, thoracic, cervical, and  pelvic sympathetic ganglia. Clinical behavior can be relatively benign with some tumors undergoing spontaneous regression or can be aggressively malignant with disease that is widely metastatic and resistant to therapy. Common sites of metastases include the bone marrow, cortical bone, lymph nodes, orbits, dura, and liver. In contrast to Wilms's tumor and hepatoblastoma, metastasis to the lungs is uncommon. Fi ft y percent of patients have metastatic disease at presentation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two  thirds  of  neuroblastomas  have  intraabdominal  primary  tumors  and  most  commonly  present  with  abdominal mass, pain, and fullness. Frequent metastatic involvement of cortical bone and bone marrow make bone pain another common symptom. Orbital involvement manifests as periorbital ecchymosis (raccoon eyes) and proptosis and may be the fi rst detectable clinical signs in young infants who cannot verbalize speci fi c complaints. Tumors arising from the paraspinal ganglion may impinge on nerve roots and cause spinal cord compression.  Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia  is  a  paraneoplastic syndrome seen in 2% of neuroblastoma cases. Th ese children exhibit involuntary random eye movements (opsoclonus) and myoclonic jerks that can persist even a ft er curative treatment of the cancer. A subtype of neuroblastoma called stage 4S is seen in young infants (<6 months) and consists of a small primary tumor with metastatic disease limited to the liver and skin (subcutaneous nodules); this form of neuroblastoma carries a favorable prognosis. Finally, neuroblastoma cells actively synthesize catecholamines, the metabolites of which are accumulated and secreted. Urinary secretion of these substances (homovanillic  acid  and  vanillylmandelic  acid)  can  be  measured to monitor disease activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnostic evaluation begins with various forms of imaging,  which  may  show  calci fi ed  masses  that  help  distinguish neuroblastoma  from  the  noncalcifying  lesions  of  Wilms's tumor.  Tissue  diagnosis  is  mandatory  before  treatment  is initiated; this can be accomplished by biopsy of the obvious primary  tumor  or  bone  marrow  aspiration  if  bone  marrow metastases are present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk strati fi cation based on histologic features, age at presentation (younger age is better), and extent of disease helps in individualizing treatment plans, which consist of surgical resection, chemotherapy, and occasionally radiotherapy. A well-recognized prognostic factor in neuroblastoma regardless of age and stage is MYCN status: ampli fi cation of the N-Myc proto-oncogene predicts poor outcome. Localized neuroblastoma (stage I) can o ft en be cured by surgical resection alone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic considerations depend on clinical presentation and the planned surgical procedure, which can range from simple bone  marrow  biopsy  to  craniotomy  for  dural  lesion  biopsy. Location, size, and metabolic activity of the tumor will dictate the  speci fi c  anesthetic  management,  including  decisions  to place arterial catheters, rapid-infusion intravenous catheters, and an epidural catheter for continuous neuraxial analgesia. In patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy cardiac function should be evaluated preoperatively. Despite potential catecholamine release with tumor manipulation, intraoperative hypertension is infrequent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ewing's Sarcoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ewing's sarcoma is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and adolescents a ft er osteosarcoma. It is part of the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors that share a common neuroectodermal origin and include peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma, atypical Ewing's sarcoma, and Askin's tumor (malignant small round cell tumor of the chest wall). Th ese are all small round cell neoplasms of varying di ff erentiation. Ewing's sarcoma represents the least di ff erentiated end of the spectrum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOGENESIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  cause  and  histopathologic  features  of  Ewing's  sarcoma have been a source of controversy since it was fi rst described in 1921 by James Ewing. Although tumors in the Ewing's sarcoma family share a common origin, the exact cell type giving rise to Ewing's sarcoma lesions is not known. What has been established  is  that  nearly  all  tumors  of  the  Ewing's  sarcoma family  have  a  reciprocal  translocation  of  the EWS gene  on chromosome 22, typically with chromosome 11, or t(22;11).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ewing's sarcoma is primarily a disease of adolescence. However,  approximately 30% of cases occur in children younger than  10  years  of  age  and  another  10%  occur  in  the  third decade of life. It preferentially a ff ects whites and is uncommon in blacks (both in the United States and Africa) and Asians. Lesions typically develop in fl at and long bones, mostly involving  the  long  bones  of  the  lower  extremities  followed  by  the pelvis and then the bones of the upper extremities. So ft tissues can also be involved. Localized pain, o ft en in association with a palpable mass, is the most common presenting symptom. Pain may be initiated by minor trauma and is usually exacerbated

Chapter 27 PEDIATRIC DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
by exercise and o ft en worse at night. Pathologic fractures are seen in 15% of cases. Systemic symptoms such as fever and anorexia are uncommon (in contrast with osteosarcoma), but when they are present, metastatic disease is likely.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between 20% and 25% of patients have clinically detectable metastatic  disease  at  presentation.  Most  cases,  however,  are thought to have micrometastases from the outset. Th e  most common sites are the lungs, bone, and bone marrow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
De fi nitive diagnosis is based on tissue biopsy. Experts recommend  that  bone  marrow  aspiration  and  biopsy,  at  least unilaterally, be a routine part of the initial workup given the predilection for bone marrow involvement. Plain radiography, CT,  MRI,  and  positron  emission  tomography  are  all  useful diagnostic modalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has signi fi cantly increased overall survival. Even in nonmetastatic disease, intensive chemotherapy consisting of alternating courses of vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin with ifosfamide and etoposide is administered, followed by surgical resection. Radiotherapy is also used, especially in cases of unresectable disease and positive  margins  a ft er  tumor  resection.  Hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation is being studied as an adjunctive treatment for metastatic disease involving bone and bone marrow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important prognostic factor in Ewing's sarcoma is the presence or absence of metastasis. Th e 5-year survival rate for those with localized disease is approximately 70%, compared with 30% for those with clinically detectable metastatic disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  important  consideration  in  the  perioperative  care of  patients  with  Ewing's  sarcoma  is  pain  control.  Patients typically  have  signi fi cant  preoperative  disease-related  pain, which  is  compounded  by  peri-incisional  pain  a ft er  surgery. Regional and neuraxial analgesia should be strongly considered. Ewing's sarcomas are not associated with any particular congenital  disorder,  so  few  patients  have  signi fi cant  comorbid conditions. Th e same principles described for any patient receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy also apply here.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumors of the Central Nervous System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  malignancies  of  the  CNS  collectively  represent  the second most common cancer of childhood and adolescence (a ft er leukemia). CNS malignancies have the highest morbidity of all childhood cancers, and the overall mortality approaches 50% despite advances in treatment modalities. Th e incidence is highest among infants and young children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  over  100  histologic  subtypes  of  primary  brain tumors, but only a few subtypes account for the majority of cases: astrocytomas,  medulloblastomas  (primitive  neuroectodermal tumors), ependymomas, and craniopharyngiomas. Tumors can occur anywhere in the CNS, and the location is determined primarily by type and age at presentation. Children younger than 1 year of age most o ft en have supratentorial tumors, which are also the most common in adolescents. Among children between the ages of 1 and 10 years, infratentorial lesions predominate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  depends  on  the  location  of  the tumor,  the  e ff ect  of  the  tumor  on  ICP ,  and  the  age  of  the child. Tumors that obstruct the normal fl ow of CSF will result in increased ICP and hydrocephalus; the child may demonstrate changes in behavior or personality and may complain of headaches along with nausea and vomiting. An increasing head size can be seen in children whose cranial sutures have not closed. Midline infratentorial tumors are classic examples; these lesions can also cause visual disturbances such as nystagmus, diplopia,  and  blurry  vision  owing  to  their  location. Supratentorial tumors generally cause widespread sensorimotor de fi cits as well as speech disorder (aphasia) and seizures. Tumors in the suprasellar and third ventricular regions o ft en lead to neuroendocrine abnormalities caused by anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunctions. Brainstem tumors are associated with cranial nerve palsies and occasionally upper motor neuron de fi cits  (hyperre fl exia).  Finally,  tumors  in  the  spinal cord, either primary lesions or metastatic seedings from leptomeningeal spread, can cause back pain, motor and/or sensory de fi cits, and possible bowel and bladder dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis must be made expeditiously given the high morbidity and mortality. Neuroimaging is important in both diagnosis and planning of surgical treatment. MRI remains the gold standard. Midline and suprasellar lesions also require additional laboratory testing to assess neuroendocrine disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Astrocytomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Astrocytomas  account  for  approximately  40%  of  CNS tumors and can occur throughout the CNS. As a group, astrocytomas  are  generally  of  low  histologic  grade  and  have  an indolent clinical course. Juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma is the most common subtype and typically a ff ects  the  cerebellum. Overall survival is 80% to 100% if complete surgical resection can be achieved. Aggressive subtypes such as anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme are rare in children and are seen mostly in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medulloblastomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medulloblastomas belong to the family of primitive neuroectodermal tumors, not to be confused with peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor, which is part of the Ewing family of  tumors  as  described  previously.  Primitive  neuroectodermal tumors account for 25% of CNS tumors, with the majority  being  medulloblastomas.  All  primitive  neuroectodermal tumors have a high histologic grade; clinically they demonstrate  high  metastatic  activity  within  the  neuraxis.  Medulloblastomas are cerebellar tumors that a ff ect boys more than girls with peak incidence between the ages of 5 and 7 years. Disseminated leptomeningeal disease is seen in approximately 30% of patients at presentation. Signs and symptoms related to increased ICP and cerebellar dysfunction (ataxia) are common. A multimodal treatment approach is standard.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ependymomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ependymomas  arise  from  the  ependymal  lining  of  the ventricular system. Th ey account for 10% of CNS tumors in children, and the majority are located in the posterior fossa. Surgery is the primary treatment modality, although it is rarely curative  without  adjuvant  radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy. Overall  survival  with  a  multimodal  treatment  approach  is approximately 40%. Local recurrence is not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniopharyngiomas

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Craniopharyngiomas  are  the  most  common  intracranial tumors of nonglial origin. Th ey are tumors of epithelial origin deriving from the remnants of Rathke's pouch and occur in the suprasellar region in almost all cases. Craniopharyngiomas can be  considered  benign  neoplasms,  although  malignant  transformations  have  been  reported.  Nonetheless,  these  "benign" tumors are associated with signi fi cant morbidities because of their anatomic proximity to important structures such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, optic chiasm, ventricular system, and carotid arteries. Even when curative surgical resection can be accomplished, children are o ft en le ft with serious neuroendocrine and visual complications. In the modern era treatment for craniopharyngiomas consists of surgery, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and chemotherapy. Tumor recurrence is  one  of  the  most  signi fi cant  and  commonly  encountered complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choroid Plexus Tumors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choroid plexus tumors are the most common CNS tumors of infancy, although they are generally rare in children. Clinical  symptoms  are  related  to  increased  ICP  caused  by  overproduction of CSF by the abnormal choroid plexus growths. Almost 100% of choroid plexus papillomas can be cured by surgical  resection;  choroid  plexus  carcinomas  have  a  much worse prognosis (survival rate of 40%).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic concerns for children with CNS tumors fall into two general categories: those relating to increased ICP and those pertaining to neuroendocrine disturbances, particularly ones that impact perioperative fl uid and electrolyte management. A thorough preoperative assessment must clearly establish the presence and severity of the aforementioned complications in addition to evaluating the general health and neurologic status of the patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the patient with increased ICP has already been described, and the reader is referred to the previous discussion on hydrocephalus. In general, anesthetic management is aimed at limiting further increase in ICP and preserving cerebral perfusion. Th e head is o ft en elevated above the level of the heart (even when the classic "sitting craniotomy" position is not used), so the risk of venous air embolism must be recognized. Precordial Doppler imaging is a sensitive means of detecting venous air embolism before hemodynamic changes are evident.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Of all the neuroendocrine disturbances that can result from CNS tumors, particularly from craniopharyngiomas, diabetes insipidus is the most important complication from a perioperative standpoint. Diabetes insipidus is diagnosed based on a  rising  serum  sodium  concentration  (>145  mg/dL)  in  the setting of copious dilute urine production (speci fi c gravity < 1.005). Th e patient may already have diabetes insipidus, and preoperative treatment (vasopressin infusion) must be continued intraoperatively along with isotonic fl uid administration at two thirds of the maintenance rate. Blood and evaporative losses must also be replaced. Vasopressin is typically started at  0.5  milliunits/kg/hr  and  is  increased  in  increments  of  0.5 milliunits/kg/hr until urine osmolality is twice that of serum osmolality or is titrated to keep urine output to less than 2 mL/ kg/hr. Desmopressin (DDAVP) can also be used; a single dose (0.5 to 4 mcg IV) lasts 8 to 12 hours, and thus it is less preferred than vasopressin because its e ff ects are not easily titratable.  Diabetes  insipidus  may  also  develop  postoperatively, typically 4 to 6 hours a ft er surgery. Intraoperative onset of diabetes insipidus is infrequent. An intraoperative need for mannitol complicates the management of diabetes insipidus. Urine output, urine and serum osmolality, and serum sodium must be strictly monitored throughout the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CNS  tumor  resections  can  be  associated  with  excessive blood loss, especially if important vascular structures such as the sagittal sinus are compromised. Intraarterial blood pressure monitoring should be used in all cases of craniotomy for tumor  resections.  A  sample  for  typing  and  cross  matching should already have been processed and the necessary blood components reserved in case transfusion is necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Modern procedures for CNS tumor resection at some centers include the use of perioperative MRI imaging to help guide the extent of resection. Th e patient undergoes MRI scanning in the operating room immediately a ft er tumor resection while still under general anesthesia. Strict MRI precautions must be observed to prevent injury to the patient and operating room personnel. Meticulous attention must be paid to securing the endotracheal tube and the various intravenous and intraarterial catheters to avoid dislodgment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANTERIOR MEDIASTINAL MASS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are many causes of anterior mediastinal mass in children,  including  both  neoplastic  and  nonneoplastic  diseases. In  the  neoplastic  category,  lymphomas  (non-Hodgkin's  and Hodgkin's disease) account for the majority of cases. Others include  lymphangiomas  (cystic  hygroma),  germ  cell  tumors (teratoma), and neurogenic tumors (neuroblastoma). Regardless of the cause, an anterior mediastinal mass can have serious cardiorespiratory consequences as a result of compression of adjacent structures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  presentation  of  an  anterior  mediastinal  mass depends how large it  is  and,  more  importantly,  on  whether the  mass  is  impinging  on  nearby  important  structures  such as the trachea, the heart, and the great vessels. Th ere is o ft en

Compression  of  the  tracheobronchial  tree  leads  to  varying  degrees  of  respiratory  compromise.  Patients  can  have tachypnea, wheezing, recurrent pneumonia, obstructive emphysema,  and  atelectasis.  Some  children  are  erroneously considered to have asthma until a mediastinal mass is found incidentally on a subsequent radiographic study. Asthmalike symptoms caused by a mediastinal mass do not respond to conventional  bronchodilator  treatment  because  the  pathophysiology  is  di ff erent.  Of  all  the  respiratory  complaints, orthopnea is most predictive of potential airway obstruction. Children  o ft en  report  worsening  of  their  symptoms  in  the supine  position.  Chronic  compression  of  the  tracheobronchial tree can lead to weakened wall structures whose patency becomes  dependent  on  the  negative  intrathoracic  pressure created during spontaneous respiration.

Cardiovascular signs and symptoms can be caused by compression of the heart and/or the great vessels. Compression of the heart can cause symptoms of restrictive pericardial disease, either  directly  by  tumor  compression  of  the  myocardium  or indirectly by causing a reactive pericardial e ff usion. Signs and symptoms of cardiac tamponade may occur, including Beck's triad  (increased  jugular  venous  pressure,  hypotension,  and decreased heart sounds), tachycardia, tachypnea, and dyspnea. As with respiratory complaints, cardiovascular symptoms may become worse in the supine position. Compression of the superior vena cava impairs venous drainage from the upper body, which  leads  to  upper  body  edema,  a  feature  of  the  superior vena cava syndrome. Other features of superior vena cava syndrome include facial and periorbital edema, shortness of breath, engorged jugular veins, headaches, and visual disturbances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  imaging  studies  are  useful  in  the  evaluation  of an  anterior  mediastinal  mass,  including  plain  radiography, CT, and MRI. Echocardiography can delineate the dynamic e ff ects of the mass on the heart and the proximal great vessels. Flow volume loops obtained in the supine and upright positions provide the best estimation of the dynamic respiratory impact of the mass. Unfortunately, most young children cannot cooperate with such testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
De fi nitive diagnosis is based on tissue biopsy, a procedure not  easily  accomplished  without  sedation  or  general  anesthesia  in  young  children.  Since  anterior  mediastinal  masses produce fi xed  and  dynamic  cardiorespiratory  compressive symptoms,  the  potential  loss  of  muscle  tone  and  negative intrathoracic  pressure  associated  with  the  administration  of sedative and anesthetic drugs can lead to disastrous outcomes. Some patients with large lesions are pretreated with corticosteroids or radiation therapy to reduce mass size before tissue biopsy under sedation or anesthesia is performed. However, such  prebiopsy  treatments  can  a ff ect  the  accuracy  of  future histologic evaluation and thus adversely impact the e ffi cacy of future treatment plans.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  important  concern  in  the  perioperative  management  of  a  child  with  an  anterior  mediastinal  mass  is  the potential loss of airway. A detailed preoperative assessment of  the  child's  respiratory  status  is  mandatory.  Speci fi cally, details  must  be  sought  regarding  the  particular  complaints, such  as  tachypnea  and  stridor,  as  well  as  maneuvers  that improve or worsen those symptoms. Positional changes (e.g., upright to supine) that worsen symptoms should be avoided even if it interferes with optimal positioning for the operative procedure.  Conversely,  positions  that  minimize  respiratory complaints  should  be  maintained.  Preoperative  radiologic studies must be reviewed to delineate the location and extent of potential compression by the mass. A preoperative radiographic fi nding  of  a  50%  reduction  in  the  tracheal  crosssectional  area  portends  respiratory  complications  with  the induction of general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tissue biopsy procedures that may be amenable to performance under local anesthesia with or without light sedation should be considered whenever possible (e.g., in an older child, biopsy of a peripheral lesion such as a cervical or supraclavicular node). If deep sedation or general anesthesia is required, spontaneous  ventilation  must  be  preserved,  because  airway patency may be entirely dependent on negative intrathoracic pressure. Carefully titrated inhaled volatile agents and intravenous ketamine and/or dexmedetomidine (1 to 3 mcg/kg/hr with or without a loading dose of 1 mcg/kg over 10 minutes) have been used successfully for maintenance in an anesthetized but spontaneously breathing child. Nitrous oxide should be avoided to maximize supplemental oxygen and to prevent rapid expansion of a potential pneumothorax that may occur during tissue biopsy. Titration of low doses of ketamine and/or dexmedetomidine, both of which lack signi fi cant respiratorydepressant  e ff ects,  can  produce  a  comfortably  sedated  child who may even tolerate deep tissue biopsy. Nonetheless, no one anesthetic  technique  can  guarantee  airway  patency.  For  this reason, the ability to perform rigid bronchoscopy (availability of both equipment and an experienced bronchoscopist) must be ensured in case of airway collapse. Intubation alone may not reestablish airway patency, because the tracheobronchial tree beyond the end of the tracheal tube may be compressed by the mass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rapid  cardiovascular  deterioration  may  also  occur  with induction  of  general  anesthesia,  because  the  child  may  be barely  maintaining  stable  hemodynamics  in  the  awake  and anxious  state.  Careless  positional  changes  may  also  cause direct compression of cardiovascular structures by the mass, leading  to  impaired  ventricular  output  and  venous  return. Because of its  sympathomimetic e ff ects,  ketamine  is  a  good choice  to  help  maintain  stable  hemodynamic  parameters. Its  direct  myocardial-depressant  e ff ects  must  be  recognized, however. Adequate intravenous access in the lower extremities must be established, since compression of the superior great vessels can occur even in the absence of preexisting superior vena cava syndrome.

Should cardiorespiratory decompensation occur, the child should be turned to a lateral decubitus or prone position to help  relieve  the  compression  exerted  by  the  mass.  An  extra bed  or  stretcher  should  be  immediately  available,  especially for older children, to help facilitate quick prone positioning.

Children with hematologic malignancies may have coagulation abnormalities (thrombocytopenia). Th erefore, available preoperative laboratory data should be reviewed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although children with an anterior mediastinal mass are at risk for signi fi cant perioperative morbidity and mortality, the actual  incidence  of  perioperative  complications  is  quite  low due to  the  recognition  of  prognostic  factors  and  the  implementation  of  appropriate  anesthetic  techniques.  In  general, perioperative complications have occurred mostly in patients with preoperative compressive symptoms. In a recent study, the  clinical  and  diagnostic  imaging fi ndings that were most predictive  of  anesthetic  complications  include  orthopnea, upper body edema, great vessel compression, and main bronchus compression. Th e  presence of pleural e ff usion and tracheal compression also appeared to be risk factors.

Th e potential for postanesthetic airway compromise is high given  the  propensity  for  tracheobronchomalacia.  Vigilant monitoring in the postanesthesia care unit or ICU is required before the patient can be returned to a less acute care setting.

DOWN'S SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Down's syndrome is the most common chromosomal abnormality, occurring in 1 in 700 to 1 in 800 live births. Advanced maternal age signi fi cantly  increases  the  risk  of  this  chromosomal aberration. Also known as trisomy 21, Down's syndrome can also occur with mosaicism and translocation of chromosome 21. Patients with Down's syndrome have characteristic dysmorphic  features  and  have  a  higher  incidence  of  many health problems than their healthy counterparts (Table 27-19). Some of these health issues are congenital and some occur later on in life. Although the overall life expectancy of patients with Down's syndrome has dramatically improved over the years, Down's syndrome still confers a shorter life span than would be expected for healthy individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Down's syndrome is usually recognized at birth or soon therea ft er by a constellation of characteristic dysmorphic features. Th ese include upslanting palpebral fi ssures, epicanthal folds, fl attened  nasal  bridge, fl attened  occiput  and  brachycephalic head shape, short broad hands with a palmar crease (simian crease), and hypotonia. Diagnosis is con fi rmed by karyotype analysis. Congenital anomalies of almost all organ systems are associated with Down's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Down's syndrome is the most common cause of intellectual disability. Almost all a ff ected children have some degree of mental retardation. Most are only mildly to moderately impaired, although severe mental retardation can occur. Individuals with Down's  syndrome  are  also  prone  to  developing  early-onset

defects (low tone and redundancy) and skeletal abnormalities (midface hypoplasia, high arched palate, micrognathia). Moreover, poor tone and macroglossia further predispose to upper airway obstruction. Most children with Down's syndrome are observed to have a protruding tongue. Subglottic airway diameter is generally decreased; small insults can lead to clinically overt subglottic stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately half of all patients with Down's syndrome have  congenital  heart  disease.  Endocardial  cushion  defects (atrioventricular septal defects) are the most common (40% to 50%), followed by ventral septal defects, secundum atrial septal  defects,  persistent  patent  ductus  arteriosus,  tetralogy of Fallot, and others (vascular rings). Th ere can be single or multiple defects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrointestinal  anomalies  are  also  common,  including gastroesophageal  re fl ux,  intestinal  atresia,  anorectal  malformations, and Hirschsprung's disease. From a musculoskeletal standpoint,  patients  with  Down's  syndrome  have  hypotonia and their joints are hyperextensible. Dysplastic pelvis is also common.  Atlantoaxial  instability  has  potentially  the  gravest impact on neurologic function. Subluxation of the atlas (C1) and  axis  (C2)  joint  can  cause  spinal  cord  compression  with resultant  sensorimotor  de fi cits  as  well  as  loss  of  bowel  and bladder control.  According  to  the  current  recommendations of  the  American Academy of Pediatrics on the management of  patients  with Down's syndrome, children should undergo radiographic  screening  for  atlantoaxial  instability  between the  ages  of  3  and  5  years.  Children  may  have  asymptomatic atlantoaxial instability. Symptoms of cord compression include neck pain, torticollis, and gait abnormalities. Bowel and bladder dysfunction as well as paretic symptoms require immediate surgical stabilization of the atlantoaxial joint.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th yroid hormonal disturbances are frequently seen; hypothyroidism is more common than hyperthyroidism. Endocrine abnormalities may play a role in the tendency toward obesity among patients with Down's syndrome; these patients have also been demonstrated to have a lower rate of metabolism. Finally, children with Down's syndrome have a high incidence of hematologic abnormalities such as neonatal polycythemia. Th ey have a 10- to 20-fold increased risk of developing leukemia. Immune de fi ciencies are not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several clinical manifestations and  associated congenital anomalies are of particular concern in the perioperative management  of  children  with  Down's  syndrome.  A  thorough preoperative assessment must be done with speci fi c focus on the cardiac, respiratory, and neurologic status. Th e  presence of atlantoaxial instability may not be apparent, because most patients are asymptomatic. Th e parents should be questioned speci fi cally about symptoms suggestive of atlantoaxial subluxation, such as neck pain, head tilt, and abnormal gait. Older infants and toddlers can be observed for poor head control, passive limited neck range of motion, and signs and symptoms of upper motor neuron dysfunction (spasticity, hyperre fl exia, clonus).  Any  existing  neck  radiographic  studies  should  be reviewed. Elective surgery should be delayed if there is clinical or radiographic evidence of subluxation (posterior atlantodens interval of >4 to 5 mm), and a neurosurgeon should be  consulted  for  further  management.  Even  in  the  absence of overt atlantoaxial instability, neck manipulation should be kept to a minimum, especially during laryngoscopy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Macroglossia compounded by potential micrognathia and midface hypoplasia predispose these children to rapid airway obstruction and hypoxemia with induction of anesthesia. Oral airways  should  always  be  available  to  help  in  reestablishing airway  patency. Th ese  children  are  also  at  a  higher  risk  for developing  postintubation  croup  because  they  tend  to  have a  smaller  absolute  subglottic  airway  diameter. Th erefore, children with Down's syndrome should be intubated with a smaller  endotracheal  tube  than  predicted  for  age.  As  in  all children, an air leak at or below a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O must be demonstrated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  bradycardia  occurs  with  inhaled  sevo fl urane induction  in  up  to  50%  of  children  with  Down's  syndrome regardless of the presence or absence of co-existing congenital  heart  disease.  It  has  been  speculated  that  these  children have ultrastructural myocardial defects that predispose them to conduction abnormalities. Anticholinergics (atropine, glycopyrrolate)  should  be  immediately  available  in  the  appropriate  weight-based  doses.  Increased  sensitivity  to  atropine is  occasionally  seen,  manifesting  as  mydriasis  and  profound tachycardia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Co-existing congenital heart disease must be clearly delineated. Anesthetic management is guided by the in-situ pattern of blood fl ow and should be aimed at balancing the pulmonary and  systemic  circulations.  In  general,  children  with  Down's syndrome undergoing cardiac surgery have a higher perioperative mortality than their counterparts without trisomy 21.

Patients  must  be  closely  observed  for  obstructive  symptoms and hypoventilation in the postoperative period given the high incidence of obstructive sleep apnea and obesity.

MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially lethal genetic disorder of muscle hypermetabolism that occurs upon exposure  to  volatile  anesthetic  agents  and  succinylcholine.  It  has multiple inheritance patterns, including autosomal dominant, autosomal  recessive,  and  unclassi fi ed.  Both  penetrance  and expression are variable, and a ff ected individuals demonstrate di ff erent sensitivity to triggering agents and manifest di ff erent levels of clinical severity. Overall incidence of MH is estimated to be anywhere between 1 in 3000 to 1 in 15,000 in children. Th e higher incidence represents cases in which both a volatile anesthetic agent and succinylcholine are used. Most cases occur in the fi rst three decades of life, although cases of MH at the extremes of age have been reported.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nonanesthetic  stressors  such  as  heat  and  human  handling (porcine stress syndrome). All breeds of pigs that are susceptible to MH share a speci fi c point mutation in the ryanodine receptor gene ( RYR1 ). Th is same point mutation is seen in a minority of humans who are susceptible to MH. Mutations in multiple other loci of the RYR1 gene (located on chromosome 19)  have  been  demonstrated  in  susceptible  human  families. In  addition,  abnormalities  in  other  muscle  membrane  proteins such as the dihydropyridine receptor have been linked with MH. Th is  explains the heterogeneous nature of MH in humans.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal muscle contraction depends on an increase in intracellular (sarcoplasmal) calcium (Ca 2+ ). Upon membrane depolarization,  Ca 2+ is  released  from  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum into the sarcoplasma via the dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptors, both of which are voltage-gated ion channels. Calcium interacts with troponin to allow cross-bridging between actin and myosin for muscle contraction to occur. MH-related mutations in the RYR1 gene decrease receptor threshold for Ca 2+ release.  In  addition,  a ff ected  RYR1 receptors  are  resistant to the negative feedback mechanisms (increased Ca 2+  and magnesium levels) that normally decrease Ca 2+  conductance. Exposure  to  triggers  causes  an  exaggerated  Ca 2+ release  at smaller levels of membrane depolarization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is consumed in all steps of intracellular Ca 2+   handling. Decoupling of Ca 2+  from troponin  (muscle  relaxation)  requires  ATP .  Removal  of  intracellular  Ca 2+ ,  including  return  to  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum and mitochondria as well as extrusion into the extracellular milieu, also requires ATP . Because of this, the initial exaggerated release of Ca 2+  via abnormal ryanodine receptors sets up a cascade of reactions that consumes an equally exaggerated amount of ATP, and hypermetabolism ensues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MH in humans is a heterogeneous disorder, and thus clinical presentation varies greatly. Some susceptible individuals can receive multiple triggering anesthetics without apparent problems,  whereas  others  demonstrate  severe  reactions  to  only traces of volatile agents. Time of onset is also variable; some have immediate reactions upon exposure to triggers and others do not manifest signs and symptoms of MH until well into the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  MH  are  nonspeci fi c and re fl ect a hypermetabolic state such as would also be seen  in  conditions  such  as  thyroid  storm,  fulminant  sepsis, and  pheochromocytoma (Table 27-20). Th erefore,  diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion along with consideration of the circumstances speci fi c  to  each  patient  (trigger  exposure, comorbid conditions, family history).

Early clinical signs of MH include sinus tachycardia, tachypnea (if  there  is  spontaneous  ventilation),  hypercarbia  (that

does  not  improve  with  compensatory  increases  in  minute ventilation), and masseter muscle spasm (Table 27-21). Rapid exhaustion of the carbon dioxide absorber is usually evident along  with  obvious  warming  of  the  canister.  Dysrhythmias and peaked T waves may also be seen on the electrocardiogram,  re fl ecting  progressive  hyperkalemia.  Increase  in  core temperature can occur within 15 minutes of exposure to culprit agents. However, overt hyperthermia may be a late sign. Laboratory analysis typically reveals a mixed respiratory and metabolic  acidosis  (lactic  acidosis),  arterial  hypoxemia,  and hyperkalemia.  Because  MH  is  a  hypermetabolic  disorder  of skeletal muscles, later clinical manifestations are more speci fi c to, but not pathognomonic of, an underlying muscle pathology. Masseter muscle spasm can progress to whole-body muscle rigidity with imminent rhabdomyolysis. At this stage, MH is  considered to be fulminant; the patient will typically have cola-colored urine along with myoglobinuria and an elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK) level (characteristically in excess of 20,000 units/L) on laboratory testing. Ultimately, the body's capacity to support the exaggerated oxidative metabolism is exhausted, and cardiovascular collapse ensues. Severe hyperthermia is also associated with the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation.

A diagnosis of MH is made based on the clinical picture. De fi nitive  diagnosis  requires  tissue  biopsy  to  obtain  a  specimen for the ca ff eine-halothane contracture test.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MASSETER SPASM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Masseter spasm is o ft en the fi rst clue to potential MH. However, transient jaw rigidity is a normal response to succinylcholine  administration. Th ere  are  several  confusing  terms describing  masseter  spasm,  including trismus and masseter muscle rigidity. However, they are not synonymous but rather describe a spectrum of spasm intensity. Trismus is generally de fi ned  as  masseter  spasm  that  still  permits  enough  mouth opening for intubation and masseter muscle rigidity is de fi ned as  masseter  spasm  that  completely  prevents  mouth  opening.  Regardless,  masseter  spasm  deserves  immediate  attention, because its presence in children is associated with a 50% chance of MH susceptibility and a 30% chance of an actual MH episode. Controversy still exists regarding whether or not to continue elective surgery and which anesthetic technique to choose once masseter spasm occurs. Worrisome signs include persistent or worsening masseter spasm and concurrent manifestations of hypermetabolism, in which case elective surgery should be aborted. If masseter spasm is mild and/or transient and is also an isolated fi nding, elective surgery may continue, but the child should receive ample intravenous hydration to maintain a urine output of at least 2 to 3 mL/kg/hr because myoglobinuria  may  occur.  Signi fi cant  serum  CK  elevations can be seen in isolated masseter spasm; thus, the patient must be  monitored  postoperatively  for  resolution.  Experienced anesthesiologists  di ff er  in  their  opinions  on  whether  or  not volatile  agents  should  be  immediately  discontinued in these cases.  However,  it  is  di ffi cult  to  justify  continuing  volatile drug-based anesthesia in these circumstances when currently available equipment and medications make it easy to transition to a nontriggering technique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHESIA-INDUCED RHABDOMYOLYSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dystrophinopathies (Duchenne's and Becker's muscular dystrophy)  have  long  been  linked  with  possible  increased  MH susceptibility. It has now become apparent that these patients do not have an increased susceptibility to MH. However, they can develop MH-like symptoms upon exposure to the same triggering agents. Speci fi cally, these patients can develop anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis, which is frequently accompanied by the same hypermetabolic signs as those seen in MH. Instead  of  ryanodine  receptor  abnormalities,  the  absence  of the  dystrophin-glycoprotein  complex  in  dystrophinopathies results  in  instability  and  increased  permeability  of  the  muscle  cell  membrane  (sarcolemma)  with  resultant  increased intracellular  Ca 2+ levels.  Sarcolemma  instability  also  predisposes to membrane breakdown leading to massive potassium release. For this reason, an acute onset of hyperkalemic cardiac arrest (without preceding hypermetabolic signs) can be the fi rst  manifestation  of  anesthesia-induced  rhabdomyolysis, a presentation not typical of MH. Th e role of dantrolene in  the  treatment  of  anesthesia-induced  rhabdomyolysis  is unknown, but it likely has little e ffi cacy because it does not possess membrane-stabilizing e ff ects.  Although only a small percentage of patients with dystrophinopathies may develop

Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  only  known  antidote  for  MH  is  dantrolene;  additional treatments  consist  of  supportive  and  resuscitative  measures (Table 27-22). Dantrolene is thought to inhibit Ca 2+  conductance through ryanodine receptor channels. More recently, it has been shown that dantrolene blocks the external entry of Ca 2+   into the sarcoplasma that normally occurs upon membrane  depolarization.  Regardless  of  the  mechanism,  dantrolene halts further rises in intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Th e most common side e ff ects of dantrolene are muscle weakness and vein irritation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once an acute episode of MH is suspected, all triggering agents must be stopped immediately and the anesthesia machine fl ushed with 100% oxygen at the highest possible fl ow rate. Dantrolene must be given expeditiously starting at  2.5  mg/kg, and occasionally a cumulative dose of more than  10  mg/kg  is  required  to  control  the  hypermetabolic signs  and  sequelae.  Preparation  of  dantrolene  solutions  is a cumbersome task, and the need to call for additional help immediately cannot be overemphasized. Dantrolene powder  must  be  diluted  with  sterile  distilled  water.  Each  vial contains 20 mg of dantrolene along with 3 g of mannitol, which must be mixed with 60 mL of sterile water. Newer formulations of dantrolene manufactured a ft er  2008  solubilize  more  easily,  but  it  is  nonetheless  a  time-consuming process, especially in the face of a rapidly deteriorating clinical situation. Th e surgeon must be noti fi ed immediately to abort or to complete surgery as quickly as possible. Under no circumstance should volatile agents or succinylcholine be administered again.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supportive and resuscitative measures are aimed at addressing  the  hypermetabolic  consequences.  Hyperventilation  with  100%  oxygen  should  be  initiated  to  compensate for  the  increased  carbon  dioxide  production  and  oxygen consumption.  Aggressive  hydration  with  room-temperature fl uids and possible pharmacologic diuresis (furosemide, mannitol) should be started to maintain a urine output of at least 2 mL/kg/hr to minimize renal damage from myoglobinuria. One  must  be  remember  that  dantrolene  solutions  contain mannitol in calculating the dose being administered. Active cooling  can  be  done  with  surface  cooling  and  intracavitary lavage of the stomach and bladder with cold saline solutions. An arterial catheter should be placed to continuously monitor the patient's hemodynamic parameters and to allow for repeat blood sampling. Metabolic disturbances such as metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia should be treated with a combination of sodium bicarbonate, regular insulin with glucose (to drive potassium intracellularly), β -agonists,  and  calcium  chloride, especially if there are electrocardiographic manifestations of hyperkalemia  (peaked  T  waves,  widened  QRS  complex),  to prevent progression to hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.

A ft er  the  acute  episode  of  MH  has  been  controlled,  the patient must have continued care in an ICU setting. Recrudescence occurs in up to 25% of patients, with muscular body type,  temperature  increase,  and  increased  latency  between exposure and MH onset as risk factors. Recrudescence usually occurs within the fi rst few hours a ft er the initial episode, but late presentations (up to 36 hours a ft er the initial episode) have been reported. Because of this, dantrolene therapy should continue (1 mg/kg every 6 hours) for 48 to 72 hours a ft er the last  observed  sign  of  MH.  Dantrolene  may  also  be  given  as a continuous infusion (0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg/hr). Development of disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  is  an  ominous  sign and is a common fi nding in fatal MH.

At least 1 g of muscle must be harvested for satisfactory testing; this precludes some young children from undergoing the  test  because  of  their  small  size. Th e  patient's  immediate family  members  should  be  counseled  and  possibly  referred for muscle and genetic testing as well (Table 27-23). All cases of  suspected  MH  and  signi fi cant  masseter  spasm  should  be reported  to  the  North  American  Malignant  Hyperthermia Registry (888-274-7899).

Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identi fi cation of susceptible patients is the most important fi rst step. It would of course be ideal to be able to identify all MHsusceptible patients so that triggering agents can be avoided. Th is is neither possible nor feasible, especially in the pediatric populations  in  which  the  majority  of  patients  are  receiving their fi rst anesthetic. Family history is unclear in many cases, particularly for adopted children. Preoperative serum CK levels are generally not predictive (some patients with elevated baseline  CK  levels  are  not  MH  susceptible,  whereas  others with a normal preoperative serum CK concentration go on to develop MH). Th ere are currently only a few disorders that have been clearly linked with MH; these include central core disease, King-Denborough syndrome, and Evans's myopathy. Th ey  are  all  rare  and  well-de fi ned clinical  entities.  Of  note, a rare subset of MH-susceptible patients can develop MH in response to nonanesthetic triggers such as vigorous exercise, heat, and anxiety, as in pigs with porcine stress syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative dantrolene prophylaxis is not indicated. Some continue to administer prophylactic dantrolene (2 to 4 mg/kg IV 15 to 30 minutes before induction) when the patient has a  documented history  of  severe  MH.  In  addition  to  muscle weakness and vein irritation, other side e ff ects of dantrolene include nausea, blurred vision, and diarrhea. For this reason, the drug must be given in a monitored setting, especially when the patient has underlying neuromuscular and/or respiratory dysfunctions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Children should be given a liberal dose of oral anxiolytic(s) preoperatively. In addition to midazolam, ketamine (4 to 5 mg/kg if used with midazolam and 9 to 10 mg/kg if used alone) should be considered as an adjunct to maximize sedation while preserving respiratory e ff orts. Topical local anesthetics (lidocaine plus prilocaine [EMLA], 4% lidocaine [ELA-Max]) should be applied on  anticipated  intravenous  catheter  insertion  sites  to  facilitate awake placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once MH susceptibility is identi fi ed or suspected, a nontriggering  anesthetic  plan  (Table  27-24)  must  be  initiated

<!-- PAGE=? -->
that includes elimination of triggering agents and thorough preparation  of  the  anesthesia  machine  to  minimize  even trace  residues  of  volatile  agents.  If  available,  a  dedicated MH-preventive anesthesia machine that was never exposed to volatile anesthetics should be used. Otherwise, the anesthesia station must be fl ushed with highfl ow oxygen for the recommended length of time speci fi c  to  each  model (from 20 minutes to over 100 minutes). Most current models have an extensive internal fl ow circuitry that requires a much longer fl ush time to reduce residual volatile anesthetics to clinically insigni fi cant levels. External parts such as the anesthesia circuit, ventilation bag, and carbon dioxide absorber should be changed and vaporizers removed. Dantrolene and other resuscitative drugs must be immediately available. Th e entire perioperative  team  should  be  made  aware  of  the  patient's condition and be educated on the recognition and treatment of MH. Th e presurgical time-out provides an ideal opportunity to voice anesthetic concerns and delineate a clear treatment plan should MH occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use  of  nitrous  oxide  in  oxygen  can  facilitate  intravenous catheter  placement in a child who is not adequately sedated with premedication. Intramuscular induction (e.g., ketamine 4 to 5 mg/kg) is an alternative for the unusually uncooperative  and  combative  child.  Maintenance  of  anesthesia  relies mostly  on  intravenous  hypnotics,  with  or  without  nitrous oxide; nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may be used if necessary. Dexmedetomidine is a useful adjunct for both its sedative and analgesic e ff ects. Whenever possible, local anesthesia (both ester- and amide-based drugs are safe) or regional anesthesia should be used. Standard monitoring as prescribed by the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists  (pulse  oximetry, end-tidal  carbon  dioxide  measurement,  electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, and temperature monitoring)  usually  su ffi ces,  and  additional  invasive  monitoring such as peripheral arterial cannulation and central venous line placement are not necessary unless dictated for other reasons speci fi c to the patient's condition or the surgical procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the patient does not show clinical signs of MH within the fi rst hour a ft er a nontriggering anesthetic technique is implemented, MH is unlikely to occur later. All patients must be

monitored for at least 1 hour (preferably 4 hours) in the postoperative period. Discharge to home is acceptable if the usual discharge criteria are met.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Characteristics of the pediatric patient related to the airway include a relatively larger head and tongue, a more cephalad larynx, and a shorter cord-to-carina distance (4 mm in a term newborn). Th e cricoid cartilage is the narrowest part of the airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Children  have  a  resting  oxygen  consumption  rate  that  is twice  that  of  adults. Th eir  functional  residual  capacity  is similar to that in adults on a per-kilogram basis. Pulmonary and chest wall compliance is high. Not only does their larger tongue  size  predispose  to  upper  airway  obstruction,  children are at risk for rapid onset of hypoxemia upon induction of general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Pulmonary vascular resistance is high at birth and decreases to adult levels over days to months, but pulmonary vasculature remains reactive for a longer period of time. Th e ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale are only functionally closed at birth and may reopen under conditions of high pulmonary vascular resistance, hypercarbia, and hypoxemia with resultant reversion to fetal circulation patterns.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  immature  myocardium  of  neonates  and  infants  have limited  contractile  and  elastic  reserves,  which  results  in  a relatively fi xed stroke volume. Cardiac output and systemic blood pressure are dependent on heart rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Physiologic anemia occurs between 2 and 3 months of age (nadir  hematocrit  of  29%  to  31%).  Obtaining  a  complete blood  count  preoperatively  may  be  prudent  in  this  age group if signi fi cant intraoperative blood loss is anticipated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Newborns generate heat via nonshivering brown fat metabolism. Hypothermic stress leads to increased oxygen consumption and thus increased risk of hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Because of risks of apnea of prematurity and postanesthetic apnea, preterm infants younger than 60 weeks' postconceptual age should be observed overnight for apnea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Drug and fl uid administration and ventilatory parameters should always be guided by the child's weight. Calculating doses on a per-kilogram basis and preparing drugs and fl uids  ahead  of  time  is  helpful,  particularly  in  emergent  and unexpected clinical  situations.  Estimates  of  blood  volume and maximal allowable blood loss, also on a per-kilogram basis, are useful to guide transfusion therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  MAC  for  sevo fl urane  varies  with  age:  for  birth  to 6 months of age it is 3.2%; for 6 months to 12 years of age, 2.5%. Th e  MAC-awake  (concentration  required  to  block voluntary  re fl exes  and  control  perceptive  awareness)  for sevo fl urane in children is 0.2 to 0.3 of the MAC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Maintenance  of  spontaneous  ventilation  is  usually  key to  successful  airway  management  of  children  with  airway  disease  and  craniofacial  abnormalities.  Close  communication between surgeon and anesthesiologist is also essential.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ An air leak around the endotracheal tube at or below a pressure of 25 cm H 2 O must always be demonstrated to minimize risk of tracheal mucosal injury. When an appropriately sized cu ff ed endotracheal tube is used, cu ff pressure should also be monitored and kept at 25 cm H 2 O or less.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Congenital  anomalies  can  exist  as  isolated fi ndings  or  as part  of  a  syndrome.  Additional  congenital  abnormalities such as congenital heart disease and renal defects are commonly seen. A brief but comprehensive preoperative assessment of all organ systems is usually in order.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Anti fi brinolytic  therapy  (aminocaproic  acid,  tranexamic acid) should be considered in children undergoing surgery with expected large-volume blood loss such as procedures to correct craniosynostosis and posterior spinal fusion. Children with syndromic conditions appear to have a higher risk of bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ CNS diseases may be accompanied by increased ICP, sensorimotor de fi cits, endocrine disturbance, and brainstem dysfunction. Appropriate anesthetic precautions must be taken. Monitoring for diabetes insipidus is especially important in patients with suprasellar lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Anterior mediastinal mass presents a formidable anesthetic challenge.  Maintenance  of  spontaneous  ventilation  (negative  intrathoracic  pressure)  is  essential.  Preparation  must be made for rescue maneuvers (rigid bronchoscopy, prone positioning).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Children  with  Down's  syndrome  may  have  atlantoaxial instability,  so  cervical  manipulation  should  be  kept  to  a minimum. Severe bradycardia is seen in up to 50% of children  with  Down's  syndrome  with  sevo fl urane  inhalation induction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ MH  and  anesthesia-induced  rhabdomyolysis  are  distinct clinical  entities  that  share  similar  clinical  manifestations. Dantrolene is e ff ective in the treatment of MH, but not of anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis. Only central core disease,  King-Denborough syndrome, and Evans's myopathy have been clearly linked with MH susceptibility.

|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hyperthyroidism                  | Characteristic symptoms and physical findings often present, blood gas abnormalities increase gradually |
| Sepsis                           | Hypercarbia usually not seen, severe lactic acidosis may be present                   |
| Pheochromocytoma                | Similar to MH except marked blood pressure swings                                      |
| Metastatic carcinoid            | Same as pheochromocytoma                                                               |
| Cocaine intoxication             | Fever, rigidity, rhabdomyolysis similar to malignant neuroleptic syndrome              |
| Heat stroke                      | Similar to MH except that patient is outside operating room                            |
| Masseter muscle rigidity         | May progress to MH, with or without total body spasm                                   |
| Malignant neuroleptic syndrome   | Similar to MH, usually associated with the use of antidepressants                      |
| Serotonergic syndrome            | Similar to MH and malignant neuroleptic syndrome, associated with the use of mood-elevating drug |
