PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  changes  in  the  cardiovascular  system  are  caused  by the  hormonal  changes  of  pregnancy.  Increased  activity  of progesterone  results  in  increased  production  of  nitric  oxide and prostacyclin,  which  together  with  a  decreased  response to  norepinephrine  and  angiotensin  result  in  vasodilation. Increased concentrations of relaxin lead to renal artery dilation and, through reduction in aortic sti ff ness, aortodilation (an approximately 0.5-cm increase in the diameter of the aorta is seen at term). Th e decrease in systemic vascular resistance during the initial weeks a ft er conception causes a compensatory  elevation  of  cardiac  output  (initially  resulting  from  an increase in heart rate) and an increase in renin activity. Th e increased renin activity results in retention of sodium and, by osmotic gradient, water. About 1000 mEq of sodium will be retained by term, which results in the retention of an extra 7 to 10 L of water. Plasma volume begins to rise in the fourth week of pregnancy, is increased by 10% to 15% at 6 to 12 weeks, and reaches a maximum (30% to 50% increase) at 28 to 34 weeks. Th e increase in plasma volume, combined with a 20% to 30% increase  in  total  red  blood  cell  mass,  results  in  signi fi cantly elevated total blood volume, which reaches 100 mL/kg at term. Cardiac output rises in parallel with plasma volume, increasing  by  15%  at  8  weeks'  gestation  and  reaching  a  maximum increase of 50% by 28 to 32 weeks. Plasma volume and cardiac output remain stable from approximately 32 weeks until labor begins. In labor, cardiac output rises as a result of sympathetic stimulation (pain and stress) and "autotransfusion," the displacement of blood from the contracting uterus into the circulation. Compared with prelabor output, cardiac output is increased by 20% during the fi rst  stage  and  50% during the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
558

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
559

<!-- PAGE=? -->
second stage of labor. Just a ft er delivery of the placenta (the end of the third stage of labor), cardiac output is elevated 80% above prelabor levels. Cardiac output falls to the prelabor level in 24 to 48 hours and returns to the prepregnancy level in the next 12 to 24 weeks. Twin pregnancy results in a 20% greater increase in cardiac output than with single gestation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Such an increase in cardiac workload results in ventricular  hypertrophy.  According  to  one  echocardiographic  study, the  le ft ventricle  increases  in  size  by  6%  and  the  right  ventricle increases by 15% to 20% by term. Increases in the size and dilation of the cardiac chamber result in a mild degree of  insu ffi ciency of all the valves except the aortic valve; it is not  normal  to  see  aortic  insu ffi ciency  at  any  stage  of  pregnancy. Enlargement of the heart and cephalic displacement of the diaphragm cause a horizontal shi ft in and rotation of the heart, which results in changes in the cardiac axis on the electrocardiogram. It is not abnormal to see a deep S wave in lead I and a large Q wave with negative T waves in leads III and IVF. Th e decline in systemic vascular resistance in early pregnancy reaches a nadir of 35% decrease at 20 weeks. Systemic vascular resistance slowly rises later, but remains 20% lower at term than the prepregnancy level. Central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure remain stable throughout the pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A mechanical change in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy is inferior vena cava compression. By term, femoral vein pressure is elevated 2.5-fold in the supine position. Compression of the aorta by the gravid uterus results in aortocaval compression or supine hypotension syndrome. At term, about 15%  of  pregnant  patients  in  the  supine  position  develop  a short period of tachycardia, followed by bradycardia and profound hypotension that is resistant to treatment with pressors. To prevent and treat this syndrome, le ft displacement of the uterus is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes in the respiratory system are also caused by the hormonal  changes  of  pregnancy.  Increased  activity  of  relaxin results in a relaxation of the ligaments of the rib cage, which allows displacement of the ribs into a more horizontal position. Th is  leads  to  upward  displacement  of  the  diaphragm very  early  in  pregnancy,  before  the  gravid  uterus  shi ft s  the abdominal contents. Elevation of the diaphragm and the more horizontal position of the ribs modify the shape of the chest into a barrel-like form; this decreases the vertical dimension of the chest by about 4 cm, but increases the diameter of the chest  by  more  than  5  cm,  which  signi fi cantly  increases  the volume of the lungs available for gas exchange during normal spontaneous respiration. Tidal volume increases up to 40% by term. Increased activity of progesterone, a potent respiratory stimulant, leads to an increase in tidal volume and more rapid respiratory rate, so that minute ventilation is increased by 50% at term. Chronic hyperventilation results in respiratory alkalosis with a pH of 7.44, Pa co 2 of 28 to 32 mm Hg, and HCO 3 concentration  of  20  mmol/L.  Secondary  to  a  diminished physiologic shunt during pregnancy Pa o 2 rises slightly to 104 to 108 mm Hg. Th ese changes increase the gradient between mother and fetus and improve maternal-fetal gas exchange.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  decrease  in  the  vertical  size  of  the  chest  secondary to elevation of the diaphragm leads to a 25% decrease in the expiratory reserve volume and a 15% decrease in the residual volume, which results in a 20% decrease in functional residual capacity.  A  20%  increase  in  oxygen  consumption  caused  by an elevated basal metabolic rate, combined with the decrease in functional residual capacity, produces more rapid desaturation during periods of apnea. In a fully preoxygenated healthy nonpregnant  patient  desaturation  from  100%  to  lower  than 90% occurs in approximately 9 minutes; in a healthy patient at term, desaturation occurs in only 3 to 4 minutes; and in a morbidly  obese  pregnant  patient,  desaturation  occurs  in  98 seconds.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Edema and hyperemia of the oropharyngeal mucosa, glandular hyperactivity, and capillary engorgement secondary to elevated activity of estrogen, progesterone, and relaxin result in nasal sti ff ness, epistaxis, and upper airway narrowing. Th e rates  of  di ffi cult  and  failed  intubation  in  pregnant  women are increased-3.3% and 0.4%, respectively-which are more than eight times higher than in nonpregnant patients. When  providing  general  anesthesia,  the  anesthesiologist  is thus faced with a potentially di ffi cult airway in a patient who will undergo desaturation more rapidly than a nonpregnant patient. Th is is one of the factors contributing to a 17-times higher mortality rate among parturient women who undergo general anesthesia than among those who undergo regional anesthesia. Prophylactic placement of an epidural catheter in patients assessed to have a di ffi cult airway may help to avoid airway manipulation and minimize maternal morbidity and mortality. Even when this approach was used, however, the rate  of  failed  intubation  was  1  in  98  obstetric  general  anesthesia  cases  over  a  5-year  period  at  Brigham  and  Women's Hospital.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal pregnancy is associated with substantial changes in hemostasis resulting in a relatively hypercoagulable state. Th e activity  of  the  majority  of  coagulation  factors  (I,  VII,  VIII, IX,  X,  XII)  is  increased,  whereas  the  activity  of  physiologic anticoagulants  is  decreased. Th e  latter  includes  a  signi fi cant reduction in protein S activity and acquired activated protein C resistance. Deep vein thrombosis occurs in 1 per 1000 deliveries, which is 5.5 to 6 times higher than the rate in the general female population of childbearing age. Procoagulant changes during normal pregnancy are counterbalanced by a signi fi cant activation of the fi brinolytic system and deactivation of natural anti fi brinolytics via a decrease in the activity of factors XI and XIII. A relative de fi ciency of factors XI and XIII causes decreased polymerization of fi brin monomers into fi brin and diminishes the cross-links of α 2 -antiplasmin to fi brin, which makes fi brin much less resistant to degradation. Th e relatively low  levels  of  factors  XI  and  XIII  decrease  the  activation  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
thrombin-activatable fi brinolysis  inhibitor,  which  results  in a  decrease  in  anti fi brinolytic  potential.  Increased  activity  of the coagulation system and fi brinolytic system, and decreased activity  of  the  anticoagulation  and  anti fi brinolytic  systems predispose pregnant patients to the development of consumption  coagulopathy  (increased fi brin  generation  following  its degradation). Levels of D-dimers and fi brin degradation products increase during normal pregnancy with rapid depletion of fi brinogen and factor XIII.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrointestinal System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lower esophageal sphincter tone is decreased in pregnancy as a result of two factors: the displacement of the stomach upward and muscle relaxation caused by the e ff ects of progestins. Heartburn is a frequent occurrence among pregnant women. Gastric emptying is not altered in pregnancy, although it is slowed during labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bile secretion is increased during pregnancy. Stasis resulting from the e ff ect of progesterone together with changes in the composition of bile acids results in increased gallstone formation. Cholecystectomy is the second most frequent surgery during pregnancy with a reported incidence as high as 1 in 1600 pregnancies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrine System

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnancy  is  characterized  by  insulin  resistance,  caused  by increased activity of hormones such as progesterone, estrogen, cortisol  (2.5-fold  increase  at  term),  and  placental  lactogen. Th is  insulin  resistance  resolves  rapidly  a ft er  delivery.  Fasting glucose levels are lower in pregnant than in nonpregnant patients because of high glucose utilization by the fetus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Estrogen increases the level of thyroxin-binding globulin, which results in an elevation of total triiodothyronine (T 3 ) and thyroxine (T 4 ) levels, but levels of free T 3 and T 4 remain stable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased levels  of  progesterone  and  endorphins  elevate  the pain threshold. Studies using bispectral index monitoring do not  support  the  previous  belief  that  pregnant  patients  show increased sensitivity to the e ff ect of inhalational anesthetics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrospinal fl uid volume is decreased during pregnancy, but intracranial pressure remains stable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal blood fl ow is increased in pregnancy. Glomerular fi ltration rate increases by 50% at 12 weeks of gestation, which results in a decrease in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations. Usual blood urea nitrogen and creatinine values at term are abnormal and indicate renal dysfunction (Table 26-1).

ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS

Nonobstetric Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between  1%  and  2%  of  all  pregnant  women  in  the  United States  will  undergo  surgery  unrelated  to  their  pregnancy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(>80,000 procedures requiring anesthesia per year). Th e most frequent nonobstetric procedures are excision of ovarian cysts, appendectomy, breast biopsy, and surgery required because of trauma. Until recently, the use of laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy was controversial because of concerns that the required pneumoperitoneum  would  decrease  maternal  lung  compliance,  leading  to  hypercarbia  and  fetal  acidosis.  Analysis  of data from case registries has provided reassurance that laparoscopic procedures can be safely carried out during pregnancy. Treatment of an incompetent cervix (cervical cerclage) typically occurs early in pregnancy. Cardiac surgery in pregnancy is  associated  with  a  maternal  mortality  of  3%  to  15%  and  a fetal mortality of 20% to 35%. Pulsatile fl ow during bypass is preferred, and fetal survival is better if maternal temperature remains above 29.3° C. Fetal surgery, fi rst performed in 1981, is now being carried out in many hospitals. Ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) procedures are performed at cesarean delivery. Fetal manipulations and minor surgeries on the fetus are being conducted earlier in pregnancy and require uterine relaxation and, at times, fetal immobility.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e objective of anesthetic management in patients undergoing  nonobstetric  operative  procedures  is  maternal  safety, safe care of the fetus, and prevention of premature labor related to the surgical procedure or to drugs administered during or as part of the anesthesia care. To achieve these goals, the e ff ects of  the  patient's  altered  physiology  must  be  recognized  and incorporated into the anesthetic plan. Induction of and emergence from anesthesia are more rapid than in the nonpregnant state  because  of  increased  minute  ventilation  and  decreased functional  residual  capacity.  Supine  hypotensive  syndrome can occur as early as the second trimester.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to remember that the e ff ects of pregnancyrelated  physiologic  changes  are  not  limited  to  general  anesthesia.  Local  anesthetics  have  an  increased  e ff ect  during pregnancy; thus, the amount of local anesthetic administered for regional anesthesia should be reduced by 25% to 30% during any stage of pregnancy. Local anesthetic toxicity, especially cardiovascular toxicity, is also seen at lower plasma concentrations of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Teratogenicity may occur at any stage of gestation. However,  most  of  the  critical  organogenesis  occurs  in  the fi rst trimester.  Although  many  commonly  used  anesthetics  are teratogenic  at  high  dosages  in  animals,  few,  if  any,  studies support  teratogenic  e ff ects  of  anesthetic  or  sedative  medications  at  the  dosages  used  for  anesthesia  care  in  humans. Th ere is some evidence of a link between maternal high-dose diazepam  injection  in  the fi rst  trimester  and  cle ft palate. Medicinal dosages of benzodiazepines are safe when used to treat  perioperative  anxiety.  In  fact,  teratogenicity  has  been shown  only  with  high-dose  diazepam  and  not  with  other benzodiazepines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
synthesis.  Although  teratogenesis  has  been  seen  in  animals only under extreme conditions that are not likely to be reproduced  in  clinical  care,  some  believe  that  nitrous  oxide  use is  contraindicated  in  the fi rst  two  trimesters  of  pregnancy. Recent studies suggest that volatile anesthetics stimulate neuronal apoptosis in rats, but it is not obvious whether these data can be extrapolated to humans. Widespread neuronal apoptosis is associated with memory and learning de fi cits in laboratory animals, but again this has not been examined in humans.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intrauterine fetal asphyxia can be avoided by maintaining maternal Pa o 2 and Pa co 2 , and uterine blood fl ow. Pa co 2 can a ff ect uterine blood fl ow, because maternal alkalosis may cause direct  vasoconstriction.  Alkalosis  shi ft s  the  oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, which results in the release of less oxygen to the fetus at the placenta. Maternal hypotension leads to a reduction in uterine blood fl ow and thus fetal hypoxia. Uterine hypertension, as occurs with increased uterine irritability, also decreases uterine blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia and surgery may result in preterm labor during the intraoperative and postoperative periods. Abdominal and pelvic procedures are associated with the greatest incidence of preterm labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Generally,  elective  surgery  should  be  delayed  until  the patient is no longer pregnant and has returned to her nonpregnant physiologic state (approximately 2 to 6 weeks post partum). Procedures that can be scheduled with some fl exibility but that cannot be delayed until a ft er delivery are best performed in the middle trimester. Th is lessens the risk of teratogenicity (greater with fi rst-trimester  medication  administration)  and  preterm labor (greater risk in the third trimester) (Figure 26-1).

anesthesia  should  be  considered  because  it  minimizes  fetal exposure to medications. If general anesthesia is needed, then, as  emphasized  previously,  normal  oxygenation  and  blood pressure  must  be  maintained  and  hyperventilation  avoided. Le ft uterine displacement should be used during the second and third trimesters and aspiration prophylaxis implemented in all pregnant patients. For monitoring, at a minimum preoperative and postoperative fetal heart rate and uterine activity must be assessed. Th e statement of the American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice titled "Nonobstetric Surgery During Pregnancy" recommends that an obstetric consult be obtained before surgery and that use of fetal monitoring be individualized.

REGIONAL ANALGESIC TECHNIQUES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of regional techniques in parturient patients requires an understanding of the neural pathways responsible for the transmission of pain during labor and delivery. Th e pain of labor arises primarily from receptors in uterine and  perineal  structures.  A ff erent  pain  impulses  from  the cervix and uterus travel in nerves that accompany sympathetic  nervous  system fi bers  and  enter  the  spinal  cord  at T10 to L1. Pain pathways from the perineum travel to S2 to S4 via the pudendal nerves. Pain during the fi rst stage of labor  (onset  of  regular  contractions)  results  from  dilation of the cervix, contraction of the uterus, and traction on the round ligament. Th e pain is visceral and is referred to dermatomes supplied by spinal cord segments T10 to L1. During the second stage of labor (complete dilation of the cervix to delivery of the fetus), pain is somatic and is produced by distention  of  the  perineum  and  stretching  of  fascia,  skin, and subcutaneous tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LUMBAR EPIDURAL ANALGESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When an epidural catheter is placed for the provision of analgesia  during  labor  and  delivery  or  anesthesia  for  cesarean delivery, it is important to con fi rm that the catheter is not in an intravascular or subarachnoid position. For this purpose, it is common to administer a test dose of a solution containing the local anesthetic and epinephrine (15 mcg). An epinephrine-induced  increase  in  the  maternal  heart  rate  alerts  the anesthesiologist to the possibility of an intravascular catheter placement. A rapid onset of analgesia suggests subarachnoid placement. Hypotension may require administration of small doses of ephedrine (5 to 10 mg IV) or phenylephrine (20 to 100 mcg IV). Use of neuraxial analgesia, speci fi cally combined spinal-epidural analgesia, in early labor does not increase the incidence  of  cesarean  delivery  and  may  shorten  labor  compared  with  systemic  analgesia.  See  Table  26-2  for  analgesic choices.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMBINED SPINAL-EPIDURAL ANALGESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combined spinal-epidural analgesia has been advocated as an alternative to epidural analgesia during labor. Advantages

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cited for the combined technique include more rapid onset of analgesia, increased reliability, e ff ectiveness when instituted in  a  rapidly  progressing  labor,  and  minimal  motor  block. Subarachnoid administration of low doses of opioids such as fentanyl (12.5 to 25 mcg) or sufentanil (5 to 10 mcg) results in rapid (5 minutes), nearly complete pain relief during the fi rst stage of labor. Low doses of local anesthetics such as 2.5 mg of bupivacaine may also be added to the opioid solution. Disadvantages  of  the  combined  technique  include  the  risk of fetal bradycardia, which is usually benign and very short lasting.  Increased  risk  of  postdural  puncture  headache  has not been cited as a concern in the literature. Th is technique should  be  considered  especially  when  neuraxial  analgesia is  requested  in  very  early  labor  or  in  a  rapidly  progressing multiparous labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHESIA FOR CESAREAN DELIVERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A large  and  growing  minority  (>30%)  of  parturient  women deliver  by  cesarean  section.  If  epidural  analgesia  is  used  for labor,  this  technique  can  then  be  converted  to  provide  surgical  anesthesia by changing the quantity and concentration of  drug  administered.  Most  elective  cesarean  deliveries  and many urgent cesarean deliveries are performed under spinal anesthesia. Hyperbaric bupivacaine solutions provide reliable anesthesia, o ft en with the addition of morphine or meperidine for  postoperative  analgesia.  General  anesthesia  is  reserved for the most emergent cases and for cases in which the condition of the mother contraindicates regional anesthesia. For unscheduled cesarean deliveries, the consensus of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists is that hospitals should have the capability to begin a cesarean delivery within 30 minutes of the decision to operate. However, not all indications for cesarean delivery require a 30-minute response time. Ironically, a time interval of longer than 18 minutes, not 30 minutes, from the onset of severe fetal heart rate decelerations to delivery is associated with poor neonatal outcome. Th e anesthesiologist

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
563

<!-- PAGE=? -->
must consider the indication for unscheduled cesarean delivery (e.g., arrest of labor, nonreassuring fetal heart rate, maternal  illness)  as  well  as  the  maternal  risks  and  bene fi ts  when choosing  the  anesthetic.  Maternal  safety  and  well-being  are paramount in selecting an anesthetic for nonscheduled cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ideally, all patients should be assessed by the anesthesiology team on admission for labor and delivery. At a minimum, the anesthesiology sta ff should  be  informed  in  advance  and  the patient evaluated when a complicated delivery is anticipated, when patient characteristics indicate increased anesthetic risk (Table 26-3), and at the fi rst indication of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern. Obviously, preanesthetic assessment must include evaluation for co-existing diseases as well as a thorough airway examination. Pulmonary aspiration and failed intubation account for three fourths of all maternal deaths related to anesthesia care. Th e incidence of aspiration of gastric contents is 1 in 661 patients undergoing cesarean delivery under general anesthesia compared with 1 in 2131 in the general surgical population.  Between  15%  and  20%  of  patients  who  experience aspiration pneumonitis require mechanical ventilation or prolonged hospitalization. To decrease the risk of signi fi cant aspiration pneumonitis, the patient should receive appropriate premedication with histamine 2 (H 2 ) blockers, a nonparticulate antacid, and/or metoclopramide, famotidine, or both. General  anesthesia  should  be  avoided  whenever  possible; cricoid pressure and an endotracheal tube should be used if general anesthesia is required. During labor, oral intake should be restricted to clear fl uids, because one cannot predict which patients in labor will progress to cesarean delivery. Th e incidence of failed intubation in the obstetric population is 1 in 250, which is 10 times that in the general surgical population. Urgent cesarean delivery for a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern does not necessarily preclude the use of regional anesthesia. Rapid induction of spinal anesthesia is appropriate in many situations in which there is fetal compromise. Parturient patients at high risk of airway complications should undergo early induction of labor analgesia in hopes of precluding the need for general anesthesia should emergent cesarean delivery become necessary, because labor analgesia can rapidly be converted to surgical anesthesia for cesarean section.

HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS OF PREGNANCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertensive  disorders  of  pregnancy  encompass  a  range of disorders that include chronic hypertension, chronic hypertension  with  superimposed  preeclampsia,  gestational hypertension,  preeclampsia,  and  eclampsia. Th ese  disorders complicate  8%  to  12%  of  all  pregnancies.  Hypertensive  disorders  are  second  only  to  thromboembolic  disorders  as  the leading  cause  of  maternal  mortality  in  developed  countries. Hypertensive disorders result in 70 maternal deaths a year in the United States and 50,000 maternal deaths a year worldwide. Th e  only  curative  treatment  for  hypertensive  disorders  that develop during pregnancy is delivery. Deteriorating maternal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
condition mandates urgent delivery of the fetus regardless of gestational age. Th e risk of developing essential hypertension later in life is thought to be increased in women who experience gestational hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gestational Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gestational  hypertension  or  pregnancy-induced  hypertension is de fi ned as an elevation of blood pressure above 139/89 mm Hg in a previously healthy woman a ft er the fi rst 19 weeks of  pregnancy  if  the  elevated  blood  pressures  were  recorded at least twice with the readings taken a minimum of 6 hours apart and no proteinuria is present. Gestational hypertension may develop into preeclampsia if proteinuria develops or may be rede fi ned as chronic hypertension if hypertension persists longer than 12 weeks a ft er delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnancy-induced  hypertension  may  be  classi fi ed as severe when blood pressure remains elevated above 159/109 mm Hg for longer than 6 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preeclampsia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preeclampsia is a complex multisystem disorder of unknown etiology  that  is  characterized  by  combined  development  of new-onset hypertension (see earlier) and new-onset proteinuria (>300 mg/24 hours) a ft er the fi rst 20 weeks of pregnancy. Edema is no longer a diagnostic criterion  for  preeclampsia; preeclampsia  is  a  clinical  diagnosis.  Tables  26-4  and  26-5 list  the  diagnostic  criteria  and  clinical  manifestations  of preeclampsia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk  factors  for  preeclampsia  include  obesity,  nulliparity, and advanced maternal age (Table 26-6). Of interest, smoking during pregnancy is protective against preeclampsia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preeclampsia is speci fi c to human pregnancy. It is a disease of the placenta and occurs in molar pregnancies (pregnancy without  the  presence  of  fetal  tissue). Th e  hallmark  of  preeclampsia  is  an  abnormal  placentation-implantation.  Normally,  cytotrophoblasts  invade  the  uterine  wall,  reaching decidual arteries and interacting with the endothelium. As a result of that interaction cytotrophoblasts acquire an endothelial  phenotype  and  decidual  arteries  become  low-  resistance vessels. In preeclampsia, shallow endovascular invasion

preclude this cytotrophoblast-endothelium interaction. Spiral arteries remain constricted, high-resistance blood vessels that fail to provide adequate oxygen and nutrients for the growing placenta and fetus. Th e abnormal placenta releases vasoactive substances, which cause severe endothelial dysfunction of the maternal vasculature. Th is injured or hyperactivated endothelium further compromises placental blood fl ow. Th e plasma concentrations  of  vasoconstrictive  substances,  markers  of oxidative  stress,  and  in fl ammatory cytokines  are  increased, and  the  concentrations  of  vasodilators  such  as  nitric  oxide and  prostacyclin  are  decreased.  Severe  proangiogenic  and antiangiogenic imbalance has been described in patients with preeclampsia. It is unclear whether this imbalance is a cause or a consequence of abnormal implantation. Antiangiogenic proteins cause endothelial damage, especially in blood vessels with fenestrated endothelium as is found in kidney, liver, and brain.

Th e  sensitivity  of  vascular  receptors  to  angiotensin  II  is signi fi cantly  decreased  during  normal  pregnancy.  In  preeclampsia, the sensitivity increases, which contributes to vasoconstriction and placental insu ffi ciency.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e de fi nitive treatment for preeclampsia is delivery. At term, a patient diagnosed with preeclampsia should be delivered. If the preeclampsia is mild and the patient remote from term, conservative management with bed rest and monitoring until 37 weeks of gestation or until the status of the mother or fetus deteriorates is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In women with severe preeclampsia (Table 26-7) the fetus should be delivered immediately regardless of gestational age. Expectant management of patients with severe preeclampsia is possible in the following circumstances:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e pregnancy is early preterm (24 to 28 weeks' duration).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e diagnosis is based only on a high level of proteinuria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  diagnosis is  based on intrauterine growth retardation before 32 weeks of gestation and results of fetal testing are good.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e diagnosis is based only on a blood pressure of higher than 159/109 mm Hg, before 32 weeks of gestation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mode of delivery depends on fetal gestational age, the fi ndings  on  cervical  examination,  assessment  of  fetal  wellbeing,  and  the  fetal  presenting  part.  Only  14%  to  20%  of women with severe preeclampsia are delivered vaginally.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium sulfate is administered for seizure prophylaxis. It is the anticonvulsant of choice because it is 50% more e ff ective in the prevention of new and recurrent seizures than diazepam or phenytoin. Th e precise mechanism of action is not known. Possible explanations for its anticonvulsant e ff ect include competitive blockade of N -methyl-d-aspartate receptors, prevention of calcium ion entry into ischemic cells, protection of endothelial cells from free radical injury, and selective dilation of the cerebral blood vessels. Other bene fi cial e ff ects include a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac index.

Th ere is no need to treat hypertension in women with mild preeclampsia. Indications for antihypertensive treatment during  pregnancy  are  chronic  hypertension,  severe  hypertension during labor and delivery, and expectant management of severe preeclampsia. Th ere are only two bene fi ts from such a treatment:  prevention  of  abruptio  placentae  and  prevention of cerebrovascular accident (which accounts for 15% to 20% of maternal deaths). Th e goal of therapy is to maintain blood pressure below 160/110 mm Hg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydralazine, labetalol, and nifedipine are all e ff ective antihypertensives in these patients. Refractory hypertension may necessitate continuous infusion of an antihypertensive. Nitroglycerin, sodium nitroprusside, and fenoldopam all are useful as short-term therapy (Table 26-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive  hemodynamic  monitoring  may  be  useful,  especially during cesarean delivery. Catheterization of the internal jugular vein during the peripartum period is associated with a  higher  overall  risk  of  complications,  especially  infectious complications, in parturient patients compared with nonpregnant medical or surgical patients (25% vs. 15% to 20%, respectively). Th e internal jugular vein overlies the carotid artery to a greater extent in pregnant than in nonpregnant patients, so the standard landmark approach is associated with a higher risk of carotid puncture (19% in pregnant patients vs. 10% in nonpregnant patients with the landmark approach and 6% vs. 3%, respectively, with the palpatory technique).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid management in the patient with preeclampsia is complicated  by  the  con fl ict  between  the  need  to  give fl uids  to an intravascularly depleted patient (the degree of depletion may be re fl ected by a rising hematocrit) and the obligation to  avoid  administration  of fl uids  to  a  patient  with  "leaky" vasculature. As mentioned earlier, endothelial damage and low  oncotic  pressure  make  preeclamptic  patients  prone  to third  spacing  of fl uids  and  thus  may  lead  to  pulmonary edema.  Invasive  hemodynamic  monitoring  may  help  to guide fl uid therapy in patients with preeclampsia. It should be remembered, however, that catheterization of the internal jugular vein during the peripartum period carries a higher risk of complications than in nonpregnant medical or surgical patients.

Labor Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to providing the common bene fi ts of epidural labor  analgesia,  use  of  neuraxial  techniques  in  preeclamptic patients  can  facilitate  blood  pressure  control  during  labor. Epidural analgesia will also increase intervillous blood fl ow in preeclampsia, which will improve uteroplacental performance and, as a result, fetal well-being.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because these patients are at high risk of requiring cesarean delivery, early placement of an epidural catheter can be considered to facilitate the use of epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery and thus avoid the risks of general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal Anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is an anesthetic choice for  patients  with  preeclampsia,  unless  it  is  contraindicated because of hypocoagulation. Neuraxial blockade causes sympathectomy and may lead to hypotension in healthy patients. In  preeclamptic  patients  hypertension  and  vasoconstriction are the result of hyperactivity of the angiotensin II receptors. Spinal  anesthesia  does  not  in fl uence the angiotensin system and thus may result in a lesser degree of hypotension in preeclamptic patients than in healthy parturient patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General Anesthesia. Not only are patients with preeclampsia subject to the common risks of general anesthesia during pregnancy, but these patients also have a higher risk of di ffi cult intubation resulting  from  severe  upper  airway  edema  and  a higher risk of aspiration because of the increased likelihood of di ffi culty in airway management. Th ey also have an exaggerated  response  to  sympathomimetics  and  methylergonovine. Th ey have a greater sensitivity to the action of nondepolarizing

HELLP Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolysis, elevated liver transaminase levels, and low platelet counts  are  the  characteristic  features  of  HELLP  syndrome,  a severe form of preeclampsia. Some 26% of patients with preeclampsia demonstrate one sign, 12% have two signs, and 10% show all three signs of the syndrome. Approximately 30% of cases present post partum. Th e most frequent clinical symptoms are right upper quadrant pain (80% of patients) and edema (50% to 60% of patients). Hemolysis is diagnosed by abnormalities on peripheral blood smear (presence of schistocytes), elevated bilirubin concentration (>1.2 mg/dL), decreased haptoglobin level (<25 mg/dL), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (>600 units/L). Plasma concentrations of transaminases are more than twice the normal levels. Th e platelet count is o ft en lower than 100,000/mm 3 . Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality is increased. Formation of a subcapsular hematoma of the liver may complicate HELLP syndrome, and hepatic rupture with a very high incidence of mortality can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e de fi nitive treatment of HELLP syndrome is the delivery of the fetus. Th e American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  recommends  that  women  with  HELLP  syndrome be delivered regardless of fetal gestational age. Patients must receive seizure prophylaxis with magnesium sulfate and correction  of  coagulopathy.  Dexamethasone  increases  platelets count to a greater degree than does betamethasone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulopathy, risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),  and  risk  of  severe  intraabdominal  bleeding  resulting from the rupture of a subcapsular hematoma of the liver are speci fi c concerns in patients with HELLP. Th ese are in addition to the general problems of anesthetic management in parturient patients with severe preeclampsia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eclampsia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eclampsia is seizures or coma in the setting of preeclampsia in the absence of any other pathologic brain condition. It is by de fi nition considered severe preeclampsia and has an incidence of 1 in 2000 pregnancies. Th e majority of patients are diagnosed with preeclampsia before development of seizures; however, eclampsia is the fi rst manifestation of preeclampsia in 20% to 38% of cases. Th e magnitude of hypertension does not correlate with the risk of eclampsia. Of patients with preeclampsia  who  develop  seizures,  approximately  half  report prodromal  symptoms  such  as  headache  or  visual  changes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Between  38%  and  50%  of  eclamptic  seizures  occur  before term. Sixteen percent of seizures occur longer than 48 hours a ft er  delivery.  Seventyfi ve  percent  of  seizures  occurring  at term take place during labor or within 48 hours of delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typical eclamptic seizures last less than 10 minutes and are neither recurrent nor associated with focal neurologic signs. Mortality related to eclampsia is about 2%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
About one third of eclamptic patients develop respiratory failure (with 23% of cases requiring mechanical ventilation), kidney failure, coagulopathy, cerebrovascular accident, or cardiac arrest. Fetal perinatal mortality is approximately 7% and is primarily related to issues associated with prematurity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eclampsia is not an indication for cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of the patient with eclampsia is  directed  at prevention of aspiration, maintenance of airway patency, control of seizures and prevention of their recurrence, control of hypertension, and evaluation for delivery. Eclamptic seizures are self-limiting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice because it is more e ff ective and has a better safety pro fi le than benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or lytic cocktails. Th e standard intravenous regimen is a loading of magnesium sulfate of 2 g every 15 minutes to a maximum of 6 g. If the patient develops seizures while receiving a magnesium infusion for seizure prophylaxis, administration of a 1- to 2-g bolus recommended, a ft er which plasma magnesium level should be measured.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the patient and fetus are in stable condition following an eclamptic seizure, the management of the patient will proceed as  it  would  for  a  patient  with  preeclampsia,  and  immediate delivery is not indicated unless that had been the plan before the seizure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTETRIC CONDITIONS AND COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conditions  that  complicate  delivery  include  hemorrhagic complications, amniotic fl uid embolism, uterine rupture, trial of  labor  a ft er  cesarean  delivery,  vaginal  birth  a ft er  cesarean delivery, abnormal presentations, and multiple births.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstetric Hemorrhage

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstetric  hemorrhage  remains  a  serious  complication,  contributing  to  maternal  and  prenatal  morbidity  and  mortality. Although bleeding can occur at any time during pregnancy, third-trimester hemorrhage is the most threatening to maternal  and  fetal  well-being  (Table  26-9).  Obstetric  hemorrhage is  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  all  pregnancy-related  deaths and  accounts  for  a  signi fi cant  portion  of  perinatal  morbidity and mortality. Placenta previa and abruptio placentae are the major causes of bleeding during the third trimester. Uterine rupture can be responsible for uncontrolled hemorrhage that  manifests  during  active  labor.  Postpartum  hemorrhage occurs a ft er 3% to 5% of all vaginal deliveries. Uterine atony

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and placenta accreta are two leading cause of peripartum hemorrhage. Placenta accreta is the most common indication for cesarean hysterectomy. Retained products of conception and cervical  or  vaginal  lacerations  may  also  lead  to  postpartum hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the increased blood volume and relative good health of the average pregnant patient, parturient women tolerate mild to moderate hemorrhage with few clinical signs or symptoms. Th is can lead to an underestimation of blood loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PLACENTA PREVIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cardinal symptom of placenta previa is painless vaginal bleeding. Th e fi rst episode usually stops spontaneously. Bleeding typically manifests at approximately week 32 of gestation, when the lower uterine segment begins to form. When this diagnosis is suspected, the position of the placenta needs to be con fi rmed via ultrasonography or radioisotope scan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Placenta previa occurs in up to 1% of full-term pregnancies. Th e cause of placenta previa is not known, although there may be an association with advanced maternal age and with high parity. Th e greatest risk factor is previous cesarean section. Placenta previa is classi fi ed as complete when the entire cervical  os  is  covered  by  placental  tissue, partial when  the internal cervical os is covered by placental tissue when closed but not when fully dilated, and marginal when placental tissue encroaches on or extends to the margin of the internal cervical  os.  Approximately 50% of parturient women with placenta previa have marginal implantations. Th e availability of more sophisticated obstetric ultrasonography has eliminated the need for a double setup cervical examination to diagnose placenta previa. Magnetic resonance imaging and color fl ow mapping during an ultrasonographic examination may identify, or at least raise suspicion for, placenta accreta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once the diagnosis is made, the obstetrician will determine timing and mode of delivery. Expectant management will be chosen if the bleeding stops and the fetus is immature. When fetal lung maturity is achieved, or at 37 weeks, delivery should proceed. Obviously, delivery will occur at any time that the mother exhibits cardiovascular instability. Except for patients with  a  marginal  previa  who  might  elect  vaginal  delivery, patients will be delivered by cesarean section.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal  mortality  is  rare.  Infant  perinatal  mortality  is 12 per 1000 births. Th e  risk  that  cesarean hysterectomy will be required increases with the number of previous cesarean deliveries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management depends on the obstetric plan and the condition of the parturient patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative. Mild  to  moderate  blood  loss  is  well  tolerated  by  the  patient  and  thus  may  be  underestimated  by  the anesthesiologist. Adequate volume resuscitation is thus paramount to the patient's care. Typing and cross-matching should be performed for all patients to ensure continuous availability of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and component products.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative. Parturient patients with complete or partial placenta  previa  will  be  delivered  by  cesarean  section.  Anesthetic management will depend on maternal and fetal status and  the  urgency  of  the  surgery.  If  the  patient  has  not  had recent  bleeding  and  is  scheduled  for  an  elective  procedure, regional anesthesia is preferred, as it is for all patients undergoing cesarean delivery. Large-bore intravenous access should be established, because the patient is at greater risk of intraoperative bleeding. Cross-matched blood should be   immediately

<!-- PAGE=? -->
568

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
available, and if the patient is in unstable condition, component products should also be available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  hemorrhage  necessitates  emergency  delivery,  general anesthesia is the anesthetic technique of choice. Ketamine and etomidate are the preferred induction agents in the hypovolemic patient. Drug selection for maintenance of anesthesia will be determined by the hemodynamic status of the mother.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PLACENTA ACCRETA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Placenta accreta refers to a placenta that is abnormally adherent to the myometrium. Placenta accreta is an adherent placenta that has not invaded the myometrium. In placenta increta, the placenta  has  invaded  the  myometrium.  Placenta  percreta  is invasion through the serosa. Massive hemorrhage may occur when removal of the placenta is attempted a ft er delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retained  placenta  and  postpartum  hemorrhage  occur  in patients with placenta accreta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority  of  patients  with  placenta  accreta  have  no symptoms; therefore, recognizing known risk factors is essential  to  early  diagnosis.  Risk  factors  include  placenta  previa and/or  previous  cesarean  delivery,  with  the  risk  increasing with placenta previa in patients with multiple cesarean deliveries.  Placenta  implantation  anteriorly  in  patients  with  previous  cesarean  deliveries  also  increases  the  risk.  Additional risk factors include a short interval from cesarean delivery to conception, advanced maternal age, and female gender of the fetus. Magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography with Doppler fl ow mapping have identi fi ed placenta accreta antenatally. However, because the predictive value of these tests is poor, this diagnosis is o ft en made at the time of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e management of placenta accreta requires close coordination among the anesthesiologist, obstetrician, interventional radiologist, gynecologic oncologist, blood bank, and specialized surgical teams. Th orough planning decreases blood loss, requirements for blood products, and perioperative morbidity and mortality. Elective cesarean delivery at 34 weeks to avoid emergent delivery is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cesarean hysterectomy used to be the traditional expectation. Now, with advances in endovascular procedures, uterinesparing management can be o ff ered to selected patients. In this approach, the placenta is le ft in place a ft er delivery of the fetus without further surgical intervention, and in fl ation of angioballoons or repeated selective uterine artery embolization is performed. Resorption of the poorly perfused placenta may be augmented by concurrent treatment with methotrexate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selective  uterine  artery  embolization  for  the  treatment of  postpartum  hemorrhage was initially  described  in  1979. Interventions include prophylactic selective catheterization of the internal iliac arteries with either temporary balloon occlusion or embolotherapy, selective embolization of collateral pelvic vessels in the setting of surgical ligation of the internal iliac arteries and/or delivery-related injuries to the genital tract, and transarterial embolization for the management of abnormal placentation. Prophylactic pelvic artery catheterization  and  embolization  in  women  with  placenta accreta can decrease perioperative blood loss and potentially allow hysterectomy to be avoided. Embolization of the uterine arteries as an alternative to hysterectomy has the advantage of being a minimally invasive treatment that preserves the uterus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  data  from  large  randomized  controlled trials, controversy still exists about the safety and e ffi cacy of endovascular interventions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal prognosis is good if the patient does not experience signi fi cant hemorrhage. As noted earlier, there has been some success with uterine preservation in selected cases; however, the majority of women still undergo cesarean hysterectomy. If an attempt is made to extract the placenta manually, profound hemorrhage may occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative. Signi fi cant  hemorrhage  should  be  anticipated, and thus at least two large-bore intravenous catheters should  be  placed.  Insertion  of  an  arterial  catheter  should be  considered.  PRBCs  and  component  products  should  be immediately available. As soon as it is known that a patient with  suspected  placenta  accreta  will  be  undergoing  surgical delivery,  the  anesthesiologist  should  communicate  directly with  the  blood  bank,  request  blood  products,  and  provide information about the possibility of massive transfusion. Th e amount and type of requested products depends on the predicted severity of bleeding (i.e., accreta vs. percreta), baseline patient condition (i.e., presence of severe anemia or thrombocytopenia), and expected limitations in supply (e.g., rare blood group or di ffi cult match because of the presence of antibodies). In routine placenta accreta cases it is recommended that 4 units of matched RBCs and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP)  be  available  in  the  operating  room  before  the  beginning of surgery. In complicated cases availability of 10 units of matched RBCs, 10 units of FFP, and 10 units of platelets is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  emergency  cases,  when  the  diagnosis  of  placenta accreta is made intraoperatively, the anesthesiologist should initiate  the  massive  transfusion  protocol.  At  Yale-New Haven Hospital, this protocol is as follows: the blood bank immediately releases 6 units of O-negative RBCs and 4 units of AB FFP. Within 20 minutes, the blood bank releases an additional 10 units of O-negative RBCs, 10 units of AB FFP, 10  units  of  platelets,  and  10  units  of  cryoprecipitate,  and provides  recombinant  factor  VIIa  if  requested.  If  further therapy is needed, the listed components are again be provided. It is strongly recommended that a massive transfusion protocol be established at any institution that provides obstetric care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative. Intraoperative management of a patient at risk of hemorrhage and/or cesarean hysterectomy is controversial. Many believe that all patients should undergo general anesthesia (as discussed for patients with a placenta previa). Others argue that, if needed, a cesarean hysterectomy can be performed under epidural anesthesia. Th ere is general agreement that if a patient is deemed potentially to have a di ffi cult airway, it is prudent to use general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of blood loss  is  the  major  issue  in  patients with  placenta  accreta. Th e  blood fl ow through each uterine artery  increases  from  100  mL/min  to  350  mL/min  during pregnancy. Arteries at the site of the placenta accreta are large in diameter. In the event that an attempt is made to remove the placenta, these arteries are torn, which leads to uncontrolled hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemorrhagic  shock  occurs  in  over  half  of  patients  who undergo  emergency  postpartum  hysterectomy,  and  coagulopathy or DIC occurs in approximately one quarter of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autologous  RBC  salvage  can  decrease  the  transfusion  of allogenic blood. Use of the intraoperative cell salvage machine ("cell saver") began in the 1970s in nonobstetric cases. Unfortunately, no prospective trials have con fi rmed the safety of its use in obstetric practice. Concerns include the risk of amniotic fl uid embolism and maternal alloimmunization. Th eoretically, the  washing  process  and  leukocyte-reducing fi lter  should eliminate this risk of contamination. Several studies showed that the level of contamination of the maternal circulatory system by amniotic fl uid is similar during caesarean delivery with and without the use of the cell saver. Th ese studies, however, did  not  involve  transfusion  of  salvaged  blood  back  into  the parturient patient. In the absence of solid evidence caution is recommended if cell salvage is used during cesarean delivery, and the risk of severe hypotension must be kept in mind.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
D amage C ontrol R esuscitation . In  2005  the  U.S. Army  Institute  of  Surgical  Research  o ff ered  a  new  strategy for  the  transfusion  of  severely  injured  military  patients:  the decreased  use  of  crystalloids  and  colloids  and  the  matching of  PRBC transfusion in a 1:1:1 ratio with FFP and platelets. Results of this new strategy, called damage control resuscitation, appear remarkable. With an increase in the FFP/PRBC ratio from 1:8 to 1:1.4,  mortality  dropped  from  65%  to  19%. Th e number needed to treat to save one life was only two patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extrapolation  of  data  from  military  and  civilian  trauma centers  to  massively  bleeding  parturient  women  should  be viewed  with  caution. Th e  pathophysiologic  mechanisms  of dilutional  and  consumption  coagulopathy,  and  the  harmful e ff ects of metabolic acidosis and hypothermia are present in both  populations.  However,  some  physiologic  mechanisms are  di ff erent  or  even  opposite,  such  as  early  activation  of the  thrombomodulin-protein  C  anticoagulation  system  in trauma patients in contrast with protein C resistance in parturient patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To avoid development of dilutional coagulopathy and further exacerbation of the discrepancy in activity of the coagulation factors, transfusion of colloids and crystalloids should be minimized during massive resuscitation of bleeding parturient patients. Also important to consider is that colloids may impair  platelet  function,  inhibit fi brin  polymerization,  and increase the fi brinolytic tendency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C ryoprecipitate and A ntifibrinolytics . A  recent review of clinical data in postpartum hemorrhage suggested that a higher than previously recommended level of fi brinogen is necessary for adequate hemostasis (2 to 3 g/L vs. 1 g/L). Factor XIII activity should be kept above 50% to 60% to reduce bleeding a ft er major surgery. As much as 30 mL/kg of FFP is required to increase fi brinogen level by 1 g/L, so even when transfusing at a high FFP/RBC ratio, early administration of cryoprecipitate  is  recommended.  Cryoprecipitate  is  rich  in fi brinogen, as well as in factors XIII and VIII. Only 3 mL/kg of cryoprecipitate is enough to raise the fi brinogen level by 1 g/L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
R atio of F resh F rozen P lasma to R ed B lood C ells . A higher ratio of FFP and platelets to RBCs is believed to signi fi cantly decrease the risk of coagulation abnormalities during massive peripartum resuscitation. Th is opinion is based on the  literature  discussed  earlier  on  damage  control  resuscitation and the fact that a mixture of 1 unit of PRBCs, 1 unit of FFP, and 1 unit of platelets has a hematocrit of 29%, a platelet count of 85,000/mm 3 , and coagulation factor activity of 62%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
F actor VII. A dose of 80 to 95 mcg/kg of factor VII may stop or reduced hemorrhage without an increase in the incidence  of  thromboembolic  events.  Failure  of  this  therapy  to correct coagulopathy may be due to hypothermia, acidosis, or low fi brinogen level.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring. PTT, PT, platelet count, and fi brinogen level should be measured at baseline and every hour a ft er the initiation of massive transfusion to guide therapy. PT is more sensitive than PTT for indicating a nonhemostatic level of at least one clotting factor. Unfortunately, none of these tests assesses platelet function, factor XIII level, clot stability, or level of fi brinolysis, all of which show abnormalities in obstetric patients. Use of point-of care devices such as a thromboelastograph or thromboelastometer may improve assessment of hemostasis and provide goal-directed hemostatic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plasma electrolyte levels should also be measured at baseline and every hour a ft er the initiation of massive transfusion, with speci fi c assessment for hyperkalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperchloremia.

ABRUPTIO PLACENTAE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of abruptio placentae depend on the site and extent of the placental separation, but abdominal pain is always present. When the separation involves only the placental margins, the escaping blood can appear as vaginal bleeding.  On  the  other  hand,  large  volumes  of  extravasated  blood can remain concealed within the uterus. Severe blood loss from abruptio placentae presents as maternal hypotension, uterine irritability and hypertonus, and fetal distress or demise. Clotting  abnormalities  can  occur. Th e  classic  hemorrhagic  picture includes thrombocytopenia, depletion of fi brinogen, and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
570

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
prolonged plasma thromboplastin times. DIC can occur and may be accompanied by acute renal failure resulting from fi brin deposition in renal arterioles. Fetal distress re fl ects the loss of functional  placenta  and  decreased  uteroplacental  perfusion because of maternal hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abruptio placentae is de fi ned as premature separation of a normally implanted placenta a ft er 20 weeks of gestation. Th e precise causes are unknown, but the incidence is increased with high parity, uterine anomalies, compression of the inferior vena cava, gestational hypertension, and cocaine abuse. Abruptio  placentae  accounts  for  approximately  one  third of  third-trimester  hemorrhages  and  occurs  in  0.5%  to  1% of all pregnancies. Diagnosis is made before delivery using ultrasonography  and  at  delivery  by  examination  of  the placenta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
De fi nitive treatment of abruptio placentae is delivery of the fetus and placenta. Delivery may be vaginal if the abruption is  not  jeopardizing  maternal  or  fetal  well-being.  Otherwise, delivery is by cesarean section.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal complications associated with abruptio placentae include DIC, acute renal failure, and uterine atony, which may lead to postpartum hemorrhage. DIC occurs in approximately 10% of patients with abruptio placentae.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonatal complications are signi fi cant. Perinatal mortality is 25-fold higher if a term pregnancy is complicated by abruption.  Fetal  distress  is  also  common  due  to  the  disruption  of placental blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  maternal hypotension is absent, clotting study results are acceptable, and there is no evidence of fetal distress due to uteroplacental insu ffi ciency; epidural analgesia is useful to  provide  analgesia  for  labor  and  vaginal  delivery.  When the magnitude of placental separation and resulting hemorrhage are severe, emergency cesarean delivery is necessary; most  o ft en,  general  anesthesia  is  used,  because  regional anesthesia may be unwise in a patient with hemodynamic instability.  Anesthetic  management  is  similar  to  that  in patients  with  placenta  previa.  Blood  and  blood  products should be readily available because of the risk of bleeding and DIC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is not uncommon for blood to dissect between layers of the myometrium a ft er premature separation of the placenta. As a result, the uterus is unable to contract adequately a ft er delivery,  and  postpartum  hemorrhage  occurs.  Uncontrolled hemorrhage may require an emergency hysterectomy. Bleeding may be exaggerated by coagulopathy, in which case infusion of FFP and platelets may be indicated to replace de fi cient clotting factors. Clotting parameters usually revert to normal within a few hours a ft er delivery of the fetus.

POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine Atony

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine  atony  a ft er  vaginal  delivery  is  a  common  cause of  postpartum  bleeding  and  a  potential  cause  of  maternal mortality. Complete atony of the uterus may result in a 2000-mL blood loss in 5 minutes. Conditions associated with uterine atony include multiple parity, multiple births, polyhydramnios, a large fetus, and a retained placenta. Uterine atony may occur immediately a ft er delivery or may manifest itself several hours later. Treatment is with intravenous oxytocin, which results in contraction of the uterus. Methylergonovine, administered intravenously or intramuscularly, or intramuscular or intrauterine carboprost tromethamine (or misoprostol)  may  also  be  used  to  control  hemorrhage.  In rare instances, it may be necessary to perform an emergency hysterectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retained Placenta

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retained placenta occurs in approximately 1% of all vaginal deliveries and usually necessitates a manual exploration of the uterus. If epidural analgesia has been used for vaginal delivery, manual removal of  the  retained  placenta  may  be  attempted under epidural anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia (saddle block) or low-dose intravenous ketamine may provide adequate analgesia  if  an  epidural  catheter  is  not  in  place.  In  rare  cases,  a general anesthetic may be needed. Low doses of intravenous nitroglycerin (40-mcg boluses, as needed) are used to relax the uterus for placental removal when indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine Rupture

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine rupture occurs in up to 0.1% of full-term pregnancies and may be associated with separation of previous uterine surgical scars, rapid spontaneous delivery, excessive oxytocin stimulation, or multiple parity with cephalopelvic disproportion or unrecognized transverse presentation. Uterine rupture and dehiscence represent a spectrum ranging from incomplete rupture  or  gradual  dehiscence  of  surgical  scars  to  explosive rupture with intraperitoneal extrusion of uterine contents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine  rupture  may  present  with  severe  abdominal  pain, o ft en  referred  to  the  shoulder  because  of  subdiaphragmatic irritation by intraabdominal blood, as well as maternal hypotension and disappearance of fetal heart tones.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  ultrasonographic  examination  is  useful  in  making  the diagnosis of uterine rupture. Visual examination of the uterus at cesarean delivery will detect rupture or dehiscence. Manual examination with vaginal delivery will also detect dehiscence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uterine  rupture  with  maternal  and/or  fetal  distress  mandates immediate laparotomy, delivery, and surgical repair or hysterectomy.

Trial of Labor after Cesarean Delivery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Women with a  history  of  one  or  two  low  transverse  cesarean deliveries may attempt a vaginal birth (trial of labor a ft er cesarean delivery, or TOLAC), with the goal of achieving vaginal birth a ft er  cesarean delivery (VBAC). TOLAC decreases the rate of cesarean deliveries, reduces maternal morbidity and mortality (from 13 per 100,000 to 4 per 100,000 live births), and  diminishes  risk  of  complications  in  future  pregnancies. Seventy-four percent of appropriately chosen candidates for TOLAC will successfully accomplish vaginal delivery. Unfortunately, many medical and nonmedical factors may increase the risk of failure of TOLAC and lead to increased maternal and perinatal morbidity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factors  associated  with  a  lower  rate  of  successful  VBAC include  African  American  or  Hispanic  ethnicity,  advanced maternal  age,  single  motherhood,  fewer  than  12  years  of maternal  education,  delivery  at  low-volume  hospitals,  and maternal comorbid conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, asthma, seizure disorders, renal disease, heart disease, and obesity. Also, induction of labor, fetal gestational age of more than 40 weeks, fetal weight of more than 4000 g, and poor cervical dilation may be predictive of failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  feared  obstetric  emergency  related  to  TOLAC is  uterine  rupture.  (See  earlier  section.)  Factors  that  may increase the risk of uterine rupture among parturient women with a history of previous cesarean delivery include a classical uterine scar; induction of labor, especially a ft er 40 weeks; two or more cesarean deliveries; maternal obesity; fetal weight of more than 4000 g; and delivery at a low-volume facility. In a retrospective analysis of 1787 cases of TOLAC, Bujold found only two risk factors for uterine rupture: interdelivery interval of less than 18 month (which increased the risk threefold) and use of a single-layer closure during prior cesarean section. Careful selection of candidates for TOLAC with consideration of all risk factors is necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists practice bulletin for VBAC recommends that the potential  complications  of  VBAC  be  thoroughly  discussed  with the patient and that they be documented before the patient is o ff ered  the  option  for  VBAC.  Both  the  American  College  of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society of Anesthesiologists  recommend  that  personnel  including  the obstetrician,  anesthetist,  and  operating  sta ff be  immediately available at all times to perform an emergency cesarean delivery when VBAC is being attempted. Despite the concern for uterine rupture in this patient population, the risk of uterine rupture in patients undergoing VBAC following one cesarean delivery is approximately 2%. Women who undergo VBAC rather than elective repeat cesarean delivery have reduced morbidity associated with their delivery. However, there may be a higher incidence of perinatal death in patients undergoing VBAC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial  labor  analgesia  provides  all  the  same  bene fi ts  for parturient women attempting TOLAC as for women without a history of cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e suggestion that neuraxial analgesia will mask the signs and symptoms of uterine rupture is unfounded. Th e pain of uterine rupture is constant (does not resolve between contractions), is much more intense, and has a di ff erent quality than the pain of contractions. Worsening of the fetal heart rate tracing will alert obstetric and anesthesiology teams to abnormality as well. Th e opioid-based epidural solutions used for labor provide only analgesia and cannot mask the pain of uterine rupture because these solutions do not provide anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amniotic Fluid Embolism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amniotic fl uid embolism is a rare catastrophic and life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs when there is a disruption in the barrier between the amniotic fl uid and the maternal circulation. Th e three most common sites for entry of amniotic fl uid into the maternal circulation are the endocervical veins, the placenta, and a uterine trauma site. Multiparous  parturient  women  experiencing  tumultuous  labors are at increased risk of amniotic fl uid embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e onset of the signs and symptoms of amniotic fl uid embolism is dramatic and abrupt, classically manifesting as dyspnea, arterial hypoxemia, cyanosis, seizures, loss of consciousness, and  hypotension  that  is  disproportionate  to  the  blood  loss. Fetal distress is present at the same time. More than 80% of these parturient women experience cardiopulmonary arrest. Coagulopathy  resembling  DIC  with  associated  bleeding  is common and may be the only presenting symptom.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  principal  defect  created  by  amniotic fl uid  embolism  is a  mechanical blockage of part of the pulmonary circulation accompanied  by  vasoconstriction  of  the  remaining  vessels resulting from release of unde fi ned chemicals such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin, and histamine. As a result, pulmonary  artery  pressures increase, arterial  hypoxemia develops  owing  to  ventilation/perfusion  mismatching,  and hypotension occurs, re fl ecting decreased cardiac output and congestive  heart  failure  caused  by  right  ventricular  out fl ow obstruction and acute cor pulmonale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of amniotic fl uid embolism is based largely on clinical  signs  and  symptoms. Th ese  include  increased  pulmonary  artery  pressures  and  decreased  cardiac  output  as

<!-- PAGE=? -->
572

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
determined  by  measurements  from  invasive  monitors.  Ultimately, the presence of amniotic fl uid material is con fi rmed in the parturient patient's blood aspirated from a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter. Findings of fetal squamous cells, fat, and mucin in samples of the patient's blood are indicative of amniotic fl uid embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conditions that can  mimic  amniotic fl uid  embolism include inhalation of gastric contents, pulmonary embolism, venous air embolism, and local anesthetic toxicity. Pulmonary aspiration is more likely when bronchoconstriction accompanies the clinical signs and symptoms. Indeed, bronchospasm is  rare  in  parturient  women  who  experience  amniotic fl uid embolism. Pulmonary embolism is usually accompanied by chest pain. High sensory levels produced by spinal or epidural anesthesia may be confused with amniotic fl uid embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of amniotic fl uid embolism includes tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation of the lungs with 100% oxygen, inotropic support as guided by central venous or pulmonary artery  catheter  monitoring,  and  correction  of  coagulopathy. Th e use of positive end-expiratory pressure is o ft en helpful for improving oxygenation. Dopamine, dobutamine, and norepinephrine have been recommended as inotropes to treat acute le ft ventricular dysfunction and associated hypotension. Fluid therapy is guided by central venous pressure monitoring, but it  must be kept in mind that these patients are vulnerable to developing pulmonary edema. Treatment of DIC may include administration of FFP , cryoprecipitate, and platelets. Even with immediate and aggressive treatment, mortality resulting from amniotic fl uid embolism remains higher than 80%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal Presentations and Multiple Births

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presentation of the fetus is determined by the presenting part  and  the  anatomic  portion  of  the  fetus  felt  through  the cervix  by  manual  examination. Th e  description  of  the  fetal position is based on the relationship of the fetal occiput, chin, or  sacrum to the le ft or  right  side  of  the  parturient  patient. Approximately 90% of deliveries are cephalic presentations in either the occiput transverse or occiput anterior position. All other presentations and positions are considered abnormal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BREECH PRESENTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Breech,  rather  than  cephalic,  presentations  characterize approximately  3.5%  of  all  pregnancies. Th e  cause  of  breech presentation is unknown, but factors that seem to predispose to this presentation include prematurity, placenta previa, multiple  gestations,  and  uterine  anomalies.  Fetal  abnormalities, including hydrocephalus and polyhydramnios, are also associated with breech presentations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetuses  in  breech  presentations  are  delivered  by  elective cesarean section. Vaginal breech delivery is rare and necessitates the immediate availability of anesthetic care, because serious complications can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Breech vaginal deliveries result in increased maternal morbidity. Compared with cephalic presentations, there is a greater likelihood of cervical lacerations, perineal injury, retained placenta, and shock resulting from hemorrhage. Morbidity and mortality of the neonate are also increased. Th ese infants are more  likely  to  experience  arterial  hypoxemia  and  acidosis during delivery because of umbilical cord compression. Prolapse of the umbilical cord occurs with increased frequency in breech presentations and is presumed to re fl ect failure of the presenting part to fi ll the lower uterine segment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In parturient patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery for breech presentation spinal anesthesia is generally used, as is routine for elective cesarean delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vaginal delivery may be complicated by umbilical cord prolapse or fetal head entrapment, which necessitates emergency anesthesia  for  cesarean  or  instrumented  vaginal  delivery. Dense perineal  anesthesia  is  needed  for  vaginal  instrumentation and must be administered rapidly, either by using 3% 2-chloroprocaine  if  an  epidural  catheter  is  in  place,  or  by inducing general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MULTIPLE GESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  increasing use of assisted reproductive technologies has resulted  in  a  markedly  greater  frequency  of  multiple  gestations.  Twin  pregnancies  comprise  approximately  3%  of  all pregnancies. Triplet and higher-order gestations increased by 500% from 1980 to 2001 and continue to increase in conjunction  with  the  increase  in  the  availability  and  use  of  assisted reproductive technologies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  all  triplet  and  higher-order  gestations,  delivery  is  by cesarean section. For twin gestations, the presentation of the twins is considered when determining the mode of delivery. If both are in vertex position, vaginal delivery is appropriate. If  twin  A  is  in  breech  position,  cesarean  delivery  is  recommended. Th e  route  of  delivery  for  vertex-nonvertex twins is controversial, but o ft en cesarean delivery is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal morbidity and mortality are increased with multiple  gestations  because  many  obstetric  complications  are more common in this setting. Fetal  perinatal  mortality  and morbidity are also increased, with preterm delivery the most common cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative. Th e  physiologic  changes  associated  with pregnancy may be exaggerated with multiple gestations. Th e larger size of the uterus causes a greater decrease in functional

<!-- PAGE=? -->
residual  capacity.  Maternal  blood  volume  is  500  mL  greater with twins, and cardiac output is greater. Supine hypotension syndrome is also more signi fi cant because of the larger uterus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative. Epidural  analgesia  is  preferred  for  labor analgesia because it will facilitate instrumented vaginal delivery or allow rapid induction of surgical anesthesia, if needed. Particular  attention  must  be  paid  to  le ft uterine  displacement. Th e risk of intrapartum and postpartum hemorrhage is increased; thus, large-bore intravenous access should be established and current blood typing and screening results should be available. Th e anesthesiologist must be prepared for vaginal (forceps) or abdominal operative delivery of twin B if that twin has a nonvertex presentation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  planned  cesarean  delivery,  maternal  and  fetal  status will dictate anesthetic choice. Severe aortocaval compression despite le ft uterine displacement may lead to profound hypotension, which should be treated aggressively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CO-EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Co-existing medical diseases may accompany pregnancy and thus assume importance out of proportion to the implications of the disease in the absence of pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heart Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the cardiovascular changes of pregnancy, women with congenital heart disease have increased risk of peripartum  cardiac  complications  ("cardiac  events").  According  to the Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy (CARPREG) study, which reviewed  data  for  562  patients  with  heart  disease  who  had 599 pregnancies and were treated in 13 Canadian hospitals, such cardiac events include pulmonary edema (documented by fi ndings on chest radiograph or the auscultation of crackles  over  more  than  one  third  of  the  posterior  lung fi elds), sustained symptomatic tachyarrhythmia or bradyarrhythmia requiring treatment, stroke, cardiac arrest, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  likelihood  of  occurrence  of  a  cardiac  event  can  be estimated using a scale based on the presence of certain risk factors. Th ese risk factors are a history of a previous cardiac event, a baseline New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II rating, or cyanosis; le ft heart obstruction (mitral valve area of 2 cm 2 , aortic valve area of <1.5 cm 2 , or peak le ft ventricular out fl ow tract gradient of >30 mm Hg by echocardiography); and reduced systemic ventricular  systolic  function  (ejection fraction of <40%). One point is assigned for each risk factor. Th e risk of an event is estimated to be 5% with no points, 27% with 1 point, and 75% with 2 or more points.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary hypertension is a signi fi cant risk factor for poor maternal  and  neonatal  outcome.  Patients  with  pulmonary hypertension are usually advised against pregnancy. Pulmonary insu ffi ciency has been shown to increase the risk of peripartum complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e ZAHARA study identi fi ed similar risk factors: a history of  arrhythmia,  use  of  cardiac  medication  before  pregnancy,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NYHA class higher than II, aortic stenosis, moderate or severe mitral and/or tricuspid regurgitation, presence of a mechanical valve, and cyanotic heart disease. A new risk score calculation  for  cardiac  complications  was  o ff ered.  Among  all  the cardiac events observed during pregnancy, the most frequent were arrhythmia and congestive heart failure. Of note, patients who died during the peripartum period were excluded from the ZAHARA study (Table 26-10).

CARDIOMYOPATHY OF PREGNANCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Le ft ventricular failure late in the course of pregnancy or during  the fi rst  6  weeks  post  partum  has  been  termed  the cardiomyopathy  of  pregnancy. Th e  precise  etiology  remains unknown. Suggested causes include myocarditis or an autoimmune response. Patients have signs and symptoms of le ft ventricular failure, frequently a ft er delivery or in the postpartum period.

Medical treatment of peripartum cardiomyopathy is similar  to  the  treatment  of  other  dilated  cardiomyopathies. Th is includes preload optimization, a ft erload reduction, and

improvement  of  myocardial  contractility.  In  addition,  these patients  may  require  anticoagulant  therapy  because  of  the increased risk of thromboembolism. It is important to remember that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which are routinely used for a ft erload reduction in nonpregnant patients, are contraindicated during pregnancy. However, nitroglycerin or nitroprusside can be used for a ft erload reduction in pregnant patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Collaboration  among  the  obstetrician,  cardiologist,  and anesthesiologist is essential to optimize care of these patients. Induction of labor is usually recommended if the patient's cardiac status can be stabilized with medical therapy. However, if acute cardiac decompensation occurs, cesarean delivery may be required because of the inability of the mother to tolerate the stresses of labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In approximately one half of these parturient patients, heart failure is transient, resolving within 6 months of delivery. In the remaining patients, idiopathic congestive cardiomyopathy persists, and the mortality rate is as high as 25% to 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parturient  patients  with  peripartum  cardiomyopathy  will likely  require  invasive  monitoring,  including  intraarterial catheterization and pulmonary artery catheterization to assess the  patient's  hemodynamic  status  and  guide  intrapartum management.  Acute  cardiac  decompensation  during  labor may require the administration of intravenous nitroglycerin or nitroprusside for preload and a ft erload reduction and dopamine or dobutamine for inotropic support. Early initiation of epidural labor analgesia is essential to minimize the cardiac stress associated with the pain of labor. Th e invasive monitoring  will  guide fl uid  management, the titration  of  vasoactive drugs, and the induction of epidural analgesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If cesarean delivery is required, epidural or spinal anesthesia may be used, with fl uid management guided by the use of the invasive monitors. If spinal anesthesia is selected, a continuous technique should be implemented, because use of a single-shot  technique,  which  produces  rapid  hemodynamic changes,  will  not  be  well  tolerated.  If  general  anesthesia  is required, the high-dose opioid remifentanil is o ft en preferred. Neonatal  depression  from  the  opioid  is  expected,  and  thus personnel must be available to perform neonatal resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes Mellitus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes  mellitus  is  one  of  the  most  common  co-existing medical conditions in pregnancy, occurring in approximately 2% of parturient women. Th e incidence is increasing because of the epidemic of obesity and the greater number of women becoming pregnant at an advanced maternal age. Ninety percent  of  diabetic  pregnant  patients  have  gestational  diabetes, whereas the other 10% have preexisting diabetes. Pregnancy is a state of progressive insulin resistance, as discussed earlier in the chapter. Women who cannot produce enough insulin to compensate for this resistance develop gestational diabetes. Patients  who  had  diabetes  before  pregnancy  have  increased insulin requirements during pregnancy. Patients with type 1 diabetes  are  at  greater  risk  of  diabetic  ketoacidosis,  because pregnancy is associated with enhanced lipolysis and ketogenesis and diminished ability to bu ff er overproduced acids. Th e decreased  bu ff ering  ability  is  secondary  to  the  lower  HCO 3 concentration  that  results  from  compensation  for  chronic respiratory  alkalosis.  Diabetic  ketoacidosis  occurs  at  lower glucose  levels  in  pregnancy,  as  low  as  130  to  150  mg/dL, because  of  utilization  of  glucose  by  the  fetus  and  placenta. Administration of β -adrenergic drugs and glucosteroids may precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  possibility  of  gestational  diabetes  arises  if  the  results  of a  routine  1-hour  glucose  tolerance  test  are  abnormal,  and  a 3-hour glucose tolerance test is then required. If the results of this test are also abnormal, the diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made. For evaluation of risk, patients with prepregnancy diabetes are classi fi ed by the type and duration of the diabetes and the presence of comorbid conditions (Table 26-11).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycemic control is the major focus of the care of pregnant women with diabetes. A blood glucose level of 60 to 120 mg/dL is  desirable, which requires frequent changes in insulin dosage  during  pregnancy.  Management of diabetic ketoacidosis is  similar  to  that  in  nonpregnant  patients.  In  patients  with gestational diabetes, dietary control is used initially. If glycemic control cannot be achieved through diet, insulin therapy is initiated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During the  third  trimester,  antenatal  fetal  surveillance  is conducted  using  twice-weekly  nonstress  tests,  beginning  at 28 weeks. If the nonstress test shows fetal nonreactivity, a biophysical pro fi le is compiled to determine timing and route of delivery. At 38 to 40 weeks, elective induction is commonly

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
chosen to avoid risks to the neonate associated with maternal diabetes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes later in life. In addition, the incidence of preeclampsia is increased, as is the incidence of polyhydramnios.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal e ff ects of diabetes include a greater risk of anomalies in fetuses of women with preexisting diabetes mellitus. Intrauterine fetal death, including late-trimester stillbirth, occurs more frequently in diabetic mothers, probably secondary to poor uteroplacental blood fl ow. Macrosomia leads to a higher incidence  of  cesarean  delivery,  shoulder  dystocia,  and  birth trauma. Neonates are at risk for hypoglycemia and may be at greater risk of respiratory distress.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  pregestational  diabetes  should  be  assessed for diabetes-related complications. Appropriate evaluation for gastroparesis,  autonomic  dysfunction,  and  cardiac,  vascular, and renal involvement should be made.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural  labor  analgesia  decreases  pain,  which  results  in decreased  maternal  plasma  catecholamine  levels  and  thus improved uteroplacental blood fl ow. Patients with autonomic dysfunction  are  especially  prone  to  hypotension  with  epidural  analgesia,  and  hypervigilance  and  rapid  treatment  are indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetic parturient patients are at increased risk of requiring  emergent cesarean delivery; therefore epidural analgesia may  be  preferred  to  spinal-epidural  analgesia,  because  the catheter should be known to be functioning to minimize the need for general anesthesia in the event that cesarean section is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e choice of anesthetic for cesarean delivery, as in other parturient patients, depends on the status of the mother and fetus.  As  for  all  diabetic  patients  undergoing  surgery,  blood glucose level should be checked intraoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenia Gravis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myasthenia  gravis  is  a  disorder  characterized  by  skeletal muscle  fatigability  and  weakness  caused  by  autoantibody destruction or blockade of postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Muscle weakness may involve only the eye muscles, predominantly the limb and axial muscles, or bulbar and respiratory muscles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e course of myasthenia gravis during gestation is highly variable and unpredictable. Exacerbations are most likely to occur during the fi rst trimester or within the fi rst 10 days post partum.  Anticholinesterase  drugs  should  be  continued  during  pregnancy and labor. Th eoretically,  these  drugs  increase uterine contractility but without increasing the incidence of spontaneous abortion or premature labor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skeletal muscles are greatly involved in the second stage of labor.  Myasthenia gravis causes weakness and fatigue of the skeletal muscles, resulting in impairment of the second stage of labor and sometimes in respiratory distress. Outlet forceps may be used to shorten the second stage of labor and thereby minimize skeletal muscle fatigue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An e ff ectively working epidural catheter for labor anesthesia provides excellent pain control and alleviates the stress of labor, which diminishes fatigue and prevents exacerbation of myasthenia gravis. Instrumented vaginal delivery is easier to perform  in  the  presence  of  good  neuraxial  analgesia.  Presence of a properly placed and functioning epidural catheter should allow general anesthesia to be avoided in case of an unplanned cesarean delivery. Early initiation of epidural analgesia is preferable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Important  considerations  regarding  the  use  of  general anesthesia in patients with myasthenia gravis are the following: First, nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are likely to have a  prolonged  e ff ect.  Second,  the  reversal  of  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may cause cholinergic crisis. Finally, larger doses of succinylcholine may be necessary to achieve relaxation unless adequate muscle relaxation can be achieved with an inhalation agent only.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neonatal  myasthenia  gravis  occurs  transiently  in  20% to 30% of infants born to mothers with this disorder. Manifestations  usually  occur  within  24  hours  of  birth  and  are characterized  by  generalized  skeletal  muscle  weakness  and expressionless facies. When breathing e ff orts are inadequate, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation of the infant's lungs should be initiated. Anticholinesterase therapy in neonates is usually necessary for approximately 21 days a ft er birth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maternal Obesity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity in the United States has become a national epidemic and is a major contributor to maternal morbidity. Nearly half of  U.S.  women of childbearing age are overweight or obese. Th e  pathophysiologic  features  associated  with  obesity  result in a greater incidence of pregnancy-related complications for both mother and infant than for nonobese patients and has lifelong health implications for o ff spring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  obesity  during  pregnancy  has  signi fi cant consequences  for  both  mother  and  fetus.  Hypertensive  disorders including chronic hypertension and preeclampsia are increased  in  these  patients.  Obese  patients  are  more  likely to  develop  gestational  diabetes  and  are  at  increased  risk  of thromboembolic  disease.  Obese  patients  are  more  likely  to have an abnormal labor, and failed induction is more likely to occur. Th ese patients are also at greater risk of postpartum hemorrhage,  regardless  of  the  route  of  delivery Th e  overall cesarean delivery rate and emergency cesarean delivery rate are  increased  in  obese  patients.  Factors  that  lead  to  these increased rates include preeclampsia and diabetes as well as an increased incidence of fetal macrosomia. So ft tissue dystocia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
576

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
may also be a contributing factor. Duration of surgery can be expected to be prolonged in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity  has  been  found  to  increase  the  risk  of  maternal death, related to the increased incidence of preeclampsia, diabetes, pulmonary embolism, and infection. Anesthesia-related maternal mortality is also increased in the obese parturient, with airway di ffi culties being a major cause.

Perinatal  outcome  is  adversely  a ff ected  by  obesity. Th e increased incidence of fetal macrosomia leads to a greater risk of birth trauma and shoulder dystocia. Meconium aspiration occurs more frequently in infants of obese women, and these infants are at greater risk of neural tube defects and other congenital abnormalities. In addition, fetal exposure to hyperglycemia in utero may result in an increased risk of developing diabetes, hypertension, and premature coronary artery disease.

OBSTETRIC MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obesity presents speci fi c technical problems in management of  labor  and  delivery  in  that  external  fetal  and  contraction monitoring  is  di ffi cult,  which  necessitates  internal  monitoring of these parameters. As noted earlier, obesity is associated with a higher incidence of cesarean delivery, and the obesity itself creates greater technical problems related to the surgery. Th us, the duration of surgery in these patients is longer than in nonobese patients.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preanesthetic Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  high  incidence  of  medical  disease  associated  with obesity as well as the di ffi culties encountered because of the patient's  body  habitus  present  a  signi fi cant  challenge  in  the management of obese parturient patients. Preanesthetic evaluation and preparation should include a thorough airway examination and assessment of the patient's pulmonary and cardiac status. Arterial blood gas analysis to assess for carbon dioxide retention, electrocardiography, and echocardiography may be indicated. An appropriately sized blood pressure cu ff designed to fi t the patient's arm must be available for management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Labor Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidural analgesia is a reasonable choice for labor analgesia. It provides excellent pain relief, reduces oxygen consumption,  and  may  attenuate  the  cardiac  responses  to  labor  and delivery.  Because  obese  women  have  a  higher  likelihood  of requiring cesarean delivery and the risk of general anesthesia is substantial in this patient population, early epidural analgesia o ff ers another advantage-the ability to extend the block for surgical anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e technical challenge of performing epidural analgesia in the obese parturient patient cannot be underestimated. Long needles may be required to reach the epidural space and should be readily available in the labor and delivery unit. Placement of  the  patient  in  the  sitting,  rather  than  the  lateral,  position should facilitate successful identi fi cation of the epidural space. Because the failure rate for epidural analgesia is increased in obese patients,  these  patients  must  be  monitored  frequently and  the  epidural  catheter  replaced  promptly  if  inadequate analgesia occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous  spinal  analgesia  is  an  option  for  labor  analgesia and may provide advantages over epidural analgesia in morbidly obese patients. Correct placement of the catheter is con fi rmed by aspiration of cerebrospinal fl uid, and thus initial failure rates will be lower than with epidural analgesia. A dislodged catheter will also be more readily identi fi ed than with epidural analgesia. Continuous spinal anesthesia is associated with  a  small  but  signi fi cant  risk  of  postural  puncture  headache, which may require treatment in the postpartum period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cesarean Delivery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  incidence  of  cesarean  delivery  is  higher  in  obese women than in nonobese women. Longer duration of surgery and increased blood loss must be anticipated by the anesthesiologist because of the patient's obesity and because the obstetrician frequently requires cephalad retraction of the patient's panniculus. Th e  anesthesiologist  must  be  vigilant  for  signs and  symptoms  of  maternal  respiratory  compromise  caused by increased chest wall compliance related to this retraction. Th ese patients are at high risk of aspiration and thus should receive aspiration prophylaxis with sodium citrate and metoclopramide  in  combination  with  an  H 2 -receptor  antagonist. Finally, the anesthesiologist must realize that technical di ffi -culties  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  obese  parturient  patients regardless of the type of anesthetic chosen. Regional anesthesia  is  preferred  whenever  possible  in  obese  patients. Th is  is primarily because of the even higher risks associated with general anesthesia and the greater likelihood of airway di ffi culty in obese parturient patients. One signi fi cant factor in the use of regional anesthesia is that the exaggerated spread of local anesthetic which occurs in obese patients may result in a high spinal anesthesia when a single-shot spinal anesthetic is used. For  this  reason,  a  continuous  technique,  spinal  or  epidural, may be considered in morbidly obese patients. Th e continuous technique also has the advantage of maintaining anesthesia for what may be an extended period of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  general  anesthesia  is  unavoidable,  emergency  airway equipment must be immediately available. If di ffi cult intubation is anticipated, awake fi beroptic intubation should be elected.

Advanced Maternal Age

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 2002, approximately 14% of all births in the United States were to women 35 years or older. In Canada in 2002, 30% of all births were to women 30 to 34 years of age, and 14% were to women 35 to 39 years of age. In 2008, births to women older than 40 years made up 3% of births in the United States, triple the rate of two decades earlier. Patients and health care professionals believe that advanced maternal age results in poor outcomes. Th e rationale for this view is the higher incidence of chronic medical conditions in older patients. Indeed, advanced maternal age is independently associated with maternal morbidities, including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, and cesarean delivery. In addition, older parturient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
women are more likely to weigh more than 70 kg and have preexisting  hypertension  or  diabetes. Th us,  these  medical problems will complicate the pregnancy and its management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e prognosis in patients of advanced maternal age is related to  the  presence  of  comorbid  conditions,  not  to  the  patient's age.  Healthy  women  of  advanced  maternal  age  would  be expected to have uneventful pregnancies and deliveries. However,  almost  half  of  patients  of  advanced  maternal  age  have preexisting medical conditions or develop pregnancy-related illness. Th eir pregnancy outcomes are related to these illnesses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perinatal complications are signi fi cant in patients of advanced maternal age. Multiple gestations are more common in older pregnant women, as are miscarriage, preterm delivery, and fetal complications such as congenital anomalies, low birth weight, and intrauterine and neonatal death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTETRIC MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e focus of obstetric management is on the patient's comorbid  conditions.  Prenatal  care  should  concentrate  on  early diagnosis  of  pregnancy-related  illnesses  to  allow  early  and aggressive management of these problems.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cesarean delivery is performed more frequently in women of advanced maternal age. In some, the need for cesarean delivery  is  related  to  confounding  problems.  However,  advanced maternal age is also independently associated with an increased likelihood of cesarean delivery, and rates of patientrequested cesarean delivery are much higher in women older than 34 years of age than in women 25 years of age or younger.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As with obstetric management, anesthetic care of the parturient patient of advanced maternal age is related to the patient's comorbid conditions, the most frequent of which have been discussed in other sections of this chapter.

Substance Abuse

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis of substance abuse is o ft en by history. Many commonly abused substances are mind altering or a ff ect the cardiovascular system when the patient is in an acutely toxic state. Diagnosis of substance abuse in a patient who is not under the in fl uence of a substance at admission may be made when that patient, or her infant, develops withdrawal symptoms or the newborn is diagnosed with a syndrome related to in utero exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Substances abused in pregnancy parallel those abused in society at large: alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and cocaine are frequently abused.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ALCOHOL ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 4% of pregnant women are heavy alcohol users.  Maternal  signs  and  symptoms  may  include  abnormal results on liver function tests, but o ft en the diagnosis is not made until delivery, when fetal alcohol syndrome is diagnosed in  the  neonate.  Fetal  alcohol  syndrome  occurs  in  approximately one third of infants born to mothers who drink more than 3 oz of alcohol per day during pregnancy. However, studies have reported neurobehavioral de fi cit, intrauterine growth retardation,  and  other  congenital  abnormalities  in  infants of  moderate  alcohol  consumers.  Current  recommendations re fl ect the view that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in pregnant patients who abuse alcohol entails the same considerations as anesthetic care of nonpregnant alcohol abusers (see Chapter 25).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TOBACCO ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cigarettes  are  the  most  commonly  abused  drug  during pregnancy.  Because  pregnant  smokers  are  relatively  young, o ft en there are minimal signs and symptoms associated with tobacco abuse in this population. A strong association is found between cigarette smoking and low infant birth rate, abruptio placentae, and impaired respiratory function in newborns. In those who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day, the incidence  of  premature  delivery  doubles.  Sudden  infant  death syndrome occurs much more frequently in infants of mothers who smoke. Smoking has a protective e ff ect against the development of preeclampsia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As  with  alcohol  abuse,  the  anesthetic  considerations  for care  of  tobacco-abusing  parturient  patients  are  similar  to those for care of nonpregnant patients who smoke.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OPIOID ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  numerous medical complications of injected drug use. Th ese  include  infectious  complications  such  as  human immunode fi ciency virus infection and  hepatitis. Patients may develop local abscesses or, more signi fi cantly, may have endocarditis or thrombophlebitis. A pregnant patient admitted while receiving long-term opioid therapy should be maintained  on  that  therapy  during  her  pregnancy  and  into  the postpartum period. It is not recommended that these patients undergo  detoxi fi cation  during  the  pregnancy.  In  fact,  withdrawal from opioids during the third trimester can result in perinatal  asphyxia  or  death  of  the  neonate.  Withdrawal  of the neonate from opioids can present as respiratory distress, seizures,  hyperthermia,  and  sudden  infant  death  syndrome. Neonates  should  be  observed  and  treated  for  withdrawal symptoms as necessary.

COCAINE ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cocaine  abuse  among  parturient  women  a ff ects  multiple organs,  including  the  cardiovascular,  respiratory,  neurologic, and hematologic systems. Cocaine is associated with maternal cardiovascular  complications  such  as  systemic  hypertension, myocardial ischemia and infarction, cardiac dysrhythmias, and sudden death. Sudden increases in systemic blood pressure may be the primary cause of cerebral hemorrhage. Alternatively, cerebrovascular spasm can produce local ischemia and infarction. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral bleeding, aneurysmal rupture, and seizures have been associated with cocaine use during pregnancy. Th rombocytopenia may occur following cocaine use and result in prolonged bleeding times. Th e maternal use of cocaine may lead to metabolic and endocrine changes in both the  fetus  and  the  mother,  which  presumably  re fl ects  cocaineinduced  release  of  catecholamines.  Pulmonary  complications (asthma,  chronic  cough,  dyspnea,  pulmonary  edema)  occur most o ft en in parturient women who smoke free-base cocaine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An increased incidence of signi fi cant  obstetric  complications is seen in parturient women who abuse cocaine during pregnancy (Table 26-12). Th e incidence of spontaneous abortion,  stillbirth,  and  preterm  labor  is  increased.  High  spontaneous  abortion  rates  may  be  related  to  cocaine-induced vasoconstriction, enhanced uterine contractions, and abrupt changes in systemic blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identi fi cation of parturient women abusing cocaine is diffi cult, because urine checks detect metabolites of cocaine for only 14 to 60 hours a ft er use. One of the single most important predictors of cocaine abuse is the absence of prenatal care.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cocaine use during the third trimester may result in immediate  uterine  contractions,  increased  fetal  activity,  abruptio placentae,  and  preterm  labor.  Uteroplacental  insu ffi ciency results in fetal intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, prematurity, and decreased birth weight. Use of cocaine during organogenesis is associated with fetal anomalies. Maternal systemic hypertension and vasoconstriction may be the cause of the increased incidence of abruptio placentae in cocaineabusing parturient women. Cocaine e ff ects on the fetus may manifest as an increased incidence of meconium staining and low Apgar score at birth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative. Evaluation  of  parturient  patients  suspected of  cocaine  abuse  includes  electrocardiography  and  possibly  echocardiography  to  check  for  the  presence  of  valvular heart disease. In parturient patients who have severe cocaineinduced  cardiovascular  toxicity,  hemodynamic  stabilization must be established before induction of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative. Cocaine-induced thrombocytopenia must be excluded if regional anesthesia is planned. Epidural

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anesthesia is instituted gradually, with attention to hydration and le ft uterine displacement to prevent hypotension. Hypotension caused by rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia  or  institution  of  regional  anesthesia  usually  responds to ephedrine, although long-term cocaine abuse can deplete catecholamines and theoretically blunt responses to indirectacting  vasopressors. Th us,  phenylephrine  may  be  the  better choice for treatment of hypotension in these patients. Esterbased local anesthetics, which undergo metabolism by plasma cholinesterase, may compete with cocaine, so that metabolism may be decreased for both drugs. Body temperature increases and  sympathomimetic  e ff ects  associated  with  cocaine  may mimic malignant hyperthermia.

FETAL ASSESSMENT AND NEONATAL PROBLEMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electronic Fetal Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electronic fetal monitoring permits evaluation of fetal welfare by following changes in fetal heart rate, as recorded using an external (Doppler) monitor or fetal scalp electrode. Th e basic principle of electronic fetal monitoring is to correlate changes in  fetal  heart  rate  with  fetal  well-being  and  uterine  contractions.  In  2009  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and Gynecologists published a revised practice bulletin updating the nomenclature for intrapartum fetal monitoring. A threetier  interpretation system was established that combines the assessment of baseline rate, beat-to-beat variability, accelerations, and periodic decelerations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BASELINE HEART RATE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal fetal heart rate is 110 to 160 beats per minute.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bradycardia is less than 110 beats per minute for longer than 10 minutes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tachycardia is more than 160 beats per minute for longer than 10 minutes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BEAT-TO-BEAT VARIABILITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fetal heart rate varies by 5 to 20 beats per minute in a manner that is irregular in amplitude and frequency. Th is normal heart rate variability is thought to re fl ect the integrity of neural pathways from the fetal cerebral cortex through the medulla,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
579

<!-- PAGE=? -->
vagus nerve, and cardiac conduction system. Fetal well-being is  con fi rmed  when  beat-to-beat  variability  is  present.  Conversely,  fetal  distress  resulting  from  arterial  hypoxemia,  acidosis,  or  central  nervous  system  damage  is  associated  with minimal to absent beat-to-beat variability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs  administered  to  parturient  patients  may  blunt  or eliminate fetal heart rate variability, even in the absence of fetal distress. Drugs most frequently associated with loss of beatto-beat variability are benzodiazepines, opioids, barbiturates, anticholinergics, and local anesthetics, as used for continuous lumbar epidural analgesia. Th ese drug-induced e ff ects do not appear to be deleterious but may cause di ffi culty in interpreting the results of fetal heart rate monitoring. In addition, lack of heart rate variability may be present normally in the premature fetus and during fetal sleep cycles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Terms  used  to  describe  fetal  heart  rate  variability  are de fi ned as follows:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Absent: variability undetectable Minimal: 5 beats per minute or less Moderate: 6 to 25 beats per minute Marked: more than 25 beats per minute

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACCELERATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An acceleration is a visually apparent abrupt increase in the fetal heart rate. A prolonged acceleration lasts longer than 2 minutes but less than 10 minutes. If an acceleration lasts 10 minutes or longer, it is a change in baseline.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DECELERATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early Decelerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Early  decelerations  are  characterized  by  a  slowing  of  the fetal heart rate that begins with the onset of uterine contractions. Slowing is maximum at the peak of the contraction, with a return to near baseline at its termination. Decreases in heart rate are usually not more than 20 beats per minute or below an absolute rate of 100 beats per minute. Th is  deceleration pattern is thought to be caused by vagal stimulation secondary to compression of the fetal head. Early decelerations are not prevented by increasing fetal oxygenation but are blunted by the administration of atropine. Traditionally, this fetal heart rate pattern is not associated with fetal distress.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Late Decelerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Late  decelerations  are  characterized  by  a  slowing  of  the fetal  heart  rate  that  begins  10  to  30  seconds  a ft er  the  onset of  uterine  contractions.  Maximum  slowing  occurs  a ft er  the peak intensity of the contraction. A mild late deceleration is de fi ned as a decrease in heart rate of less than 20 beats per minute;  profound  slowing  is  present  when  the  decrease  is more  than  40  beats  per  minute.  Late  decelerations  may  be associated with fetal distress and most likely re fl ect myocardial hypoxia  secondary  to  uteroplacental  insu ffi ciency.  Primary factors  contributing  to  the  appearance  of  late  decelerations include maternal  hypotension,  uterine  hyperactivity,  and chronic uteroplacental insu ffi ciency, such as may be seen with maternal diabetes mellitus or hypertension. When this pattern persists,  there  is  a  predictable  correlation  with  the  development of fetal acidosis. Late decelerations can be corrected by improving  fetal  oxygenation.  When  beat-to-beat  variability persists despite late decelerations, the fetus is still likely to be born vigorous.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variable Decelerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variable decelerations are the most common pattern of fetal heart changes observed during the intrapartum period. As the term indicates, these decelerations are variable in magnitude, duration,  and  time  of  onset  relative  to  uterine  contractions. For example, this pattern may begin before, with, or a ft er the onset of uterine contractions. Characteristically, deceleration patterns are abrupt in onset and cessation. Th e fetal heart rate almost invariably decreases to less than 100 beats per minute. Variable decelerations are thought to be caused by umbilical cord compression. Atropine diminishes the severity of variable decelerations, but administration of oxygen to the mother is  without  e ff ect.  If  deceleration  patterns  are  not  severe  and repetitive,  there  are  usually  only  minimal  alterations  in  the fetal acid-base status. Severe variable deceleration patterns that persist for 15 to 30 minutes are associated with fetal acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prolonged Decelerations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A prolonged  deceleration  is  a  decrease  in  the  fetal  heart rate from baseline of more than 15 beats per minute that lasts longer than 2 minutes and less than 10 minutes. If the deceleration lasts longer than 10 minutes, it represents a baseline change.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SINUSOIDAL PATTERN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinusoidal heart rate variability is a visually smooth, undulating  sine  wave-like  pattern  with  a  cyclical  frequency  of  3  to 5 minutes persisting for 20 minutes or longer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THREE-TIERED CLASSIFICATION OF FETAL HEART RATE TRACINGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Table  26-13  presents  a  three-tiered  system  for  categorizing the tracings obtained in fetal heart rate monitoring based on baseline rate, degree of variability, and pattern of decelerations and/or accelerations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category 1 tracings are normal. Th ese tracings are strongly predictive of normal acid-base status. No speci fi c action is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category 3 tracings are abnormal and are associated with abnormal fetal acid-base status. Evaluation of the fetus and  measures  to  resolve  the  abnormal  pattern  are required. If the tracing does not improve with intervention, delivery should be expedited.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Category 2 tracings  are  indeterminate. Although they are not predictive of abnormal acid-base status, there is not enough evidence to classify them as normal or abnormal. Ancillary testing or intrauterine resuscitation may be indicated.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FETAL SCALP SAMPLING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal scalp sampling may be indicated to evaluate a fetus with an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern. Based on the results, suspected  fetal  hypoxia  may  be  con fi rmed, which establishes  a need for urgent delivery. Good neonatal outcomes are associated with a pH 7.20 or greater, whereas a pH of 7.20 or lower suggests fetal compromise necessitating immediate delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FETAL PULSE OXIMETRY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fetal  pulse  oximetry  is  a  newer  technique  evaluating  intrapartum  fetal  oxygenation.  It  is  currently  employed  as  an adjunct to electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and may be used when the heart rate monitoring produces a nonreassuring tracing. Th e fetal pulse oximeter provides continuous fetal arterial oxygen saturation readings when placed through the cervix to lie alongside the fetal cheek or temple. Normal fetal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Points assigned for each parameter are summed to obtain the Apgar score.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
oxygen saturations range between 30% and 70%. Saturations less than 30% are suggestive of fetal acidemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ULTRASONOGRAPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ultrasonographic examination of the fetus when the mother is in labor may be useful to determine the fetal presenting part. Also, if fetal heart tones are undetectable using Doppler scanning,  ultrasonography may con fi rm intrauterine fetal health or demise. Ultrasonography may also be used to determine the quantity of amniotic fl uid present in the uterus and to diagnose abruptio placentae and placenta previa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of the Neonate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment of the infant immediately a ft er birth is important so  that  neonates  in  distress  who  require  active  resuscitation can be identi fi ed promptly. As a guide to identifying and treating neonates with depressed function, the Apgar score has not been surpassed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Apgar score assigns a numerical value to fi ve signs measured or observed in neonates 1 minute and 5 minutes a ft er delivery (Table 26-14). Of the fi ve factors, heart rate and quality of respiratory e ff ort are the most important; color is the least informative  in  identifying  neonates  in  distress.  A  heart  rate of  less  than  100  beats  per  minute  generally  signi fi es  arterial hypoxemia. Disappearance of cyanosis is o ft en rapid when ventilation and circulation are normal. Nevertheless, many healthy neonates still  have  cyanosis  at  1  minute  owing  to  peripheral vasoconstriction in response to cold ambient temperatures in the delivery room. Acidosis and pulmonary vasoconstriction are the most likely causes of persistent cyanosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Apgar scores correlate  well  with  acid-base  measurements performed  immediately  a ft er  birth.  When  scores  are  higher than 7, neonates have either normal blood gas concentrations or mild respiratory acidosis. Infants with scores of 4 to 6 have moderately depressed function; those with scores of 3 or below have  combined  metabolic  and  respiratory  acidosis.  Infants with mild to moderately depressed function (Apgar scores of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 26 PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3 to 7) frequently improve in response to oxygen administration by face mask, with or without positive pressure ventilation of the lungs. Tracheal intubation and perhaps external cardiac massage are indicated when Apgar scores are less than 3. Apgar scores  are  not  su ffi ciently  sensitive  to  detect  drug-related changes reliably or to provide data necessary to evaluate the subtle e ff ects of obstetric anesthetic techniques on neonates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIOD IMMEDIATELY AFTER BIRTH

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Major  changes  in  the  neonatal  cardiovascular  system  and respiratory  system  occur  immediately  following  delivery. For  example,  with  clamping  of  the  umbilical  cord  at  birth, systemic  vascular  resistance  increases,  le ft atrial  pressure increases, and fl ow through the foramen ovale ceases. Expansion of the lungs decreases pulmonary vascular resistance, and the entire right ventricular output is diverted to the lungs. In normal newborns, the increase in Pa o 2 to more than 60 mm Hg causes vasoconstriction and functional closure of the ductus  arteriosus.  When  adequate  oxygenation  and  ventilation are  not  established  a ft er  delivery,  a  fetal  circulation  pattern persists that is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance and decreased pulmonary blood fl ow. Furthermore, the ductus arteriosus and foramen ovale remain open, which results in large right-to-le ft intracardiac shunts with associated arterial hypoxemia and acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  high  index  of  suspicion  must  be  maintained  for  serious  abnormalities  that  can  be  present  at  birth  or  manifest shortly  a ft er  delivery. Th ese  include  meconium  aspiration, choanal stenosis and atresia, diaphragmatic hernia, hypovolemia, hypoglycemia, tracheoesophageal fi stula, and laryngeal anomalies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypovolemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Newborns with mean arterial pressures of less than 50 mm Hg at birth are likely to be hypovolemic. Poor capillary re fi ll, tachycardia, and tachypnea will be present. Hypovolemia frequently follows intrauterine fetal distress during which larger than normal portions of fetal blood are shunted to the placenta and remain there a ft er delivery and clamping of the umbilical cord. Umbilical cord compression is also frequently associated with hypovolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoglycemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypoglycemia can manifest as hypotension, tremors, and seizures.  Infants  with  intrauterine  growth  retardation  and those  born  to  diabetic  mothers  or  a ft er  severe  intrauterine fetal distress are vulnerable to hypoglycemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meconium Aspiration

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Meconium is the breakdown product of swallowed amniotic fl uid,  gastrointestinal  cells,  and  secretions.  It  is  seldom present  before  34  weeks  of  gestation.  A ft er  approximately 34 weeks, intrauterine arterial hypoxemia  can  result in increased gut motility and defecation. Gasping associated with arterial  hypoxemia  causes  the  fetus  to  inhale  amniotic fl uid and  debris  into  the  lungs.  If  delivery  is  delayed,  meconium is broken down and excreted from the lungs. If birth occurs within 24 hours of aspiration, the meconium is still present in  the  major  airways  and  is  distributed  to  the  lung  periphery with the onset of spontaneous breathing. Obstruction of small airways causes ventilation/perfusion mismatching. Th e breathing rate may be more than 100 breaths per minutes and lung compliance decreases to levels seen in infants with respiratory distress syndrome. In severe cases, pulmonary hypertension and right-to-le ft shunting through the patent foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus (persistent fetal circulation) lead to severe arterial hypoxemia. Pneumothorax is also a common problem in the presence of meconium aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  past,  treatment  of  meconium  aspiration  consisted of  placing  a  tracheal  tube  immediately  a ft er  delivery  and attempting to suction meconium from the newborn's airways. Currently,  a  more  conservative  approach  is  recommended, because routine tracheal intubation of all infants with meconium  staining  (approximately  10%  of  all  newborns)  may cause unnecessary airway complications. Routine oropharyngeal suctioning is recommended at the time of delivery, but tracheal  intubation  and  suctioning  is  performed  selectively, depending on the infant's condition (those with Apgar scores of  >7  are  managed  conservatively).  Infants  who  have  low Apgar scores or who have clinical signs of meconium obstruction require active resuscitation, including tracheal intubation and attempted removal of meconium via suctioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choanal Stenosis and Atresia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nasal  obstruction  should  be  suspected  in  neonates  who have good breathing e ff orts but in whom air entry is absent. Cyanosis develops if these infants are forced to breathe with their  mouths  closed.  Unilateral  or  bilateral  choanal  stenosis is  diagnosed  based  on  the  inability  to  pass  a  small  catheter through each naris. Such failure may re fl ect congenital (anatomic)  obstruction  or,  more  commonly,  functional  atresia resulting  from  obstruction  by  blood,  mucus,  or  meconium. Th e congenital form of choanal atresia must be treated surgically during the neonatal period. Use of an oral airway may be  necessary  until  surgical  correction  can  be  accomplished. Functional choanal atresia is treated by nasal suctioning. Opioids o ft en cause congestion of the nasal mucosa and obstruction. Such congestion can be treated with phenylephrine nose drops.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diaphragmatic Hernia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Severe  respiratory  distress  at  birth,  in  association  with cyanosis and a scaphoid abdomen, suggests a diaphragmatic hernia.  Chest  radiographs  demonstrate  abdominal  contents in the thorax. Initial treatment in the delivery room includes tracheal intubation and ventilation of the lungs with oxygen. A pneumothorax on the side opposite the hernia is likely if attempts are made to expand the ipsilateral lung.

diagnosis in the delivery room is suggested when a catheter inserted into the esophagus cannot be passed into the stomach. Copious amounts of oropharyngeal secretions are usually present.  Chest  radiographs  taken  with  the  catheter  in  place con fi rm the diagnosis.

Laryngeal Anomalies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stridor is present at birth as a manifestation of laryngeal anomalies and subglottic stenosis. Insertion of a tube into the trachea beyond the obstruction alleviates the symptoms. Vascular rings are anomalies of the aorta that may compress the trachea, producing both inspiratory and expiratory obstruction. It may be di ffi cult to advance a tracheal tube beyond the obstruction produced by vascular rings.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Physiologic changes of pregnancy a ff ect all organ systems. Th ey in fl uence maternal compensation for comorbid conditions and maternal responses to anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th ere is less fetal drug exposure with regional anesthesia. Any well-managed anesthetic is safe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Blood pressure, oxygenation, and normocarbia should be maintained during delivery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Delivery is the de fi nitive treatment for pregnancy-induced hypertension. Delivery should be delayed only if the risk of neonatal immaturity outweighs maternal risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Co-existing medical diseases may result in maternal decompensation related to the physiologic changes of pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Fetal assessment permits evaluation of fetal well-being and guides neonatal management.
