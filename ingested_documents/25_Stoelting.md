Th e prevalence of mental disorders and substance use disorders  in  the  United  States  is  about  30%,  so  these  conditions will  o ft en  be  present  in  patients  undergoing  anesthesia  and surgery. E ff ects  of  and  potential  drug  interactions  with  psychotropic  medications  are  important  perioperative  considerations.  In  addition,  substance  abuse  and  suicide  represent signi fi cant occupational hazards for anesthesiologists.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MOOD DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mood disorders are characterized by disturbances in the regulation of mood, behavior, and a ff ect. Th ey are typically divided into three classes: (1) depressive disorders, (2) bipolar disorders,  and  (3)  depression  associated  with  medical  illness  or substance abuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depression

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depression  is  a  common  psychiatric  disorder,  a ff ecting  2% to 4% of the population. It is distinguished from normal sadness and grief by the severity and duration of the mood disturbances. Th ere  is  a  familial  pattern  to  major  depression, and  females  are  a ff ected  more  o ft en  than  males.  Approximately 15% of patients with major depression commit suicide. Pathophysiologic  causes  of  major  depression  are  unknown, although abnormalities of amine neurotransmitter pathways are the most likely etiologic factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of major depression is based on the persistent presence of at least fi ve of the symptoms noted in Table 25-1 for a period of at least 2 weeks. Th ere is a profound loss of pleasure  in  previously  enjoyable  activities  (anhedonia).  Organic causes of irritability or mood changes and the normal reaction to a major loss such as the death of a loved one or loss of a job must be excluded. Depressive symptoms o ft en are present

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
in  patients  with  cardiac  disease,  cancer,  neurologic  diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and human immunode fi -ciency virus (HIV) infection. Even if it is not directly related to  the  medical illness,  the  depression can be a side e ff ect  of medication used to treat the medical illness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  patients  with  depression  should  be  evaluated  for  the potential to commit suicide. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans. About 5% of depressed patients will commit suicide. Interestingly, physicians have moderately higher (men) to much higher (women) suicide rates than the general  population.  Most  individuals  who  commit  suicide have been under the care of a physician (not necessarily a psychiatrist) within the month before their death, which emphasizes  the  need  for  physicians  in  all  specialties  to  recognize patients at risk. Hopelessness is the most important aspect of depression associated with suicide.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depression  can  be  treated  with  antidepressant  medications, psychotherapy,  and/or  electroconvulsive  therapy  (ECT).  An estimated 70% to 80% of patients respond to pharmacologic therapy, and at least 50% who do not respond to antidepressants do respond favorably to ECT. ECT is usually reserved for patients with depression resistant to antidepressant drugs or those with medical contraindications to treatment with these drugs.  Patients  with  depression  plus  psychotic  symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, catatonia) require both antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately  50  years  ago,  neurochemical  hypotheses regarding  depression  postulated  that  decreased  availability of norepinephrine and serotonin at speci fi c synapses in the brain is associated with depression and, conversely, that an increased concentration of these neurotransmitters is associated  with  mania.  Subsequent  studies  have  generally  supported  the  hypotheses  that  norepinephrine  and  serotonin metabolism  are  important  in  mood  states,  although  the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Almost all drugs with antidepressant properties a ff ect the availability of catecholamine and/or serotonin in the central nervous system (Table 25-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  block reuptake of serotonin at presynaptic membranes but have relatively little e ff ect on adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, or

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 25-2 ■ Commonly used antidepressant medications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAOIs, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors; SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
other neurochemical systems. As a result, they are associated with few side e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricyclic antidepressants are thought to a ff ect depression by inhibiting synaptic reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. However, they also a ff ect other neurochemical systems, including histaminergic and cholinergic systems. Consequently, they have a large range of adverse e ff ects, including postural hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias, and urinary retention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monoamine  oxidase  inhibitors  (MAOIs)  are  inhibitors of  both  the  A  and  B  forms  of  brain  monamine oxidase and change  the  concentration  of  neurotransmitters  by  preventing breakdown of catecholamines and serotonin. Th ey are not considered fi rst-line drugs in treatment of depression because of their adverse e ff ect pro fi le, which includes the risk of hypertensive crises from consumption of tyramine-containing foods and the risk of serotonin syndrome if they are used concomitantly with SSRIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venlafaxine  is  a  methylamine  antidepressant  that  selectively inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin without  a ff ecting  other  neurochemical  systems.  Other  atypical antidepressants have more diverse e ff ects, including inhibition of reuptake of serotonin and dopamine, antagonism of speci fi c serotonin receptors, dopamine receptor blockade, presynaptic α 2 -blockade resulting in increases in norepinephrine and serotonin release, and histamine receptor blockade.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere has been a resurgence in the use of amphetamine and its congeners in treating depression. Typically these drugs are used in small dosages in combination with SSRIs. Th e e ff ects on mood can be remarkable. However, because of their status as class II controlled substances, it is unlikely that they will be widely used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serotonin  is  produced  by  hydroxylation  and  decarboxylation of L-tryptophan in presynaptic neurons, then stored in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
535

<!-- PAGE=? -->
vesicles that are released and bound to postsynaptic receptors when needed for neurotransmission. A reuptake mechanism allows  for  return  of  serotonin  to  the  presynaptic  vesicles. Metabolism  is  by  monoamine  oxidase  type  A.  Serotoninspeci fi c  reuptake  inhibitors,  as  their  name  implies,  inhibit the reuptake of serotonin from the neuronal synapse without having signi fi cant e ff ects on reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SSRIs comprise the most widely prescribed class of antidepressants and are the drugs of choice to treat mild to moderate depression. Th ese drugs are also e ff ective for treating panic disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, bulimia, dysthymia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and irritable bowel syndrome. Common side e ff ects of SSRIs are insomnia, agitation, headache,  nausea,  diarrhea,  dry  mouth,  and  sexual  dysfunction. Appetite  suppression  is  associated  with fl uoxetine  therapy. Abrupt  cessation  of  SSRI  use,  especially  use  of  paroxetine and fl uvoxamine,  which  have  short  half-lives  and  no  active metabolites, can result in a discontinuation syndrome that can mimic serious illness and can be distressing and uncomfortable.  Discontinuation  symptoms  typically  begin  1  to  3  days a ft er abrupt cessation of SSRI use and may include dizziness, irritability, mood swings, headache, nausea and vomiting, dystonia, tremor, lethargy, myalgias, and fatigue. Symptoms are relieved within 24 hours of restarting SSRI therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Among SSRIs, fl uoxetine is a potent inhibitor of certain hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes. As a result, this drug may increase plasma concentrations of drugs that depend on hepatic metabolism for clearance. For example, the addition  of fl uoxetine  to  treatment  with  tricyclic  antidepressant  drugs  may  result  in  twofold  to fi vefold  increases  in the plasma concentrations of tricyclic drugs. Some cardiac antidysrhythmic drugs and some β -adrenergic antagonists are also metabolized by this enzyme system, and fl uoxetine inhibition of enzyme activity may result in potentiation of their e ff ects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serotonin Syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening  adverse  drug  reaction  that  may  occur  with therapeutic drug use, overdose, or interaction between serotoninergic drugs. A large number of drugs have been associated with serotonin syndrome. Th ese include SSRIs, atypical and  cyclic  antidepressants,  MAOIs,  opiates,  cough  medicine,  antibiotics,  weight  reduction  drugs,  antiemetic  drugs, antimigraine  drugs,  drugs  of  abuse  (especially  "ecstasy" [3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine]), and herbal products (Table 25-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Typical symptoms of serotonin syndrome include agitation, delirium, autonomic hyperactivity, hyperre fl exia, clonus, and hyperthermia  (Figure  25-1).  Additional  syndromes  to  consider in the di ff erential diagnosis of serotonin syndrome are listed in Table 25-4. Treatment includes supportive measures and  control  of  autonomic  instability,  excess  muscle  activity, and  hyperthermia.  Cyproheptadine,  a  5-hydroxytriptamine (serotonin) type 2A (5-HT 2A ) antagonist, can be used to bind serotonin receptors. It is available only for oral use.

Before  the  availability  of  SSRIs,  tricyclic  antidepressants were  the  most  commonly  prescribed  drugs  for  treatment of  depression.  Now  they  are  used  in  selected  patients  with depression and as adjuvant therapy for patients with chronic pain  syndromes.  Advantages  include  low  cost  and,  for  nortriptyline,  imipramine,  and  desipramine,  the  existence  of

well-de fi ned correlations between dosage, plasma concentration, and therapeutic responses. Adverse e ff ects in fl uence drug choice, because all these drugs are equally e ff ective if administered in equivalent dosages. In addition to causing sedative and anticholinergic e ff ects, tricyclic antidepressants can cause cardiovascular abnormalities, including orthostatic hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  Anesthesia. Patients  being  treated  with tricyclic antidepressants may have altered responses to drugs administered during the perioperative period. Increased availability  of  neurotransmitters  in  the  central  nervous  system can result in increased anesthetic requirements. Likewise, increased availability of norepinephrine at postsynaptic receptors in the sympathetic nervous system can be responsible for exaggerated  blood  pressure  responses  following  administration  of  indirect-acting  vasopressors,  such  as  ephedrine. Th e potential for signi fi cant hypertension is greatest during acute treatment with tricyclic antidepressants ( fi rst 14 to 21 days); long-term  treatment  is  associated  with  downregulation  of receptors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term  treatment  with  tricyclic  antidepressants  may alter the response to pancuronium. Tachydysrhythmias have been  observed  following  administration  of  pancuronium to  patients  who  were  also  receiving  imipramine.  Presumably, there is an interaction between tricyclic antidepressants and the anticholinergic- and sympathetic-stimulating e ff ects of  pancuronium.  Ketamine,  meperidine,  and  epinephrinecontaining local anesthetic solutions might produce adverse responses  similar  to  those  seen  with  pancuronium  and  are best avoided.

Potential for serotonin syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAOIs  inhibit  norepinephrine  and  serotonin  breakdown, so there is more norepinephrine and serotonin available for release. Th e principal clinical problem associated with use of these  drugs  is  the  occurrence  of  signi fi cant  systemic  hypertension if patients ingest foods containing tyramine (cheeses, wines) or receive sympathomimetic drugs. Both tyramine and sympathomimetic drugs are potent stimuli for norepinephrine release. Orthostatic hypotension is the most common adverse e ff ect observed in patients being treated with MAOIs (Table 25-5). Th e mechanism for this hypotension is unknown, but it  may involve accumulation of false neurotransmitters such as  octopamine,  which  are  less  potent  than  norepinephrine. Th is mechanism may also explain the antihypertensive e ff ects observed with long-term use of MAOIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As noted earlier, adverse interactions between MAOIs and other serotoninergic drugs have been observed. In the anesthetic  environment, the interaction with the opioid meperidine has been the most notable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia. Anesthesia can be safely conducted in patients being treated with MAOIs despite earlier recommendations that these drugs be discontinued 14 days before  elective  operations  to  permit  time  for  regeneration of  new  enzyme.  Proceeding  with  anesthesia  and  surgery  in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
patients  being  treated  with  MAOIs  in fl uences  the  selection and doses of drugs to be administered. Benzodiazepines are acceptable for pharmacologic treatment of preoperative anxiety. Induction of anesthesia can be safely accomplished with most intravenous induction agents, but it should be kept in mind  that  central  nervous  system  e ff ects  and  depression  of ventilation  may  be  exaggerated.  Ketamine,  a  sympathetic stimulant,  should  be  avoided.  Serum  cholinesterase  activity  may  decrease  in  patients  treated  with  phenelzine,  so  the dose  of  succinylcholine  may  need  to  be  reduced.  Nitrous oxide  combined  with  a  volatile  anesthetic  is  acceptable  for maintenance of anesthesia. Anesthetic requirements may be increased because of increased concentrations of norepinephrine in the central nervous system. Fentanyl has been administered intraoperatively to patients being treated with MAOIs without apparent adverse e ff ects. Th e  choice  of  nondepolarizing  muscle  relaxants  is  not  in fl uenced  by  treatment  with MAOIs, with the possible exception of pancuronium. Spinal or epidural anesthesia is acceptable, although the potential of these anesthetic techniques to produce hypotension and the consequent need for vasopressors may argue in favor of general anesthesia. Th e addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic solutions should probably be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  anesthesia  and  surgery,  it  is  important  to  avoid stimulating the sympathetic nervous system as, for example, by  light  anesthesia,  topical  application  of  cocaine  spray,  or injection of indirect-acting vasopressors to decrease the incidence  of  systemic  hypertension.  If  hypotension  occurs  and vasopressors  are  needed,  use  of  direct-acting  drugs  such  as phenylephrine is recommended. Th e dose should probably be decreased to minimize the likelihood of an exaggerated hypertensive response.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Care. Provision of analgesia during the postoperative period is in fl uenced by the potential adverse interactions between opioids, especially meperidine and MAOIs, which  can  result  in  severe  serotonin  syndrome  (see  Table 25-3). If  opioids  are  needed for postoperative pain management,  morphine  is  a  preferred  drug.  Alternatives  to  opioid analgesics  such  as  nonopioid  analgesics,  nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory drugs, and peripheral nerve blocks should be considered. Neuraxial opioids provide e ff ective analgesia, but experience is too limited to permit recommendations regarding use of this approach in patients being treated with MAOIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electroconvulsive Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite many decades of use of ECT, the exact mechanism for  its  therapeutic  e ff ect  remains  unknown.  Alterations  in neurophysiologic,  neuroendocrinologic,  and  neurochemical systems are thought to be involved but have not been clearly elucidated. What is evident is that electrically induced seizures of at least 25 seconds' duration are necessary for a therapeutic e ff ect. ECT is indicated for treatment of severe depression in patients who show no response to drug therapy, cannot tolerate the adverse e ff ects of psychotropic drug therapy, or are suicidal. Th e electrical current may be administered to both

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hemispheres or only to the nondominant hemisphere, which may reduce memory impairment. Th e electrical stimulus produces  a  grand  mal  seizure  consisting  of  a  brief  tonic  phase followed  by  a  more  prolonged  clonic  phase. Th e  electroencephalogram shows changes similar to those present during spontaneous grand mal seizures. Typically, patients undergo 6 to 12 induction treatments during hospitalization and then may continue weekly, biweekly, or monthly maintenance therapy. More than two thirds of patients receiving ECT show signi fi cant improvement in their depressive symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to the seizure and its neuropsychiatric e ff ects, ECT  produces  signi fi cant  cardiovascular  and  central  nervous  system  e ff ects  (Table  25-6). Th e  typical  cardiovascular response to the ECT stimulus consists of 10 to 15 seconds of parasympathetic  stimulation  producing  bradycardia  with  a reduction in blood pressure, followed by sympathetic nervous system  activation  resulting  in  tachycardia  and  hypertension lasting several minutes. Th ese changes may be undesirable in patients with ischemic heart disease. Indeed, the most common  causes  of  death  associated  with  ECT  are  myocardial infarction and cardiac dysrhythmias, although overall mortality  rates  are  low,  approximately  1  in  5000  treatments.  Transient  myocardial  ischemia,  however,  is  not  an  uncommon event. Other cardiovascular changes in response to ECT are decreased venous return caused by the increased intrathoracic pressure that accompanies the seizure and/or positive pressure ventilation and ventricular premature beats that presumably re fl ect  excess  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity.  Patients with  acute  coronary  syndromes,  decompensated  congestive heart  failure,  signi fi cant  dysrhythmias,  and  severe  valvular heart disease require cardiologic consultation before initiation of ECT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular responses to ECT include marked increases in cerebral blood fl ow (up to sevenfold) and blood fl ow  velocity  (more  than  double)  compared  with  pretreatment values. Cerebral oxygen consumption increases as well. Th e rapid increase in systemic blood pressure may transiently overwhelm cerebral autoregulation and result in a dramatic increase  in  intracranial  pressure. Th us,  the  use  of  ECT  is prohibited  in  patients  with  known  space-occupying  lesions or  head  injury. Th e  cerebral  hemodynamic changes are also

<!-- PAGE=? -->
538

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
associated with increased wall stress on cerebral aneurysms, and intracranial aneurysm disease is another contraindication to ECT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased  intraocular  pressure  is  an  inevitable  side  e ff ect of electrically induced seizures. Increased intragastric pressure also occurs during seizure activity. Transient apnea, postictal confusion  or  agitation,  nausea  and  vomiting,  and  headache may follow the seizure. Th e most common long-term e ff ect of ECT is memory impairment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia. Anesthesia for ECT must be brief, provide the ability to monitor and limit the physiologic e ff ects of the seizure, and minimize any interference with seizure  activity  or  duration.  Patients  must  fast  before  the  procedure.  Administration  of  glycopyrrolate  intravenously  1  to 2 minutes before induction of anesthesia and delivery of the electrical current may be useful in decreasing excessive salivation and bradycardia. Th e magnitude of treatment-induced hypertension can be ameliorated by the use of nitroglycerin intravenously, sublingually, or transcutaneously.  Likewise, esmolol  1  mg/kg  IV  administered  just  before  induction  of anesthesia  can  attenuate  the  tachycardia  and  hypertension associated with ECT, and it does so better than labetalol. Many other drugs, including calcium channel blockers, ganglionic blockers, α 2 -agonists and antagonists, and direct-acting vasodilators, have been used to treat the sympathetic overactivity during ECT, but they do not appear to o ff er any speci fi c advantages over esmolol or nitroglycerin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methohexital (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg IV) is the traditional drug used for induction of anesthesia for ECT. It has a rapid onset, short duration of action, and minimal anticonvulsant e ff ects, and  recovery  is  rapid. Th iopental  o ff ers  no  advantage  over methohexital and may be associated with longer recovery times.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of shortages of barbiturates in the United States, other  induction  drugs  are  now  commonly  used  for  ECT. Propofol  is  an  alternative  to  methohexital  and  is  associated with a lower blood pressure and heart rate response to ECT. Recovery time is similar a ft er  administration of methohexital and propofol, but the anticonvulsant e ff ect of propofol can be  manifested  as  shortened  seizure  duration.  Ketamine  and etomidate improve the quality and duration of the electrically induced seizure, but ketamine is associated with a prolonged reorientation time a ft er the procedure, and etomidate is associated with more hypertension a ft er the seizure and the possibility of spontaneous seizures before the electrical stimulus is delivered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravenous  injection  of  succinylcholine  promptly  a ft er induction  is  intended  to  attenuate  the  potentially  dangerous skeletal muscle contractions and bone fractures that can result from seizure activity. Doses of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg IV are su ffi cient  to  attenuate  skeletal  muscle  contractions  and  still permit visual con fi rmation of seizure activity. Th e most reliable  method  to  con fi rm electrically  induced  seizure  activity is  the  electroencephalogram.  Alternatively,  tonic  and  clonic movements in an extremity that has been isolated from the circulation  by  applying  a  tourniquet  before  administration of  succinylcholine  are  evidence  that  a  seizure  has  occurred. Succinylcholine-induced  myalgias  are  remarkably  uncommon,  occurring  in  approximately  2%  of  patients  undergoing  ECT. Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  succinylcholine-induced release of potassium is increased by ECT. Ventilatory support and oxygen supplementation are continued as necessary until there is complete recovery to pretreatment cardiopulmonary status. Because repeated administration of anesthetics is necessary,  it  is  possible  to  establish  the  doses  of  the  anesthetic induction  drug  and  succinylcholine  that  produce  the  most predictable and desirable e ff ects in each patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occasionally, ECT is necessary in a patient with a permanent  cardiac  pacemaker  or  cardioverter-de fi brillator.  Fortunately, most of these devices are shielded and are not adversely a ff ected  by  the  electrical  currents  necessary  to  produce  seizures, but it is prudent to have an external magnet available to ensure that the pacemaker can be converted to asynchronous modes should malfunction occur in response to the externally delivered electrical current or myopotentials from the succinylcholine or the seizure. Monitoring the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the plethysmographic waveform of the pulse oximeter, and palpation of peripheral arterial pulses document the uninterrupted  function  of  cardiac  pacemakers.  Implantable cardioverters-de fi brillators  should  be  turned  o ff before  ECT and reactivated when the treatment is fi nished.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Safe and successful use of ECT has been described in patients following cardiac transplantation. In such patients, the lack of vagal innervation to the heart eliminates the risk of bradydysrhythmias. However, the sympathetic responses still occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bipolar Disorder

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bipolar disorder, previously called manic-depressive disorder, is characterized by marked mood swings from depressive episodes to manic or hypomanic episodes with normal behavior o ft en seen in between these episodes. Between 8% and 10% of patients with bipolar disorder commit suicide. Th e manic phase of bipolar disorder is manifested clinically by sustained periods  of  expansive  euphoric  mood  in  which  the  patient expresses grandiose ideas and plans. Th e mood disturbance is su ffi ciently severe to cause impairment in occupational functioning and in social activities and relationships, so there is risk of harm to self and others. Irritability and hyperactivity are also present, and in severe cases psychotic delusions and hallucinations  may  appear  that  are  indistinguishable  from those of schizophrenia (Table 25-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
539

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e genetic pattern in bipolar disorder suggests autosomal dominance  with  variable  penetrance.  Presumably,  there  are abnormalities in neuroendocrine pathways that result in aberrant regulation of one or more amine neurotransmitter systems. Th us, the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder, to the extent that it  is  known, is similar to that of major depressive illness. Th e evaluation of mania must exclude the e ff ects of substance abuse drugs, medications, and concomitant medical conditions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mania necessitates prompt treatment, usually in a hospital setting to protect patients from potential harmful actions. Lithium remains a mainstay of treatment, but antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine and valproate are o ft en used. Olanzapine is another treatment option. When manic symptoms are severe, lithium may be administered in combination with an antipsychotic drug until the acute symptoms abate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lithium

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lithium is an alkali metal, a monovalent cation, and is minimally protein bound. It does not undergo biotransformation and  is  excreted  renally.  Lithium  is  e ffi ciently  absorbed  a ft er oral  administration. Its therapeutic serum concentration for acute mania and for prophylaxis is approximately 0.8 to 1.2 mEq/L. Because of its narrow therapeutic window, serum lithium concentration must be monitored to prevent toxicity. Th e therapeutic e ff ects of lithium are most likely related to actions on second messenger systems based on phosphatidylinositol turnover. Lithium also a ff ects transmembrane ion pumps and has inhibitory e ff ects on adenylate cyclase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common adverse e ff ects  of  lithium  therapy  include  cognitive dysfunction, weight gain, and tremor. Lithium inhibits release of thyroid hormone and results in hypothyroidism in approximately  5%  of  patients.  Long-term  administration  of lithium may also result in polyuria due to a form of vasopressin-resistant diabetes insipidus. Cardiac problems may include sinus  bradycardia,  sinus  node  dysfunction,  atrioventricular block, T-wave changes, and ventricular irritability. Leukocytosis in the range of 10,000 to 14,000 cells/mm 3  is common.

Toxicity  occurs  when  the  serum  lithium  concentration exceeds  2  mEq/L,  with  signs  of  skeletal  muscle  weakness, ataxia, sedation, and widening of the QRS complex. Atrioventricular  heart  block,  hypotension,  and  seizures  may  accompany severe lithium toxicity. Hemodialysis may be necessary in this medical emergency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lithium is excreted entirely by the kidneys. Reabsorption of lithium occurs in the proximal tubule in exchange for sodium. Diuretic use can a ff ect the serum lithium concentration. Th iazide  diuretics  trigger  an  increase  in  lithium  reabsorption  in the proximal tubule, whereas loop diuretics do not promote lithium  reabsorption.  Administration  of  sodium-containing  solutions  or  osmotic  diuretics  enhances  renal  excretion of  lithium  and  results  in  lower  lithium  levels.  Concomitant administration of nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs and/ or  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors  increases  the risk of lithium toxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  Anesthesia. Evidence  of  lithium  toxicity  is  important to consider during the preoperative evaluation. Th e  most  recent  serum  lithium  concentration  should be reviewed, and inclusion of lithium level in measurements of  the  patient's  serum  electrolyte  concentrations  during  the perioperative  period  is  very  useful.  To  prevent  signi fi cant renal  reabsorption  of  lithium,  it  is  reasonable  to  administer sodium-containing  intravenous  solutions  during  the  perioperative  period.  Stimulation  of  urine  output  with  thiazide diuretics must be avoided. Th e ECG should be monitored for evidence of lithium-induced conduction defects or dysrhythmias. Th e  association  of  sedation  with  lithium  therapy  suggests that anesthetic requirements may be decreased in these patients. Monitoring the e ff ects of neuromuscular blockade is indicated, because the duration of action of both depolarizing and nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may be prolonged in the presence of lithium.

SCHIZOPHRENIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Schizophrenia (Greek for "split mind") is the major psychotic mental disorder. It is characterized by abnormal reality testing or thought processes. Th e essential features of the illness include two broad categories of symptoms. Positive symptoms are  those  that  re fl ect  distortion  or  exaggeration  of  normal behavior and include delusions and hallucinations. Negative symptoms represent a loss or diminution in normal function and  include fl attened  a ff ect,  apathy,  social  or  occupational dysfunction including withdrawal, and changes in appearance and hygiene. Subtypes of schizophrenia include the paranoid type, the disorganized type, the catatonic type, and the undifferentiated type. In some patients, the disorder is persistent, whereas in others, there are exacerbations and remissions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e dopamine hypothesis concerning the etiology of schizophrenia  suggests  that  the  disorder  is  a  result  of  neurotransmitter  dysfunction,  speci fi cally  dysfunction  of  the neurotransmitter dopamine. Th is  hypothesis is based on the discovery that agents that diminish dopaminergic activity also reduce the acute signs and symptoms of psychosis, especially agitation, anxiety, and hallucinations. Drugs that a ff ect dopaminergic function by blocking dopamine receptors, especially D2 and D4 receptors, have demonstrated the ability to improve a  variety  of  psychotic  symptoms,  especially  positive  symptoms. Conventional antipsychotic drugs have broad-spectrum dopamine  receptor-blocking  properties,  a ff ecting  all  dopamine receptor subtypes. As a result, these drugs have signi fi -cant  motor  adverse  e ff ects. Th ese  troubling  adverse  e ff ects include tardive dyskinesia (choreoathetoid movements), akathisia (restlessness), acute dystonia (contraction of skeletal muscles of the neck, mouth, and tongue), and parkinsonism. Some  of  these  e ff ects  diminish  over  time,  but  some  persist even  a ft er  drug  discontinuation.  Concurrent  administration of anticholinergic medication may lessen some of these motor

abnormalities. Acute dystonia resolves with administration of diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Newer antipsychotic  drugs,  also  called atypical antipsychotic  drugs,  have  variable  e ff ects  on  dopamine  receptor subtypes  and  serotonin  receptors,  especially  the  5-HT 2A receptor. Th ese newer drugs appear to be quite e ff ective in relieving the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and have fewer  extrapyramidal  adverse  e ff ects  than  the  traditional drugs (Table 25-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  the  anesthesiologist,  important  e ff ects  of  antipsychotic medications include β -adrenergic blockade causing  postural  hypotension,  prolongation  of  the  QT  interval  potentially  producing  torsade  de  pointes,  seizures,  elevations  in hepatic enzyme levels, abnormal temperature regulation, and sedation.  Drug-induced  sedation  may  decrease  anesthetic requirements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  is  a  rare,  potentially  fatal complication of antipsychotic drug therapy that is presumed to re fl ect dopamine depletion in the central nervous system. Th is syndrome can occur anytime during the course of antipsychotic treatment but o ft en is manifest during the fi rst few weeks of therapy or following an increase in drug dosage. Clinical  manifestations  usually  develop  over  24  to  72  hours  and include hyperpyrexia, severe skeletal muscle rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, autonomic hyperactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac  dysrhythmias),  altered  consciousness,  and  acidosis. Skeletal muscle spasm may be so severe that mechanical ventilation becomes necessary. Renal failure may occur as a result of myoglobinuria and dehydration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  neuroleptic  malignant  syndrome  requires immediate cessation of antipsychotic drug therapy and supportive therapy (ventilation, hydration, cooling). Bromocriptine (5 mg PO every 6 hours) or dantrolene (up to 6 mg/kg daily as a continuous infusion) may decrease skeletal muscle rigidity.  Mortality rates approach 20% in untreated patients, with  death  resulting  from  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  congestive heart  failure,  hypoventilation,  or  renal  failure.  Patients  who have this syndrome are likely to experience a recurrence when treatment with antipsychotic drugs is resumed, so a switch is usually made to a less potent antidopaminergic drug or to an atypical antipsychotic drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because there are similarities between neuroleptic malignant syndrome  and  malignant  hyperthermia,  the  possibility  that patients with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome are vulnerable to developing malignant hyperthermia is an important  issue  to  consider  (see  Table  25-4).  At  the  present  time, there  is  no  evidence  of  a  pathophysiologic  link  between  the two syndromes, and there is no familial pattern or evidence of inheritance in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. However, until any association between neuroleptic malignant syndrome and malignant hyperthermia is clearly disproved, careful metabolic monitoring during general anesthesia is recommended. Note that succinylcholine has been used without problems for ECT in patients with a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

ANXIETY DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anxiety  disorders  are  the  most  prevalent  form  of  psychiatric illness in the general community. Anxiety is de fi ned as a subjective sense of unease, dread, or foreboding. It can be a primary psychiatric illness, a reaction to or a result of a medical  illness,  or  a  medication  side  e ff ect.  Anxiety is  associated with  distressing  symptoms  such  as  nervousness,  insomnia,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypochondriasis,  and  somatic  complaints.  It  is  useful  clinically to consider anxiety disorders as occurring in two di ff erent patterns: (1) generalized anxiety disorder, and (2) episodic, o ft en situation-dependent, anxiety. Th e γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anxiety resulting from identi fi able stresses is usually selflimited and rarely requires pharmacologic treatment. Performance anxiety (stage fright) is a type of situational anxiety that is o ft en treated with β -blockers, which do not produce sedation or allay anxiety but do eliminate the motor and autonomic manifestations of anxiety. Th e presence of unrealistic or excessive worry and apprehension may be cause for drug therapy. Buspirone, a partial 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist, is a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic drug that is not sedating and does not produce  tolerance  or  drug  dependence.  However,  its  slower onset of action (several weeks until full e ff ect is reached) and the need for thrice-daily dosing have limited its use. Short-term and o ft en dramatic relief is a ff orded by almost any benzodiazepine, which is not surprising since these drugs bind to GABA receptors.  Other  drugs  with  GABAergic  properties  such  as gabapentin, pregabalin, and divalproex may also be e ff ective in treating anxiety disorders. Supplemental cognitive-behavioral therapy,  relaxation  techniques,  hypnosis,  and  psychotherapy are also very useful in treating anxiety disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Panic disorders are qualitatively di ff erent from generalized anxiety. Th e patient typically experiences recurrent and unprovoked episodes  of  intense  fear  and  apprehension  associated with physical symptoms and signs such as dyspnea, tachycardia,  diaphoresis, paresthesias, nausea, chest pain, and fear of impending doom or dying. Such episodes can be confused with or indeed caused by certain medical conditions such as angina pectoris,  epilepsy,  pheochromocytoma,  thyrotoxicosis,  hypoglycemia, or cardiac dysrhythmias. Several classes of medications are e ff ective in reducing panic attacks, including SSRIs, benzodiazepines,  cyclic  antidepressants,  and  MAOIs. Th ese drugs have approximately comparable e ffi cacy. Psychotherapy and education increase the e ff ectiveness of drug treatment.

EATING DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Eating  disorders  are  traditionally  classi fi ed  as  anorexia  nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder (Table 25-9). Bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are more common than  anorexia  nervosa.  All  of  these  disorders  are  characterized by serious disturbances in eating (fasting or binging) and excessive concerns about body weight. Eating disorders typically occur in adolescent girls or young women, although 5% to 15% of cases of anorexia nervosa and bulimia and 40% of binge-eating disorders occur in boys and young men.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorexia Nervosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anorexia  nervosa  is  a  relatively  rare  disorder,  with  an  incidence of 5 to 10 cases per 100,000 and a mortality rate of 5% to 10%. Approximately one half of deaths result from medical

<!-- PAGE=? -->
complications associated with malnutrition and the remainder are due to suicide. Th e disease is characterized by a dramatic decrease in food intake and excessive physical activity in the obsessive pursuit of thinness. Bulimic symptoms may be part of  the  syndrome.  Weight  loss  o ft en  exceeds  25%  of  normal body  weight,  but  patients  perceive  that  they  are  still  obese despite this dramatic weight loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Marked,  unexplained  weight  loss  in  adolescent  girls  is  suggestive of anorexia nervosa. Among the more serious medical complications seen in these patients are those that a ff ect the cardiovascular system. Such changes include a decrease in cardiac muscle mass and depressed myocardial contractility. Cardiomyopathy secondary to starvation or to abuse of ipecac (used to induce vomiting) may be present. Sudden death has  been  attributed  to  ventricular  dysrhythmias  presumably re fl ecting the e ff ects of starvation or associated hypokalemia. ECG fi ndings  may  include  low  QRS  amplitude,  nonspeci fi c ST-T wave changes, sinus bradycardia, U waves, and a prolonged QT interval (another possible association with sudden death). Hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia can be present along with metabolic alkalosis from vomiting and laxative and diuretic abuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amenorrhea is o ft en seen in patients with anorexia. Physical  examination  reveals  emaciation,  dry  skin  that  may  be covered with fi ne body hair, and cold, cyanotic extremities. Decreased body temperature, orthostatic  hypotension,  bradycardia, and cardiac dysrhythmias may re fl ect alterations in autonomic nervous system activity. Bone density is decreased as a result of poor nutrition and low estrogen concentrations,

and long bones or vertebrae may fracture as a result of osteoporosis.  Gastric  emptying  may  be  slowed,  which  leads  to complaints of gastric distress a ft er  eating.  In  addition,  starvation may impair cognitive function. Occasionally patients develop  a  fatty  liver  and  altered  results  on  liver  function tests.  Renal  complications  may  re fl ect  long-term  dehydration  resulting  in  damage  to  the  renal  tubules.  Parturient women are at increased risk of delivering low-birth-weight infants. Anorexic patients are o ft en anemic, neutropenic, and thrombocytopenic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  patients  with  anorexia  nervosa  is  complicated by the patient's denial of the condition. Psychopharmacologic treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, and antipsychotic drugs has not been predictably successful. SSRIs that are  e ff ective  in  treating  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  particularly fl uoxetine, may have some value in treating patients with anorexia nervosa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is a paucity of information relating to the management of anesthesia in patients with this eating disorder. Preoperative evaluation is based on the known pathophysiologic e ff ects of starvation. Th e  ECG is useful for detecting evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Electrolyte abnormalities, hypovolemia, and delayed  gastric  emptying  are  important  preanesthetic  considerations. Th e risk of perioperative cardiac dysrhythmias is present. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade and respiratory alkalosis could contribute to the risk of development of dysrhythmias. Experience is too limited to permit recommendations  regarding  speci fi c  anesthetic  drugs,  muscle  relaxants, and anesthetic techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bulimia Nervosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of binge eating (a sense of loss of control over eating), purging, and dietary restriction. Binges are most o ft en triggered by a negative emotional  experience.  Purging  usually  consists  of  self-induced vomiting  that  may  be  facilitated  by  laxatives  and/or  diuretics.  In  most  patients,  this  disorder  is  chronic,  with  relapses and remissions. Depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse commonly accompany bulimia nervosa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Findings on physical examination that suggest the presence of  bulimia  nervosa  are  dry  skin,  evidence  of  dehydration, and  bilateral  painless  hypertrophy  of  the  salivary  glands. Resting  bradycardia  is  o ft en  present. Th e  most  common laboratory fi nding is  an  increased  serum  amylase  concentration,  presumably  of  salivary  gland  origin.  Metabolic alkalosis  secondary  to  purging  is  frequently  seen.  Dental complications  are  common,  especially  enamel  loss  from repeated vomiting and exposure of the lingual surface of the teeth to gastric acid.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  e ff ective  treatment  of  bulimia  nervosa  is  cognitive-behavioral therapy. Pharmacotherapy with tricyclic antidepressants and SSRIs may be helpful. Potassium supplementation may be necessary in the presence of hypokalemia caused by recurrent self-induced vomiting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Binge-Eating Disorder

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Binge-eating disorder resembles bulimia nervosa, but in contrast to patients with bulimia, those with binge-eating disorder do not purge and the periods of dietary restriction are shorter. Th e diagnosis of binge-eating disorder should be suspected in morbidly obese patients, particularly obese patients with continued weight gain or marked weight cycling. Th e disease is chronic and accompanied by weight gain. Like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, this disorder is frequently accompanied  by  depression,  anxiety  disorders,  and  personality disorders. Th e principal medical e ff ects of binge-eating disorder are severe clinical obesity and its associated complications: hypertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  hypercholesterolemia,  and degenerative  joint  disease.  Antidepressant  medications  may be useful for treating those with binge-eating disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SUBSTANCE ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Substance  abuse  may  be  de fi ned  as  self-administration  of drugs that deviates from accepted medical or social use, which, if sustained, can lead to physical and psychologic dependence. Th e incidence of substance abuse and drug-related deaths is high among physicians, especially during the fi rst 5 years a ft er medical  school  graduation.  Dependence  is  diagnosed  when patients  manifest  at  least  three  of  nine  characteristic  symptoms and the symptoms have persisted for at least 1 month or have occurred repeatedly (Table 25-10). Physical dependence develops when the presence of a drug in the body is necessary for normal physiologic function and prevention of withdrawal symptoms.  Typically,  the  withdrawal  syndrome  consists  of a  rebound in the physiologic systems modi fi ed by the drug. Tolerance  is  a  state  in  which  tissues  become  accustomed  to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
543

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the presence of a drug so that increased dosages of that drug become necessary to produce e ff ects similar to those experienced  initially  with  smaller  dosages.  Substance  abusers  can manifest  cross-tolerance  to  drugs,  which  makes  it  di ffi cult to  predict  analgesic  or  anesthetic  requirements.  Most  o ft en, long-term substance abuse results in increased analgesic and anesthetic requirements, whereas additive or even synergistic e ff ects may occur in the presence of acute substance abuse. It is important to recognize the signs of drug withdrawal during the perioperative period. Certainly, a detoxi fi cation program should not be attempted during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Substance abuse is o ft en fi rst suspected or recognized during the medical management of other conditions, such as hepatitis,  acquired  immunode fi ciency  syndrome, and pregnancy. Patients almost always have a concomitant personality disorder and may display antisocial traits. Sociopathic characteristics (school dropout, criminal record, abuse of multiple drugs) seem to predispose to, rather than result from, drug addiction. Approximately 50% of patients admitted to hospitals with factitious disorders are drug abusers, as are some patients with chronic pain. Psychiatric consultation is recommended in all cases of substance abuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug overdose is the leading cause of unconsciousness in patients brought to emergency departments. O ft en more than one class of drug as well as some alcohol has been ingested. Conditions  other  than  drug  overdose  may  result  in  unconsciousness,  which  emphasizes  the  importance  of  laboratory testing (electrolyte levels, blood glucose concentration, arterial blood gas analysis, renal and liver function tests) to con fi rm the diagnosis. Th e depth of central nervous system depression can be estimated based on the response to painful stimulation, activity of the gag re fl ex, presence or absence of hypotension, respiratory rate, and size and responsiveness of the pupils.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless of the drug(s) ingested, the manifestations are similar.  Assessment  and  treatment  proceed  simultaneously. Th e fi rst step is to secure the airway and support ventilation and circulation. Absence of a gag re fl ex is con fi rmatory evidence that protective laryngeal re fl exes are dangerously depressed. In this situation, a cu ff ed endotracheal tube should be placed to protect the lungs from aspiration. Body temperature is monitored,  since  hypothermia  frequently  accompanies  unconsciousness as a result of drug overdose. Decisions to attempt removal of ingested substances (gastric lavage, forced diuresis, hemodialysis)  depend  on  the  drug  ingested,  the  time  since ingestion,  and  the  degree  of  central  nervous  system  depression.  Gastric  lavage  may  be  bene fi cial  if  less  than  4  hours have elapsed since ingestion. Gastric lavage or pharmacologic stimulation of emesis is not recommended when the ingested substances are hydrocarbons or corrosive materials or when protective laryngeal re fl exes are not intact. A ft er gastric lavage or emesis, activated charcoal can be administered to adsorb any drug remaining in the gastrointestinal tract. Hemodialysis may be considered when potentially fatal doses of drugs have been ingested, when there is progressive deterioration of cardiovascular function, or when normal routes of metabolism and excretion are impaired. Treatment with hemodialysis is of little value when the ingested drugs are highly protein bound or are avidly stored in tissues because of high lipid solubility.

Alcohol

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alcoholism  is  de fi ned  as  a  primary  chronic  disease  whose development  and  manifestations  are  in fl uenced  by  genetic, psychosocial,  and  environmental  factors.  Alcoholism  a ff ects at least 10 million Americans and is responsible for 200,000 deaths annually. Up to one third of adult patients have medical problems related to alcohol (Table 25-11). Th e diagnosis of alcoholism requires a high index of suspicion combined with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
544

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nonspeci fi c but suggestive symptoms such as gastritis, tremor, history  of  falling,  or  unexplained  episodes  of  amnesia. Th e possibility of alcoholism is o ft en overlooked in the elderly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Male  gender  and  family  history  of  alcohol  abuse  are  the two major risk factors for alcoholism. Adoption studies indicate that male children of alcoholic parents are more likely to become alcoholic, even when raised by nonalcoholic adoptive parents. Other forms of psychiatric disease such as depression and sociopathy are not increased in the children of alcoholic parents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although alcohol appears to produce widespread nonspeci fi c e ff ects on cell membranes, there is evidence that many of its neurologic e ff ects are mediated by actions at receptors for the  inhibitory  neurotransmitter  GABA.  When  GABA  binds to  receptors,  it  causes  chloride  channels  in  the  receptors  to open, which hyperpolarizes the neurons and makes the occurrence of depolarization less likely. Alcohol appears to increase GABA-mediated chloride ion conductance. A shared site of action  for  alcohol,  benzodiazepines,  and  barbiturates  would be consistent with the ability of these di ff erent classes of drugs to produce cross-tolerance and cross-dependence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of alcoholism mandates total abstinence from alcohol.  Disul fi ram may be administered  as  an  adjunctive  drug along with psychiatric counseling. Th e unpleasantness of the symptoms that accompany alcohol ingestion in the presence of disul fi ram ( fl ushing, vertigo, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting) is intended to serve as a deterrent to the urge to drink. Th ese symptoms re fl ect the accumulation of acetaldehyde from oxidation of alcohol, which cannot be further oxidized because of  disul fi ram-induced inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity.  Adherence  to  long-term  disul fi ram therapy is o ft en poor, and this drug has not been documented to have advantages  over  placebo  for  achieving  total  alcohol  abstinence. Medical  contraindications  to  disul fi ram  use  include  pregnancy,  cardiac  dysfunction,  hepatic  dysfunction,  renal  dysfunction, and peripheral neuropathy. Emergency treatment of an  alcohol-disul fi ram interaction  includes  intravenous  infusion  of  crystalloids  and,  occasionally,  transient  maintenance of systemic blood pressure with vasopressors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e intoxicating e ff ects of alcohol parallel its blood concentration. In patients who are not alcoholics, blood alcohol levels of 25 mg/dL are associated with impaired cognition and coordination. At blood alcohol concentrations higher than 100 mg/ dL, signs of vestibular and cerebellar dysfunction (nystagmus, dysarthria, ataxia) are likely. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction may result in hypotension, hypothermia, stupor, and coma.  Intoxication  with  alcohol  is  o ft en  de fi ned  as  a  blood alcohol concentration of more than 80 to 100 mg/dL, and levels above 500 mg/dL are usually fatal as a result of respiratory depression.  Long-term  tolerance  from  prolonged  excessive alcohol ingestion may cause alcoholic patients to remain sober despite  potentially  fatal  blood  alcohol  concentrations. Th e critical aspect of treating life-threatening alcohol overdose is maintenance of ventilation. Hypoglycemia may be profound if  excessive  alcohol  consumption  is  associated  with  food deprivation. It must be appreciated that other central nervous system-depressant  drugs  are  o ft en  ingested  simultaneously with alcohol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physiologic  dependence  on  alcohol  produces  a  withdrawal syndrome  when  the  drug  is  discontinued  or  when  there  is decreased intake.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  earliest  and  most  common alcohol  withdrawal  syndrome is  characterized  by  generalized  tremors  that  may  be accompanied by perceptual disturbances (nightmares, hallucinations), autonomic nervous system hyperactivity (tachycardia,  hypertension,  cardiac  dysrhythmias),  nausea,  vomiting, insomnia,  and  mild  confusional  states  with  agitation. Th ese symptoms usually begin within 6 to 8 hours a ft er a substantial decrease in blood alcohol concentration and are typically most pronounced at 24 to 36 hours. Th ese  withdrawal  symptoms can be suppressed by the resumption of alcohol ingestion or by administration of benzodiazepines, β -blockers, or α 2 -agonists. In clinical situations, diazepam is usually administered to produce sedation. A β -blocker is added if tachycardia is present. Th e  ability  of  sympatholytic  drugs  to  attenuate  these  symptoms suggests a role for autonomic nervous system hyperactivity in the etiology of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately 5% of patients experiencing alcohol withdrawal syndrome exhibit delirium tremens, a  life-threatening medical emergency. Delirium tremens occurs 2 to 4 days a ft er the cessation of alcohol ingestion and manifests as hallucinations,  combativeness,  hyperthermia,  tachycardia,  hypertension  or  hypotension,  and  grand  mal  seizures.  Treatment  of delirium tremens must be aggressive, with administration of diazepam (5 to 10 mg IV every 5 minutes) or another benzodiazepine until the patient becomes sedated but remains awake. Administration of β -blockers such as propranolol and esmolol is  useful to suppress manifestations of sympathetic hyperactivity. Th e  goal  of β -blocker therapy is to decrease the heart rate to less than 100 beats per minute. Protection of the airway with a cu ff ed endotracheal tube is necessary in some patients. Correction of fl uid, electrolyte (magnesium, potassium), and metabolic (thiamine) derangements is also important. Lidocaine is usually e ff ective if dysrhythmias occur despite correction  of  electrolyte  abnormalities.  Physical  restraints  may  be necessary to decrease the risk of self-injury or injury to others. Even with aggressive treatment, mortality from delirium tremens is approximately 10%, principally resulting from hypotension, dysrhythmias, or seizures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wernicke-Korsako ff syndrome re fl ects  a  loss  of  neurons in  the  cerebellum  ( Wernicke's  encephalopathy )  and  a  loss  of memory  ( Korsako ff 's  psychosis )  resulting  from  the  lack  of thiamine (vitamin B 1 ),  which  is  required  for  the  intermediary  metabolism  of  carbohydrates. Th is  syndrome  is  not  an alcohol withdrawal syndrome, but its occurrence establishes that a patient is, or has been, physically dependent on alcohol.

In addition to ataxia and memory loss, many patients exhibit global confusional states, drowsiness, nystagmus, and orthostatic hypotension. An associated peripheral polyneuropathy is almost always present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Wernicke-Korsako ff syndrome  consists  of intravenous administration of thiamine, with normal dietary intake  when  possible.  Because  carbohydrate  loads  may  precipitate  this  syndrome in thiamine-depleted patients, it may be useful to administer thiamine before initiation of glucose infusions in malnourished or alcoholic patients.

Alcohol crosses the placenta and may result in decreased infant birth weight. High blood alcohol concentrations (>150 mg/dL) may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, characterized by craniofacial dysmorphology, growth retardation, and mental retardation. Th e incidence of cardiac malformations, including patent ductus arteriosus and septal defects, is increased in the children of alcoholic mothers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  being  treated  with disul fi ram should consider the potential presence of disul fi ram-induced  sedation  and  hepatotoxicity.  Decreased drug requirements could re fl ect additive e ff ects from co-existing sedation or the ability of disul fi ram to inhibit metabolism of drugs other than alcohol. For example, disul fi ram may potentiate the e ff ects of benzodiazepines. Acute, unexplained hypotension during general anesthesia could re fl ect inadequate stores of norepinephrine as a result of disul fi ram-induced inhibition of dopamine β -hydroxylase. Th is hypotension might respond to  ephedrine,  but  direct-acting  sympathomimetics  such  as phenylephrine  produce  a  more  predictable  response  in  the presence of norepinephrine depletion. Use of regional anesthesia may be in fl uenced by the presence of   disul fi ram-induced or alcohol-induced polyneuropathy. Alcohol-  containing solutions, such as those used for skin   cleansing, should probably be avoided in disul fi ram-treated patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cocaine

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cocaine  use  for  nonmedical  purposes  is  a  public  health problem with important economic and social consequences. Myths associated with cocaine abuse are that the drug is sexually stimulating, nonaddictive, and physiologically benign. In fact, cocaine is highly addictive. Casual use is not possible once addiction occurs, and life-threatening adverse e ff ects accompany cocaine use. Cocaine produces sympathetic stimulation by  blocking  the  presynaptic  uptake  of  norepinephrine  and dopamine, and thereby increases the postsynaptic concentrations of these neurotransmitters. Because of this e ff ect, dopamine  is  present  in  high  concentrations  in  synapses,  which produces the characteristic "cocaine high."

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  cocaine  administration  has  been  known  to  cause coronary vasospasm, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction,  and  ventricular  dysrhythmias,  including  ventricular fi brillation. Associated systemic hypertension and tachycardia further  increase  myocardial  oxygen  requirements  at  a  time when coronary oxygen delivery is decreased by the e ff ects of cocaine on coronary blood fl ow. Cocaine use can cause myocardial ischemia and hypotension that lasts as long as 6 weeks a ft er discontinuation of cocaine use. Th e excessive sensitivity of the coronary vasculature to catecholamines a ft er long-term exposure to cocaine may be due in part to cocaine-induced depletion of dopamine stores. Lung damage and pulmonary edema have been observed  in  patients  who  smoke  cocaine. Cocaine-abusing parturient women are at higher risk of spontaneous abortion, abruptio placentae, and fetal malformations. Cocaine causes a dose-dependent decrease in uterine blood fl ow. It may also produce hyperpyrexia, which can contribute to seizures. Th ere is a temporal relationship between the recreational use of cocaine and cerebrovascular accidents. Longterm  cocaine  abuse  is  associated  with  nasal  septal  atrophy, agitated behavior, paranoid thinking, and heightened re fl exes. Symptoms associated with cocaine withdrawal include fatigue, depression, and increased appetite. Death due to cocaine use has  occurred  with  all  routes  of  administration  (intranasal, oral,  intravenous,  inhalational)  and  is  usually  due  to  apnea, seizures,  or  cardiac  dysrhythmias.  Persons  with  decreased plasma cholinesterase activity (elderly individuals, parturient women, those with severe liver disease) may be at risk of sudden death when using cocaine, because this enzyme is essential for metabolizing the drug.

Cocaine overdose evokes overwhelming sympathetic stimulation of the cardiovascular system. Uncontrolled hypertension  may  result  in  pulmonary  and  cerebral  edema,  and  the e ff ects  of  increased  circulating  catecholamines  may  include coronary artery vasoconstriction, coronary artery vasospasm, and platelet aggregation, all of which can lead to myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  cocaine  overdose  includes  administration  of nitroglycerin to manage  myocardial ischemia. Although esmolol has been recommended for treating the tachycardia caused by cocaine overdose, there is evidence that β -blockade can  accentuate  cocaine-induced  coronary  artery  vasospasm. α -Adrenergic blockade is  quite  e ff ective  in  the  treatment  of coronary vasoconstriction caused by cocaine. Administration of intravenous benzodiazepines such as diazepam is e ff ective in controlling seizures associated with cocaine toxicity. Active cooling may be necessary if hyperthermia is signi fi cant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients acutely intoxicated with cocaine  must  consider  the  vulnerability  of  these  patients  to myocardial  ischemia  and  dysrhythmias.  Any  event  or  drug likely to increase already enhanced sympathetic activity must be  avoided.  It  seems  prudent  to  have  nitroglycerin  readily available to treat signs of myocardial ischemia associated with tachycardia  or  hypertension.  Increased  anesthetic  requirements may be present in acutely intoxicated  patients,  which presumably  re fl ects  increased  concentrations  of  catecholamines  in  the  central  nervous  system. Th rombocytopenia

associated with cocaine abuse may in fl uence the selection of regional anesthesia. Unexpected agitation during the postoperative period may re fl ect the e ff ects of cocaine ingestion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  acute  intoxication,  long-term  abuse  of cocaine  has  not  been  shown  to  be  associated  with  adverse anesthetic interactions, although the possibility of cardiac dysrhythmias remains a constant concern. Th e rapid metabolism of  cocaine  probably decreases the likelihood that an acutely intoxicated patient will come to the operating room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of topical cocaine for medically indicated purposes  followed  by  administration  of  a  volatile  anesthetic that  sensitizes  the  myocardium  may  exaggerate  the  cardiacstimulating e ff ects of cocaine. Cocaine use for medically indicated purposes should be avoided in patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease and in patients receiving drugs that potentiate the e ff ects of catecholamines, such as MAOIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioids

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Contrary to common speculation, opioid dependence rarely develops from the use of these drugs to treat acute postoperative  pain.  It  is  possible  to  become  addicted  to  opioids  in less than 14 days, however, if the drug is administered daily in ever-increasing dosages. Opioids are abused orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously for their euphoric and analgesic e ff ects. Numerous  medical  problems  are  encountered  in  patients addicted to opioids, especially those who take the drugs intravenously (Table 25-12). Evidence of these medical problems in  patients  addicted  to  opioids  should  be  sought  during  the preoperative  evaluation.  Tolerance  may  develop  to  some  of the  e ff ects  of  opioids  (analgesia,  sedation,  emesis,  euphoria, hypoventilation) but not to others (miosis, constipation). Fortunately, as tolerance increases, so does the lethal dose of the opioid.  In  general,  there  is  a  high  degree  of  cross-tolerance among drugs with morphinelike actions, although tolerance wanes rapidly when opioids are withdrawn.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  obvious  manifestation  of  overdose  of  an  opioid (usually heroin) is a slow breathing rate with an increased tidal volume. Pupils are typically miotic, although mydriasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
may occur if  hypoventilation  results  in  severe  hypoxemia. Central nervous system manifestations range from dysphoria  to  unconsciousness.  Seizures  are  unlikely.  Pulmonary edema occurs in a large proportion of patients with heroin overdose. Th e  cause  of  this  pulmonary  edema  is  poorly understood, but hypoxemia, hypotension, neurogenic mechanisms, drug-related pulmonary endothelial damage, or the e ff ects  of  other  materials  (contaminants)  injected  with  the heroin  may  be  responsible.  Gastric  atony  is  a  predictable accompaniment of acute opioid overdose. Fatal opioid overdose is most o ft en an outcome of fl uctuations in the purity of street products or the combination of opioids with other central nervous system depressants. Naloxone is the speci fi c opioid  antagonist  administered  to  maintain  an  acceptable respiratory rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although withdrawal from opioids is rarely life threatening, it is unpleasant and may complicate management during the perioperative  period.  In  this  regard,  it  is  useful  to  consider the time to onset, peak intensity, and duration of withdrawal symptoms a ft er  abrupt  withdrawal  of  opioids.  Opioid  withdrawal  symptoms  develop  within  seconds  a ft er  intravenous administration of naloxone. Conversely, it is usually possible to abort the withdrawal syndrome by reinstituting administration of the abused opioid or by substituting methadone (2.5 mg equivalent  to  10  mg  of  morphine).  Clonidine  may  also attenuate opioid withdrawal symptoms, presumably by replacing  opioid-mediated  inhibition  with α 2 -agonist-mediated inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system in the brain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioid  withdrawal  symptoms  include  manifestations  of excess  sympathetic  activity,  such  as  diaphoresis,  mydriasis, hypertension, and tachycardia. Craving for the drug and anxiety  are  followed  by  yawning,  lacrimation,  rhinorrhea, piloerection (origin of the term cold turkey ), tremors, skeletal muscle and bone discomfort, and anorexia. Insomnia, abdominal  cramps,  diarrhea,  and  hyperthermia  may  also  develop. Skeletal muscle spasms and jerking of the legs (origin of the term kicking the habit )  follow, and cardiovascular collapse is possible. Seizures are rare, and their occurrence should raise suspicion  of  other  causes  of  seizures,  such  as  unrecognized barbiturate withdrawal or underlying epilepsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rapid opioid detoxi fi cation using high doses of an opioid antagonist (nalmefene) administered during general anesthesia  followed  by  naltrexone  maintenance  has  been  proposed as  a  cost-e ff ective  alternative  to  conventional  detoxi fi cation approaches. Th ere  is  evidence  that  opioid  withdrawal,  primarily involving the locus caeruleus, peaks and then recovers to  near  baseline  within  4  to  6  hours  a ft er  administration  of high doses of opioid antagonists. Subsequent administration of naloxone to patients who have undergone rapid detoxi fi cation under general anesthesia should produce no evidence of opioid withdrawal, which con fi rms that rapid opioid detoxi fi -cation has been achieved. Unlike in conventional detoxi fi cation accomplished by the gradual tapering of opioid doses, the unpleasant aspects of opioid withdrawal are compressed into a

few hours, during which time the patient is anesthetized. Th is is thought to contribute to an increased success rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Profound  increases  in  serum  catecholamine  concentrations  during  anesthesia-assisted  opioid  detoxi fi cation  have been described, manifesting as changes in systolic blood pressure  and  tachycardia.  Previous  administration  of  clonidine may blunt these  changes.  During  anesthesia,  manifestations of sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity may be treated with pharmacologic interventions such as administration of β -blockers. Deep general anesthesia with skeletal muscle paralysis  and  controlled  ventilation  is  recommended.  Although general  anesthesia  seems  to  be  safely  tolerated  during  rapid opioid  detoxi fi cation,  there  is  some  concern  regarding  the occurrence of cardiac dysrhythmias (prolonged QT interval) and postoperative mortality. Naltrexone is o ft en administered in the postanesthesia care unit along with adjunctive medications such as midazolam, ketorolac, and clonidine. Th e occurrence  of  mild  to  moderate  withdrawal  symptoms  for  3  to  4 days a ft er rapid opioid detoxi fi cation is expected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Buprenorphine  is  a  semisynthetic  alkaloid  derived  from brain  tissue.  It  is  a  long-acting,  lipid-soluble,  mixed  µ  agonist-antagonist opioid. Continued interest in buprenorphine has been attributed to its unique pharmacologic e ff ects. It is a  partial  µ  opioid  agonist  having  moderate  intrinsic  activity, with high a ffi nity to and slow dissociation from µ opioid receptors. Buprenorphine has a very low abuse potential and has become a widely used therapeutic agent in patients with opioid dependence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacotherapy  for  opioid  dependence  has  included  µ opiate  agonists,  such  as  methadone  and  levomethadyl,  and partial  agonists.  Levomethadyl  is  a  congener  of  methadone that is biotransformed to active metabolites with long durations of action. Th e  advantage of levomethadyl over methadone is the option for every other day dosing. Buprenorphine has pharmacodynamic e ff ects very similar to those of typical opioid agonists such as morphine and heroin. Buprenorphine is an e ff ective intervention for use in the maintenance treatment of heroin dependence. However, if used as the sole drug, it appears to o ff er no advantages over methadone. Buprenorphine-carbamazepine,  however,  may  be  more  e ff ective  than methadone-carbamazepine  in  detoxi fi cation strategies for patients addicted to opioids who also abuse other drugs. Th e U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the marketing of buprenorphine in sublingual tablets or liquids containing buprenorphine alone (Subutex) or in combination with  naloxone  (Suboxone)  for  treatment  of  opioid  dependence. Th e  naloxone  is  added  to  the  compound  to  prevent patients  from  dissolving  the  pills  and  then  injecting  them intravenously. If they do this, they will experience withdrawal symptoms. Buprenorphine may also have a ceiling e ff ect that is  useful  in  controlling opioid dependence. Th e  FDA reclassi fi ed buprenorphine from a Schedule V drug to a Schedule III  drug. Th is  imposed the regulatory controls and criminal sanctions of a Schedule III narcotic on those persons who handle  buprenorphine  or  buprenorphine-containing  products. Schedule III substances by de fi nition have less abuse potential than  substances  in  Schedules  I  and  II,  including  morphine or fentanyl. Methadone is a schedule II drug. Because of the pharmacology of buprenorphine, transfer from methadone to buprenorphine may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e unique pharmacologic properties of buprenorphine, with its high patient acceptance, favorable safety profi le,  and  ease  of  administration,  should  facilitate  its  use  in the  treatment  of  opioid  dependence.  Opiate  detoxi fi cation with buprenorphine occurs with a minimum of discomfort. Detoxi fi cation occurs without the fatigue, sweats, unpleasant tactile sensations, aches, seizures, and confused thought processes common during traditional detoxi fi cation procedures. Buprenorphine 8 to 12 mg is roughly equivalent to 35 to 60 mg of oral methadone. Buprenorphine can be used to treat pregnant addicted patients. However, it is secreted in breast milk and should not be used by nursing mothers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recent  comparisons  of  rapid  opioid  detoxi fi cation  with naltrexone  under  general  anesthesia  and  buprenorphineassisted detoxi fi cation indicate that there are more potentially life-threatening complications with rapid detoxi fi cation under general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  addicted  to  opioids,  the  opioids  or  methadone should be maintained during the perioperative period. Preoperative  medication may also include an opioid. Opioid agonist-antagonist drugs are not recommended for perioperative use because they can precipitate acute withdrawal reactions. Th ere is  no  advantage to trying to maintain anesthesia with opioids,  since  dosages  greatly  in  excess  of  normal  are  likely to  be  required.  Furthermore, long-term opioid  use  leads  to cross-tolerance to other central nervous system depressants. Th is may manifest as a decreased analgesic e ff ect from inhaled anesthetics or nitrous oxide. Conversely, acute opioid administration decreases anesthetic  requirements.  Maintenance  of anesthesia  is  most  o ft en  accomplished  with  a  volatile  anesthetic. Th ere  is  a  tendency  for  perioperative  hypotension  to occur,  which  may  re fl ect  inadequate  intravascular fl uid  volume secondary  to  chronic  infection,  fever,  malnutrition,  or adrenocortical  insu ffi ciency.  Chronic  liver  disease  may  be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of  anesthesia  in  patients  rehabilitated  from opioid addiction and in patients receiving agonist-antagonist therapy  o ft en  includes  a  volatile  anesthetic.  Regional  anesthesia  may have a role in some patients, but it is important to  remember  the  tendency  for  hypotension  to  occur,  the increased incidence of positive results on serologic testing for HIV, the occasional presence of peripheral neuritis, and the rare occurrence of transverse myelitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients addicted to opioids o ft en seem to experience exaggerated  degrees  of  postoperative  pain.  For  reasons  that  are not  clear,  satisfactory  postoperative  analgesia  may  o ft en  be achieved when average doses of meperidine are administered in addition to the usual daily maintenance dose of methadone or other opioid. Methadone and buprenorphine have minimal analgesic activity with respect to management of postoperative

pain, so they are typically administered in addition to other opioids  for  postoperative  analgesia.  Alternative  methods  of postoperative  pain  relief  include  continuous  regional  anesthesia with local anesthetics, neuraxial opioid analgesia, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Barbiturates

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term  barbiturate  abuse  is  not  associated  with  major pathophysiologic  changes. Th ese  drugs  are  most  commonly abused  orally  to  produce  euphoria,  to  counter  insomnia, and to antagonize the stimulant e ff ects of other drugs. Th ere is  tolerance  to  most  of  the  actions  of  these  drugs  as  well  as cross-tolerance to other central nervous system depressants. Although  the  barbiturate  doses  required  to  produce  sedative  or  euphoric  e ff ects  increase  rapidly,  lethal  doses  do  not increase at the same rate or to the same magnitude. Th us, the margin of error for individuals who abuse barbiturates, in contrast to that for those who abuse opioids or alcohol, decreases as barbiturate doses are increased to achieve the desired e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central nervous system depression is the principal manifestation  of  barbiturate  overdose.  Barbiturate  blood  levels  correspond to the degree of central nervous system depression (slurred  speech,  ataxia,  irritability),  with  excessively  high blood levels resulting in loss of pharyngeal and deep tendon re fl exes  and  the  onset  of  coma.  No  speci fi c  pharmacologic antagonist  exists  to  reverse  barbiturate-induced  central  nervous system depression, and the use of nonspeci fi c stimulants is not encouraged. Depression of ventilation may be profound. Maintenance of a patent airway, protection from aspiration, and support of ventilation using a cu ff ed  endotracheal  tube may  be  necessary.  Barbiturate  overdose  may  be  associated with  hypotension  because  of  central  vasomotor  depression, direct  myocardial  depression,  and  increased  venous  capacitance. Th is  hypotension  usually  responds  to fl uid  infusion, although  occasionally  vasopressors  or  inotropic  drugs  are required. Hypothermia is frequent. Acute renal failure resulting from hypotension and rhabdomyolysis may occur. Forced diuresis and alkalinization of the urine promote elimination of phenobarbital but are of lesser value for many of the other barbiturates. Induced emesis or gastric lavage followed by administration of activated charcoal may be helpful in awake patients who ingested barbiturates less than 6 hours previously.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  contrast  to  opioid  withdrawal,  the  abrupt  cessation  of excessive  barbiturate  ingestion  is  associated  with  potentially life-threatening responses. Th e time of onset, peak intensity, and  duration  of  symptoms  of  withdrawal  from  barbiturates are  delayed  compared  with  those  for  opioids  (Table  25-13). Barbiturate withdrawal manifests initially as anxiety, skeletal muscle  tremors,  hyperre fl exia,  diaphoresis,  tachycardia,  and orthostatic hypotension. Cardiovascular collapse and hyperthermia may occur. Th e most serious problem associated with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
barbiturate  withdrawal  is  the  occurrence  of  grand  mal  seizures. Seizures are likely to be caused by an abrupt decrease in  the  circulating  concentration  of  the  barbiturate.  Many  of the manifestations of barbiturate withdrawal, particularly seizures, are di ffi cult to abort once they develop. Pentobarbital may  be  administered  to  treat  barbiturate  withdrawal.  Typically, the initial oral dose is 200 to 400 mg, with subsequent doses titrated to e ff ect. Phenobarbital and diazepam may also be useful for suppressing evidence of barbiturate withdrawal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  there  are  few  data  concerning  management  of anesthesia in patients who habitually abuse barbiturates, it is predictable  that  cross-tolerance  to  the  depressant  e ff ects  of anesthetic drugs occurs. Anecdotal reports describe the need for increased barbiturate doses for induction of anesthesia in long-term barbiturate abusers. Although acute administration of barbiturates has been shown to decrease anesthetic requirements,  there  are  no  reports  of  increased  anesthetic  requirements in long-term barbiturate abusers. Long-term barbiturate abuse  leads  to  induction  of  hepatic  microsomal  enzymes, which introduces the potential for drug interactions with concomitantly administered medications (warfarin, digitalis, phenytoin, volatile anesthetics). Venous access is a likely problem in patients who abuse intravenous barbiturates, since the alkalinity of the self-injected solutions is likely to sclerose veins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benzodiazepines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benzodiazepine addiction requires ingestion of large dosages of drug. As with barbiturates, tolerance and physical dependence occur with long-term benzodiazepine abuse. Benzodiazepines do not signi fi cantly induce microsomal enzymes. Symptoms of withdrawal generally occur later than with barbiturates and are less severe because of the prolonged elimination half-lives of most benzodiazepines and the fact that many of these drugs are metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites that also have prolonged elimination half-lives. Anesthetic considerations in patients who habitually abuse benzodiazepines are similar to those described for patients who abuse barbiturates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute benzodiazepine overdose is much less likely to  produce ventilatory depression than barbiturate overdose. It must be recognized, however, that the combination of benzodiazepines and other central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol, has proved to be life threatening. Supportive treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
usually  su ffi ces  for  treatment  of  a  benzodiazepine  overdose. Flumazenil, a speci fi c benzodiazepine antagonist, is useful for managing severe or life-threatening overdose. Seizure activity suppressed by benzodiazepines could be unmasked by administration of fl umazenil.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amphetamines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amphetamines stimulate the release of catecholamines, which results in increased alertness, appetite suppression, and decreased need for sleep. Approved medical uses of amphetamines are treatment of narcolepsy, attention-de fi cit disorders, signi fi cant depression, and hyperactivity associated with minimal brain dysfunction in children. Tolerance to the appetitesuppressant  e ff ects  of  amphetamines  develops  within  a  few weeks, which makes these drugs poor substitutes for proper dieting techniques. Physiologic dependence on amphetamines is profound, and dosages may be increased to several hundred times  the  therapeutic  dosage.  Long-term  abuse  of  amphetamines results in depletion of body stores of catecholamines. Such depletion may manifest as somnolence and anxiety or a psychotic state. Other physiologic abnormalities reported with long-term amphetamine abuse include hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmias,  and  malnutrition.  Amphetamines  are  most o ft en  abused  orally  but,  in  the  case  of  methamphetamine, abuse is via the intravenous route.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amphetamine overdose causes anxiety, a psychotic state, and progressive central nervous system irritability manifesting as hyperactivity, hyperre fl exia, and occasionally seizures. Other physiologic  e ff ects  include  hypertension  and  tachycardia, dysrhythmias,  decreased  gastrointestinal  motility,  mydriasis, diaphoresis, and hyperthermia. Metabolic imbalances such as dehydration, lactic acidosis, and ketosis may occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of oral amphetamine overdose includes induced emesis  or  gastric  lavage  followed  by  administration  of  activated charcoal and a cathartic. Phenothiazines may antagonize many of the acute central nervous system e ff ects of amphetamines.  Similarly,  diazepam  may  be  useful  for  controlling amphetamine-induced  seizures.  Acidi fi cation  of  the  urine promotes elimination of amphetamines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abrupt  cessation  of  amphetamine  use  is  accompanied  by extreme lethargy, depression that may be suicidal, an increased appetite,  and  weight  gain.  Benzodiazepines  are  useful  in  the management of withdrawal if sedation is needed, and β -blockers may  be  administered  to  control  sympathetic  nervous  system  hyperactivity.  Postamphetamine  depression  may  last  for months and may require treatment with antidepressant drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic doses of amphetamines that have been administered  long  term  for  medically  indicated  uses  (narcolepsy, attention-de fi cit  disorder)  need  not  be  discontinued  before elective surgery. Patients who require emergency surgery and who are acutely intoxicated from ingestion of amphetamines may  exhibit  hypertension,  tachycardia,  hyperthermia,  and increased requirements for volatile anesthetics. Intraoperative intracranial hypertension and cardiac arrest have been attributed  to  amphetamine  abuse.  In  animals, acute intravenous administration of dextroamphetamine produces dose-related increases  in  body  temperature  and  anesthetic  requirements. For these reasons, it is prudent to monitor body temperature during  the  perioperative  period. Long-term amphetamine abuse may be associated with markedly decreased anesthetic requirements, presumably as a result of catecholamine depletion in the central nervous system. Refractory hypotension can re fl ect depletion of catecholamine stores. Direct-acting vasopressors,  including  phenylephrine  and  epinephrine,  should be  available  to  treat  hypotension,  because  the  response  to indirect-acting vasopressors such as ephedrine may be attenuated  by  the  amphetamine-induced  catecholamine  depletion. Intraoperative  monitoring of blood pressure using an intraarterial catheter should be considered. Postoperatively, there is  the  potential  for  orthostatic  hypotension  once  the  patient begins to ambulate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hallucinogens

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hallucinogens,  as  represented  by  lysergic  acid  diethylamide  (LSD)  and  phencyclidine,  are  usually  ingested  orally. Although there is a high degree of psychologic dependence, there  is  no  evidence  of  physical  dependence  or  withdrawal symptoms when LSD is abruptly discontinued. Long-term use of hallucinogens is unlikely. Th e e ff ects of these drugs develop within  1  to  2  hours  and  last  8  to  12  hours. Th ey  consist  of visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations and distortions of the surroundings and body image. Th e ability of the brain to suppress  relatively  unimportant  stimuli  is  impaired  by  LSD. Evidence of sympathetic nervous system stimulation includes mydriasis,  increased  body  temperature,  hypertension,  and tachycardia. Tolerance to the behavioral e ff ects of LSD occurs rapidly, whereas tolerance to the cardiovascular e ff ects is less pronounced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overdose of LSD has not been associated with death, although patients may experience unrecognized injuries, which re fl ects the intrinsic analgesic e ff ects of the drug. On rare occasions, LSD produces seizures and apnea. It can lead to an acute panic reaction  characterized  by  hyperactivity,  mood  lability,  and, in  extreme cases, overt psychosis. Patients should be placed in a calm, quiet environment with minimal external stimuli. No speci fi c antidote exists, although benzodiazepines may be useful  for  controlling  agitation  and  anxiety  reactions.  Supportive care in the form of airway management, mechanical ventilation, treatment of seizures, and control of the manifestations of sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity may be needed.  Forced  diuresis  and  acidi fi cation  of  the  urine  promotes  elimination  of  phencyclidine  but  also  introduces  the

risk of fl uid overload and electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia  and  surgery  have  been  reported  to  precipitate panic  responses  in  these  patients.  If  such  an  event  occurs, midazolam  or  diazepam  is  likely  to  be  a  useful  treatment. Exaggerated responses to sympathomimetic drugs are likely. Th e analgesia and ventilatory-depressant e ff ects of opioids are prolonged by LSD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Marijuana

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Marijuana  is  usually  abused  via  smoking,  which  leads  to higher bioavailability of the primary psychoactive component, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than with oral ingestion. Inhalation  of  marijuana smoke produces euphoria, with signs of increased sympathetic nervous system activity and decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity. Th e most consistent cardiac change is an increased resting heart rate. Orthostatic hypotension  may  occur.  Long-term  marijuana  abuse  leads to  increased  tar  deposits  in  the  lungs,  impaired  pulmonary defense mechanisms, and decreased pulmonary function. An increased incidence of sinusitis and bronchitis is likely. In predisposed persons, marijuana may evoke seizures. Conjunctival reddening is evidence of vasodilation. Drowsiness is a common side e ff ect. Tolerance to most of the psychoactive e ff ects of  THC  has  been  observed.  Although  physical  dependence on marijuana is not believed to occur, abrupt cessation a ft er long-term use is characterized by mild withdrawal symptoms, such as  irritability,  insomnia,  diaphoresis,  nausea,  vomiting, and diarrhea. Th e one medical use for marijuana is as an antiemetic in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pharmacologic  e ff ects  of  inhaled  THC  occur  within minutes  but  rarely  persist  longer  than  2  to  3  hours,  which decreases the likelihood that acutely intoxicated patients will be  seen  in  the  operating  room.  Management  of  anesthesia includes  consideration  of  the  known  e ff ects  of  THC  on  the heart, lungs, and central nervous system. Animal studies have demonstrated  drug-induced  drowsiness  and  decreased  dose requirements  for  volatile  anesthetics  following intravenous administration of THC. Barbiturate and ketamine sleep times are  prolonged  in  THC-treated  animals,  and  opioid-induced respiratory depression may be potentiated.

Substance Abuse as an Occupational Hazard in Anesthesiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesiologists  represent  3.6%  of  all  physicians  in  the United States. However, they are overrepresented in addiction treatment  programs,  enrolling  at  a  rate  approximately  three times higher than that of any other physician group. In addition, anesthesiologists are at highest risk of relapse a ft er drug addiction treatment. At the present time, 12% to 15% of all physicians in treatment are anesthesiologists. Th e encouraging news is that a survey covering 1994 and 1995 revealed that the apparent incidence of substance abuse among anesthesiology residents was 0.4% with a faculty incidence of 0.1%. Both rates represented a decline in incidence since 1986.

DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF ANESTHESIOLOGISTS WHO ABUSE DRUGS

Th e curriculum on drug abuse and addiction compiled by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Committee on Occupational Health is a highly recommended in-depth source of information  on  this  important  topic. Th is  curriculum  notes the following demographic characteristics of anesthesiologists who are addicted to drugs:

MOST FREQUENTLY ABUSED DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditionally,  opioids  are  the  drugs  selected  for  abuse  by anesthesiologists. Fentanyl and sufentanil are the most commonly abused drugs, followed by meperidine and morphine. Th is  choice  is  particularly  evident  among  anesthesiologists younger than 35 years of age. Alcohol is the abused substance in older anesthesiologists, probably because the time to produce  impairment  is  signi fi cantly  longer  than  that  observed with opiate addiction. Th e  data  also  suggest  that  opiates  are the substance of choice for abuse early in an anesthesiologist's

career, whereas alcohol abuse is more frequently detected in anesthesia practitioners who have been out of residency for longer than 5 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other agents that have been abused include cocaine, benzodiazepines (midazolam), and, more recently, propofol. Over the past 5 years, there has been a major switch to "needleless" delivery of commonly abused drugs. Th is approach provides a  cleaner  alternative  to  the  more  traditional  intravenous  or intramuscular routes. Every possible route of administration has  been  tried,  including  unusual  intravenous  sites  (hidden veins in the feet, groin, thigh, and penis), oral-nasal administration (benzodiazepines), and sublingual and rectal routes. Volatile anesthetics are now entering the abuse arena as well. Sevo fl urane has been reported as the drug of choice among inhalational  agents.  Regardless  of  the  drug  initially  abused, a ft er  6  months  there  is  an  increasing  incidence  of  polydrug abuse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
METHODS OF OBTAINING DRUGS FOR ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesiologists have developed numerous and o ft en creative methods for obtaining drugs for abuse. Th e most frequently employed  methods  are  falsely  recording  drug  administration, improperly fi lling out the anesthesia record, and keeping rather than wasting le ft over drugs. In addition, recent reports have highlighted a new practice involving secretly accessing multidose  vials  and  then  re fi lling  and  resealing  them  with other  substances.  It  is  important  to  be  wary  of  the  faculty member or resident who is too anxious to give breaks to others or who volunteers to take late cases. One of the most frequently reported retrospective markers of addictive behavior was the desire to work overtime, particularly during periods when  supervision  might  be  reduced,  such  as  evenings  and weekends.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless of which drugs are abused, any unusual and persistent changes in behavior should be cause for alarm. Classically, these behaviors include wide mood swings, such as periods of depression, anger, and irritability alternating with periods of euphoria. Key points to remember about addictive behavior include the following:

ASSOCIATED RISKS OF PHYSICIAN DRUG ADDICTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  traditionally  the  risks  related  to  substance  abuse were  assigned  to  the  individual  physician-abuser,  it  is  clear that  there  are  also  signi fi cant risks to patients and potential risks to the hospital sta ff and administration when a physician becomes impaired or addicted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physician

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e principal risks to the anesthesia provider with addictive disease are an increased risk of suicide by drug overdose and drug-related death. Unfortunately, the relapse rate for anesthesiologists is the highest among all physicians with a history of narcotic addiction. Th e risk of relapse is greatest in the fi rst 5 years and decreases as time in recovery increases. Th e positive news is that 89% of anesthesiologists who complete treatment and commit to a ft ercare  remain  abstinent  for  longer  than  2 years. However, death is the primary presenting sign of relapse in opiate-addicted anesthesiologists!

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  can  be  a ff ected  by  addictive  behavior. Th e  data show that impaired physicians (those who are actively abusing drugs) are at increased risk of malpractice suits. Data from both California and Oklahoma revealed a dramatic decrease in both the number and dollar value of claims fi led a ft er treatment for substance abuse.

PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH SUSPECTED SUBSTANCE ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e process for dealing with suspected substance abuse by an anesthesiologist will be signi fi cantly a ff ected by the presence or absence of a physician assistance committee. If an institution does not have such a committee, one should be formed and  policies  developed  so  that  the  support  required  by  an impaired physician is in place when it is needed. Th e membership of this committee should include an anesthesiologist. In  addition,  this  group  should  have  a  consulting  agreement with  local  addiction  specialists  with  experience  in  treating and referring physicians. Ideally, this treatment group would include a physician-counselor with experience and expertise in  treating  anesthesiologists.  Finally,  this  committee  should have a help line telephone number and a point of contact with at least one preselected addiction treatment program.

REPORTING AND INTERVENTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Admission to an alcohol or drug addiction treatment program is not considered a reportable event by state or national agencies. It can be dealt with as a medical leave of absence. However,  intervention  must  be  initiated  as  soon  as  there  is fi rm evidence that substances of abuse are being diverted for personal use. Th is evidence needs to be clear and convincing to the physician assistance committee.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  primary  goal  of  intervention  is  to  get  the  addicted individual into a multidisciplinary medical evaluation process conducted by a team of experts at an experienced residential treatment program. One-on-one intervention must be avoided. Th e expertise of the hospital physician assistance committee and county or state medical society can be called upon to help with the intervention. A ft er an individual has been confronted and is awaiting fi nal disposition of his or her case, it is important not to leave the individual alone, because newly identi fi ed addicted physicians are at increased risk of suicide following the initial confrontation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e speci fi cs of substance abuse treatment for physicians are beyond  the  scope  of  this  chapter.  However,  it  is  important that a member of the faculty, group, or impairment committee keep in contact with the addicted physician and his or her treatment team. Th ere is no cure for addiction and recovery is a lifelong process. Th e most e ff ective treatment programs are multidisciplinary and are able to provide long-term follow-up for the impaired physician.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deliberate  overdose  of  antidepressant  medication  is  a  common cause of death due to drug ingestion. Th e tricyclic antidepressant drugs account for most of this mortality. Potentially lethal doses of these drugs may be only 5 to 10 times the daily therapeutic  doses.  Overdose  principally  a ff ects  the  central nervous  system,  parasympathetic  nervous  system,  and  cardiovascular system. Inhibition of neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin, anticholinergic e ff ects, peripheral α -adrenergic blockade,  and  membrane-depressant  e ff ects account  for  the  toxicity.  Evidence  of  intense  anticholinergic e ff ects include delirium, fever, tachycardia, mydriasis, fl ushed dry skin, ileus,  and  urinary  retention  (see  Table  25-4).  Cardiovascular  toxicity  consists  of  sinus  tachycardia  with  prolongation of the PR interval, QRS complex, and QT interval; ventricular dysrhythmias (especially polymorphic ventricular tachycardia);  and  myocardial  depression  and  may  be  lethal. Seizures are not uncommon. Th e  likelihood  of  seizures  and cardiac dysrhythmias is very low when the maximal limb lead QRS duration is less than 100 milliseconds. Plasma concentrations  of  cyclic  antidepressants  are  not  usually  measured because  of  the  reliability  of  the  limb  lead  QRS  duration  in predicting the risk of neurologic and cardiac complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  obtundation-coma-seizure  phase  of  cyclic  antidepressant overdose lasts 24 hours or longer. Even a ft er this phase passes, the risk of life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias may persist  for  several  days,  which  necessitates  prolonged  ECG monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial  treatment  of  tricyclic  antidepressant  overdose  in the presence of preserved upper airway re fl exes includes gastric  lavage  and  administration  of  activated  charcoal.  Emesis should not be induced, because progression from being alert with mild symptoms to being obtunded with life-threatening changes (seizures, hypoventilation, hypotension, coma) may be very rapid, and pulmonary aspiration may result. Depressed ventilation  or  coma  may  require  tracheal  intubation  and mechanical ventilation. Serum alkalinization is the principal treatment and results in an increase in protein-bound drug, less  free  drug,  and  thereby  less  toxicity.  Intravenous  administration of sodium bicarbonate or hyperventilation to a pH between 7.45 and 7.55 should be performed to a clinical end point such as narrowing of the QRS complex or cessation of dysrhythmias. If polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsade de  pointes)  is  present,  magnesium  should  be  administered. Patients who remain hypotensive a ft er volume expansion and alkalinization may bene fi t from vasopressor or inotropic support. Diazepam is useful for seizure control. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion are ine ff ective in removing cyclic antidepressants because of the high lipid solubility and high degree of protein binding of these drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Salicylic Acid Overdose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Once aspirin is ingested, it is converted to its active metabolite, salicylic acid. At toxic levels, salicylates are metabolic poisons that a ff ect many organs by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and interfering with the Krebs cycle. Th is uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leads to accumulation of lactic acid and ketoacids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Manifestations of salicylic acid overdose include tinnitus, nausea  and  vomiting,  fever,  seizures,  obtundation,  hypoglycemia, low cerebrospinal fl uid glucose concentrations, coagulopathy,  hepatic  dysfunction,  and  direct  stimulation  of  the respiratory center. Th e respiratory alkalosis resulting from this respiratory center stimulation assists in renal elimination of the  drug  by  increasing  the  water-soluble  ionized  fraction  of salicylic acid. Metabolic acidosis, on the other hand, favors the lipid-soluble nonionized fraction of the drug, which enhances the passage of drug into tissues and brain where toxic e ff ects are produced. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema o ft en occurs during the fi rst 24 hours a ft er aspirin overdose.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial  treatment  of  acute  salicylic  acid  overdose  includes administration of activated charcoal. Serum salicylate concentration should be measured initially and reassessed at a later time  for  evidence  of  continued  absorption  of  drug,  such  as might be seen with enteric-coated or sustained-release formulations  of  aspirin.  Empirical  administration  of  dextrose  will help prevent low cerebrospinal fl uid glucose concentrations. Administration  of  sodium  bicarbonate  to  increase  arterial

<!-- PAGE=? -->
blood pH to 7.45 to 7.55 alkalinizes the urine, which dramatically increases renal clearance of salicylate. In addition, alkalemia promotes the movement of salicylate away from the brain and  other  tissues  into  the  blood.  Potential  complications  of this  therapy  include fl uid overload and hypokalemia. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, if undertaken, must be done very cautiously, because an abrupt decrease in salicylate-induced hyperventilation and hyperpnea may lead to  life-threatening  acidosis.  Hemodialysis  is  indicated  for potentially  lethal  concentrations  of  salicylic  acid  (>100  mg/ dL) and for refractory acidosis, coma, seizures, volume overload, or renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acetaminophen Overdose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acetaminophen  overdose  is  the  most  common  medicinal overdose  reported  to  poison  control  centers  in  the  United States.  Patients  typically  have  nausea  and/or  vomiting  and abdominal  pain  at  presentation.  Acetaminophen  toxicity  is due  to  centrilobular  hepatic  necrosis  caused  by N -acetylp -benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which reacts with and destroys hepatocytes. Normally, this metabolite constitutes only 5% of acetaminophen metabolic products and is inactivated by conjugation with endogenous glutathione. In overdose, the supply of glutathione becomes depleted and NAPQI is not detoxi fi ed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of acetaminophen overdose begins with determination of the time of drug ingestion and with administration of activated charcoal to impede drug absorption. At 4 hours a ft er drug ingestion, plasma acetaminophen concentration  is  measured  and  plotted  on  the  Rumack-Matthew nomogram, which strati fi es patients into those who are not at risk of hepatotoxicity, those who are possibly at risk, and those  who  are  probably  at  risk  (Figure  25-2).  All  patients who are possibly  or  probably  at  risk  of  hepatotoxicity  and anyone  for  whom  the  time  of  ingestion  is  not  known  are treated  with N -acetylcysteine,  which  repletes  glutathione, combines directly with N -acetylp -benzoquinoneimine, and enhances  sulfate  conjugation  of  acetaminophen.  Administration of N -acetylcysteine is virtually 100% e ff ective in preventing hepatotoxicity when administered within 8 hours of drug ingestion.

Methyl Alcohol Ingestion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methyl  alcohol  (methanol)  is  found  in  paint  remover,  gasline  antifreeze,  windshield  washing fl uid,  and  camper  fuel. Methanol is a weak toxin, but it has very toxic metabolites. It is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde and formic acid, which results in an anion gap metabolic acidosis. It is formic acid that is primarily responsible for the metabolic acidosis and visual disturbances that are associated with methanol toxicity. Th e target organs for its toxic e ff ects are the retina, the optic nerve, and the central nervous system. Blurred vision, optic disk hyperemia, and blindness are hallmarks of

methanol intoxication. Severe abdominal pain that mimics a surgical emergency may also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  methyl  alcohol  poisoning  includes  providing  supportive care and ensuring a secure airway. Activated charcoal does not adsorb alcohols. Intravenous administration of  ethyl  alcohol,  which  is  preferentially  metabolized  by  the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, will decrease the metabolism of  methanol.  Alternatively,  the  activity  of  alcohol  dehydrogenase  may  be  competitively  inhibited  by  administration  of fomepizole. Folic acid and/or folinic acid will provide cofactors to assist in formic acid elimination. Hemodialysis may be indicated for refractory acidosis or visual impairment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ethylene Glycol Ingestion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ingestion of as little as 4 fl oz  of  ethylene  glycol  may be fatal. Ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze, de-icers, and industrial solvents) is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolic acid, which leads to metabolic acidosis. Glycolic acid is then metabolized  to  oxalate.  Accumulation  and  precipitation  of  calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules can produce acute tubular necrosis.  Myocardial  dysfunction,  pulmonary  edema,  cerebral edema, and hypocalcemia resulting from oxalate chelation of calcium are additional features of ethylene glycol poisoning. Treatment of ethylene glycol ingestion is similar to that described for methyl alcohol ingestion. Formation of toxic metabolites can be inhibited by administration of ethyl alcohol or fomepizole. Th iamine, pyridoxine, and su ffi cient calcium to reverse the hypocalcemia are also given. Urgent hemodialysis may be necessary.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Organophosphate Overdose

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Organophosphate pesticides, carbamate pesticides, and organophosphorus  compounds  (nerve  agents  developed  for chemical warfare and used in terrorist attacks) all inhibit acetylcholinesterase,  which  results  in  cholinergic  overstimulation. Th ese chemicals are absorbed by inhalation, by ingestion, and through the skin. Th ere are several important di ff erences between the nerve agents and the insecticides. Th e insecticides are oily, less volatile liquids with a longer time to onset of toxicity but longer-lasting e ff ects. Nerve agents are typically watery and volatile, acting rapidly and severely but for a shorter period of time. Carbamate insecticides have a more limited penetration  of  the  central  nervous  system,  bind  acetylcholinesterase reversibly,  and  result  in  a  shorter,  milder  course  of  toxicity than organophosphates. All can be aerosolized and vaporized. Th e manifestations of pesticide and nerve agent poisoning are in fl uenced  by  the  route  of  absorption,  with  the  most  severe e ff ects  occurring  a ft er  inhalation  (Table  25-14).  Muscarinic signs  and  symptoms  of  organophosphate  exposure  include profuse  exocrine  secretions  (tearing,  rhinorrhea,  bronchorrhea, salivation), gastrointestinal signs, and ophthalmic signs such as miosis. Exposure to larger doses results in stimulation of nicotinic receptors, which produces skeletal muscle weakness, fasciculations, and paralysis. Cardiovascular fi ndings may include tachycardia or bradycardia, hypertension or hypotension. Central nervous system e ff ects include cognitive impairment, convulsions, and coma. Acute respiratory failure is the primary cause of death and is mediated by bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, respiratory muscle and diaphragmatic weakness or paralysis, and inhibition of the medullary respiratory center.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of organophosphate overdose involves administration  of  three  types  of  drugs:  an  anticholinergic  drug to  counteract  the  acute  cholinergic  crisis,  an  oxime  drug to  reactivate  inhibited  acetylcholinesterase,  and  an  anticonvulsant drug to prevent or treat seizures (Table 25-15). Atropine in 2-mg doses repeated every 5 to 10 minutes as needed is the main antidote for this poisoning. Th e  clinical end point of atropine therapy is ease of breathing without signi fi cant airway secretions. Pralidoxime is an oxime that  complexes  with  the  organophosphate,  which  results in  its  removal  from  the  acetylcholinesterase  enzyme  and splitting  of  the  organophosphate  into  rapidly  metabolizable fragments. Th e removal of the organophosphate from acetylcholinesterase  reactivates  the  enzyme,  and  its  normal  functions  can  be  resumed.  Benzodiazepines  are  the only e ff ective anticonvulsants for the treatment of patients with  organophosphate  exposure.  All  patients  with  severe intoxication by these compounds should be given diazepam or  midazolam.  Respiratory  muscle  weakness  may  require mechanical ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CO  is  a  colorless,  odorless,  nonirritating  gas  that  is  easily absorbed  through  the  lungs. Th e  amount  of  CO  absorbed depends  on  minute  ventilation,  duration  of  exposure,  and ambient CO and oxygen concentrations. CO toxicity appears to  result  from  a  combination  of  tissue  hypoxia  and  direct CO-mediated cellular damage. CO competes with oxygen for binding to hemoglobin. Th e a ffi nity of hemoglobin for CO is more than 200 times greater than its a ffi nity for oxygen. Th e consequence of this competitive binding is a shi ft of the oxyhemoglobin  dissociation  curve  to  the  le ft ,  which  results  in impaired release of oxygen to tissues (Figure 25-3). However, the binding of CO to hemoglobin does not account for all of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 25 PSYCHIATRIC DISEASE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND DRUG OVERDOSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
555

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the pathophysiologic consequences of CO poisoning. CO also disrupts oxidative metabolism, increases nitric oxide concentrations, causes brain lipid peroxidation, generates oxygen free radicals, and produces other metabolic changes that may result in neurologic and cardiac toxicity. CO binds more tightly to fetal hemoglobin than to adult hemoglobin, so that infants are particularly vulnerable to its e ff ects. Children, because of their higher metabolic rate and oxygen consumption, are also very susceptible to CO toxicity. CO exposure has uniquely deleterious e ff ects in pregnant women because CO readily crosses the placenta, and fetal carboxyhemoglobin concentration may exceed maternal carboxyhemoglobin concentration and fetal elimination of CO is slower than that of the mother.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  initial  signs  and  symptoms  of  CO  exposure  are  nonspeci fi c.  Headache,  nausea,  vomiting,  weakness,  di ffi culty concentrating, and confusion are common. Th e highly oxygen-dependent organs-the brain and the heart-show the major signs of injury. Tachycardia and tachypnea re fl ect cellular  hypoxia.  Angina  pectoris,  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  and pulmonary  edema  may  result  from  the  increased  cardiac output  necessitated  by  the  hypoxia.  Syncope  and  seizures may result from cerebral hypoxia and cerebral vasodilation, Of note, the degree of systemic hypotension in CO poisoning is correlated with the severity of central nervous system structural damage. Th e classic fi nding of cherry-red lips is not commonly seen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e e ff ects of CO poisoning are not con fi ned to the period immediately a ft er exposure. Persistent or delayed neurologic e ff ects may be seen. Delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome, which may  include  cognitive  dysfunction,  memory  loss,  seizures, personality changes, parkinsonism, dementia, mutism, blindness,  and  psychosis,  may  occur  following  apparent  recovery from the acute phase of CO intoxication. No clinical fi ndings or laboratory test results reliably predict which patients are at risk of delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome, but patients who are  comatose at presentation, older patients, and those with prolonged exposure seem to be at greater risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serum carboxyhemoglobin concentrations should be obtained  for  patients  suspected  of  CO  exposure.  Arterial blood  sampling  is  not  necessary  since  arterial  and  venous carboxyhemoglobin levels correlate well. Measurement requires  a  CO-oximeter,  which,  by  spectrophotometry,  can detect and quantify all normal and abnormal hemoglobins. Routine blood gas analysis does not recognize the presence of  abnormal  hemoglobins,  and  pulse  oximetry  cannot  distinguish  carboxyhemoglobin from oxyhemoglobin. Oxygen saturation values measured by pulse oximetry may therefore be quite misleading.

TREATMENT

supplemental oxygen, and aggressive supportive care: airway management,  blood  pressure  support,  and  cardiovascular stabilization. Oxygen therapy shortens the elimination halftime of CO by competing at the binding sites on hemoglobin and  improves  tissue  oxygenation.  Oxygen  administration is  continued  until  the  carboxyhemoglobin  concentrations have returned to normal. Th e half-life of carboxyhemoglobin  is  4  to  6  hours  when  patients  are  breathing  room  air, 40  to  80  minutes  when  they  are  breathing  100%  oxygen, and approximately 15 to 30 minutes when they are breathing hyperbaric oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy consists of  delivery  of  100%  oxygen within a pressurized chamber, which results in huge increases in the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy accelerates the elimination of CO and may decrease the frequency of the neurologic sequelae that can result from severe CO exposure.  Hyperbaric  oxygen  therapy  is  controversial,  is  not universally available, and has some risks. However, it may be  indicated  in  selected  patients:  those  who  are  comatose or have neurologic abnormalities at presentation, those who have carboxyhemoglobin concentrations in excess of 40%, and those who are pregnant and have carboxyhemoglobin concentrations above 15%.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that results from overstimulation of central serotonin receptors. It can be caused by an excess of precursors, increased release, reduced reuptake, or reduced metabolism  of  serotonin.  Many  drugs  are  serotoninergic (i.e., involved in these serotonin processes), including SSRIs, atypical and cyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, lithium, drugs of abuse, and narcotic analgesics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In addition to the seizure and its neuropsychiatric e ff ects, ECT produces signi fi cant cardiovascular e ff ects. Th e typical cardiovascular response to the electrically induced seizure consists of 10 to 15 seconds of parasympathetic stimulation producing bradycardia and a reduction in blood pressure. Th is is followed by sympathetic nervous system activation resulting in tachycardia and hypertension lasting several minutes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Substance abuse may be de fi ned as self-administration of drugs  that  deviates  from  accepted  medical  or  social  use, which, if  sustained,  can  lead  to  physical  and  psychologic dependence.  Physical  dependence  has  developed  when the presence of a drug in the body is necessary for normal physiologic function and prevention of withdrawal symptoms. Tolerance is the state in which tissues become accustomed to the presence of a drug so that increased dosages of that drug become necessary to produce e ff ects similar to those observed initially with smaller dosages.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Although alcohol appears to produce widespread nonspeci fi c e ff ects on cell membranes, there is evidence that many of its neurologic e ff ects are mediated by actions at receptors  for  the  inhibitory  neurotransmitter  GABA.  Alcohol appears to increase GABA-mediated chloride ion conductance. A shared site of action for alcohol, benzodiazepines, and  barbiturates  would  be  consistent  with  the  ability  of these di ff erent classes of drugs to produce cross-tolerance and cross-dependence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute cocaine administration is known to cause coronary vasospasm,  myocardial  ischemia,  myocardial  infarction, and ventricular cardiac dysrhythmias, including ventricular fi brillation.  Associated  systemic  hypertension  and  tachycardia further increase myocardial oxygen requirements at a time when oxygen delivery to the heart is decreased by the e ff ects of cocaine on coronary blood fl ow. Cocaine use can cause myocardial ischemia and hypotension for as long as 6 weeks a ft er discontinuance of the drug.

addition, anesthesiologists are at highest risk of relapse of all physician specialists.

■ Fentanyl  and  sufentanil  are  the  drugs  most  commonly abused by anesthesiologists. Th is drug choice is particularly evident among anesthesiologists younger than 35 years of age. Alcohol abuse is seen primarily among older anesthesiologists, because the time to produce impairment is signi fi cantly longer than that observed with opiate addiction. It appears that opiates are the substances of choice for abuse early in an anesthesiologist's career.

■ Th e primary goal of intervention is to get the addicted physician into a multidisciplinary medical evaluation process conducted by a team of experts at an experienced residential treatment program. One-on-one intervention must be avoided.  A ft er  an  individual  has  been  confronted  and  is awaiting fi nal disposition of his or her case, it is important not to leave the individual alone, because newly identi fi ed addicted physicians are at increased risk of suicide following the initial confrontation.

■ Acetaminophen overdose is the most common medicinal  overdose  reported  to  poison  control  centers  in  the United  States.  Patients  typically  have  nausea  and/or vomiting  and  abdominal  pain.  Acetaminophen  hepatic toxicity is caused by a metabolite of acetaminophen that reacts  with  and  destroys  hepatocytes.  Normally,  this metabolite  constitutes  only  5%  of  acetaminophen  metabolic  products  and  is  inactivated  by  conjugation  with endogenous glutathione. In overdose, the supply of glutathione becomes depleted and the destructive metabolite is not detoxi fi ed.

■ Nerve agents are organophosphate poisons that have been used  in  warfare  and  in  terrorist  attacks. Th ey  inactivate acetylcholinesterase and create an acute, severe cholinergic crisis.  Emergency management of this poisoning consists of administration of repeated large doses of atropine.

■ Routine  blood  gas  analysis  does  not  recognize  the  presence of  abnormal hemoglobins, and pulse oximetry cannot distinguish carboxyhemoglobin from oxyhemoglobin. Th erefore, in the presence of CO poisoning, these methods provide erroneous readings.

■ Th e  e ff ects  of  CO  are  not  con fi ned to the period immediately following exposure. Delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome, which may include cognitive dysfunction, memory loss, seizures, personality changes, parkinsonism, dementia,  mutism,  blindness,  and  psychosis,  may  occur  a ft er apparent recovery from the acute phase of CO intoxication.  Patients  who  are  comatose  at  presentation,  older patients, and those with prolonged exposure seem to be at greater risk.
