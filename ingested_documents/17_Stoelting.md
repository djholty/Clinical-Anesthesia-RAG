Key Points

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e kidneys are responsible for, or contribute to, a number of essential functions, including water conservation, electrolyte homeostasis,  acid-base  balance,  and  several  neurohumoral and hormonal functions. Knowing how the kidneys perform these important functions aids in understanding the clinical presentation,  signs  and  symptoms,  and  treatment  of  renal diseases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The kidneys are the most highly perfused organs in the body,  receiving  20%  to  25%  of  the  cardiac  output.  Each kidney consists of approximately a million nephrons, each of  which  has  distinct  anatomic  parts:  Bowman's  capsule, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct. Renal blood flow is autoregulated between mean arterial  pressures  of  50  and  150  mm  Hg.  A  glomerulus, which is  a  tuft  of  capillaries,  is  surrounded  by  Bowman's capsule and is supplied by an afferent arteriole and drained by a slightly smaller efferent arteriole. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is a specialized structure between the afferent arteriole and distal tubule that contributes to the control of renal perfusion and extrarenal hemodynamics. The glomeruli filter the plasma at a rate of 180 L/day, allowing all but protein  and  polysaccharides  to  pass  into  the  nephron.  As the plasma flows along the nephron, virtually all the fluid and solutes are reabsorbed by a number of active and passive transport systems. The main function of the kidneys is water and sodium homeostasis, which are intimately linked and regulated by a number of feedback loops and hormonal controls.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF RENAL FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are a number of tests that are useful in evaluating renal function and diagnosing disease (Table 17-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomerular Filtration Rate

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  glomerular fi ltration  rate  (GFR)  is  considered  the  best measure of renal function, because it parallels the various functions of the nephrons. Th e GFR may be calculated from timed urine volumes plus urinary and plasma creatinine concentrations (creatinine clearance), or from direct measurements of the clearance of either endogenous or exogenous substances (creatinine and inulin, respectively). Alternatively, a number of formulas exist that estimate the GFR from various serum and urinary indices (Table 17-2). Normal values for GFR are 125 mL/min to 140 mL/min and vary with gender, body weight, and age. GFR decreases by approximately 1% per year a ft er the age of 20.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  manifestations  of  uremia  generally  appear  when the GFR falls below 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2  (normal level is ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ). Alterations in the GFR are also associated with predictable changes in erythropoietic activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Creatinine Clearance

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Creatinine, an endogenous marker of renal fi ltration, is produced  at  a  relatively  constant  rate  by  hepatic  conversion  of skeletal muscle creatinine. Creatinine is freely fi ltered by the kidney  and  is  not  reabsorbed.  As  a  result,  creatinine  clearance  is  the  most  reliable  measure  of  GFR  (see  Table  17-1).

Creatinine clearance does not depend on corrections for age or the presence of a steady state.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serum Creatinine

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serum  creatinine  levels  can  be  used  as  an  estimate  of  the GFR. Normal serum creatinine concentrations range from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/dL in women and 0.8 to 1.3 mg/dL in men, which re fl ects di ff erences in skeletal muscle mass. A number of factors  (accelerated  creatinine  production,  decreased  tubular secretion of creatinine, presence of chromogens in the blood) can increase serum creatinine concentrations in the absence of a concomitant decrease in GFR. Conversely, small reductions in serum creatinine level can re fl ect large decreases in GFR. For example, the maintenance of normal serum creatinine concentrations in elderly patients with known decreases in the GFR re fl ects decreased creatinine production owing to the  decreased  skeletal  muscle  mass  that  accompanies  aging. Serum creatinine values are also slow to re fl ect acute changes in  renal  function.  For  example,  if  acute  renal  failure  occurs and  the  GFR  decreases  from  100  mL/min  to  10  mL/min, serum creatinine values do not increase correspondingly for approximately 7 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood Urea Nitrogen

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations vary with the GFR. Nevertheless, the in fl uences of dietary intake, co-existing disease,  and  intravascular fl uid  volume  on  BUN  concentrations make it potentially misleading as a test of renal function. For

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
example, production of urea is increased by consumption of a high-protein diet or gastrointestinal bleeding, which results in increased  BUN  concentrations  despite  a  normal  GFR.  Other causes of increased BUN concentrations despite a normal GFR include dehydration and increased catabolism, as occurs during a febrile illness. Increased BUN concentrations in the presence of dehydration most likely re fl ect increased urea absorption owing to  slow  movement  of fl uid  through  the  renal  tubules.  When the latter is responsible for increased BUN concentrations, the serum  creatinine  levels  remain  normal.  BUN  concentrations can also remain normal with consumption of a low-protein diet (as in hemodialysis patients) despite decreases in the GFR. Even with these extraneous in fl uences, however, BUN concentrations higher than 50 mg/dL usually re fl ect a decreased GFR.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Tubular Function and Integrity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal tubular function is most o ft en assessed by measuring the urine concentrating ability. Th e presence of proteinuria may re fl ect  renal  tubular  damage.  Enzymes  present  in  the  renal tubular  cells  ( N -acetylβ -D-glucosaminidase, α -glutathione Stransferase) may be detectable in the urine following sevofl urane anesthesia, which presumably re fl ects transient druginduced  tubular  dysfunction  that  is  not  accompanied  by changes in the BUN or serum creatinine concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
URINE CONCENTRATING ABILITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis  of  renal  tubular  dysfunction  is  established  by demonstrating that the kidneys do not produce appropriately concentrated  urine  in  the  presence  of  a  physiologic  stimulus for the release of antidiuretic hormone. In the absence of diuretic therapy or glucosuria, a urine-speci fi c gravity higher than 1.018 suggests that the ability of renal tubules to concentrate urine is adequate. Treatment with diuretics or the presence of hypokalemia or hypercalcemia may interfere with the ability  of  renal  tubules  to  concentrate  urine. Th e  inorganic fl uoride resulting from metabolism of sevo fl urane is theoretically capable of interfering with the urine concentrating ability of the renal tubules; however, the clinical signi fi cance of this observation has yet to be established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROTEINURIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Proteinuria is relatively common and is present in 5% to 10% of tested adults during screening examinations. Transient proteinuria may be associated with fever, congestive heart failure, seizure activity, pancreatitis, and exercise. Th is  form of proteinuria resolves with treatment of the underlying condition. Orthostatic  proteinuria  occurs  in  up  to  5%  of  adolescents while in the upright position and disappears with recumbency. Generally, orthostatic proteinuria resolves spontaneously and is not associated with any deterioration in renal function. Persistent proteinuria generally connotes signi fi cant renal disease. Microalbuminuria is the earliest sign of diabetic nephropathy. Severe proteinuria may result in hypoalbuminemia, with associated decreases in plasma oncotic pressures and increases in unbound drug concentrations.

FRACTIONAL EXCRETION OF SODIUM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fractional excretion of sodium (Fe Na ) is a measure of the percentage  of fi ltered  sodium  that  is  excreted  in  the  urine (Table 17-3). It is most useful in di ff erentiating between prerenal and renal causes of azotemia. An Fe Na higher than 2% (or  urinary  sodium  concentration  of  >40  mEq/L)  re fl ects decreased ability of the renal tubules to conserve sodium and is  consistent  with  tubular  dysfunction.  An  Fe Na of  less  than 1% (or urinary sodium excretion of <20 mEq/L) occurs when normally  functioning  renal  tubules  are  conserving  sodium and is suggestive of prerenal azotemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
URINALYSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Examination of the urine is useful for diagnosing renal and urinary tract disease. Urinalysis is intended to detect the presence of protein, glucose, acetoacetate, blood, and leukocytes. Th e urine pH and solute concentrations (speci fi c gravity) are determined, and sediment microscopy is used to identify the presence of cells, casts, microorganisms, and crystals. Hematuria may be caused by bleeding anywhere between the glomerulus  and  urethra.  Microhematuria  may  be  benign  (focal nephritis)  or  may  re fl ect  glomerulonephritis,  renal  calculi, or cancer of the genitourinary tract. Joggers may experience transient hematuria, presumably as a result of trauma to the urinary tract. Sickle cell disease is a consideration in African Americans who exhibit hematuria. In the absence of protein or  red  blood  cell  casts  in  the  urine,  glomerular  disease  as  a cause of hematuria is unlikely. Red blood cell casts are pathognomonic of acute glomerulonephritis. White blood cell casts are most commonly seen with pyelonephritis.

NOVEL BIOMARKERS OF RENAL FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cystatin  C  is  a  protein  produced  by  all  nucleated  cells  and freely fi ltered but not resorbed by the kidneys. Its serum concentration is independent of age, gender, or muscle mass, and for this reason it may turn out to be a better marker of GFR than serum creatinine concentration. Neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin is a protein produced by renal tubular cells in response to injury and has shown promise as an early indicator of acute kidney injury.

ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by deterioration of renal function over a period of hours to days, resulting in failure of the kidneys to excrete nitrogenous waste products and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to maintain fl uid and electrolyte homeostasis. Commonly used de fi nitions of AKI include an increase in serum creatinine concentration of more than 0.5 mg/dL compared with the baseline value, a 50% decrease in the calculated creatinine clearance, or a change in serum creatinine concentration of greater than 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours of an acute insult. AKI may be oliguric (urinary output < 400 mL/day) or nonoliguric (urinary output  >  400  mL/day).  Despite  major  advances  in  dialysis therapy  and  critical  care,  the  mortality  rate  among  patients with severe AKI requiring dialysis remains high. When AKI occurs in the setting of multiorgan failure, the mortality rate o ft en exceeds 50%. Th e most common causes of death are sepsis, cardiovascular dysfunction, and pulmonary complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Etiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of AKI depends on the de fi nition used and the patient population studied. Some degree of AKI is thought to a ff ect 5% to 7% of all hospitalized patients. AKI is associated with a number of other systemic diseases, acute clinical conditions, drug treatments, and interventional therapies. It almost invariably accompanies multiorgan failure syndromes in the critically ill patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  causes  of  AKI  are  classically  divided  into  prerenal, intrarenal (or intrinsic), and postrenal (Table 17-4). Azotemia is a condition marked by abnormally high serum concentrations  of  nitrogen-containing  compounds  such  as  BUN  and creatinine, and is a hallmark of AKI, regardless of cause.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PRERENAL AZOTEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prerenal  azotemia  accounts  for  nearly  half  of  hospitalacquired cases of AKI. Prerenal azotemia is rapidly reversible  if  the  underlying  cause  is  corrected.  If  le ft untreated, sustained  prerenal  azotemia  is  the  most  common  factor that  predisposes  patients  to  ischemia-induced  acute  tubular  necrosis.  Elderly  patients  are  uniquely  susceptible  to prerenal azotemia because of their predisposition to hypovolemia (poor fl uid intake) and high incidence of renovascular disease.  Among hospitalized patients, prerenal azotemia is o ft en  due  to  congestive  heart  failure,  liver  dysfunction,  or septic  shock.  Reduced renal blood fl ow may be a result of anesthetic  drug-induced  decreases  in  perfusion  pressure, particularly  in  the  presence  of  hypovolemia  and  surgical blood loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment  of  volume  status,  hemodynamics,  and  drug therapy is required to identify prerenal causes of acute oliguria. Invasive monitoring (central venous catheter, pulmonary artery catheter) may be necessary to assess intravascular volume status. Urinary indices are o ft en helpful in distinguishing  prerenal  from  intrinsic  AKI  (Table  17-5). Th e  use  of urinary indices is based on the assumption that the ability of renal tubules to reabsorb sodium and water is maintained in the presence of prerenal causes of AKI, whereas these functions  are  impaired  in  the  presence  of  tubulointerstitial  disease  or  acute  tubular  necrosis.  Blood  and  urine  specimens for determination of urinary indices must be obtained before

RENAL AZOTEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intrinsic  renal  diseases  that  result  in  AKI  are  categorized according  to  the  primary  site  of  injury  (glomerulus,  renal tubules,  interstitium,  renal  vasculature).  Injury  to  the  renal tubules is most o ft en due to ischemia or nephrotoxins (aminoglycosides,  radiographic  contrast  agents).  Prerenal  azotemia and ischemic tubular necrosis are a continuum, with the initial  decreases  in  renal  blood fl ow  leading  to  ischemia  of the renal tubular cells. Although some cases of ischemic AKI are reversible if the underlying cause is corrected, irreversible cortical necrosis occurs if the ischemia is severe or prolonged. Injury may also occur during reperfusion because of an in fl ux of in fl ammatory cells, cytokines, and oxygen-free radicals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ischemia and toxins o ft en combine to cause AKI in severely ill patients with conditions such as sepsis or acquired immunode fi ciency  syndrome  (AIDS).  AKI  resulting  from  acute interstitial nephritis is most o ft en caused by allergic reactions to drugs. Other causes of renal azotemia include glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, renal artery emboli, renal vein thrombosis, and vasculitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTRENAL AZOTEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AKI  occurs  when  urinary  out fl ow  tracts  are  obstructed,  as with prostatic hyperplasia or cancer of the prostate or cervix. It is important to diagnose postrenal causes of AKI promptly, because the potential for recovery is inversely related to the duration  of  the  obstruction.  Renal  ultrasonography  is  o ft en useful for determining the presence of obstructive nephropathy.  Percutaneous  nephrostomy  can  relieve  obstruction  and improve outcomes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk Factors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk factors for the development of AKI include preexisting renal disease, advanced age, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, emergency surgery, and major operative procedures such as coronary revascularization and aortic aneurysm repair (Table 17-6). Sepsis and multiple organ system dysfunction resulting from trauma introduce the risk of AKI. Iatrogenic components that predispose to AKI include inadequate fl uid replacement, hypotension, delayed treatment of sepsis, and administration of nephrotoxic drugs or dyes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appropriate hydration and optimal preservation of the intravascular fl uid volume are essential to maintain renal perfusion. It is also important to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure and cardiac output and to prevent peripheral vasoconstriction. Hypotension may result in inadequate renal perfusion and loss of renal autoregulation. Potentially nephrotoxic substances (nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs, aminoglycosides, radiographic contrast dyes) are logically avoided in patients with prerenal oliguria, and diuretic therapy is contraindicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms  of  AKI  are  o ft en  absent  in  the  early stages,  and  a  high  degree  of  suspicion  is  required  to  identify subtle changes that accompany the development of AKI. Patients may show generalized malaise or demonstrate evidence of fl uid overload such as dyspnea, edema, and hypertension. As protein and amino acid metabolites accumulate, patients become lethargic, nauseated, and confused. Hyperkalemia and acidosis may a ff ect cardiac rhythm and contractility. Encephalopathy, coma, seizures, and death may ensue. Other  signs  and  symptoms  of  AKI  are  associated  with  its speci fi c cause, such as hypotension, jaundice, hematuria, or urinary retention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  diagnosis  of  AKI  is  usually  made  based  on  laboratory  data  demonstrating  an  acute  increase  in  serum  creatinine concentration. Urinary output may or may not fall, and depending on this, the term oliguric or nonoliguric is used to qualify AKI. Th ere are a number of de fi nitions of oliguria, the most common of which is less than 0.5 mL/kg/hr or less than 400 mL/day. Anuria is de fi ned as less than 100 mL/day, with complete anuria being very unusual.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Urinalysis is o ft en helpful in diagnosing whether the cause of AKI is prerenal, intrarenal, or postrenal (see Table 17-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications of AKI manifest in the central nervous, cardiovascular, hematologic, and gastrointestinal systems. Metabolic derangements are also common. In addition, infections occur frequently in patients who develop AKI and are leading causes of morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular complications include systemic hypertension,  congestive  heart  failure,  and  pulmonary  edema,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic complications of AKI include confusion, asterixis,  somnolence,  seizures,  and  polyneuropathy. Th ese changes appear to be related to the build-up of protein and amino acids in the blood, and symptoms may be ameliorated by dialysis.

principally as re fl ections of sodium and water retention. Th e presence of congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema suggests the need to decrease the intravascular fl uid volume. Cardiac dysrhythmias may develop; peaked T waves and widened QRS complexes are indicative of hyperkalemia. Uremic pericarditis may also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metabolic derangements include hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Sodium and water retention result in hypertension  and  edema.  Frequent  monitoring  of  arterial  blood  gas concentrations and electrolyte levels is indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic complications include anemia and coagulopathy. Hematocrit values between 20% and 30% are common as a  result  of  hemodilution  and  decreased  erythropoietin  production. Patients with renal insu ffi ciency are also at increased risk  of  bleeding  complications  caused  by  uremia-induced platelet  dysfunction.  Preoperative  dialysis  may  be  indicated in high-risk patients.  Alternatively,  1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin [DDAVP]) can be administered  preoperatively  to  temporarily  increase  concentrations of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII and improve coagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrointestinal complications include anorexia, nausea,  vomiting,  and  ileus.  Gastrointestinal  bleeding  occurs  in as many as one third of patients who develop AKI and may contribute to anemia. Gastroparesis may occur as a result of uremia. Administration of histamine-2 (H 2 ) receptor antagonists and/or proton pump inhibitors may decrease the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infection commonly  a ff ects  the  respiratory  and  urinary tracts  and  sites  where  breaks  in  normal  anatomic  barriers  have  occurred because of indwelling catheters. Impaired immune responses resulting from uremia may contribute to the increased likelihood of infections in patients with AKI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are no speci fi c treatment modalities for AKI. Management is aimed at limiting further renal injury and correcting fl uid,  electrolyte,  and  acid-base  derangements.  Underlying causes should be sought and terminated or reversed, if possible. Speci fi cally, hypovolemia, hypotension, and low cardiac output should be corrected and sepsis treated. A mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg should be attained, but there is no evidence supporting a better outcome with supraphysiologic values of either systemic pressure or cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are universally emphasized in the prevention and treatment of AKI. Th ere is no evidence to support the use of colloid over crystalloid. In fact,  administration  of  hydroxyethyl  starch  has  been  shown in some studies to exacerbate renal injury. Traditionally, 0.9% saline  was  the  preferred  crystalloid  for  use  in  patients  with renal dysfunction because it lacks potassium. However, recent research suggests that it may cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and secondarily lead to hyperkalemia. Th erefore, lactated  Ringer's  or  other  bicarbonate-containing  balanced  salt solutions may be a better choice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With regard  to  the  use  of  vasopressors  in  the  treatment of  AKI  associated  with  sepsis,  concern  has  been  expressed that renal vasoconstriction may exacerbate tubular injury. It is true that α 1 -agonists such as norepinephrine reduce renal blood fl ow in healthy volunteers. However, in patients with sepsis-related AKI, their e ff ects depend on the balance of a variety  of  factors.  In  general,  it  appears  that  improved  systemic pressure is accompanied by reduced renal sympathetic tone and vasodilation, and in this context, direct α 1 -agonistmediated  renal  vasoconstriction  is  of  minor  importance. Th erefore, the overall e ff ect of using norepinephrine in septic patients is to increase the GFR and urinary output. Arginine vasopressin is an alternative to traditional vasopressors in the treatment of  septic  shock  and  may  be  e ff ective  when  other agents have failed. Th is drug appears to selectively constrict renal  e ff erent  arterioles;  therefore,  it  may  help  preserve  the GFR and urinary output better than α 1 -agonists. However, its superiority in the management of septic shock has yet to be demonstrated.

Th e  use  of  dopamine either to treat or to prevent AKI is not supported by the literature; in fact, dopamine use has been associated with a number of undesirable side e ff ects. Fenoldopam  is  a  dopamine  analogue  with  exclusively  dopamine-1 agonist  activity.  At  low  dosages,  fenoldopam  causes  renal vasodilation, whereas at higher dosages, peripheral vasodilation  occurs.  Preliminary  evidence  suggests  that  fenoldopam provides  renal  protection  in  patients  at  high  risk  who  are undergoing cardiac, vascular, and transplant surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  practice  of  trying  to  convert  oliguric  to  nonoliguric  AKI  by  using  diuretics  is  not  advised  and  may  actually increase mortality risk and permanent renal injury. However, the  incidence  of  posttransplantation  acute  tubular  necrosis may be lower in patients treated with mannitol plus hydration than in those treated with hydration alone. Th e mechanism of action presumably relates to mannitol's ability to cause renal vasodilation through the production of renal prostaglandins. Mannitol is also commonly used in the treatment of pigmentinduced nephropathies; however, clinical evidence of its bene fi ts in this context is weak.

Prophylactic  administration  of N -acetylcysteine,  a  thiocontaining  antioxidant  that  acts  as  a  free  radical  scavenger, may  provide  protection  against  radiographic  dye-induced nephropathy.  However,  because  of  con fl icting  data  and  the risk of complications such as anaphylactoid reactions, it is not universally recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkalinization of urine with sodium bicarbonate is helpful in the treatment of pigment-induced nephropathy such as that caused by rhabdomyolysis, because it increases the solubility of myoglobin and prevents the formation of tubular precipitates. Prophylactic administration of sodium bicarbonate also  appears  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  contrast-induced nephropathy by decreasing the formation of damaging free radicals.

Dialysis (also known as hemo fi ltration or renal replacement therapy ) is still the mainstay of treatment for severe AKI. Th ere are fi ve main indications for its use: volume overload, hyperkalemia, severe metabolic acidosis, symptomatic uremia, and overdose with a dialyzable drug. Two dialysis methods exist: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Th e purpose of both is to remove excess fl uid and solutes from the blood and optimize electrolyte balance. Dialysis may be performed as a continuous or intermittent therapy, and controversy exists as to whether one or the other method is superior.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  overall  prognosis  for  hospital-acquired  AKI  is  poor. Many AKI study series report mortality rates of more than 20%, and once dialysis is required, mortality rates are invariably  in  excess  of  50%. Th ose  who  succumb  usually  die  of failure of other organ systems a ft er prolonged and complex hospital courses. Only about 15% of patients developing AKI will fully recover renal function. Five percent of AKI patients will retain a degree of renal insu ffi ciency that remains stable, and  another  5%  will  experience  continued  deterioration  of renal function throughout the remainder of their lives. Fifteen percent will be le ft with stable renal insu ffi ciency for a period but remain at high risk of developing chronic renal failure later in life.

Drug Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  impairment  a ff ects  most  of  the  organ  systems  of  the body  and,  consequently,  the  pharmacology  of  many  drugs. Selecting drugs that do not rely on the kidneys for excretion is ideal but not always possible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst  step  in  tailoring  drug  dosing  for  patients  with renal impairment is to estimate the creatinine clearance, since the rate of elimination of drugs excreted by the kidneys is proportional to the GFR. If the patient is oliguric, the creatinine clearance  can  be  approximated  by  a  value  of  5  mL/min.  If the normal drug regimen starts with a loading dose to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels, the following guidelines may be used: If a ft er  clinical  examination, the extracellular fl uid volume appears to be normal, use the loading dose suggested for  patients  with  normal  renal  function.  If  the  extracellular fl uid is contracted, reduce the loading dose. If the extracellular fl uid is expanded, use a higher loading dose. Th ere are also  formulas  to  calculate  loading  and  maintenance  doses based on renal function, depending on either the fraction of drug excreted in the urine or the di ff erence in drug half-life in patients with normal renal function and those with impaired function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  medications  with  wide  therapeutic  ranges  or  long plasma  half-lives,  the  interval  between  doses  is  generally increased. For medications with narrow therapeutic ranges or short plasma half-lives, reduced doses at normal intervals are advised. In reality, a combination of the two methods of dosage adjustment is frequently used (Table 17-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the high morbidity and mortality, only lifesaving surgery should be undertaken in patients with AKI. Th e principles that guide the management of anesthesia are the same as those that guide supportive treatment of AKI, namely, maintenance of an adequate systemic blood pressure and cardiac output and the avoidance of further renal insults, including hypovolemia,  hypoxia,  and  exposure  to  nephrotoxins.  Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is mandatory, as are frequent blood gas analyses and electrolyte measurements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  general,  the  administration  of  diuretics  to  maintain urine output in those patients who are not oliguric has not been shown to improve either renal outcome or patient survival. However, when a dilutional anemia has been caused by overzealous hydration, use of diuretics may minimize the risk of fl uid  overload  caused  by  the  administration  of  blood  or

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the progressive, irreversible deterioration of renal function that results from a wide variety of  diseases  (Table  17-8).  In  the  United  States,  diabetes  mellitus  is  the  leading  cause  of  end-stage  renal  disease  (ESRD), followed closely by systemic hypertension. Th e clinical manifestations of CKD are typically independent of the initial insult and instead re fl ect the overall inability of the kidneys to excrete nitrogenous waste products, regulate fl uid and electrolyte balance, and secrete hormones. In most patients, regardless of the cause, a decrease in the GFR to less than 25 mL/min eventually progresses to ESRD requiring dialysis or transplantation (Table 17-9).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  best  source  of  data  on  the  incidence  and  etiology  of CKD and ESRD is the U.S. Renal Data System of the National Institutes of Health. According to these data, in 2008 the prevalence of ESRD reached 1699 per million, or approximately half  a  million  individuals.  Prevalence  continues  to  increase, partly  due  to  aging  of  the  population  and  partly  because patients with ESRD are surviving longer. However, the incidence of ESRD has fl attened and is quoted as 351 per million in 2008, or more than 112,000 individuals.

the incidence of ESRD among African American and Native American populations is 3.6  and  1.8  times  greater,  respectively, than the rate among whites. Th e rate of ESRD among Hispanics  is  1.5  times  higher  than  among  non-Hispanics. Furthermore,  African  Americans  and  Hispanics  tend  to reach  ESRD  at  a  younger  age  than  whites.  Hypertensive nephropathy accounts for a relatively  higher  proportion  of ESRD cases among African Americans compared with other racial or ethnic groups. A combination of genetic variables and  disparities  in  health  care  access  are  likely  to  underlie these di ff erences.

Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  of  CKD  are  o ft en  undetectable  (Table  17-10).  When symptoms  do  appear,  complaints  are  nonspeci fi c,  such  as fatigue, malaise, and anorexia. In most patients the diagnosis is made during routine testing. In addition to serum creatinine level, urinary sediment analysis is helpful in establishing the diagnosis and possible cause of renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intrarenal  hemodynamic changes (glomerular hypertension, glomerular  hyper fi ltration  and  permeability  changes,  glomerulosclerosis) are likely responsible for progression of renal disease. Decreases in both systemic and glomerular hypertension  can  be  achieved  by  the  administration  of  angiotensinconverting enzyme  (ACE)  inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor  blockers  (ARBs).  In  addition  to  having  bene fi cial e ff ects on intraglomerular hemodynamics and systemic pressures,  ACE  inhibitors  and  ARBs  have  renoprotective  e ff ects that manifest as reductions in proteinuria and slowing of the progression  of  glomerulosclerosis  in  patients  with  diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy. Other antihypertensive drugs that lower the systemic pressure to similar degrees do not provide comparable renoprotective e ff ects.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  animal  models,  protein  intake  can  in fl uence  the  progression of renal disease, and consequently, moderate protein restriction is recommended for all patients with renal insuffi ciency. In patients who are diabetic, strict control of blood glucose  concentrations  can  delay  the  onset  of  proteinuria and  slow  the  progression  of  nephropathy,  neuropathy,  and retinopathy. Th ere is no evidence in humans that restricting dietary  phosphate  or  lipid  intake  slows  the  progression  of renal disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adaptation to Chronic Kidney Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally functioning kidneys precisely regulate the concentrations of solutes and water in the extracellular fl uid despite large variations in daily dietary intake. Because of substantial renal reserve  function,  patients  with  CKD  o ft en  remain  relatively asymptomatic until renal function is less than 10% of normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e kidneys demonstrate three stages of adaptation to progressive impairment of renal function. Th e fi rst stage involves substances such as creatinine and urea, which are dependent largely on glomerular fi ltration for urinary excretion. As the GFR decreases, the plasma concentrations of these substances begin to rise, but the increase is not directly proportional to the  degree  of  GFR  impairment.  For  example,  serum  creatinine concentrations frequently remain within normal limits despite a 50% decrease in GFR. Beyond a certain point, however, when the renal reserve has been exhausted, even minimal further decreases in the GFR can result in signi fi cant increases in the serum creatinine and urea concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e second  stage  of adaptation  to progressive renal impairment is  seen  with  solutes  such  as  potassium.  Serum potassium  concentrations  are  maintained  within  normal limits until GFR approaches 10% of normal, at which point hyperkalemia  manifests.  As  nephrons  are  lost,  the  remaining nephrons increase their secretion of potassium through increased blood fl ow and increased sodium delivery to the collecting tubules. In addition, because aldosterone secretion increases in patients with renal failure, there is a greater loss of potassium through the gastrointestinal tract. Th is system of enhanced gastrointestinal secretion is an e ff ective compensatory mechanism in the presence of normal dietary intake of potassium but can be easily overwhelmed by an acute exogenous  potassium  load  (e.g.,  administration  of  potassium, such as during the perioperative period) or acute endogenous potassium load (e.g.,  hemolysis,  tissue  trauma  such  as  that associated with surgery).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  third stage of adaptation involves sodium homeostasis and regulation of the extracellular fl uid compartment volume. In contrast to the levels of other solutes, sodium balance remains intact despite progressive deterioration in renal function and variations in dietary intake. Nevertheless, the system can  be  overwhelmed  by  abruptly  increased  sodium  intake (resulting  in  volume  overload)  or  decreased  sodium  intake (resulting in volume depletion).

Complications

UREMIC SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uremic syndrome is  a  constellation  of  signs  and  symptoms (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, anemia, fatigue, coagulopathy)  that  re fl ect  the  kidney's  progressive  inability  to perform  its  excretory,  secretory,  and  regulatory  functions. Although it is questionable whether urea itself produces the signs and symptoms (except at high concentrations), the BUN concentration is a useful clinical indicator of the severity of the uremic syndrome and the patient's response to therapy. Th is is in contrast to the serum creatinine concentration, which correlates  poorly  with  uremic  symptoms.  Traditional  treatment of uremic syndrome is dietary protein restriction to decrease protein catabolism and urea production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL OSTEODYSTROPHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Changes in bone structure and mineralization are common in patients with progressive CKD. Th e most important factors are  secondary  hyperparathyroidism  and  decreased  vitamin D production by the kidneys. Decreased vitamin D production by the kidneys impairs intestinal absorption of calcium. Hypocalcemia stimulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion,  which  leads  to  bone  resorption  to  restore  serum  calcium concentrations. As the GFR decreases, there is a parallel decrease  in  phosphate  clearance  and  an  increase  in  serum phosphate concentrations. Th is results in reciprocal decreases in  serum  calcium  concentrations.  Radiographs  demonstrate evidence of bone demineralization. Further evidence of bone resorption is the presence of increased serum alkaline phosphatase  concentrations.  Treatment  of  renal  osteodystrophy is  intended  to  prevent  skeletal  complications  and  includes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
restriction of dietary phosphate intake and oral calcium and vitamin  D  supplementation.  Antacids  may  be  administered to  bind  phosphorus  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract;  however, magnesium-containing antacids introduce the risk of hypermagnesemia, and   aluminum-containing antacids are equally undesirable. If medical therapies fail to control hypocalcemia resulting from secondary hyperparathyroidism, subtotal parathyroidectomy is o ft en recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accumulation of aluminum in patients undergoing longterm  renal  dialysis,  although  decreasing  in  frequency,  may result  in  bone  pain,  fractures,  and  weakness.  Hyperparathyroidism seems to protect against aluminum-induced bone disease. If aluminum toxicity is present, deferoxamine chelation therapy is helpful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia  frequently  accompanies  CKD  and  is  presumed  to be responsible for many of the symptoms (fatigue, weakness, decreased  exercise  tolerance)  characteristic  of  uremic  syndrome. Th is anemia is normochromic and normocytic, and is due primarily to decreased erythropoietin production by the kidneys. Excess PTH appears also to contribute to anemia by replacing bone marrow with fi brous tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anemia  of  CKD  is  treated  with  recombinant  human erythropoietin or darbepoetin. Blood transfusions are avoided if  possible,  because  the  resultant  sensitization  to  antigens  of the  human  leukocyte  antigen  (HLA)  complex  makes  future kidney transplantation less successful. Intermittent injections of parenteral iron are recommended to maximize the response to  erythropoietin. Th e  development  or  exacerbation  of  systemic hypertension is a risk of erythropoietin administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UREMIC BLEEDING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with CKD have an increased tendency to bleed despite the  presence  of  a  normal  platelet  count,  prothrombin  time, and  plasma  thromboplastin  time. Th e  bleeding  time  is  the screening test that best correlates with the tendency to bleed. Hemorrhagic  episodes  (gastrointestinal  bleeding,  epistaxis, hemorrhagic pericarditis, subdural hematoma) are signi fi cant sources of morbidity in patients with CKD and contribute to persistent anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of uremic bleeding may include the administration of cryoprecipitate to provide factor VIII-vWF complex  or  the  use  of  desmopressin.  A  signi fi cant  deterrent  to the use of cryoprecipitate is the risk of viral disease transmission.  Desmopressin,  an  analogue  of  antidiuretic  hormone, increases circulating levels of factor VIII-vWF complex and thereby improves coagulation. In patients with uremia, the intravenous  infusion  or  subcutaneous  injection  of  desmopressin is particularly useful for preventing clinical hemorrhage when invasive procedures such as surgery are planned. Desmopressin  is  fast  acting  and  short-lived. Th e  maximal e ff ect is present within 2 to 4 hours and lasts for about 6 to 8 hours. Tachyphylaxis appears to develop with repeat doses and may be related to depletion of endothelial stores of vWF (Table 17-11).

Conjugated  estrogens  have  also  been  shown  to  improve bleeding times in patients with uremia. Th e time to onset of action is about 6 hours, but the e ff ects last for 14 to 21 days. It has also been observed that erythropoietin shortens bleeding  times  by  enhancing  platelet  aggregation  and  increasing platelet counts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEUROLOGIC CHANGES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic changes may be early manifestations of progressive  renal  insu ffi ciency.  Initially,  symptoms  may  be  mild (impaired  abstract  thinking,  insomnia,  irritability),  but  as renal disease progresses, more signi fi cant changes (seizures, obtundation, uremic encephalopathy, coma) may develop. A disabling complication of advanced renal failure is the development  of  a  distal,  symmetrical  mixed  motor  and  sensory polyneuropathy, marked by paresthesias or hyperesthesias or distal weakness of the lower extremities. Th e arms may also be a ff ected, but the incidence is less than in the legs. Diabetic neuropathy  may  be  superimposed  on  uremic  neuropathy. Hemodialysis may improve some aspects of uremic encephalopathy  and  reduce  the  severity  of  peripheral  neurologic symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CARDIOVASCULAR CHANGES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic  hypertension  is  the  most  signi fi cant  risk  factor accompanying CKD and contributes to the congestive heart failure,  coronary  artery  disease,  and  cerebrovascular  disease that  occur  in  these  patients.  Uncontrolled  systemic  hypertension  also  speeds  the  progression  of  renal  dysfunction. Th e  pathogenesis of systemic hypertension in these patients involves intravascular volume expansion resulting from retention of sodium and water and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dyslipidemias are common at all stages of CKD and increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Along with lifestyle  and  dietary  modi fi cations,  therapy  is  advised  when fasting triglyceride levels are 500 mg/dL or higher and/or lowdensity lipoprotein levels are 100 mg/dL or more.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Silent  myocardial  ischemia  is  probably  common  due to  peripheral  neuropathy.  Chemical  stress  testing  may

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
be  preferred  to  exercise  stress  testing,  because  patients  in renal failure are o ft en unable to exercise adequately. However,  dipyridamole  thallium  testing  may  be  less  accurate in  patients  with  uremia,  probably  as  a  result  of  decreased sensitivity  of  the  microvasculature  to  dipyridamole. Th e baseline  electrocardiogram  may  be  altered  by  metabolic derangements. For unknown reasons, baseline plasma creatine  kinase  concentrations  are  commonly  increased  in patients with CKD. Because this increase is accounted for principally by the MM isoenzyme, the value of the MB fraction for diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction remains intact.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dialysis  is  the  indicated  treatment  for  patients  who  are hypertensive because of hypervolemia (volume is removed to attain  "dry  weight")  and  those  who  develop  uremic  pericarditis.  Dialysis  is  less  likely  to  control  systemic  hypertension because  of  activation  of  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Increasing dosages of antihypertensive drugs are recommended for these patients. ACE inhibitors are used cautiously in patients in whom GFR is dependent on increased e ff erent arteriolar vasoconstriction (bilateral renal artery stenosis, transplanted kidney with unilateral stenosis), which is mediated by angiotensin II. Administration of ACE inhibitors to these patients can result in e ff erent arteriolar dilation and decreased  GFR,  leading  to  a  sudden  deterioration  in  renal function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac tamponade and hemodynamic instability associated with uremic pericarditis is an indication for prompt drainage of the effusion, often via placement of a percutaneous pericardial catheter. In occasional patients, surgical drainage with creation of a pericardial window or pericardiectomy  is  necessary.  The  development  of  hypotension unresponsive  to  intravascular  fluid  volume  replacement may  be  an  important  clue  that  cardiac  tamponade  is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of patients with CKD includes aggressive treatment of the underlying cause, pharmacologic therapy to delay disease progression and prevent complications, and preparation for renal replacement therapy as ESRD ensues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BLOOD PRESSURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since hypertension is both a cause and a consequence of CKD and is directly correlated with deterioration of renal function, blood pressure control is imperative. Hypertension in CKD is di ffi cult to treat, and most patients require therapy with three or more antihypertensive agents to achieve target blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg). Considering that a driving force in the pathophysiology of CKD is the renin-angiotensin-  aldosterone system,  most  guidelines  recommend  treatment  with  either ACE inhibitors or ARBs, whether or not hypertension is present.  Treatment  with  these  agents  has  been  shown  in  many clinical trials to decrease proteinuria, slow the progression of renal  dysfunction,  and  reduce  mortality  and  cardiac  events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
β -Blockers (speci fi cally carvedilol) and diuretics are also commonly used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NUTRITION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of studies involving both diabetic and nondiabetic patients  with  CKD  have  demonstrated  that  modest  protein restriction reduces the progression of renal disease. However, an overly restrictive diet places patients at risk for malnutrition and its associated complications. A daily protein intake of 0.6 to 0.8 mg/kg is currently advised.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dietary phosphorus should be restricted to 800 to 1000 mg/ day when serum phosphorus or PTH levels are elevated. Phosphate binders are used when dietary restriction alone is ineffective.  Vitamin  D  supplementation  is  also  sometimes  used to help normalize phosphorus and calcium levels. In patients with advanced disease and chronic metabolic acidosis, administration  of  alkali  salts  is  advised.  Sodium  intake  should  be restricted to less than 2.4 g/day to prevent hypertension and fl uid overload.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term  follow-up  of  diabetic  patients  with  CKD  has shown that euglycemia is associated with reversal of the typical  lesions  seen  in  diabetic  nephropathy  and  a  reduction  in proteinuria.  However,  this  is  a  long-term  change,  and  the bene fi ts  may  not  manifest  for  5  to  10  years.  Current  guidelines recommend a glycosylated hemoglobin level of less than 7%. Metformin is recommended for most patients with type 2  diabetes  and  stable  stage  1,  2,  or  3  CKD.  However,  owing to the risk of lactic acid accumulation, metformin should be discontinued if there are acute changes in renal function or the patient is at risk of such changes, such as during illness or in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia  o ft en  accompanies  CKD  and  is  associated  with  a decreased health-related quality of life. Th e decision to initiate  treatment  should  be  individualized,  with  consideration of the  potential  bene fi ts  and  risks  of  therapy.  Anemia  is responsive to treatment with erythropoietin in all stages of CKD. In general, the target hemoglobin level should be in the range of 11 to 12 mg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dialysis  is  usually  advised  when  the  GFR  reaches  15  mL/ min/1.73 m 2  or less. Th ere is clear evidence that the dialysis dose  is  signi fi cantly  correlated  with  survival.  Since  clinical signs and symptoms are not reliable indicators of dialysis adequacy, the delivered dose should be measured and monitored routinely (Table 17-12). Dialysis dose can be calculated from a number of di ff erent formulas or models. All of them essentially measure the clearance of urea by estimating the di ff erence in predialysis and postdialysis plasma BUN levels. Urea is used to calculate dialysis dose because it is a small, readily dialyzed solute that accounts for 90% of the waste nitrogen that accumulates between hemodialysis treatments. Furthermore, the fractional clearance of urea has been shown to correlate with morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients.

Hemodialysis and Associated Clinical Challenges

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodialysis involves the di ff usion of solutes across a semipermeable membrane between the blood and a dialysis solution. Th is results in the removal of metabolic waste products and excess fl uid volume, as well as the replenishment of body bu ff ers. During the procedure, blood is heparinized and passed through a plastic dialyzer. Th e dose of dialysis, type of dialysis membrane, and solute clearance are the most important modifi able factors. A typical dialysis session lasts for 3 or 4 hours and results in a 65% to 70% reduction in BUN. Th e annual mortality for patients receiving hemodialysis is nearly 25% and is most o ft en attributed to cardiovascular causes or infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vascular Access. A surgically created vascular access site is necessary for e ff ective hemodialysis. Native arteriovenous fi stulas (cephalic vein anastomosed to the radial artery) are superior to polytetra fl uoroethylene gra ft s as sites of vascular access because of their longer life span and lower incidence of  thrombosis  and  infection. Th e  most  common  accessrelated  complication  is  intimal  hyperplasia,  which  results in stenosis proximal to the venous anastomosis. Other complications  related  to  access  include  thrombosis,  infection, aneurysm formation,  and  limb  ischemia.  When  dialysis  is urgently  required,  vascular  access  is  obtained  with  a  double-lumen dialysis catheter, most o ft en using the jugular or femoral vein.

Complications

I ntradialytic C omplications . Hypotension  is the most common adverse event during hemodialysis and most likely  re fl ects  osmolar  shi ft s  and  ultra fi ltration-induced  volume depletion. Hypotensive episodes may also be due to myocardial ischemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, or pericardial e ff usion with  cardiac  tamponade.  Arrhythmias  may  be  due  to  rapid changes  in  potassium  concentration.  Most  hypotensive  episodes are successfully treated by slowing the rate of ultra fi ltration and/or administering intravenous saline.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypersensitivity reactions to the ethylene oxide used to sterilize dialysis machines, as well as adverse reactions to the speci fi c  hemodialysis  membrane  material  polyacrylonitrile,  may occur. Reactions to polyacrylonitrile are seen most commonly in  patients  receiving  ACE  inhibitors.  When  blood  comes  in contact with the polyacrylonitrile membrane, the membrane's high negative surface charge stabilizes enzymes, which generate bradykinins. Normally, bradykinin is degraded by kinases, but ACE inhibitors block this response, and profound peripheral vasodilation and hypotension occurs.

Dialysis  disequilibrium  syndrome  is  marked  by  nausea, headaches, and fatigue, but may progress to seizures or coma.

During  progressive renal failure, catabolism and anorexia lead to loss of lean body mass, but concomitant fl uid retention masks weight loss and may  even  lead  to  weight  gain.  Protein-calorie  malnutrition is  extremely  common.  Decreased  oral  intake,  hemodialysisinduced catabolism, and hormonal imbalances are common factors.  Amino  acids  as  well  as  water-soluble  vitamins  are removed by dialysis, which contributes to malnutrition. Routine assessment of nutritional status using plasma biomarkers (albumin, prealbumin) is advised, and many patients bene fi t from oral or parenteral nutritional supplements.

Th ere is no justi fi cation for stringent restriction of dietary potassium in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Patients with ESRD  have  decreased  total  body  potassium  stores  and  an inexplicable tolerance of hyperkalemia. Th e expected cardiac and neuromuscular responses to hyperkalemia are less pronounced in patients receiving hemodialysis than in those with normal renal function. Clearance of potassium by hemodialysis is e ffi cient, and because most potassium is intracellular, it is likely that hypokalemia will be suggested by a blood sample obtained  soon  a ft er  completion  of  hemodialysis  and  before transcellular equilibration has occurred.

Patients should receive counseling with regard to regulation of sodium and fl uid intake. Normal weight gain between dialysis treatments is 3% to 4% of total body mass.

It  is  recommended that all patients receiving hemodialysis  be  immunized  against  pneumococcus,  hepatitis  B  virus, and in fl uenza virus. Malnutrition or inadequate dialysis may impair antibody response to vaccines, however, and the diagnosis of infection may be di ffi cult because many patients do not show typical symptoms such as fever.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tuberculosis in patients receiving hemodialysis is usually extrapulmonary  and  o ft en  presents  with  atypical  symptoms that  mimic  those  of  inadequate  dialysis.  Because  anergy  in response to skin testing is common, unexplained weight loss and anorexia, with or without persistent fever, should prompt further testing to rule out tuberculosis.

Hepatitis B or C virus infection in patients receiving hemodialysis  is  o ft en  asymptomatic,  and  liver  aminotransferase concentrations  may  not  be  increased.  A  substantial  proportion  of  patients  undergoing  hemodialysis  have  antibodies to hepatitis C. Of note, dosage adjustments of drugs used to treat human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV) infection are not required during hemodialysis.

Peritoneal Dialysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peritoneal  dialysis  requires  placing  an  anchored  plastic catheter in the peritoneal cavity for infusion of a dialysate that  remains  in  place  for  several  hours.  During  that  time, di ff usive solute transport occurs across the peritoneal membrane until fresh fl uid is exchanged for the old fl uid. Automated  peritoneal  dialysis,  in  which  a  mechanized  cycler infuses  and  drains  peritoneal  dialysate  at  night,  is  used  in many patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peritoneal dialysis may be desirable for patients with congestive heart failure or unstable angina who may not tolerate the rapid fl uid shi ft s or fl uctuations in systemic blood pressure that o ft en accompany hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis is  also  indicated  for  patients  with  extensive  vascular  disease  that  prevents  the  creation  of  a  vascular  access  site  for hemodialysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  patients  with  diabetes,  insulin  can  be  infused  with the  dialysate  to  provide  precise  regulation  of  blood  glucose concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of abdominal hernias or adhesions may interfere with the ability to use peritoneal dialysis e ff ectively. Peritonitis presenting as abdominal pain and fever is the most common serious  complication  of  peritoneal  dialysis.  Treatment  is  with antibiotics,  which  may  include  cephalosporins,  aminoglycosides, and vancomycin. Survival rates and annual costs are similar with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, but hospitalization rates are higher among patients treated with peritoneal dialysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug Clearance in Patients Undergoing Dialysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who are undergoing dialysis require special consideration with respect to drug dosing intervals. Supplemental dosing may be needed for drugs that are cleared by dialysis. When possible, drug doses are best scheduled for administration a ft er completion of a dialysis session.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug properties that in fl uence clearance by dialysis include protein binding, water solubility, and  molecular  weight.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low-molecular-weight (<500 Da), water-soluble, nonproteinbound drugs are readily cleared by dialysis. Continuous renal replacement therapies, such as continuous venovenous hemofi ltration  and  continuous  arteriovenous  hemo fi ltration,  e ffi -ciently remove drugs unless they are bound to protein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Hemodialysis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients should undergo adequate dialysis within 24 hours of elective surgery to minimize the likelihood of volume overload, hyperkalemia, and uremic bleeding. Depending on the planned surgery, the use of heparin may be avoided or minimized  during  preoperative  hemodialysis.  Patients  receiving peritoneal dialysis who are undergoing abdominal surgery are generally switched to hemodialysis in the immediately postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Urgent hemodialysis is not required a ft er radiocontrast dye studies  in  those  who  are  undergoing  regular  hemodialysis. Although these dyes can be removed by hemodialysis, the volume administered in most studies does not result in pulmonary edema in patients maintained on an adequate dialysis regimen, and nephrotoxicity is not a concern in patients with ESRD.

Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  CKD  requires an  understanding  of  the  pathologic  changes  that  accompany  renal  disease,  co-existing  medical  conditions,  and  the impact of reduced renal function on drug pharmacokinetics (Table 17-13). Optimal management of modi fi able risk factors and the development of an anesthetic management plan aimed at minimizing further kidney injury are imperative.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation of patients with CKD includes consideration of renal function, underlying pathologic processes, and comorbid conditions. In addition to identifying patients with preexisting renal dysfunction, it is important to recognize those who are at high risk of developing perioperative renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation of the trend in serum creatinine concentration is useful to determine whether renal function is stable. Blood volume status may be estimated by comparing body weight before and a ft er hemodialysis, monitoring vital signs (orthostatic  hypotension, tachycardia), and measuring atrial fi lling pressures. Because diabetes is o ft en present in these patients, glucose  management  is  of  concern.  Blood  pressure  should be  well  controlled  before  elective  surgery.  Antihypertensive therapy is frequently continued; however, ACE inhibitors and ARBs are o ft en withheld on the day of surgery to reduce the risk  of  intraoperative  hypotension.  Preoperative  medication must be individualized, with recognition that these patients may exhibit unexpected sensitivity to central nervous system depressant drugs.

A common recommendation is that the serum potassium concentration  should  not  exceed  5.5  mEq/L  on  the  day  of surgery. Th e  patient  should  be  evaluated  preoperatively  for

the presence of anemia, but the introduction of recombinant human erythropoietin therapy has decreased the number of patients with renal failure who come for elective surgery with a  hematocrit of less than 30%. Th e  preoperative presence of a coagulopathy may be addressed with the administration of desmopressin. Gastric aspiration prophylaxis should be considered, especially in diabetic patients. However, all H 2 -receptor blockers are excreted renally; therefore dosage adjustment is  required.  Patients  maintained  on  dialysis  should  undergo dialysis within the 24 hours preceding elective surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation can be safely accomplished with most of the intravenous drugs (propofol, etomidate,  thiopental). Th iopental  has  an  increased  volume of distribution and reduced protein binding in patients with CKD; therefore,  a  dose  reduction  is  advised.  Many  patients with ESRD respond to induction of anesthesia as if they were hypovolemic. Th e  likelihood  of  hypotension  is  increased by uremia as well as by the administration of antihypertensives. Exaggerated central nervous system e ff ects of anesthetic induction drugs may also re fl ect uremia-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  indicated,  rapid-sequence  induction  with  succinylcholine may be performed if the potassium concentration is less than 5.5  mg/dL.  Potassium  release  following  administration of  succinylcholine  is  not  exaggerated  in  patients  with  CKD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alternatively, a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant with a short onset of action, such as rocuronium, may be selected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Attenuated  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity  impairs compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction; thus, small decreases  in  blood  volume,  institution  of  positive  pressure ventilation, abrupt changes in body position, or drug-induced myocardial depression can result in an exaggerated decrease in systemic blood pressure. Patients being treated with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may be at increased risk of experiencing intraoperative hypotension, especially in the setting of acute surgical blood loss or neuraxial anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A balanced anesthetic technique using a volatile agent, muscle relaxant, and opioids is most o ft en employed. Elimination of volatile anesthetics is not dependent on renal function. Sevofl urane may be avoided because of concerns related to fl uoride nephrotoxicity or production of compound A, although there is no evidence that patients with co-existing renal disease are at increased risk of renal dysfunction a ft er administration of sevo fl urane. Total intravenous anesthesia is also an option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potent volatile anesthetics are useful for controlling intraoperative  systemic  hypertension  and  decreasing  the  doses of  muscle  relaxants  needed  for  adequate  surgical  relaxation. Excessive  depression  of  cardiac  output  is  a  potential  hazard of volatile anesthetics. Decreases in blood fl ow must be minimized to avoid jeopardizing oxygen delivery to the tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Selection of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants for maintenance of skeletal muscle paralysis during surgery is in fl uenced by the known clearance mechanisms of these drugs. Renal disease may  slow excretion of  vecuronium  and rocuronium, whereas clearance of mivacurium, atracurium, and cisatracurium from plasma is independent of renal function.  Renal  failure  may  delay  clearance  of  laudanosine,  the principal metabolite of atracurium and cisatracurium. Laudanosine  lacks  e ff ects  at  the  neuromuscular  junction,  but at  high plasma concentrations, it may stimulate the central nervous system. Regardless of the drug selected, it is prudent to decrease the initial dose and administer subsequent doses based  on  the  responses  observed  using  a  peripheral  nerve stimulator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opioids  are  useful  because  they  lack  cardiodepressant e ff ects and may help minimize the need for volatile anesthetics.  Both  morphine and meperidine undergo metabolism to potentially neurotoxic compounds (morphine-3-glucoronide and  normeperidine,  respectively)  that  rely  on  renal  clearance. Morphine-6-glucoronide, a morphine metabolite more  potent  that  its  parent  compound,  may  also  accumulate in patients with CKD and result in profound respiratory depression.  Hydromorphone  also  has  an  active  metabolite, hydromorphone-3-glucoronide, that may accumulate in patients  with  CKD;  however,  hydromorphone  may  be  used safely  with  proper  monitoring and dose adjustment. Alfentanil, fentanyl, remifentanil, and sufentanil lack active metabolites.  However,  the  elimination  half-life  of  fentanyl  may  be prolonged in patients with CKD.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  excretion  accounts  for  approximately  50%  of  the clearance of neostigmine and approximately 75% of the elimination  of  edrophonium  and  pyridostigmine. Th erefore,  the risk of recurarization following reversal of muscle relaxant is low, because the half-lives of these agents are likely to be prolonged to a greater extent than the half-lives of the nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fluid Management and Urine Output

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with severe renal dysfunction who do not require hemodialysis  and  those  without  renal  disease  undergoing operations associated with a high incidence of postoperative renal  failure  may  bene fi t  from  preoperative  hydration  with balanced  salt  solutions.  Indeed,  most  patients  come  to  the operating room with a contracted extracellular fl uid volume. A bolus of balanced salt solution to restore circulating volume (500 mL IV) should increase urine output in the presence of hypovolemia. Lactated Ringer's solution (potassium 4 mEq/L) or other potassium-containing fl uids should be used with caution.  Maintaining  a  urine  output  of  at  least  0.5  mL/kg/hr  is generally considered reasonable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stimulation  of  urine  output  with  osmotic  (mannitol)  or tubular  (furosemide)  diuretics  in  the  absence  of  adequate intravascular fl uid volume replacement is not advised. Intraoperative urine output has not been shown to be predictive of  postoperative  renal  insu ffi ciency.  Indeed,  the  most  likely cause of oliguria is an inadequate circulating fl uid volume, and administration of diuretics in this setting may further compromise renal function. Preliminary results suggest that fenoldopam, a dopamine-1 agonist, may provide renal protection in patients at high risk who are undergoing cardiac, vascular, or transplant surgery. A dose of 0.1 mcg/kg/min initiated at the induction of surgery may therefore be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients dependent on hemodialysis require special attention  with  respect  to  perioperative fl uid  management.  An absence of renal function narrows the margin of safety between insu ffi cient  and  excessive fl uid  administration.  Noninvasive operations require replacement of only insensible water losses. Th e small amount of urine output can be replaced with 0.45% sodium chloride. Th oracic or abdominal surgery can be associated with loss of signi fi cant intravascular fl uid volume to the interstitial spaces. Th is loss is o ft en replaced with balanced salt solutions or colloid. Blood transfusions are considered if the oxygen-carrying capacity must be increased or if blood loss is excessive. Measuring the central venous pressure is o ft en useful for guiding fl uid replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To preserve blood vessels for future dialysis access, venipuncture should be avoided entirely in the nondominant arm, as well as in the upper part of the dominant arm. Similarly, it is recommended that radial and ulnar artery cannulation be avoided in case these vessels are needed for an arteriovenous fi stula in the future. Th e same may be said of the brachial and even the axillary arteries. Use of the femoral arteries carries the risk of line infection, particularly since these patients may already be immunocompromised. Remaining options include the  dorsalis  pedis  or  posterior  tibial  arteries,  which  may  be inconvenient  because  of  positioning  or  di ffi cult  to  access because  of  edema  and  tissue  induration.  Whichever  site  is chosen, it is important to note that neither the arterial pressure nor the arterial blood gas concentrations will be accurate if the cannula is placed in the same extremity as a functioning or partially patent fi stula.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous  pressure  monitoring  is  o ft en  extremely  helpful, if not necessary, since a volume load is not well tolerated by patients  with  even  modest  decreases  in  renal  function. Th e choice of right atrial or pulmonary artery pressure monitoring is guided by the presence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease. Strict asepsis must be maintained when placing these lines, because patients with CKD are extremely prone to infection. Central venous access may be di ffi cult in patients who have  a  tunneled  venous  access  device  or  temporary  dialysis catheter in situ or who have had many such catheters previously  placed  with  subsequent  stenosis  of  the  veins.  Transesophageal  echocardiography  is  an  additional  option  for monitoring hemodynamic status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although their use is discouraged, temporary dialysis catheters may be employed if intravenous access proves di ffi cult. However, it must be remembered that (1) the catheter must be accessed aseptically, just as it is at the time of dialysis; (2) heparin must be aspirated before connecting to an intravenous line or pressure transducer; and (3) heparin must be reintroduced and the line aseptically sealed at the discontinuation of its use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Associated Concerns

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Attention  to  patient  positioning  on  the  operating  room table is important. Poor nutritional status renders the skin particularly prone to bruising and sloughing, and extra padding is  required  to  protect  vulnerable  nerves  around  the  elbows, knees, and ankles. Fistulas must be protected at all costs and be well padded to prevent pressure injury. Blood pressure cu ff s should not be applied to the arm with the fi stula. If at all possible, the arm with the fi stula should not be tucked but should be positioned so that the fi stula thrill can be checked periodically throughout surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial  anesthesia  may  be  considered  in  patients  with CKD. A sympathetic blockade of T4 to T10 levels may theoretically improve renal perfusion by attenuating catecholamineinduced renal vasoconstriction and suppressing the surgical stress response. However, platelet dysfunction and the e ff ects of  residual  heparin  in  patients  receiving  hemodialysis  must also be considered. In addition, adequate intravascular fl uid volume must be maintained to minimize hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Brachial plexus blockade is useful for placing the vascular shunts necessary for long-term hemodialysis. In addition to providing  analgesia,  this  form  of  regional  anesthesia  abolishes  vasospasm  and  produces  vasodilation  that  facilitates the surgical procedure. Th e suggestion that the duration of brachial plexus anesthesia is shortened in patients with CKD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
has not been con fi rmed in controlled studies. Th e presence of  uremic  neuropathies  should  be  excluded  before  induction  of  regional  anesthesia.  Co-existing  metabolic  acidosis may decrease the threshold for seizures in response to local anesthetics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  residual  neuromuscular  blockade  a ft er  apparent reversal  of  nondepolarizing  neuromuscular  blockade  with anticholinesterase drugs is rare, this diagnosis should be considered  in  anephric  patients  who  manifest  signs  of  skeletal muscle weakness during the early postoperative period. Other explanations (antibiotics, acidosis, electrolyte imbalance) should also be considered when muscle weakness persists or reappears in patients with renal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Caution should be exercised in the use of parenteral opioids  for  postoperative  analgesia  in  view  of  the  potential  in these patients for exaggerated central nervous system depression  and  hypoventilation  a ft er  administration  of  even  small doses of opioids. Administration of naloxone may be necessary if depression of ventilation is severe. Selection of opioids that  do  not  have  active  metabolites  and  do  not  rely  on  the kidneys for excretion is appropriate. Nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory agents are best avoided, because they may exacerbate hypertension, precipitate edema, and increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram is helpful for  detecting  cardiac  dysrhythmias,  such  as  those  related  to hyperkalemia. Continuation of supplemental oxygen into the postoperative period is a consideration, especially if anemia is  present. It is prudent to check levels of electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine as well as hematocrit postoperatively. A chest radiograph may be useful if pulmonary edema is a concern. Uremic coagulopathy should be considered in the workup of postoperative bleeding. Controversy exists over the preferred maintenance fl uid  for  patients  with  CKD.  Although  0.9% saline was traditionally favored because it lacks potassium, it may exacerbate preexisting acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Candidates for renal transplantation are selected from among patients with ESRD who are being maintained on established programs of long-term renal replacement therapy. In adults, the most common causes of ESRD are diabetes mellitus, systemic hypertension, and glomerulonephritis. Despite concerns regarding  recurrence  of  disease  in  the  donor  kidney,  such disease generally progresses slowly. A kidney from a cadaver donor can be preserved by perfusion at low temperatures for up to 48 hours, which makes its transplantation a semi-elective surgical procedure. Attempts are made to match HLA antigens and ABO blood groups between donor and recipient. Paradoxically, the presence of certain common shared HLA antigens in the blood administered to a potential transplant recipient has been observed to induce tolerance to donor antigens and thus improve gra ft survival. Th e donor kidney is placed in the lower abdomen and receives its vascular supply from the iliac vessels. Th e ureter is anastomosed directly to the bladder. Immunosuppressive therapy is instituted during the perioperative period.

Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GENERAL ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although both regional and general anesthesia have been successfully used for renal transplantation, general anesthesia is more  common.  General  anesthesia  o ff ers  the  advantage  of allowing controlled ventilation, because respiratory mechanics may be compromised by surgical retraction in the area of the  diaphragm.  Renal  function  a ft er  kidney  transplantation is  not predictably in fl uenced by choice of volatile anesthetic. Decreased  cardiac  output  resulting  from  negative  inotropic e ff ects of volatile anesthetics is minimized to avoid jeopardizing the adequacy of tissue oxygen delivery (especially if anemia is present) and to promote renal perfusion. A high-normal systemic blood pressure is required in the presence of euvolemia to maintain adequate urine fl ow. Th e selection of muscle relaxants  is  in fl uenced  by  their  dependence  on  renal  clearance. In  this  regard,  atracurium  and  cisatracurium  are  attractive selections,  because  their  clearance  from  the  plasma  is  organ independent. A newly transplanted kidney is able to clear neuromuscular blockers and the anticholinesterase drugs used for their reversal at the same rate as healthy native kidneys.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Central venous pressure monitoring is useful for guiding the rate and volume of crystalloid infusions. Optimal hydration during the intraoperative period is intended to maximize renal blood fl ow and improve early function of the transplanted kidney. Mannitol is o ft en administered to facilitate urine formation by the newly transplanted kidney and to reduce the risk of acute tubular necrosis. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that facilitates urine output by decreasing excess tissue and intravascular fl uid. In addition, mannitol increases renal blood fl ow through the local release of prostaglandins. Albumin may also be helpful when a cadaveric kidney is transplanted to expand intravascular volume and promote urine production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the vascular clamps are released, renal preservative solution  from  the  transplanted  kidney  and  venous  drainage from the legs are released into the circulation. Cardiac arrest has  been  described  a ft er  completion  of  the  arterial  anastomosis to the transplanted kidney and release of the vascular clamp. Th is event is most likely due to sudden hyperkalemia caused by washout of the potassium-containing preservative solutions from the newly perfused kidney. Unclamping may also  be  followed  by  hypotension  resulting  from  the  abrupt addition of up to 300 mL to the capacity of the intravascular fl uid space and the release of vasodilating chemicals from previously ischemic tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REGIONAL ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  advantage  of  regional  anesthesia  compared  with  general anesthesia  is  avoidance  of  the  need  for  tracheal  intubation and  administration  of  neuromuscular  blocking  drugs. Th is

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
advantage is negated, however, if regional anesthesia must be extensively supplemented with injected or inhaled agents. Furthermore, blockade of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, as produced by regional anesthesia, can complicate control of systemic blood pressure, especially considering the unpredictable intravascular fl uid volume status of many of these patients. Th e use of regional anesthesia, particularly epidural anesthesia, is controversial in the presence of abnormal coagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  newly  transplanted  kidney  may  undergo  acute  immunologic  rejection,  which  manifests  in  the  vasculature  of  the transplanted kidney. It can be so rapid that inadequate circulation is evident almost immediately a ft er the blood supply to the  kidney  is  established. Th e  only  treatment  for  this  acute rejection reaction is removal of the transplanted kidney, especially if the rejection process is accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation. A hematoma also may arise in the gra ft postoperatively, causing vascular or ureteral obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Delayed  signs  of  gra ft rejection  include  fever,  local  tenderness,  and  deterioration  of  urine  output.  Treatment  with high  doses  of  corticosteroids  and  antilymphocyte  globulin may be helpful. Th e acute tubular necrosis that occurs in the transplanted kidney secondary to prolonged ischemia usually responds to hemodialysis. Cyclosporine toxicity may also cause AKI. Ultrasonography and needle biopsy are performed to differentiate between the possible causes of kidney malfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Opportunistic infections resulting from long-term immunosuppression are common a ft er renal transplantation. Longterm  survival  is  unsatisfactory  in  renal  transplant  recipients who are immunosuppressed and who also carry hepatitis B surface antigen. Th e frequency of cancer is 30 to 100 times higher in transplant recipients than in the general population, which presumably re fl ects the loss of protective e ff ects resulting from immunosuppression. Large cell lymphoma is a well-recognized complication of transplantation; it occurs almost exclusively in patients with evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic Considerations in Renal Transplant Recipients Undergoing Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal transplant recipients are o ft en elderly individuals with co-existing cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Th e side e ff ects of immunosuppressant drugs (systemic hypertension, lowered seizure thresholds, anemia, thrombocytopenia) must be considered when planning the management of anesthesia in these patients. Serum creatinine concentrations are likely  to  be  normal in the presence of normally functioning renal gra ft s.  Nevertheless, the GFR and renal blood fl ow are likely to be lower than those in healthy individuals, and the activity of drugs excreted by the kidneys may be prolonged. Th e presence of azotemia, proteinuria, and systemic hypertension may indicate chronic rejection of the kidney transplant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs  that  are  potentially  nephrotoxic  or  dependent  on renal  clearance  should  be  avoided,  and  diuretics  should  be administered only a ft er careful evaluation of the patient's intravascular volume status. Decreases in renal blood fl ow resulting from hypovolemia or other causes should be minimized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PRIMARY DISEASES OF THE KIDNEYS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of pathologic processes can primarily involve the kidneys or occur in association with dysfunction of other organ systems. Knowledge of the associated pathologic features and other characteristics of these diseases is important when managing these patients during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomerulonephritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  glomerulonephritis  is  usually  due  to  deposition  of antigen-antibody  complexes  in  the  glomeruli. Th e  source  of antigens  may  be  exogenous  (a ft er  streptococcal  infection)  or endogenous  (collagen  vascular  diseases).  Clinical  manifestations  of  glomerular  disease  include  hematuria,  proteinuria, hypertension,  edema,  and  increased  serum  creatinine  concentration. Th e presence of urinary red blood cell casts is also highly  suggestive  of  renal  dysfunction  resulting  from  a  glomerular process. Proteinuria re fl ects an increase in glomerular permeability. Prompt diagnosis is important, because treatment with  immunosuppressive drugs may help prevent permanent kidney injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two general patterns of glomerular disease exist. A nephritic pattern  is  associated  with  in fl ammation and an active urine sediment containing red and white blood cells, and a variable amount of proteinuria. A nephrotic pattern is characterized by marked proteinuria and a relatively inactive urine sediment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nephrotic Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nephrotic  syndrome  is  de fi ned  as  daily  urinary  protein excretion exceeding 3.5 g associated with sodium retention, hyperlipoproteinemia,  and  thromboembolic  and  infectious complications.  Diabetic  nephropathy  is  the  most  frequent cause of nephrotic proteinuria. In the absence of diabetes, the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults is membranous  glomerulonephritis,  which  is  frequently  associated with  neoplasia  (carcinoma,  sarcoma,  lymphoma,  leukemia). HIV  infection  may  cause  nephrotic  proteinuria  and  renal insu ffi ciency; in some patients, this is the fi rst clinical manifestation of AIDS. Pregnancy-induced hypertension is also o ft en associated with nephrotic syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sodium  retention  and  edema  formation  in  patients  with nephrotic syndrome have been presumed to re fl ect decreased plasma oncotic pressure with resultant hypovolemia. Increased  tubular  reabsorption  of  sodium  was  assumed  to be a homeostatic response to hypovolemia. More recent evidence suggests that sodium retention is a primary event that precedes the development of proteinuria. Increased sodium reabsorption  by  the  distal  renal  tubules  may  be  due  to  an

inappropriately low natriuretic response to atrial natriuretic peptide.  Patients  with  nephrotic  syndrome  may  experience hypovolemia with associated orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia,  peripheral  vasoconstriction,  and  occasionally  even AKI in response to the administration of diuretics. Th e risk of AKI is increased in elderly patients and those who receive nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory  drugs.  Infusion  of  albumin corrects  the  clinical  signs  of  hypovolemia.  Hyperlipidemia accompanies nephrotic syndrome and may be associated with an increased risk of vascular disease.

THROMBOEMBOLIC COMPLICATIONS

Th romboembolic  complications  such  as  renal  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis are major  risks  in  patients  with  nephrotic  syndrome,  particularly those who have membranous glomerulonephritis. Arterial  thromboses are less common than venous thromboses, although  the  risk  of  acute  myocardial  infarction  in  these patients  may  be  increased.  Prophylactic  administration  of heparin or oral anticoagulants may be considered in patients at high risk.

Plasma levels of vitamins and hormones may be decreased in patients with nephrotic syndrome as a result of proteinuria. Hypoalbuminemia  decreases  the  available  binding  sites  for many drugs and increases the circulating levels of unbound drug. In this regard, when plasma drug levels are monitored, low levels of highly protein-bound drugs do not necessarily indicate low therapeutic concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nephrotic Edema

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Generalized edema is a function of an increase in total body sodium content. Potent loop diuretics such as furosemide are needed  to  o ff set  the  kidney's  propensity  to  retain  sodium.  In addition, thiazide or potassium-sparing diuretics may be added to decrease sodium reabsorption in the distal nephrons. Th e goal is to decrease edema slowly, because abrupt natriuresis may cause hypovolemia and even AKI; it may also produce hemoconcentration, which increases the risk of thromboembolic complications. Albumin solutions are administered to expand the plasma volume only if symptomatic hypovolemia is present. In particularly severe cases, plasma ultra fi ltration may be considered.

Goodpasture's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Goodpasture's  syndrome  is  a  rare  autoimmune  disease  that manifests as rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis in combination  with  pulmonary  hemorrhage.  It  occurs  most  o ft en in young males. Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies  account  for  renal  dysfunction  and  apparently  also react with similar antigens in the lungs, producing alveolitis and  subsequent  hemoptysis.  Typically,  hemoptysis  precedes clinical  evidence  of  renal  disease.  Plasmapheresis  is  sometimes used to remove the disease-causing antibodies. Corticosteroids are also employed to reduce in fl ammatory damage. Th e prognosis is poor, and most patients develop renal failure within a year of diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interstitial Nephritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interstitial nephritis has been observed as an allergic reaction to drugs, including sulfonamides, allopurinol, phenytoin, and diuretics. Other less common causes include autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus) and in fi ltrative diseases (sarcoidosis).  Patients  exhibit  decreased  urine  concentrating ability, proteinuria, and systemic hypertension. Renal failure caused by acute interstitial nephritis is o ft en reversible a ft er withdrawal of the o ff ending agent or treatment of the underlying disease. Corticosteroid therapy may be bene fi cial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary Nephritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary  nephritis  (Alport's  syndrome)  is  o ft en  accompanied by hearing loss and ocular abnormalities. Th e  disorder is  more  common  in  males  than  in  females.  In  women,  the disease is usually mild, but in men, the symptoms are more severe and progressive. Drug therapy has not proven successful, although lowering the intraglomerular pressure with ACE inhibitors may slow the progression of renal disease. ESRD is likely before the age of 50.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polycystic Kidney Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder most commonly inherited  as  an  autosomal  dominant  trait. Th e  condition  is marked by the development of cysts in the kidney, as well as in  other  organs  such  as  the  liver  and  pancreas.  Intracranial aneurysms and cardiac valve abnormalities may also be present.  Mild  systemic  hypertension,  hematuria,  kidney  stones, and urinary tract infections are common. Th e disease typically progresses slowly until renal failure occurs during middle age. Hemodialysis or renal transplantation is eventually necessary in most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fanconi's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fanconi's  syndrome  results  from  inherited  or  acquired  disturbances of proximal renal tubular function. Th ere  is  renal loss of substances normally conserved by the proximal renal tubules, including potassium, bicarbonate, phosphate, amino acids,  glucose,  and  water.  Symptoms include polyuria, polydipsia,  metabolic  acidosis,  and  skeletal  muscle  weakness. Dwar fi sm and osteomalacia, re fl ecting loss of phosphate, are also  common,  and  patients  may  have  vitamin  D-resistant

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bartter's and Gitelman's Syndromes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bartter's  syndrome  and  Gitelman's  syndrome  are  inherited renal  salt-wasting  disorders  caused  by  defects  in  sodium, chloride, and potassium channels in the thick ascending limb of the distal convoluted tubule. Juxtaglomerular hyperplasia, hyperaldosteronism,  and  hypokalemic  acidosis  are  pathognomic of these disorders. Treatment relies on ACE inhibitors, spironolactone, and sodium and potassium supplementation. Th ese syndromes alone do not lead to renal failure. However, if patients develop ESRD for other reasons, transplantation of a kidney from a healthy donor results in normal renal solute handling.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Tubular Acidosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a syndrome that causes metabolic acidosis resulting from inappropriate acidi fi cation of the urine.  Several  subtypes  of  the  disorder  are  recognized.  Type 1 RTA is caused by impaired bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal renal tubule. Type 2 RTA is due to impaired secretion of hydrogen ions in the distal tubule. Th e result of either defect is a hypokalemic, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and inappropriately basic urine. Th ese conditions may be hereditary or secondary to an underlying systemic illness. Type 4 RTA also causes a metabolic acidosis, but is distinct from the other types in that it is associated with hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia. Type 4 RTA occurs when plasma aldosterone levels are inappropriately low or the kidney fails to respond to aldosterone normally. Type 4 RTA is o ft en seen in patients with CKD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nephrolithiasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
stones are composed of calcium oxalate and result from excess calcium  excretion  by  the  kidneys.  In  these  patients,  causes of hypercalcemia  (hyperparathyroidism, sarcoidosis,  cancer) must be considered. Urinary tract infections with ureasplitting organisms that produce ammonia favor the formation of  magnesium  ammonium  phosphate  stones.  Formation  of uric acid stones is favored by a persistently acidic urine (pH < 6.0), which decreases the solubility of uric acid. Approximately 50% of patients with uric acid stones have gout.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stones  in  the  renal  pelvis  are  typically  painless  unless their presence is complicated by infection or obstruction. By contrast,  renal  stones  passing  down  the  ureter  can  produce intense fl ank pain, o ft en radiating to the groin, associated with nausea and vomiting, and mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. Hematuria is common during ureteral passage of stones, whereas ureteral obstruction may precipitate renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of a renal stone depends on identifying the composition of the stone and correcting predisposing factors, such as hyperparathyroidism, urinary tract infection, or gout. High fl uid intake su ffi cient to maintain a daily urine output of 2 to 3  L  is  o ft en  part  of  the  therapy.  Extracorporeal  shock  wave lithotripsy is a noninvasive treatment for renal stones that uses focused, high-intensity acoustic impulses to break up stones into pieces that may be excreted in the urine. Th e advantages of this approach, as an alternative to percutaneous nephrolithotomy, are that it is associated with low morbidity and can be  performed  on  an  outpatient  basis.  Cardiac  dysrhythmias may occur during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, presumably as a result of premature stimulation of the atria by the electrical discharge that precedes each shock wave. Lithotripsy devices are equipped with electrocardiogram gating that helps limit the risk of ventricular fi brillation caused by the "R-on-T" phenomenon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Hypertension

Although the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis is poorly understood, several predisposing factors are recognized for the fi ve major  types  of  renal  stones  that  occur  (Table  17-14).  Most

Renal  disease  is  the  most  common  cause  of  secondary  systemic  hypertension.  Accelerated  or  malignant  hypertension is likely to be associated with renal disease. Furthermore, the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
appearance of systemic hypertension in young patients suggests the diagnosis of renal rather than essential hypertension. Hypertension due to renal dysfunction re fl ects parenchymal disease of the kidneys or renovascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic pyelonephritis and glomerulonephritis are parenchymal diseases o ft en associated with systemic hypertension, particularly in younger patients. Less common forms of renal parenchymal  disease  that  can  cause  systemic  hypertension include  diabetic  nephropathy,  cystic  disease  of  the  kidneys, and renal amyloidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renovascular disease is caused by narrowing of the renal arteries resulting from either fi bromuscular dysplasia or atheroma. Th e  sudden onset of a marked increase in systemic blood pressure or the presence of hypertension before the age of 30 years should arouse suspicion of renovascular disease. A bruit may be audible on auscultation of the abdomen over the kidneys. Systemic hypertension due to renovascular disease does not respond well to treatment with antihypertensive drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  mechanism  that  produces  systemic  hypertension  in the presence of renal parenchymal or renovascular disease has not  been  established.  Stimulation  of  the  renin-angiotensinaldosterone system is a possible, but unproven, mechanism. Regardless of the mechanism, treatment of systemic hypertension due to renal parenchymal disease is usually with antihypertensive  drugs,  including β -adrenergic  antagonists,  which inhibit  the  release  of  renin  from  the  kidneys.  Treatment  of renovascular  hypertension  is  with  renal  artery  endarterectomy or nephrectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uric Acid Nephropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute uric acid nephropathy occurs when uric acid crystals precipitate in the renal collecting tubules or ureters, producing acute oliguric renal failure. Th is precipitation occurs when uric  acid  concentrations  reach  a  saturation  point  in  acidic urine. Th e  condition  is  particularly  likely  to  occur  when uric acid production is greatly increased, as in patients with myeloproliferative disorders being treated with chemotherapeutic drugs. Th ese patients are particularly vulnerable to uric acid nephropathy when they become dehydrated or acidotic because of decreased caloric intake.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatorenal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute oliguria manifesting in patients with decompensated cirrhosis of the liver is called hepatorenal syndrome. Indeed, cirrhosis of the liver is associated with decreased GFR and renal blood fl ow that precede overt renal dysfunction by several weeks. Th e typical patient is deeply jaundiced and moribund; ascites, hypoalbuminemia, and hypoprothrombinemia are present. Renal failure in these patients re fl ects reduction in e ff ective circulating volume, partly as a result of diuretic treatment and partly as a result of splanchnic arteriolar dilatation. Treatment is directed at restoring intravascular fl uid volume.  Administration  of  normal  saline  may  aggravate ascites. Th erefore, whole blood or packed red blood cells may be  a  more  appropriate  form  of  volume  replacement.  Vasopressin analogues such as ornipressin and terlipressin cause splanchnic vasoconstriction, and may help to increase renal perfusion and GFR. A peritoneal-venous shunt for the treatment of ascites may also be associated with improved renal function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  an  increased  incidence  of  postoperative  AKI  in patients with obstructive jaundice who undergo surgery. Th e cause of renal failure in these patients is unclear, but preoperative administration of mannitol may be recommended in the hope of providing some renoprotective e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate caused by excessive growth of both the glandular and stromal elements of the gland. Symptoms occur as a result of compression of the urethral canal and disruption of  the  normal fl ow of urine. BPH is common worldwide in men older than 40 years of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDICAL THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prostatic tissue growth is androgen sensitive, so that androgen deprivation decreases the size of the prostate and thereby the resistance to out fl ow through the prostatic urethra. Finasteride, an inhibitor of the 5 α -reductase enzyme, is moderately e ff ective  for  symptomatic  treatment  of  BPH.  Side  e ff ects  of 5 α -reductase  inhibitors  are  minimal. α -Adrenergic  antagonists  (terazosin,  doxazosin,  tamsulosin)  are  administered  to block adrenergic receptors in hyperplastic prostatic tissue, the prostatic capsule, and the bladder neck, and thereby decrease smooth  muscle  tone  and  resistance  to  urinary fl ow. Th ese drugs also have antihypertensive e ff ects and may cause orthostatic hypotension in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INVASIVE TREATMENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  commonly used minimally invasive treatments of BPH  are  transurethral  microwave  thermotherapy  (TUMT) and transurethral needle ablation (TUNA). Th ese procedures rely  on  the  generation  of  heat  to  cause  tissue  necrosis  and shrinkage of the prostate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  treatments  include  transurethral  incision  of  the prostate  (TUIP)  and  transurethral  resection  of  the  prostate (TURP). TUIP is usually e ff ective in patients whose prostates weigh 30 g or less and in whom the primary urinary outlet obstruction  is  located  at  the  bladder  neck.  As  the  incisions are deepened, the bladder neck and prostatic urethra spring open,  and  the  bladder  outlet  obstruction  is  relieved.  TURP involves  resection  of  prostatic  tissue  using  electrocautery  or sharp excision. Th e procedure is associated with a fair amount of bleeding; patients are admitted postoperatively for continuous bladder irrigation to prevent the formation of obstructing blood clots.

Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  TURP,  an  irrigation solution (glycine, sorbitol,  mannitol)  is  used  to  provide  surgical  visualization  and remove blood and resected tissue. Th e procedure is accompanied by absorption of irrigating fl uid via direct intravascular access  through  the  prostatic  venous  plexus  or  more  slowly through  absorption  from  the  retroperitoneal  and  perivesical spaces. TURP syndrome is characterized by intravascular fl uid volume shi ft s and the e ff ects of plasma solute absorption (Table 17-15). Solute changes may alter neurologic function independent of volume-related e ff ects. Although monitoring of serum sodium concentrations during TURP is e ff ective for assessing intravascular fl uid absorption, there may be benefi t  in  monitoring serum osmolality as well. Hypo-osmolality appears to be the principal factor contributing to the neurologic  and  hypovolemic  changes  considered  to  re fl ect  TURP syndrome. Supportive care remains the most important therapeutic approach for managing cardiovascular, central nervous system, and renal complications of TURP syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial anesthesia has conventionally been the anesthetic technique of choice for TURP because it allows for monitoring of TURP syndrome symptoms during the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravascular  Volume  Expansion. Rapid intravascular fl uid volume expansion due to systemic absorption of irrigating fl uids (absorption rates may reach 200 mL/min) can cause systemic  hypertension  and  re fl ex  bradycardia.  Patients  with poor le ft ventricular function may develop pulmonary edema due to acute circulatory volume overload. Factors that in fl uence the amount of irrigating solution absorbed include the intravesicular pressure, which is determined by the height of the irrigation bag above the prostatic sinuses (height should be  limited  to  40  cm  above  the  prostate)  and  the  number  of prostatic sinuses opened (resection time should be limited to 1

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hour and a rim of tissue should be le ft on the capsule). If intravesical pressures are maintained below 15 cm H 2 O, absorption of irrigating fl uids is minimal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most widely used indicator of intravascular fl uid volume gain is hyponatremia. Before treating TURP syndrome with hypertonic saline, it is important to exclude the presence of  hypervolemia  with  near-normal  plasma  sodium  concentrations.  Cardiovascular  compromise  and  impaired  arterial oxygenation  due  to  pulmonary  edema  require  aggressive intervention, which may include administration of inotropic drugs or diuretics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intravascular  Volume  Loss. Perioperative  hypotension during TURP is sometimes preceded by systemic hypertension. It is conceivable that hyponatremia in association with systemic hypertension can result in water fl ux along osmotic and  hydrostatic  pressure  gradients  out  of  the  intravascular space and into the lungs with resultant pulmonary edema and hypovolemic  shock.  Sympathetic  nervous  system  blockade produced by regional anesthesia may compound the hypotension,  as  may  intraoperative  endotoxemia, which is common during TURP.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyponatremia. Acute hyponatremia due to intravascular absorption  of  sodium-free  irrigating fl uids  may  cause  confusion, agitation,  visual  disturbances,  pulmonary  edema, cardiovascular collapse, and seizures. Changes on the electrocardiogram may accompany progressive decreases in serum sodium  concentrations.  Spinal  anesthesia  associated  with hypotension may cause nausea and vomiting indistinguishable from that caused by acute hyponatremia. Furthermore, some hyponatremic patients show no signs of water intoxication.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypo-osmolality. Hypo-osmolality  rather  than  hyponatremia appears to be the crucial physiologic derangement leading to central nervous system dysfunction in TURP syndrome. Th is is  predictable,  because  the  blood-brain  barrier  is  essentially

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 17 RENAL DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
355

<!-- PAGE=? -->
impermeable  to  sodium  but  freely  permeable  to  water.  Cerebral  edema  caused  by  acute  hypo-osmolality  can  result  in increased intracranial pressure with resultant bradycardia and hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diuretics administered to treat hypervolemia during TURP  may  accentuate  hyponatremia  and  hypo-osmolality. A patient's serum sodium concentration and osmolality may continue  to  decrease  following  TURP  because  of  continued absorption of irrigating solutions from the perivesicular and retroperitoneal spaces. If the serum osmolality is near normal, no interventions to correct serum sodium concentrations are recommended  for  asymptomatic  patients  even  in  the  presence  of  hyponatremia.  Instituting  treatment  in  the  absence of symptoms risks too rapid a correction, because the correction rate is di ffi cult to control. Th e most feared complication of correction of hyponatremia is central pontine myelinolysis (osmotic demyelination syndrome), which has been observed a ft er both rapid and slow correction of serum sodium concentrations in patients undergoing TURP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia is a result of the use  of  glycine-containing  irrigation  solutions  with  subsequent  systemic  absorption  of  glycine  and  its  oxidative deamination to glyoxylic acid and ammonia. Alterations in central nervous system function may accompany hyperammonemia, but its role in TURP syndrome remains unclear. Endogenous arginine in the liver prevents hepatic release of ammonia and facilitates conversion of ammonia to urea. Th e time necessary to deplete endogenous arginine stores may be as brief as 12 hours, which approximates the preoperative fasting time. Prophylactic administration of intravenous arginine blunts the increase in serum ammonia concentrations associated with the presence of glycine in the systemic circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycinemia. Glycine  is  an  inhibitory  neurotransmitter similar to γ -aminobutyric acid in the spinal cord and brain. Th e use of glycine-containing irrigation solutions may cause visual disturbances, including transient blindness during TURP syndrome, which re fl ects the role of glycine as an inhibitory  neurotransmitter  in  the  retina. Th erefore,  glycine likely  a ff ects  retinal  physiology  independent  of  the  cerebral edema caused by hyponatremia and hypo-osmolality. Vision returns to normal within 24 hours as serum glycine concentrations approach baseline values. Reassurance that unimpaired vision will return is probably the best treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycine  may  also  lead  to  encephalopathy  and  seizures through  its  ability  to  potentiate  the  e ff ects  of N -methyl-daspartate  (NMDA),  an  excitatory  neurotransmitter.  Magnesium exerts  a  negative  control  on  the  NMDA  receptor,  and hypomagnesemia caused by dilution (resulting from systemic absorption of irrigating solutions during TURP or administration  of  loop  diuretics)  may  increase  the  susceptibility  to seizures.  For  this  reason,  a  trial  of  magnesium  therapy  may be indicated in patients who develop seizures and in whom glycine-  containing irrigating solutions have been used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycine may also exert toxic e ff ects on the kidneys. Hyperoxaluria due to metabolism of glycine to oxalate and glyoxylic acid may compromise renal function in patients with preexisting renal disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e kidneys are involved in water conservation, electrolyte homeostasis, acid-base balance, and several neurohumoral and hormonal functions. Some or all of these functions are a ff ected by renal disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patient risk factors for perioperative AKI include advanced age, preexisting renal dysfunction, diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease. High-risk surgical procedures  include  those  requiring  aortic  cross-clamping  and cardiopulmonary  bypass.  Prevention  of  AKI  hinges  on maintaining adequate renal perfusion and avoiding nephrotoxins. Fenoldopam, a dopamine-1 agonist, may also be helpful in patients at high risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Treatment of AKI is supportive, aimed at limiting further injury by maintaining hemodynamic stability and adequate intravascular fl uid volume. Mannitol and sodium bicarbonate may be useful in treating pigment- or contrast-induced nephropathies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Preoperative evaluation of patients with CKD should take into  consideration  not  only  baseline  renal  function,  but also the high prevalence of comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ National guidelines advise that patients with CKD should have their blood pressure maintained below 130/80 mm Hg. ACE  inhibitors  and/or  ARBs  are fi rst-line  therapies,  but most patients  require  treatment  with  multiple  antihypertensive drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Provision  of  anesthesia  for  patients  with  CKD  focuses  on meticulous fl uid and  electrolyte  management,  acid-base maintenance, and attention to drug disposition in renal failure. Vessels of the nondominant forearm should be preserved in anticipation of vascular access requirements for hemodialysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ During renal transplantation, hypotension and cardiac dysrhythmias may develop when the vascular clamps are released. Th is event is likely due to washout of potassium-containing preservative fl uid  from  the  newly  perfused  kidney,  abrupt addition of fl uid to the intravascular space, and the release of vasodilating chemicals from previously ischemic tissues.
