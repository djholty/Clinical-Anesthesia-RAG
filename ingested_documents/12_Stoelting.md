thought to be unrelated: striatonigral degeneration, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and Shy-Drager syndrome. Th e hallmark of  multiple-system  atrophy  is  degeneration  and  dysfunction of diverse central nervous system structures such as the basal ganglia,  cerebellar  cortex,  locus  ceruleus,  pyramidal  tracts, inferior olives, vagal motor nucleus, and spinocerebellar tracts. Th e extent of the di ff erential degeneration in these structures dictates signs and symptoms. Shy-Drager syndrome is characterized by autonomic dysfunction and degeneration of the locus  ceruleus,  intermediolateral  column  of  the  spinal  cord, and peripheral autonomic neurons. Other regions of the central nervous system described earlier may also be a ff ected, but to a lesser degree. Speci fi cally, striatonigral degeneration and olivopontocerebellar atrophy may also be present in patients with  Shy-Drager  syndrome,  resulting  in  parkinsonism  and ataxia.  Idiopathic  orthostatic  hypotension,  rather  than  ShyDrager syndrome, is thought to be present when autonomic nervous system dysfunction occurs in the absence of central nervous system degeneration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms  of  Shy-Drager  syndrome  include orthostatic  hypotension,  urinary  retention,  bowel  dysfunction, and impotence. Postural hypotension, when severe, can produce syncope. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations fail to show a normal increase a ft er standing or exercise. Pupillary re fl exes may be sluggish and control of breathing abnormal. Further  evidence  of  autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction is  noted  by  the  failure  of  baroreceptor  re fl exes  to  produce an  increase  in  heart  rate  or  vasoconstriction  in  response  to hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of orthostatic hypotension is symptomatic and includes  use  of  elastic  stockings,  consumption  of  a  highsodium diet to expand intravascular fl uid volume, and administration of vasoconstricting α 1 -adrenergic agonists such as  midodrine  or α 2 -adrenergic  antagonists  such  as  yohimbine. Th ese drugs facilitate continued release of norepinephrine  from  postganglionic  adrenergic  neurons.  Patients  with

Th e  peripheral  nervous system consists of nerve elements outside the brain and spinal cord. It contains both peripheral nerves and elements of the autonomic nervous system. Disorders of the autonomic nervous system can result in signi fi cant hemodynamic changes  as  well  as  abnormal  responses  to  drugs  that  work  via adrenergic receptors. Diseases a ff ecting peripheral nerves o ft en have implications for perioperative patient management, including the choice of muscle relaxants and control of neuropathic pain.

Shy-Drager Syndrome

Shy-Drager  syndrome  belongs  to  a  group  of  heterogeneous disorders known as multiple-system atrophy. Multiple-system atrophy  includes  three  conditions  that,  in  years  past,  were

Shy-Drager syndrome have an ominous prognosis, with death usually occurring within 8 years of diagnosis. Death is generally a result of cerebral ischemia from prolonged hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation may disclose orthostatic hypotension and  the  absence  of  the  beat-to-beat  variability  in  heart  rate that should be associated with deep breathing. Management of anesthesia should focus on the decreased autonomic nervous system activity and hemodynamic aberrations that will occur in response to changes in body position, positive airway pressure, and acute blood loss. Th e negative inotropic e ff ects of anesthetic drugs should also be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite  the  obvious  vulnerability  of  these  patients  to adverse perioperative events, most tolerate general and regional anesthesia without undue risk. Th e keys to management  include  continuous  monitoring  of  the  systemic  blood pressure and prompt correction of hypotension. Crystalloid or colloid  solutions  can  be  infused  to  treat  the  hypotension.  If vasopressors are needed, a direct-acting vasopressor such as phenylephrine is preferred, because these patients may have an exaggerated response to indirect-acting drugs that provoke the release of norepinephrine. Small doses of phenylephrine should  be  used  initially  until  the  response  can  be  assessed, because  the  upregulated  expression  of α -adrenergic  receptors in this disease of chronic relative autonomic denervation can produce an exaggerated response to even a small dose of drug.  A  continuous  infusion  of  phenylephrine  may  be  used to maintain systemic blood pressure during general anesthesia if needed. Spinal or epidural anesthesia can be considered, although the risk of hypotension demands diligence and caution.  Volatile  anesthetics  can  diminish  cardiac  contractility and result in exaggerated hypotension, because absent carotid sinus  activity  will  impair  the  usual  compensatory  responses to  a  decreased  cardiac  output  such  as  vasoconstriction  or tachycardia.  Bradycardia,  which  contributes  to  hypotension, is  best treated with atropine or glycopyrrolate. Signs of light anesthesia may be less apparent in these patients because the sympathetic nervous system is less responsive to noxious stimulation. Administration of a muscle relaxant that has little or no e ff ect on hemodynamics, such as vecuronium, is preferred. Th e dose and rate of administration of thiopental or propofol must be adjusted to accommodate for the patient's diminished ability  to  tolerate  hypotension.  Conversely,  an  accentuated blood pressure increase is  a  theoretical  possibility  following ketamine administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orthostatic Intolerance Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Orthostatic intolerance syndrome is a chronic idiopathic disorder of primary autonomic system dysfunction characterized by episodic or postural tachycardia occurring independently of  alterations  in  blood  pressure.  It  manifests  physiologic responses  similar  to  those  of  other  entities  including  postural  tachycardia  syndrome,  e ff ort  syndrome, hyperdynamic β -adrenergic state, hyperdynamic  orthostatic  tachycardia, idiopathic  hypovolemia,  irritable  heart,  mitral  valve  prolapse  syndrome,  and  neurocirculatory  asthenia.  Orthostatic intolerance  syndrome  is  most  o ft en  observed  in  young women. Symptoms include palpitations, tremulousness, lightheadedness,  fatigue,  and  syncope. Th e  pathophysiology  is unclear,  although  possible  explanations  include  enhanced sensitivity of β 1 -adrenergic receptors, hypovolemia, excessive venous pooling during standing, primary dysautonomia, and lower extremity sympathetic denervation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical  treatment  of  patients  with  orthostatic  intolerance syndrome includes increasing intravascular fl uid volume (increased sodium and water intake, administration of mineralocorticoids)  to  increase  venous  return.  Long-term  administration  of α 1 -adrenergic  agonists  such  as  midodrine  may compensate for the decreased sympathetic activity in the legs and blunt heart rate responses to standing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with orthostatic intolerance  syndrome  includes  preoperative  administration  of crystalloid  solutions  to  expand  intravascular fl uid  volume. Low-dose phenylephrine infusions may be cautiously administered,  with  the  recognition  that  lower  extremity  sympathetic  nervous  system  denervation  may  cause  upregulation of α 1 -adrenergic receptors and contribute to receptor hypersensitivity. Th e  combination  of  volume  expansion  and  lowdose phenylephrine infusion should be su ffi cient to augment venous return,  maintain  blood  pressure,  and  decrease  autonomic nervous system lability in the presence of vasodilating anesthetic  drugs  or  techniques. β -Blockers  may  be  used  to blunt tachycardia if needed, but care must be taken to avoid excessive hypotension. Neuraxial opioids may be quite useful for postoperative pain management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomus Tumors of the Head and Neck

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomus  tumors  are  paragangliomas  that  arise  embryologically from neural crest cells. Th ese tumors develop in the head and  neck  within  neuroendocrine  tissues  that  lie  along  the carotid artery, aorta, glossopharyngeal nerve, and middle ear. Th ey are rarely malignant. Tumor location determines signs and symptoms, which most o ft en re fl ect middle ear and cranial  nerve  invasion.  Unilateral  pulsatile  tinnitus,  conductive hearing loss, aural fullness, and a bluish red mass behind the tympanic membrane are characteristic of middle ear involvement. Facial paralysis, dysphonia, hearing loss, and pain are characteristic of cranial nerve invasion. Recurrent aspiration, dysphagia, and upper airway obstruction may also accompany cranial nerve involvement. Invasion of the posterior fossa may obstruct  the  aqueduct  of  Sylvius,  causing  hydrocephalus.  It is common for glomus tumors to invade the internal jugular vein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glomus  tumors  can  secrete  a  variety  of  substances. Th e most common is norepinephrine, so that symptoms are produced mimicking those of a pheochromocytoma. Cholecystokinin secretion is thought to play a role in the high incidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of  postoperative  ileus  following  tumor  resection.  Release  of serotonin  or  kallikrein  can  cause  carcinoid-like  symptoms such  as  bronchoconstriction,  diarrhea,  headache, fl ushing, and  hypertension.  Release  of  histamine  or  bradykinin  can cause bronchoconstriction and hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Small glomus tumors are most o ft en treated with radiation or embolization, either as a primary treatment or as adjunctive  treatment  before  surgery.  Surgery  is  recommended  if bony  destruction  is  present.  Preoperative  determination  of serum concentrations  of  norepinephrine  and  catecholamine metabolites may be useful to determine if a pheochromocytoma-like condition is present. However, unlike some pheochromocytomas, glomus tumors do not secrete epinephrine because they lack the transferase necessary to convert norepinephrine to epinephrine. Phenoxybenzamine or prazosin may be  administered preoperatively to lower blood pressure and facilitate volume expansion in patients with increased serum norepinephrine concentrations. Patients with increased serum 5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid  (5-HIAA)  concentration,  especially those with symptoms resembling those of carcinoid syndrome, should receive octreotide preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  can  be  a  formidable  challenge  in these patients. Risks include catecholamine secretion producing  exaggerated  hemodynamic  changes,  serotonin  secretion producing signs of carcinoid syndrome, aspiration a ft er tumor resection caused by cranial nerve dysfunction, impaired gastric  emptying  caused  by  vagal  nerve  dysfunction,  the  threat of  venous  air  embolism,  and  massive  blood  loss.  Histamine and  bradykinin  released  during  surgical  manipulation  can cause  profound  hypotension.  Cranial  nerve  de fi cits  (vagus, glossopharyngeal, hypoglossal nerves) may be present preoperatively or may occur as a result of tumor resection. Airway obstruction is a risk a ft er cranial nerve injury resulting from unilateral vocal cord paralysis. In adults this does not usually result in complete airway obstruction by itself, but could produce airway obstruction in combination with airway edema or laryngeal distortion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive arterial and venous pressure monitoring is indicated, and urinary output should be monitored with a urinary bladder  catheter.  Given  the  risk  of  pheochromocytoma-like and carcinoid-like signs occurring intraoperatively, drugs used to treat both hypertension (e.g., sodium nitroprusside, phentolamine) and carcinoid-like signs (e.g., octreotide) should be immediately available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Venous  air  embolism  is  a  risk,  especially  if  the  internal jugular  vein  is  opened  to  remove  tumor.  It  is  also  a  risk  if excision of a tumor that has invaded temporal bone results in exposure of veins that cannot collapse because of bony attachments. Appropriate monitoring to detect venous air is indicated when venous air embolism is considered a risk. Sudden, unexplained cardiovascular collapse and death during resection of these tumors may re fl ect the presence of a venous air or tumor embolism. If the surgeon fi nds it necessary to identify the facial nerve, skeletal muscle paralysis should be avoided so that a visible twitch response to direct neural stimulation can be obtained. Th e choice of anesthetic drugs is not uniquely in fl uenced  by  the  presence  of  glomus  tumors,  although  the potential adverse e ff ects of nitrous oxide have implications if venous air embolism occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid Sinus Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid  sinus  syndrome  is  an  uncommon  entity  caused by  exaggeration  of  normal  activity  of  the  baroreceptors  in response to mechanical stimulation. For example, stimulation of the carotid sinus by external massage, which in normal individuals produces modest decreases in heart rate and systemic blood  pressure,  can  produce  syncope  in  those  with  carotid sinus syndrome. A ff ected individuals have an increased incidence of peripheral vascular disease. Carotid sinus syndrome is  a  recognized  although  transient  complication  following carotid endarterectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two distinct cardiovascular responses may be noted in the presence  of  carotid  sinus  hypersensitivity.  In  approximately 80% of a ff ected individuals, a cardioinhibitory re fl ex, mediated by the vagus nerve, produces profound bradycardia. In approximately  10%  of  a ff ected  individuals,  a  vasodepressor  re fl ex mediated by inhibition of vasomotor tone produces decreases in systemic vascular resistance and profound hypotension. Th e remaining 10% exhibit components of both re fl exes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid sinus syndrome may be treated with drugs, an artifi cial cardiac pacemaker, or ablation of the carotid sinus. Th e use of anticholinergic and vasopressor drugs is limited by their adverse e ff ects,  and  they  are  rarely  e ff ective in patients with vasodepressor or mixed forms of carotid sinus hypersensitivity.  Because  most  patients  have  the  cardioinhibitory  type  of carotid sinus syndrome, implantation of an arti fi cial  cardiac pacemaker is the usual treatment. Denervation of the carotid sinus may be attempted in patients in whom the vasodepressor re fl ex response is refractory to cardiac pacing. Since the glossopharyngeal nerve provides the a ff erent limb of the re fl ex that produces symptoms in carotid sinus syndrome, block of this nerve may be an alternative therapy in patients refractory to cardiac pacing or drug therapy. Th e nerve is approached with a  stimulating needle as it passes anterior to the styloid process. Successful identi fi cation of its location is noted when the patient complains of vague sensations in the region supplied by this nerve (e.g., external ear and pharynx) upon electrical nerve stimulation. Typically a test blockade is performed fi rst with local  anesthetic.  If  the  desired  e ff ect  of  reduced  symptomatology with carotid massage is obtained, then the nerve can be ablated with alcohol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  management  in  patients  with  carotid  sinus  syndrome  is  o ft en  complicated  by  hypotension,  bradycardia, and cardiac dysrhythmias. In fi ltration  of  a  local  anestheticcontaining solution around the carotid sinus before dissection usually  improves  hemodynamic  stability,  but  may  interfere with determination of the completeness of the ablation.

Hyperhidrosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperhidrosis is a rare disorder in which individuals produce an excessive amount of sweat. Th e disorder can be either primary (idiopathic)  or  secondary  to  other  conditions  such  as hyperthyroidism,  pheochromocytoma,  hypothalamic  disorders (including that following central nervous system trauma), spinal cord injury, parkinsonism, or menopause. Th e disorder results from overactivity of sudomotor nerve fi bers innervating eccrine sweat glands. Th e location of excess sweat production in secondary hyperhidrosis depends on the speci fi c cause. Patients with primary hyperhidrosis o ft en complain of excess sweat production in the palms of the hands and axillae, which o ft en leads to social embarrassment. Conservative treatments include topical astringents such as potassium permanganate or tannic acid, or antiperspirants. Although these sudomotor nerve fi bers  belong  to  the  sympathetic  nervous  system,  the primary  neurotransmitter  in  sweat  glands  is  acetylcholine. Patients may respond to anticholinergic agents or to botulinum toxin injections. Botulinum toxin temporarily blocks the nerves that stimulate sweating. Severe cases may require surgical sympathectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e sympathetic chain is most commonly accessed in the thoracic  cavity  via  video-assisted  thoracoscopy.  Bilateral  hyperhidrosis  will  require  bilateral  sympathectomy,  which  can  be performed  during  two  separate  operations  but  more  commonly is done during a single procedure. Each thoracic cavity  will  need  to  be  accessed,  so  one-lung  ventilation  will  be required  and  is  facilitated  by  placement  of  a  double-lumen endotracheal  tube.  Successful  sympathectomy  will  produce vasodilation  in  the  ipsilateral  upper  extremity,  documented by an immediate increase in temperature of 1° C or more in that  extremity. Th erefore,  cutaneous  temperature  monitoring on a fi nger or palm is necessary before sectioning of the sympathetic chain to determine baseline and postlesion temperatures. In otherwise healthy patients, this surgery can be performed  as  an  outpatient  procedure.  Patients  o ft en  have minimal pain postoperatively, which responds well to opioids and nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs. Common surgical complications  include  infection,  Horner's  syndrome,  and  a compensatory hyperhidrosis  elsewhere  (e.g.,  trunk  or  lower extremity).

Idiopathic Facial Paralysis (Bell's Palsy)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Idiopathic facial paralysis is characterized by the rapid onset of motor weakness or paralysis of all the muscles innervated by the facial nerve. Onset is typically noted on arising in the morning and looking into a mirror. Additional symptoms can include the loss of taste sensation over the anterior two thirds of the tongue as well as hyperacusis and diminished salivation and lacrimation. Th ere is no cutaneous sensory loss because the  trigeminal  nerve,  not  the  facial  nerve,  supplies  sensory innervation to the face. Th e cause of idiopathic facial paralysis is presumed to be in fl ammation and edema of the facial nerve, most o ft en in the facial canal in the temporal bone. A virus, perhaps herpes simplex virus, may be the cause. Indeed, the onset of this cranial mononeuropathy is o ft en preceded by a viral prodrome. During pregnancy, there is an increased incidence of idiopathic facial paralysis. Th e presence of idiopathic facial  paralysis  does  not  in fl uence  the  choice  of  anesthetic technique.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spontaneous recovery usually occurs in approximately 12 weeks. If no recovery is seen in 16 to 20 weeks, the clinical signs and symptoms are probably not due to idiopathic facial paralysis. Prednisone (1 mg/kg orally daily for 5 to 10 days, depending  on  the  extent  of  facial  nerve  paralysis)  can  dramatically relieve pain and decrease the likelihood of complete denervation of the facial nerve. If blinking is not possible, the patient's a ff ected eye should be covered to protect the cornea from dehydration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical decompression of the facial nerve may be needed for persistent or severe cases of idiopathic facial paralysis or for facial paralysis secondary to trauma. Paralysis of the facial nerve can re fl ect a stretch injury produced by excessive traction on the angle of the mandible during maintenance of the upper  airway  in  unconscious  patients.  Uveoparotid  fever (Heerfordt's syndrome) is a variant of sarcoidosis characterized  by  bilateral  anterior  uveitis,  parotitis,  and  low-grade fever as well as the presence of facial nerve paralysis in 50% to 70% of patients. Facial nerve paralysis associated with postoperative uveoparotid fever may be erroneously attributed to mechanical pressure over the nerve during general anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trigeminal Neuralgia (Tic Douloureux)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by the sudden onset of brief but intense unilateral facial pain triggered by local sensory stimuli to the a ff ected side of the face. Trigeminal neuralgia  can  be  diagnosed purely on the basis of clinical signs and  symptoms.  Patients  report  brief,  stabbing  pain  or  clusters of stabbing pain in the face or mouth that are restricted to one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve, most o ft en the mandibular division (Figure 12-1). Trigeminal neuralgia most o ft en develops in otherwise healthy individuals during late middle age. Th e appearance of this neuralgia at an earlier age should arouse suspicion of multiple sclerosis. Th e pathophysiology of the pain associated with trigeminal neuralgia is uncertain. However, compression of the nerve root by a blood vessel is sometimes the cause. Th e most common blood vessel causing such compression is a branch of the superior cerebellar artery. Antiepileptic drugs are useful for treating trigeminal neuralgia. Th e anticonvulsant carbamazepine is the drug treatment  of  choice,  but  baclofen  and  lamotrigine  are  also e ff ective.  Surgical  therapy  (selective  radiofrequency destruction of trigeminal nerve fi bers, transection of the sensory root of the trigeminal nerve, microsurgical decompression of the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  undergoing  surgery  may  experience  bradycardia caused by activation of the trigeminocardiac re fl ex. In patients having microsurgical decompression, placement of a retractor to gain access to the root of the trigeminal nerve can stretch the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII), which can potentially result in hearing loss. Th erefore, intraoperative monitoring of brainstem auditory evoked potentials may be used to assess the integrity of cranial nerve VIII. Because brainstem auditory-evoked  potentials  can  be  suppressed  by  anesthetic drugs, an anesthetic technique that minimizes such suppression  should  be  used. Th e  potential  enzyme-inducing  e ff ects of anticonvulsant drugs must be considered when predicting drug  e ff ects.  Carbamazepine  can  also  cause  altered  hepatic function and produce leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glossopharyngeal  neuralgia  is  characterized  by  episodes  of intense  pain  in  the  throat,  neck,  tongue,  and  ear.  Swallowing, chewing, coughing, or talking can trigger the pain. Th is neuralgia may also be associated with severe bradycardia and syncope, presumably because of the close association of the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves, especially the branch of the  glossopharyngeal  nerve  carrying  a ff erent  impulses  from the  carotid  sinus  (Hering's  nerve).  Hypotension,  seizures caused  by  cerebral  ischemia,  and  even  cardiac  arrest  may occur in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glossopharyngeal  neuralgia  is  usually  idiopathic  but  has been described in patients with cerebellopontine angle vascular anomalies and tumors, vertebral and carotid artery occlusive disease, arachnoiditis, and extracranial tumors arising in the area of the pharynx, larynx, and tonsils. Th e diagnosis of glossopharyngeal neuralgia is supported by pain in the distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve and relief of this pain by topical anesthesia of the oropharynx at the tonsillar pillar.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the absence of pain, cardiac symptoms associated with glossopharyngeal neuralgia may be confused with sick sinus syndrome  or  carotid  sinus  syndrome.  Sick  sinus  syndrome can  be  discounted  by  the  absence  of  characteristic  changes on the electrocardiogram. Failure of carotid sinus massage to produce cardiac symptoms rules out carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Glossopharyngeal nerve blockade is useful for di ff erentiating glossopharyngeal neuralgia from atypical trigeminal neuralgia. Th is nerve blockade does not, however, di ff erentiate glossopharyngeal neuralgia from carotid sinus syndrome, because a ff erent pathways of both syndromes are mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glossopharyngeal neuralgia-associated cardiac symptoms should be aggressively treated because there is a risk of sudden death. Cardiovascular symptoms are treated acutely with atropine,  isoproterenol,  a  cardiac  pacemaker,  or  a  combination of these modalities. Pain associated with this syndrome is managed by administration of anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine and phenytoin. Prevention of cardiovascular symptoms and predictable pain relief can be achieved by intracranial surgical transection of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the upper two roots of the vagus nerve. Although permanent pain  relief  is  possible  a ft er  repeated  glossopharyngeal  nerve blockade, this neuralgia is su ffi ciently life-threatening to justify  intracranial transection of the nerve in patients who do not respond to medical therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  glossopharyngeal neuralgia is directed at assessing cardiac status and intravascular fl uid volume. Hypovolemia may be present since these patients avoid oral intake and its associated pharyngeal stimulation  in  an  attempt  to  avoid  triggering  the  pain  attacks.  In addition, drooling can contribute to fl uid losses. A preoperative  history  of  syncope  or  documented  bradycardia  concurrent with an episode of pain introduces the possible need for transcutaneous cardiac pacing or placement of a transvenous cardiac pacemaker before induction of anesthesia. Continuous monitoring of electrocardiographic activity and of blood pressure via an intraarterial catheter is useful. Topical anesthesia of the oropharynx with lidocaine is helpful to prevent bradycardia and hypotension, which may occur in response to pharyngeal stimulation during direct laryngoscopy. Intravenous  administration  of  atropine  or  glycopyrrolate  before initiation of laryngoscopy may be useful in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular changes should be expected in response to surgical  manipulation  during  intracranial  transection  of  the glossopharyngeal  and  vagus  nerve  roots.  Bradycardia  and hypotension are likely during manipulation of the vagus nerve. Anticholinergic drugs should be immediately available to treat these  vagally  mediated  responses.  Hypertension,  tachycardia, and ventricular premature beats may occur a ft er surgical transection of the glossopharyngeal nerve and the upper two roots  of  the  vagus  nerve  because  of  the  sudden  loss  of  sensory  input  from  the  carotid  sinus.  Hypertension  is  usually transient but can persist into the postoperative period. In this

setting, hydralazine may be useful. Experience is too limited to  permit  recommendations for speci fi c  anesthetic  drugs  or muscle  relaxants. Th e  possible  development  of  vocal  cord paralysis a ft er vagal nerve transection should be considered if airway obstruction follows tracheal extubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common inherited cause of chronic motor and sensory  peripheral  neuropathy,  Charcot-Marie-Tooth  disease type  1A  (CMT1A),  also  called peroneal  muscle  disease, has an estimated incidence of 1 in 2500 individuals. An autosomal dominant mode of inheritance is most common but an X-linked variant is known to exist. Th is disorder manifests as distal  skeletal  muscle  weakness, wasting, and loss of tendon re fl exes, which becomes evident by the middle teenage years. Classically,  this  neuropathy  is  described  as  being  restricted to the lower one third of the legs, producing foot deformities (high pedal arches and talipes) and peroneal muscle atrophy ("stork-leg" appearance). Th e disease may slowly progress to include wasting of the quadriceps muscles and the muscles of the hands and forearms. Mild to moderate stocking-glove sensory loss occurs in many patients. Pregnancy may precipitate exacerbations of CMT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  CMT1A  is  limited  to  supportive  measures, including splinting, tendon transfers, and various arthrodeses. Although  life  span  is  not  decreased,  many  individuals  with CMT1A experience long-term disability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia  in  patients  with  CMT1A  should focus on the response to neuromuscular blocking drugs and the  possibility  of  postoperative  respiratory  failure  resulting from weakness of the respiratory muscles. Cardiac manifestations  attributed  to  this  neuropathy,  including  conduction disturbances,  atrial fl utter,  and  cardiomyopathy,  are  seen occasionally. Drugs known to trigger malignant hyperthermia have been used safely in patients with CMT. Th e response to neuromuscular blocking drugs seems to be normal in patients with CMT1A. It may be reasonable to avoid succinylcholine because of theoretical concerns about exaggerated potassium release in individuals with neuromuscular diseases. However, succinylcholine has been used safely in some patients without producing hyperkalemia or triggering  malignant  hyperthermia. Use of epidural anesthesia for labor has been described.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Brachial Plexus Neuropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Brachial plexus neuropathy  (idiopathic brachial neuritis, Parsonage-Turner  syndrome,  shoulder-girdle  syndrome)  is characterized by the acute onset of severe pain in the upper arm. Th e pain is typically most severe at the onset of the neuropathy.  As  the  pain  diminishes,  patchy  paresis  or  paralysis of the skeletal muscles innervated by branches of the brachial plexus appears. Skeletal muscle wasting, particularly involving the shoulder girdle and arm, is common. Brachial plexus neuropathy is more common on the right side, although nerve involvement and pain are bilateral in 10% to 30% of a ff ected individuals, with both sides becoming involved either simultaneously or sequentially. Although this neuropathy seems to have a predilection for the upper trunks of the brachial plexus (axillary, suprascapular, long thoracic nerves), it may involve other  nerves  in  the  upper  extremity.  An  estimated  70%  of patients  have  involvement  of  the  axillary  nerve.  Secondary causes  of  brachial  plexus  neuropathy  include  trauma  to  the neck  or  upper  limb.  In  neonates,  shoulder  dystocia  during delivery is another cause of brachial plexus neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Electrophysiologic studies are valuable in diagnosing brachial  plexus  neuropathy  and  demonstrating  the  multifocal pattern  of  denervation.  Muscle fi brillations  and  slowing  of nerve conduction velocity are observed. Th e skeletal muscles most o ft en a ff ected, in decreasing order, are the deltoid, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, serratus anterior, biceps, and triceps. Th e  diaphragm  may  also  be  a ff ected.  Sensory  disturbances occur in most patients, but tend to be minimal and generally disappear over time. Th e incidence of this neuropathy is two to three times higher in males than in females. Overall, recovery may take 2 to 3 years but is nearly always complete. Th e annual incidence of brachial plexus neuropathy is estimated at 1.64 cases per 100,000.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nerve biopsy fi ndings in individuals with hereditary brachial  plexus  neuropathy  and  Parsonage-Turner  syndrome suggest an in fl ammatory-immune  pathogenesis.  Autoimmune neuropathies may also occur during the postoperative period independent of the site of surgery. It is possible that the stress of surgery activates an unidenti fi ed dormant virus in  the  nerve  roots,  a  circumstance  that  would  be  similar  to the onset of herpes zoster a ft er surgery. In addition, strenuous exercise or pregnancy may be inciting events for brachial plexus neuropathy.

Guillain-Barré Syndrome (Acute Idiopathic Polyneuritis)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by sudden onset of skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis that typically begins in the legs and spreads cephalad over the ensuing days to involve the arms, trunk, and face. With the virtual elimination of poliomyelitis, this syndrome has become the most common cause of acute generalized paralysis, with an annual incidence of 0.75 to 2.0 cases per 100,000. Bulbar involvement typically manifests as  bilateral  facial  paralysis.  Di ffi culty  swallowing  because  of pharyngeal muscle weakness and impaired ventilation because of intercostal muscle paralysis are the most serious signs of this process. Because of lower motor neuron involvement, paralysis is fl accid, and corresponding tendon re fl exes are diminished. Sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesias) generally precede the onset of paralysis and are most prominent in the distal extremities. Pain o ft en exists in the form of headache, backache, or tenderness of skeletal muscles to deep pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction  is  a  prominent fi nding in patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome and is usually

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
manifested as fl uctuations in blood pressure, sudden profuse diaphoresis, peripheral vasoconstriction, resting tachycardia, and cardiac conduction abnormalities. Orthostatic hypotension may be so severe that elevating the patient's head onto a pillow may lead to syncope. Th romboembolism may occur due to immobility. Sudden death associated with this disease is most likely caused by autonomic nervous system dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complete  spontaneous  recovery  from  acute  idiopathic polyneuritis can occur within a few weeks if segmental demyelination  is  the  predominant  pathologic  process.  Axonal degeneration  (as  detected  by  electromyographic  screening) may result in slower recovery that takes several months and leaves some residual weakness. Th e mortality rate associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome is 3% to 8%, and death is most o ft en a result  of  sepsis,  acute  respiratory  failure,  pulmonary embolism, or cardiac arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome is based on clinical  signs  and symptoms (Table 12-1), supported by fi ndings of  an  increased  protein  concentration  in  the  cerebrospinal fl uid. Cerebrospinal fl uid cell counts typically remain within the  normal  range. Th is  syndrome  develops  a ft er  respiratory or gastrointestinal infection in approximately half of patients, which hints that the cause may be related to either a viral or mycoplasma infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  is  symptomatic. Vital capacity is monitored, and when it decreases to less than 15 mL/kg, mechanical support of ventilation is initiated. Arterial  blood gas measurements help in assessing the adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation. Pharyngeal muscle weakness, even in the absence of ventilatory failure, may require insertion of a cu ff ed endotracheal tube or tracheostomy to protect the lungs from aspiration of secretions or gastric fl uid. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction may require treatment of hypertension or hypotension. Corticosteroids are not useful. Plasma exchange or infusion of gamma globulin may bene fi t some patients.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal autonomic nervous system function and the presence  of  lower  motor  neuron  lesions  are  the  major  factors to  consider  in  developing  an  anesthetic  plan  for  patients with  Guillain-Barré  syndrome.  Compensatory  cardiovascular  responses  may  be  absent,  so  that  profound  hypotension occurs in response to changes in posture, blood loss, or positive  airway  pressure.  Conversely,  noxious  stimulation,  such as  direct  laryngoscopy,  can  cause  exaggerated  increases  in blood  pressure.  Because  of  these  unpredictable  changes  in blood pressure, it may be prudent to monitor blood pressure continuously with an intraarterial catheter. Patients may also exhibit exaggerated responses to indirect-acting vasopressors, probably as a result of upregulation of postsynaptic receptors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Succinylcholine should not be administered because there is a risk of excessive potassium release from denervated skeletal muscles. A nondepolarizing muscle relaxant with minimal circulatory e ff ects, such as cisatracurium or vecuronium, may be used if needed. Even if a patient is breathing spontaneously before surgery, it is likely that mechanical ventilation will be necessary during the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Entrapment Neuropathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Entrapment neuropathies occur at anatomic sites where peripheral nerves pass through narrow passages (e.g., median nerve and carpal tunnel at the wrist, ulnar nerve and cubital tunnel at the elbow) that make compression a possibility. Peripheral nerves are  probably  more  sensitive  to  compressive  (ischemic)  injury in patients who also have generalized polyneuropathies such as those that occur with diabetes mellitus or hereditary peripheral neuropathies. A peripheral nerve may also be more susceptible to compression if the same fi bers have been partially damaged proximally ( double crush hypothesis ). For example, spinal nerve root  compression  (cervical  radiculopathy)  may  increase  the vulnerability of nerve fi bers to injury at distal entrapment sites, such as the carpal tunnel at the wrist. Osteoarthritis could also explain symptoms attributed to the double crush phenomenon. Peripheral nerve damage resulting from compression depends on the severity of the compression and the anatomy of the nerve. In most instances, the outermost nerve fi bers-that is, those that innervate more proximal tissues-are more vulnerable to ischemia from compression than the fi bers lying more deeply in the nerve bundle. Th is di ff ering damage to individual fascicles in a peripheral nerve makes it di ffi cult to localize the site of nerve injury precisely, although nerve conduction studies can be helpful. Focal demyelination of nerve fi bers causes slowing or blocking  of  nerve  impulse  conduction  through  the  damaged  area. Electromyographic  studies  are  adjuncts  to  nerve  conduction studies and can show patterns characteristic of denervation and subsequent reinnervation of muscle fi bers by surviving axons.

CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carpal  tunnel  syndrome  is  the  most  common  entrapment neuropathy. It results from compression of the median nerve between the transverse carpal ligament and the carpal bones

at the wrist. Th is compression neuropathy most o ft en occurs in  otherwise  healthy  women  (three  times  more  frequently than  in  men)  and  is  o ft en  bilateral,  although  the  dominant hand is typically involved fi rst. Patients describe repeated episodes of pain and paresthesias in the wrist and hand following the distribution of the median nerve (thumb and index and middle fi ngers), o ft en occurring during sleep or upon awakening. Population-based studies reveal that approximately 3% of  adults  have  symptomatic  electrodiagnostically  con fi rmed carpal tunnel syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e exact cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown, but a ff ected individuals o ft en engage in occupations that require repetitive  movements  of  the  hands  and fi ngers.  Nerve  conduction studies are the de fi nitive method for con fi rming the diagnosis.  In  previously  asymptomatic  patients  who  acquire symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome shortly a ft er  an  unrelated surgery, it is likely that accumulation of third space fl uid resulting in increased tissue pressure caused compression of the nerve. In such patients, subsequent neurologic examination  and  neurophysiologic  testing  o ft en fi nd  asymptomatic evidence  of  preexisting  carpal  tunnel  syndrome.  Pregnancy and  associated  peripheral  edema  may  also  precipitate  the initial  manifestations  of  carpal  tunnel  syndrome.  Cervical radiculopathy may produce similar symptoms unilaterally but rarely bilaterally.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immobilizing  the  wrist  with  a  splint  is  a  common  treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome that is likely to be transient (pregnancy) or caused by a medically treatable disease (hypothyroidism, acromegaly). Injection of corticosteroids into the carpal  tunnel  may  relieve  symptoms  but  is  seldom  curative. De fi nitive treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome is decompression of the median nerve by surgical division of the transverse carpal ligament.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compression of the ulnar nerve a ft er it passes through the condylar groove and enters the cubital tunnel results in clinical  symptoms considered typical of ulnar nerve neuropathy. It may be di ffi cult to di ff erentiate clinical symptoms of ulnar nerve  neuropathy  caused  by  compression  in  the  condylar groove from symptoms related to entrapment in the cubital tunnel. Surgical treatment of cubital tunnel entrapment syndrome  (by  tunnel  decompression  and  transposition  of  the nerve)  may  be  helpful  in  relieving  symptoms,  but  may  also make symptoms worse, perhaps by interfering with the nerve's blood supply.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MERALGIA PARESTHETICA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, a pure sensory nerve, can become entrapped as it crosses under the inguinal ligament near the attachment of the ligament to the anterior superior iliac  spine.  Patients  complain of burning pain down the lateral thigh, but may also have sensory loss in that region and possibly point tenderness at the site of entrapment. Meralgia paresthetica  o ft en  occurs  in  overweight  individuals  and  is exacerbated by wearing tightfi tting garments, such as belts. It may also occur following abdominal surgery or iliac crest bone gra ft harvesting, during pregnancy, or in conditions involving fl uid overload such as ascites or congestive heart failure. Treatment is usually conservative since meralgia paresthetica tends to  regress  spontaneously.  Treatment  options  include  weight loss, removal of o ff ending garments, elimination of activities involving  hip fl exion,  topical  cooling  and  administration  of nonsteroidal  analgesics.  Refractory  cases  may  require  local anesthetic and corticosteroid injections at the site of entrapment and possible surgical decompression.

Diseases Associated with Peripheral Neuropathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIABETES MELLITUS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes mellitus is commonly associated with peripheral polyneuropathies. Th e incidence of this problem increases with the duration  of  the  diabetes  and  perhaps  the  degree  of  hypoinsulinemia. Th e  etiology  of  diabetic  neuropathy  is  multifactorial and  may  include  microvascular  damage  resulting  in  neuronal ischemia;  formation  of  glycosylated  intraneuronal  proteins; activation of protein kinase C; inhibition of glutathione, which increases reactive oxygen species; and activation of the sorbitolaldose reductase pathway. Neurons in this latter pathway (like retinal and renal cells), do not require insulin to allow intracellular entry of glucose. Th e increased intracellular glucose is converted to sorbitol via aldose reductase, and since sorbitol cannot cross cell membranes, this results in increased intracellular osmolarity, cellular osmotic stress, and subsequent neuronal dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Up to  7.5%  of  patients  with  non-insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus have clinical neuropathy at the time that their diabetes  is  diagnosed.  Electrophysiologic  studies  show  evidence of denervation and reduced nerve conduction velocity. Th e most common neuropathy is distal, symmetrical, and predominantly sensory. Th e principal manifestations are unpleasant  tingling,  numbness,  burning,  and  aching  in  the  lower extremities; skeletal muscle weakness; and distal sensory loss. Occasionally, an isolated sciatic neuropathy suggests the presence  of  a  herniated  intervertebral  disc.  Sciatic  neuropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus is not associated with pain in  response  to  straight-leg  raising,  which  distinguishes  this peripheral neuropathy from lumbar disk disease. In diabetic neuropathy,  discomfort  is  prominent  at  night  and  is  o ft en relieved by walking. Symptoms o ft en progress and may extend to  the  upper  extremities.  Impotence,  urinary  retention,  gastroparesis, resting tachycardia, and postural hypotension are common and re fl ect autonomic nervous system dysfunction. For reasons that are not understood, the peripheral nerves of patients  with  diabetes  mellitus  are  more  vulnerable  to  ischemia resulting from compression or stretch injury such as may occur during intraoperative and postoperative positioning.

ALCOHOL ABUSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polyneuropathy of chronic alcoholism is nearly always associated  with  nutritional  and  vitamin  de fi ciencies.  Symptoms characteristically begin in the lower extremities, with pain and numbness in the feet. Weakness and tenderness of the intrinsic muscles of the feet, loss of the Achilles tendon re fl ex, and

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hypalgesia in a stocking-glove distribution are early manifestations. Restoration of a proper diet, abstinence from alcohol, and multivitamin therapy promote slow but predictable resolution of the neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  earliest  neurologic  symptoms  of  vitamin  B 12 de fi ciency resemble the neuropathy typically seen in patients who abuse alcohol. Paresthesias in the legs with sensory loss in a stocking distribution plus absent Achilles tendon re fl exes are characteristic fi ndings. Similar neurologic fi ndings have been reported in  dentists  who  experience  long-term  exposure  to  nitrous oxide and in individuals who habitually inhale nitrous oxide for nonmedical purposes. Nitrous oxide is known to inactivate certain vitamin B 12 -dependent enzymes, which could lead to symptoms of altered nerve function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UREMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Distal  polyneuropathy with sensory and motor components o ft en occurs in the extremities of patients with chronic renal failure.  Symptoms  tend  to  be  more  prominent  in  the  legs than  in  the  arms.  Presumably,  metabolic  abnormalities  are responsible for the axonal degeneration and segmental demyelination  that  accompany  the  neuropathy.  Slowing  of  nerve conduction has been correlated with increased plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone and myoinositol, a component of myelin. Improved nerve conduction velocity o ft en occurs within a few days a ft er renal transplantation. However, hemodialysis is ine ff ective in reversing this polyneuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral sensory and motor neuropathies occur in patients with  a  variety  of  malignancies,  especially  those  involving the lung, ovary, and breast. Polyneuropathy that develops in elderly  patients  should  always  arouse  suspicion  of  undiagnosed cancer. Myasthenic (Eaton-Lambert) syndrome may be observed in patients with carcinoma of the lung. Th is  paraneoplastic syndrome results from the abnormal production of an antibody against presynaptic calcium channels located on cholinergic neurons. As a result of calcium channel blockade, decreased quantities of acetylcholine are released from nerve terminals  at  the  neuromuscular  junction,  which  results  in weakness. Myasthenic syndrome is associated with increased sensitivity  to  both  depolarizing and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs. Invasion of the lower trunks of the brachial plexus by tumors in the apex of the lungs (Pancoast's syndrome) produces arm pain, paresthesias, and weakness of the hands and arms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COLLAGEN VASCULAR DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Collagen  vascular  diseases  are  commonly  associated  with peripheral neuropathies. Th ese occur most o ft en in systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid arthritis,  and  scleroderma.  Detection  of  multiple  mononeuropathies suggests vasculitis of nerve trunks and should stimulate a search for the presence of a collagen vascular disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SARCOIDOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sarcoidosis is a disorder of unknown etiology in which noncaseating granulomas occur in multiple organ systems, most commonly the lung, lymphatics, bone, liver, and nervous system.  Polyneuropathy  resulting  from  the  presence  of  granulomatous  lesions  in  peripheral  nerves  is  a  frequent fi nding. Unilateral or bilateral facial nerve paralysis may result from sarcoid involvement of this nerve in the parotid gland and is o ft en one of the fi rst manifestations of sarcoidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME-ASSOCIATED NEUROPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral neuropathy is common in patients with acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome (AIDS) but not in patients with human  immunode fi ciency  virus  infection  without  AIDS. AIDS-associated  neuropathy  is  typically  a  distal  symmetric polyneuropathy, and patients complain of numbness, tingling, and sometimes pain in their feet. Th ere may be loss of vibratory  sensation  and  light  touch.  Although  the  exact  cause  is unclear,  infection  with  cytomegalovirus  or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, lymphomatous  invasion  of  peripheral nerves, or adverse e ff ects of antiretroviral medication may be responsible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Peripheral Neuropathies

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative  neuropathies  have  been  described  following a variety of surgical procedures and a ff ecting a multitude of nerves. Although such neuropathies were originally thought to  be  primarily  the  result  of  errors  in  patient  positioning during surgery, epidemiologic data suggest that in most circumstances,  preexisting  aberrations  of  patient  anatomy  and physiology predispose the patient to this kind of injury. Intraoperative  positioning  must  still  be  considered  as  contributory  in  many  instances,  but  other  critical  factors  including obesity,  bony  abnormalities,  edema  formation,  metabolic derangements,  and  the  failure  of  sedated,  pain-free  patients to  frequently  reposition  themselves  in  bed  postoperatively (and hence a failure to relieve pressure on individual nerves) may also be involved. Ulnar neuropathy is the most common perioperative neuropathy, typically a ff ecting obese males who undergo abdominal or pelvic procedures. Symptoms of ulnar neuropathy  do  not  typically  present  until  at  least  48  hours a ft er surgery, and patients are o ft en found to have contralateral nerve conduction dysfunction, which indicates a predisposition to this injury. Postoperative brachial plexus neuropathy may initially be mistaken for ulnar neuropathy and appears to be associated with brachial plexus stretch resulting from sternal retraction during median sternotomy, placement in steep Trendelenburg's position, and prone positioning with shoulder abduction  and  contralateral  head  rotation.  Lower  extremity neuropathies  are  most  common  following  procedures  performed in the lithotomy position and usually a ff ect the common peroneal nerve where it may become compressed by a leg holder in this position as the nerve crosses over the fi bular head. Sciatic and femoral neuropathy may also be associated

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
with lithotomy positioning, but these are seen much less o ft en than peroneal neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of patients who develop perioperative peripheral neuropathies begins with (1) taking a history and performing a physical examination, which should focus on identifying risk  factors  for  or  a  history  of  neuropathy;  (2)  determining whether the de fi cit is sensory, motor, or mixed; and (3) documenting the distribution of the de fi cit. Most sensory de fi cits resolve within 5 days, so if the de fi cit is purely sensory, expectant management is suggested. Since motor fi bers tend to be located deeper within nerves, the presence of a motor de fi cit suggests a more extensive injury. In this situation, a neurology consultation is warranted.
