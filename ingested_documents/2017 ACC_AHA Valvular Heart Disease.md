PREAMBLE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since 1980, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and  American  Heart  Association  (AHA)  have  translated scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines (guidelines)  with  recommendations to improve cardiovascular health� These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone  for  quality  cardiovascular  care�  The  ACC  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AHA sponsor the development and publication of guidelines without commercial support, and members of each organization volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts� Guidelines are official policy of the ACC and AHA�

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intended Use

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients  with  or  at  risk  of  developing  cardiovascular  disease� The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in collaboration with other organizations  may  have  a  global  impact�  Although  guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, their intent is to improve patients' quality of care and align with patients' interests� Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and should not replace clinical judgment�

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical Implementation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guideline  recommended management is effective only when  followed  by  healthcare  providers  and  patients� Adherence  to  recommendations  can  be  enhanced  by shared  decision  making  between  healthcare  providers and  patients,  with  patient  engagement  in  selecting  interventions based on individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities�

<!-- PAGE=? -->
METHODOLOGY AND MODERNIZATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines (Task Force) continuously reviews, updates, and modifies guideline methodology on the basis of published standards from organizations including the Institute of Medicine 1,2 and on the basis of internal reevaluation� Similarly, the presentation and delivery of guidelines are reevaluated and modified on the basis of evolving technologies and other factors to facilitate optimal dissemination of information at the point of care to healthcare professionals� Given time constraints of busy healthcare providers and the need to limit text, the current guideline format delineates that each recommendation be supported by limited text (ideally, <250 words) and hyperlinks to supportive evidence summary tables� Ongoing efforts to further limit text are underway� Recognizing the  importance  of  cost-value  considerations  in  certain guidelines, when appropriate and feasible, an analysis of the  value  of  a  drug,  device,  or  intervention  may  be  performed in accordance with the ACC/AHA methodology� 3

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To ensure that guideline recommendations remain current, new data are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with full guideline revisions commissioned in approximately 6-year cycles� Publication of new, potentially practice-changing study results that are relevant to an existing or new drug, device, or management strategy will prompt evaluation by the Task Force, in consultation with the relevant guideline writing committee, to determine whether a focused

Evidence Review and Evidence Review Committees

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When developing recommendations, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies that are based on all available data� 4-7 Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies,  case  series,  cohort  studies,  systematic  reviews, and expert opinion� Only key references are cited�

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  independent  evidence  review  committee  (ERC)  is commissioned when there are 1 or more questions deemed of utmost clinical importance that merit formal systematic review� This systematic review will strive to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from a drug, device, or treatment strategy and to what degree� Criteria for commissioning an ERC and formal systematic review include: a) the absence of a current authoritative systematic review, b) the feasibility of defining the benefit and risk in a time frame consistent with the writing of a guideline, c) the relevance to a substantial number of patients, and d) the likelihood that the findings can be translated into actionable recommendations� ERC members may include methodologists, epidemiologists, healthcare providers, and biostatisticians� When a formal systematic review has been commissioned, the recommendations developed by the writing committee on the basis of the systematic review are marked with ' sr ' �

1. INTRODUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The focus of the '2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management  of  Patients  With  Valvular  Heart  Disease' 9,10 (2014 VHD guideline)  was  the  diagnosis  and  management of adult patients with valvular heart disease (VHD)� The field of VHD is rapidly progressing, with new knowledge of the natural history of patients with valve disease, advances  in  diagnostic  imaging,  and  improvements  in catheter-based and surgical  interventions�  Several  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  have  been  published since the 2014 VHD guideline, particularly with regard to the outcomes of interventions� Major areas of change include indications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR),  surgical  management  of  the  patient  with primary  and  secondary  mitral  regurgitation  (MR),  and management of patients with valve prostheses�

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All recommendations (new, modified, and unchanged) for each clinical section are included to provide a comprehensive assessment� The text explains new and modified recommendations,  whereas  recommendations  from  the previous guideline that have been deleted or superseded no longer appear� Please consult the full-text version of the  2014  VHD  guideline 10 for  text  and  evidence  tables supporting the unchanged recommendations and for clinical areas not addressed in this focused update� Individual recommendations  in  this  focused  update  will  be  incorporated into the full-text  guideline  in  the  future�  Recommendations from the prior guideline that remain current have been included for completeness but the LOE reflects the COR/LOE system used when initially developed� New and modified recommendations in this focused update reflect the latest COR/LOE system, in which LOE B and C are subcategorized for greater specificity� 4-7  The section numbers correspond to the full-text guideline sections�

2.4.2. Infective Endocarditis Prophylaxis: Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With the absence of RCTs that demonstrated the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis  (IE),  the  practice  of  antibiotic  prophylaxis  has  been questioned by national and international medical societ- ies� 11-14   Moreover, there is not universal agreement on which patient populations are at higher risk of developing IE than the general population� Protection from endocarditis  in  patients  undergoing  high-risk  procedures is  not  guaranteed�  A  prospective  study  demonstrated that  prophylaxis  given  to  patients  for  what  is  typically considered  a  high-risk  dental  procedure  reduced  but did not eliminate the incidence of bacteremia� 15  A 2013 Cochrane Database systematic review of antibiotic prophylaxis  of  IE  in  dentistry  concluded  that  there  is  no evidence to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective, highlighting the need for further study of this longstanding clinical dilemma� 13  Epidemiological data conflict with regard to incidence of IE after adoption of more limited prophylaxis, as recommended by the AHA and European Society of Cardiology, 16-20  and no prophylaxis, as recommended by the U�K� NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines� 21 Some studies indicate no increase in incidence of endocarditis with limited or no prophylaxis, whereas others suggest that IE cases have increased with adoption of the new guidelines� 16-22  The consensus of the writing group is that antibiotic prophylaxis is reasonable for the subset of patients at increased risk of developing IE and at high risk of experiencing adverse outcomes from IE� There is no evidence for IE prophylaxis in gastrointestinal procedures or genitourinary procedures, absent known active infection�

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The risk of developing IE is higher in patients with underlying VHD. However, even in patients at high risk of IE, evidence for the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis is lacking. The lack of supporting evidence, along with the risk of anaphylaxis and increasing bacterial resistance to antimicrobials, led to a revision in the 2007 AHA recommendations for prophylaxis limited to those patients at highest risk of adverse outcomes with IE. 11 These included patients with a history of prosthetic valve replacement, patients with prior IE, select patients with congenital heart disease, and cardiac transplant recipients. IE has been reported to occur after TAVR at rates equal to or exceeding those associated with surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and is associated with a high 1-year mortality rate of 75%. 30,31 IE may also occur after valve repair in which prosthetic material is used, usually necessitating urgent operation, which has high in-hospital and 1-year mortality rates. 32,33 IE appears to be more common in heart transplant recipients than in the general population, according to limited data. 23 The risk of IE is highest in the first 6 months after transplantation because of endothelial disruption, high-intensity immunosuppressive therapy, frequent central venous catheter access, and frequent endomyocardial biopsies. 23 Persons at risk of developing bacterial IE should establish and maintain the best possible oral health to reduce potential sources of bacterial seeding. Optimal oral health is maintained through regular professional dental care and the use of appropriate dental products, such as manual, powered, and ultrasonic toothbrushes; dental floss; and other plaque-removal devices.

CLINICAL STATEMNTS AND GUIDELINES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AVR is indicated for survival benefit, improvement in symptoms, and improvement in left ventricular (LV) systolic function in patients with severe symptomatic AS (Section 3.2.3 in the 2014 VHD guideline). 42-48 Given the magnitude of the difference in outcomes between those undergoing AVR and those who refuse AVR in historical series, an RCT of AVR versus medical therapy would not be appropriate in patients with a low-to-intermediate surgical risk (Section 2.5 in the 2014 VHD guideline). Outcomes after surgical AVR are excellent in patients who do not have a high procedural risk. 43-46,48 Surgical series demonstrate improved symptoms after AVR, and most patients have an improvement in exercise tolerance, as documented in studies with pre- and post-AVR exercise stress testing. 43-46,48 The choice of prosthetic valve type is discussed in Section 11.1 of this focused update.

VHD Guideline)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TAVR has been studied in RCTs, as well as in numerous observational studies and multicenter registries that include large numbers of high-risk patients with severe symptomatic AS. 49,50,52-56 In the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve) IA trial of a balloon-expandable valve, 50,53 TAVR (n=348) was noninferior to surgical AVR (n=351) for all-cause death at 30 days, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years ( P =0.001). 53,54 The risk of death at 5 years was 67.8% in the TAVR group, compared with 62.4% in the surgical AVR group (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86 to 1.24; P =0.76). 50 TAVR was performed by the transfemoral approach in 244 patients and the transapical approach in 104 patients. There was no structural valve deterioration requiring repeat AVR in either the TAVR or surgical AVR groups.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In a prospective study that randomized 795 patients to either self-expanding TAVR or surgical AVR, TAVR was associated with an intention-to-treat 1-year survival rate of 14.2%, versus 19.1% with surgical AVR, equivalent to an absolute risk reduction of 4.9%. 49 The rate of death or stroke at 3 years was lower with TAVR than with surgical AVR (37.3% versus 46.7%; P =0.006). 51 The patient's values and preferences, comorbidities, vascular access, anticipated functional outcome, and length of survival after AVR should be considered in the selection of surgical AVR or TAVR for those at high surgical risk. The specific choice of a balloon-expandable valve or self-expanding valve depends on patient anatomy and other considerations. 57 TAVR has not been evaluated for asymptomatic patients with severe AS who have a high surgical risk. In these patients, frequent clinical monitoring for symptom onset is appropriate, as discussed in Section 2.3.3 in the 2014 VHD guideline.

TAVR was compared with standard therapy in a prospective RCT of patients with severe symptomatic AS who were deemed inoperable. 53,58,60 The rate of all-cause death at 2 years was lower with TAVR (43.3%) (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.92; P =0.02) than with standard medical therapy (68%). 53,58,60 Standard therapy included percutaneous aortic balloon dilation in 84%. There was a reduction in repeat hospitalization with TAVR (55% versus 72.5%; P <0.001). In addition, only 25.2% of survivors were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV 1 year after TAVR, compared with 58% of patients receiving standard therapy ( P <0.001). However, the rate of major stroke was higher with TAVR than with standard therapy at 30 days (5.05% versus 1.0%; P =0.06) and remained higher at 2 years (13.8% versus 5.5%; P =0.01). Major vascular complications occurred in 16.2% with TAVR versus 1.1% with standard therapy ( P <0.001). 53,58,60

Recommendations for Choice of Intervention (Continued)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Similarly, in a nonrandomized study of 489 patients with severe symptomatic AS and extreme surgical risk treated with a self-expanding TAVR valve, the rate of all-cause death at 12 months was 26% with TAVR, compared with an expected mortality rate of 43% if patients had been treated medically. 59

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thus, in patients with severe symptomatic AS who are unable to undergo surgical AVR because of a prohibitive surgical risk and who have an expected survival of >1 year after intervention, TAVR is recommended to improve survival and reduce symptoms. This decision should be made only after discussion with the patient about the expected benefits and possible complications of TAVR. Patients with severe AS are considered to have a prohibitive surgical risk if they have a predicted risk with surgery of death or major morbidity (all causes) >50% at 30 days; disease affecting ≥ 3 major organ systems that is not likely to improve postoperatively; or anatomic factors that preclude or increase the risk of cardiac surgery, such as a heavily calcified (eg, porcelain) aorta, prior radiation, or an arterial bypass graft adherent to the chest wall. 58-61

In the PARTNER II (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve II) RCT, 62 which enrolled symptomatic patients with severe AS at intermediate risk (STS score ≥ 4%), there was no difference between TAVR and surgical AVR for the primary endpoint of all-cause death or disabling stroke at 2 years (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.09; P =0.25). All-cause death occurred in 16.7% of those randomized to TAVR, compared with 18.0% of those treated with surgical AVR. Disabling stroke occurred in 6.2% of patients treated with TAVR and 6.3% of patients treated with surgical AVR. 62

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In an observational study of the SAPIEN 3 valve, 63 TAVR was performed in 1077 intermediate-risk patients with severe symptomatic AS, with the transfemoral approach used in 88% of patients. At 1 year, the rate of all-cause death was 7.4%, disabling stroke occurred in 2%, reintervention was required in 1%, and moderate or severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation was seen in 2%. In a propensity score-matched comparison of SAPIEN 3 TAVR patients and PARTNER 2A surgical AVR patients, TAVR was both noninferior and superior to surgical AVR (propensity score pooled weighted proportion difference: -9.2%; 95% CI: -13.0 to -5.4; P <0.0001). 63,66

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the choice of surgical AVR or TAVR is being made in an individual patient at intermediate surgical risk, other factors, such as vascular access, comorbid cardiac and noncardiac conditions that affect risk of either approach, expected functional status and survival after AVR, and patient values and preferences, must be considered. The choice of mechanical or bioprosthetic surgical AVR (Section 11 of this focused update) versus a TAVR is an important consideration and is influenced by durability considerations, because durability of transcatheter valves beyond 3 and 4 years is not yet known. 65 TAVR has not been studied in patients with severe asymptomatic AS who have an intermediate or low surgical risk. In these patients, frequent clinical monitoring for symptom onset is appropriate, as discussed in Section 2.3.3 in the 2014 VHD guideline. The specific choice of a balloon-expandable valve or self-expanding valve depends on patient anatomy and other considerations. 41,57

In  chronic secondary MR,  the  mitral  valve  leaflets  and chords usually are normal (Table 2 in this focused update; Table 16 from the 2014 VHD guideline)� Instead, MR is associated  with  severe  LV  dysfunction  due  to  coronary artery disease (ischemic chronic secondary MR) or idiopathic myocardial disease (nonischemic chronic secondary MR)� The abnormal and dilated left ventricle causes papillary  muscle  displacement,  which  in  turn  results  in leaflet tethering with associated annular dilation that prevents adequate leaflet coaptation� There are instances in which both primary and secondary MR are present� The best therapy for chronic secondary MR is not clear because MR is only 1 component of the disease, with clinical outcomes also related to severe LV systolic dysfunction, coronary disease, idiopathic myocardial disease, or other diseases  affecting  the  heart  muscle�  Thus,  restoration of mitral valve competence is not curative� The optimal criteria for defining severe secondary MR have been controversial� In patients with secondary MR, some data suggest that, compared with primary MR, adverse outcomes are associated with a smaller calculated effective regurgitant orifice, possibly because of the fact that a smaller regurgitant volume may still represent a large regurgitant fraction in the presence of compromised LV systolic function (and low total stroke volume) added to the effects of elevated filling pressures� In addition, severity of secondary MR may increase over time because of the associated progressive LV systolic dysfunction and dysfunction due  to  adverse  remodeling  of  the  left  ventricle�  Finally, Doppler methods for calculations of effective regurgitant orifice area by the flow convergence method may under-

7.3.3. Intervention: Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is concern that the presence of MR leads to progressively more severe MR ('mitral regurgitation begets mitral regurgitation'). The concept is that the initial level of MR causes LV dilatation, which increases stress on the mitral apparatus, causing further damage to the valve apparatus, more severe MR and further LV dilatation, thus initiating a perpetual cycle of ever-increasing LV volumes and MR. Longstanding volume overload leads to irreversible LV dysfunction and a poorer prognosis. Patients with severe MR who develop an EF ≤ 60% or LVESD ≥ 40 have already developed LV systolic dysfunction. 112-115 One study has suggested that for L V function and size to return to normal after mitral valve repair, the left ventricular ejection fraction (L VEF) should be >64% and LVESD <37 mm. 112 Thus, when longitudinal follow-up demonstrates a progressive decrease of EF toward 60% or a progressive increase in LVESD approaching 40 mm, it is reasonable to consider intervention. Nonetheless, the asymptomatic patient with stable LV dimensions and excellent exercise capacity can be safely observed. 116

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral valve repair is reasonable for asymptomatic patients with chronic severe nonrheumatic primary MR (stage C1) and preserved LV function (LVEF >60% and LVESD <40 mm) in whom there is a high likelihood of a successful and durable repair with 1) new onset of AF or 2) resting pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic arterial pressure >50 mm Hg). 111,117-123

11.1. Evaluation and Selection of Prosthetic Valves

<!-- PAGE=? -->
11.1.2. Intervention: Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The choice of valve prosthesis in an individual patient is based on consideration of several factors, including valve durability, expected hemodynamics for a specific valve type and size, surgical or interventional risk, the potential need for long-term anticoagulation, and patient values and preferences. 147-149 Specifically, the trade-off between the potential need for reintervention for bioprosthetic structural valve deterioration and the risk associated with long-term anticoagulation should be discussed in detail with the patient. 142-145 Some patients prefer to avoid repeat surgery and are willing to accept the risks and inconvenience of lifelong anticoagulant therapy. Other patients are unwilling to consider long-term VKA therapy because of the inconvenience of monitoring, the attendant dietary and medication interactions, and the need to restrict participation in some types of athletic activity. Several other factors must be taken into consideration in a decision about the type of valve prosthesis, including other comorbidities (Table 3). Age is important because the incidence of structural deterioration of a bioprosthesis is greater in younger patients, but the risk of bleeding from anticoagulation is higher in older patients. 142,143,150,151 A mechanical valve might be a prudent choice for patients for whom a second surgical procedure would be high risk (ie, those with prior radiation therapy or a porcelain aorta). In patients with shortened longevity and/or multiple comorbidities, a bioprosthesis would be most appropriate. In women who desire subsequent pregnancy, the issue of anticoagulation during pregnancy is an additional consideration (Section 13 in the 2014 VHD guideline). The availability of transcatheter valve-in-valve replacement is changing the dynamics of the discussion of the trade-offs between mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, but extensive long-term follow-up of transcatheter valves is not yet available, and not all bioprostheses are suitable for a future valve-in-valve procedure. 152-154 A valve-in-valve procedure will always require insertion of a valve smaller than the original bioprosthesis, and patient-prosthesis mismatch is a potential problem, depending on the size of the initial prosthesis. Irrespective of whether a mechanical valve or bioprosthesis is placed, a root enlargement should be considered in patients with a small annulus to ensure that there is not an initial patient-prosthesis mismatch.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients <50 years of age at the time of valve implantation incur a higher and earlier risk of bioprosthetic valve deterioration. 141,149,151,155-157 Overall, the predicted 15-year risk of needing reoperation because of structural deterioration is 22% for patients 50 years of age, 30% for patients 40 years of age, and 50% for patients 20 years of age, although it is recognized that all bioprostheses are not alike in terms of durability. 151 Anticoagulation with a VKA can be accomplished with acceptable risk in the majority of patients <50 years of age, particularly in compliant patients with appropriate monitoring of International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels. Thus, the balance between valve durability versus risk of bleeding and thromboembolic events favors the choice of a mechanical valve in patients <50 years of age, unless anticoagulation is not desired, cannot be monitored, or is contraindicated. (See the first Class I recommendation for additional discussion).

11.2.2. Medical Therapy: Recommendations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many patients who undergo implantation of a surgical bioprosthetic MVR or AVR will not require life-long anticoagulation. However, there is an increased risk of ischemic stroke early after operation, particularly in the first 90 to 180 days after operation with either a bioprosthetic AVR or MVR. 198-205 Anticoagulation early after valve implantation is intended to decrease the risk of thromboembolism until the prosthetic valve is fully endothelialized. The potential benefit of anticoagulation therapy must be weighed against the risk of bleeding. In a nonrandomized study, patients with a bioprosthetic MVR who received anticoagulation had a lower rate of thromboembolism than those who did not receive therapy with VKA (2.5% per year with anticoagulation versus 3.9% per year without anticoagulation; P =0.05). 193 Even with routine anticoagulation early after valve surgery, the incidence of ischemic stroke within the first 30 postoperative days was higher after replacement with a biological prosthesis (4.6±1.5%) than after mitral valve repair (1.5±0.4%) or replacement with a mechanical prosthesis (1.3±0.8%; P <0.001). 206 Small RCTs have not established a convincing net benefit of anticoagulation after implantation of a bioprosthetic AVR 205,207 ; however, a large observational Danish registry demonstrated a lower risk of stroke and death with VKA extending up to 6 months, without a significantly increased bleeding risk. 197 Concern has also been raised about a higher-than-recognized incidence of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis leaflets after surgical valve replacement. 196 Thus, anticoagulation with an INR target of 2.5 may be reasonable for at least 3 months and perhaps for as long as 6 months after implantation of a surgical bioprosthetic MVR or AVR in patients at low risk of bleeding. Compared with oral anticoagulation alone, the addition of dual-antiplatelet therapy results in at least a 2- to 3-fold increase in bleeding complications, and the recommendations on triple therapy should be followed. 208

Recommendations for Bridging Therapy for Prosthetic Valves (Continued)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
'Bridging' therapy with either intravenous unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin has evolved empirically to reduce thromboembolic events during temporary interruption of oral anticoagulation in higher-risk patients, such as those with a mechanical MVR or AVR and additional risk factors for thromboembolism (eg, AF, previous thromboembolism, hypercoagulable condition, older-generation mechanical valves [ball-cage or tilting disc], LV systolic dysfunction, or >1 mechanical valve). 214

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When interruption of oral VKA therapy is deemed necessary, the agent is usually stopped 3 to 4 days before the procedure (so the INR falls to <1.5 for major surgical procedures) and is restarted postoperatively as soon as bleeding risk allows, typically 12 to 24 hours after surgery. Bridging anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is started when the INR falls below the therapeutic threshold (ie, 2.0 or 2.5, depending on the clinical context), usually 36 to 48 hours before surgery, and is stopped 4 to 6 hours (for intravenous unfractionated heparin) or 12 hours (for subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin) before the procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are no randomized comparative-effectiveness trials evaluating a strategy of bridging versus no bridging in adequate numbers of patients with prosthetic heart valves needing temporary interruption of oral anticoagulant therapy, although such studies are ongoing. The evidence used to support bridging therapy derives from cohort studies with poor or no comparator groups. 214,215 In patient groups other than those with mechanical heart valves, increasing concerns have surfaced that bridging therapy exposes patients to higher bleeding risks without reducing the risk of thromboembolism. 199 Accordingly, decisions about bridging should be individualized and should account for the trade-offs between thrombosis and bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommendation for Mechanical Prosthetic Valve Thrombosis Diagnosis and Follow-Up

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstruction of mechanical prosthetic heart valves may be caused by thrombus formation, pannus ingrowth, or a combination of both. 216 The presentation can vary from mild dyspnea to severe acute pulmonary edema. Urgent diagnosis, evaluation, and therapy are indicated because rapid deterioration can occur if there is thrombus causing malfunction of leaflet opening. The examination may demonstrate a stenotic murmur and muffled closing clicks, and further diagnostic evaluation is required. TTE and/or TEE should be performed to examine valve function and the status of the left ventricle. 216 Leaflet motion should be visualized with TEE (particularly for a mitral prosthesis) or with CT or fluoroscopy (for an aortic prosthesis). 217-223 Prolonged periods of observation under fluoroscopy or TEE may be required to diagnose intermittent obstruction. The presence and quantification of thrombus should be evaluated by either TEE or CT. 217,223 Differentiation of valve dysfunction due to thrombus versus fibrous tissue ingrowth (pannus) is challenging because the clinical presentations are similar. Thrombus is more likely with a history of inadequate anticoagulation, a more acute onset of valve dysfunction, and a shorter time between surgery and symptoms. Mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis is diagnosed by an abnormally elevated gradient across the prosthesis, with either limited leaflet motion or attached mobile densities consistent with thrombus, or both. Vegetations from IE must be excluded. If obstruction is present with normal leaflet motion and no thrombus, either patient-prosthesis mismatch or pannus formation is present (or both). Thrombus formation on the valve in the absence of obstruction can also occur and is associated with an increased risk of embolic events.

11.6.3. Intervention: Recommendation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical left-sided prosthetic valve obstruction is a serious complication with high mortality and morbidity and requires urgent therapy with either fibrinolytic therapy or surgical intervention. There has not been an RCT comparing the 2 interventions, and the literature consists of multiple case reports, single-center studies, multicenter studies, registry reports, and meta-analyses-with all the inherent problems of differing definitions of initial diagnosis, fibrinolytic regimens, and surgical expertise 224-235 (Data Supplement 7A). The overall 30-day mortality rate with surgery is 10% to 15%, with a lower mortality rate of <5% in patients with NYHA class I/II symptoms. 225,226,232-234 The results of fibrinolytic therapy before 2013 showed an overall 30-day mortality rate of 7% and hemodynamic success rate of 75% but a thromboembolism rate of 13% and major bleeding rate of 6% (intracerebral hemorrhage, 3%). 224-230 However, recent reports using an echocardiogram-guided slow-infusion low-dose fibrinolytic protocol have shown success rates >90%, with embolic event rates <2% and major bleeding rates <2%. 231,235 This fibrinolytic therapy regimen can be successful even in patients with advanced NYHA class and larger-sized thrombi. On the basis of these findings, the writing group recommends urgent initial therapy for prosthetic mechanical valve thrombosis resulting in symptomatic obstruction, but the decision for surgery versus fibrinolysis is dependent on individual patient characteristics that would support the recommendation of one treatment over the other, as shown in Table 4, as well as the experience and capabilities of the institution. All factors must be taken into consideration in a decision about therapy, and the decision-making process shared between the caregiver and patient. Final definitive plans should be based on the initial response to therapy.

11.7. Prosthetic Valve Stenosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical reoperation to replace the stenotic prosthetic heart valve has been the mainstay treatment modality� Although it is associated with acceptable mortality and morbidity in the current era, it remains a serious clinical event and carries a higher risk than the initial surgery� Reoperation  is  usually  required  for  moderate-to-severe prosthetic dysfunction (structural and nonstructural), dehiscence, and prosthetic valve endocarditis� Reoperation may also be needed for recurrent thromboembolism, severe intravascular hemolysis, severe recurrent bleeding from anticoagulant therapy, and thrombosed prosthetic valves� In 2015, catheter-based therapy with transcatheter valve-in-valve emerged as an acceptable alternative to treat high- and extreme-risk patients with bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis (stenosis, insufficiency, or combined) in the absence of active IE� 154

Symptomatic prosthetic valve stenosis secondary to thrombosis is observed predominantly with mechanical valves� Mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis and its treatment are discussed in Section 11�6� Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis can result in thromboembolic events or obstruction� In a pooled analysis from 3 studies including 187 patients who underwent either TAVR or bioprosthetic  surgical  AVR,  reduced  leaflet  motion  was  noted on 4-dimensional volume-rendered CT imaging in 21% of patients� 203 In this small cohort, therapeutic anticoagulation with warfarin was associated with lower incidence of reduced leaflet motion than that associated with dual antiplatelet therapy, as well as more restoration of leaflet  motion  on  follow-up  CT  imaging�  Subclinical  leaflet thrombosis was identified as the likely cause on the basis of advanced and characteristic imaging findings� 203 As  outlined  by  the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration,

most cases of reduced leaflet motion (which occurs in 10% to 40% of TAVR patients and 8% to 12% of surgical  AVR  patients)  were  discovered  by  advanced  imaging studies in asymptomatic patients� 236  The diagnosis of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis remains difficult, with most suspected bioprosthetic valve thrombosis based on increased transvalvular gradients�

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In some patients, the size of the prosthetic valve that can  be  implanted  results  in  inadequate  blood  flow  to meet the metabolic demands of the patient, even when the prosthetic valve itself is functioning normally� This situation,  called patient-prosthesis mismatch (defined  as an indexed effective orifice area ≤ 0�85 cm 2 /m 2 for aortic valve prostheses), is a predictor of a high transvalvular gradient, persistent LV hypertrophy, and an increased rate of cardiac events after AVR� 237,238  The impact of a relatively small valve area is most noticeable with severe

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are no medical therapies known to prevent or treat bioprosthetic valve degeneration. However, bioprosthetic valve thrombosis may present with slowly progressive stenosis months to years after implantation. Small, nonrandomized studies support the use of VKAs to treat patients with bioprosthetic valve thrombosis after both surgical AVR and TAVR. 203,242-246 In a retrospective single-center report of 31 patients with bioprosthetic valve thrombosis who were initially treated with either a VKA or surgery/thrombolysis, VKA-treated patients had 87% thrombus resolution and experienced hemodynamic and clinical improvement comparable to surgery/thrombolysis, with no complications. 244 Notably, in that case series, the peak incidence of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis occurred 13 to 24 months after implantation, with the longest interval being 6.5 years. 244 Surgery or thrombolysis may still be needed for patients who are hemodynamically unstable or have advanced and refractory HF, large mobile thrombus, or high risk of embolism. At present, the DOACs have not been adequately studied, nor has the US Food and Drug Administration approved them for prophylaxis or treatment of prosthetic valve thrombosis.

The VIVID (Valve-In-Valve International Data) Registry is the largest registry to date examining outcomes of the transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure in 459 patients, of whom about 40% had isolated stenosis and 30% had combined regurgitation and stenosis. 154 Within 1 month after the valvein-valve procedure, 7.6% of patients died, 1.7% had a major stroke, and 93% of survivors experienced good functional status (NYHA class I/II). The overall 1-year survival rate was 83.2%. 154 In nonrandomized studies and a systematic review comparing outcomes and safety of the transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure with repeat surgical AVR, the valve-in-valve procedure was found to have similar hemodynamic outcomes, lower stroke risk, and reduced bleeding risk as compared with repeat surgery. 248 No data are available yet on the durability and long-term outcomes after transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures. There are also unique clinical and anatomic challenges, requiring experienced operators with an understanding of the structural and fluoroscopic characteristics of the failed bioprosthetic valve. An anticipated hemodynamic improvement from the transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure occurs only in patients with larger-sized prostheses, because a smaller-sized valve will always be placed within a failing bioprosthesis. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the transcatheter heart valve-in-valve procedure for patients with symptomatic heart disease due to stenosis of a surgical bioprosthetic aortic valve who are at high or greater risk for open surgical therapy (as judged by a heart team, including a cardiac surgeon). 249 The transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve procedure is not currently approved to treat para-prosthetic valve regurgitation or for failed/degenerated transcatheter heart valves; and it is contraindicated in patients with IE. Transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation has also been successfully performed for failed surgical bioprostheses in the mitral, pulmonic, and tricuspid positions.

patientprosthesis mismatch, defined as an indexed orifice area <0�65 cm 2 /m 2 � Patient-prosthesis mismatch is especially detrimental in patients with reduced LVEF and may decrease the likelihood of resolution of symptoms and improvement in LVEF� Patient-prosthesis mismatch can be avoided or reduced by choice of a valve prosthesis that will have an adequate indexed orifice area, determined  by  the  patient's  body  size  and  annular  dimension� In some cases, annular enlargement or other approaches may be needed to allow implantation of an appropriately  sized  valve  or  avoidance  of  a  prosthetic valve� With bileaflet mechanical valves, patterns of blood flow are complex, and significant pressure recovery may be present; this may result in a high velocity across the prosthesis  that  should  not  be  mistaken  for  prosthetic valve stenosis or patient-prosthesis mismatch, particularly in those with small aortic diameters�

Prior recommendations for intervention choice did not specify patient symptoms. The patient population recommended for surgical AVR encompasses both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who meet an indication for AVR with low-to-intermediate surgical risk. This is opposed to the patient population recommended for TAVR, in whom symptoms are required to be present. Thus, all recommendations for type of intervention now specify the symptomatic status of the patient.

| I   | B-NR | Urgent initial treatment with either slow-infusion low-dose fibrinolytic therapy or emergency surgery is recommended for patients with a thrombosed leftsided mechanical prosthetic heart valve presenting with symptoms of valve obstruction. 224-231 | MODIFIED: LOE updated to B-NR. Multiple recommendations based only on NYHA class symptoms were combined into 1 recommendation. Slow-infusion fibrinolytic therapy has higher success rates and lower complication rates than prior high-dose regimens and is effective in patients previously thought to require urgent surgical intervention. The decision for emergency versus fibrinolytic therapy should be based on multiple surgery factors, including the availability of surgical expertise and the clinical experience with both treatments.

| I   | B   | Decisions about timing of surgical intervention should be made by a multispecialty Heart Valve Team of cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, and infectious disease specialists. 255                                                  | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| I   | B   | Early surgery (during initial hospitalization before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is indicated in patients with IE who present with valve dysfunction resulting in symptoms of HF. 256-261                     | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| I   | B   | Early surgery (during initial hospitalization before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is indicated in patients with left-sided IE caused by S. aureus, fungal, or other highly resistant organisms. 261-268 | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| I   | B   | Early surgery (during initial hospitalization before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is indicated in patients with IE complicated by heart block, annular or aortic abscess, or destructive penetrating lesions. 261,269-273 | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| I   | B   | Early surgery (during initial hospitalization before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) for IE is indicated in patients with evidence of persistent infection as manifested by persistent bacteremia or fevers lasting longer than 5 to 7 days after onset of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. 261,263,268,274-276 | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| I   | C   | Surgery is recommended for patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis and relapsing infection (defined as recurrence of bacteremia after a complete course of appropriate antibiotics and subsequently negative blood cultures) without other identifiable source for portal of infection. | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| I   | B   | Complete removal of pacemaker or defibrillator systems, including all leads and the generator, is indicated as part of the early management plan in patients with IE with documented infection of the device or leads. 277-280          | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| IIa | B   | Complete removal of pacemaker or defibrillator systems, including all leads and the generator, is reasonable in patients with valvular IE caused by S. aureus or fungi, even without evidence of device or lead infection. 277-280 | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| IIa | C   | Complete removal of pacemaker or defibrillator systems, including all leads and the generator, is reasonable in patients undergoing valve surgery for valvular IE.                                                                    | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| IIa | B   | Early surgery (during initial hospitalization before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) is reasonable in patients with IE who present with recurrent emboli and persistent vegetations despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. 281-283 | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
| IIb | B   | Early surgery (during initial hospitalization before completion of a full therapeutic course of antibiotics) may be considered in patients with native valve endocarditis who exhibit mobile vegetations greater than 10 mm in length (with or without clinical evidence of embolic phenomenon). 281-283 | 2014 recommendation remains current.                |
