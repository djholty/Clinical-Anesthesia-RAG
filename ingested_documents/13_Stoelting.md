Key Points

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e overall frequency of clinically signi fi cant liver disease is relatively low in the surgical patient population. However, the complexity of derangements in hepatic function necessitates an in-depth understanding of this topic. Th e liver plays a central  role  in  the  functioning of several body systems, such as the activity of the gastrointestinal tract; metabolic activities, including the synthesis and degradation or detoxi fi cation of essential compounds; the pharmacokinetics of anesthetic and anesthesia adjuncts; and hemostasis. It is thus desirable that an anesthesiologist be familiar with the various hepatic pathophysiologic  conditions  and  anticipate  the  consequences  of liver dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASSESSMENT OF LIVER FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initial presentation of most hepatic abnormalities typically  involves  symptoms  of  malaise  or fl ulike  symptoms followed  by  the  development  of  jaundice. Th us  laboratory testing is essential to assess the cause and the severity of the illness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bilirubin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bilirubin is the degradation product of hemoglobin and myoglobin. Unconjugated bilirubin formed in the periphery is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated to monoglucuronides and diglucuronides by the action of the enzyme glucuronosyl transferase. Th is greatly increases the water solubility of bilirubin, which enhances its elimination from the body while simultaneously  decreasing  its  ability  to  cross  biologic  membranes, including the blood-brain barrier. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with an increase in bilirubin production, decreased hepatic uptake of bilirubin, or decreased conjugation of bilirubin. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with decreased canalicular  transport  of  bilirubin,  acute  or  chronic  hepatocellular dysfunction, or obstruction of the bile ducts (Table 13-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normally, total bilirubin concentration is less than 1 mg/ dL.  A  serum  bilirubin  concentration  of  3  mg/dL  results  in scleral icterus and a level above 4 mg/dL causes overt jaundice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aminotransferases

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are enzymes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis. ALT is a cytoplasmic enzyme that is highly speci fi c to the liver, but  the  cytoplasmic  and  mitochondrial  isoenzymes  of  AST are present in extrahepatic tissues as well. Frequently, hepatocellular injury results in the release of aminotransferases and leads to signi fi cantly increased serum levels of these enzymes. Th e AST/ALT ratio can be a useful measurement. When levels of both enzymes are elevated, a ratio of less than 1 is characteristic of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. A ratio between 2 and 4 is typical of alcoholic liver disease, and a ratio of more than 4 is distinctive of Wilson's disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkaline Phosphatase

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increases  in  serum  alkaline  phosphatase  lack  speci fi city  as a diagnostic test for liver disease because its isoenzymes are present in plasma membranes throughout the body. However, in  cholestatic  disorders,  an  increased  alkaline  phosphatase concentration may indicate the bile salt-induced damage of hepatocyte  membranes.  Alkaline  phosphatase  has  a  serum half-life of approximately 1 week, so the level remains elevated for several days a ft er resolution of biliary obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
International Normalized Ratio

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prolongation  of  the  international  normalized  ratio  (INR) shows strong correlation with deteriorating hepatic function and has a reliable predictive value for survival of patients with liver disease. It is, of course, not a complete indicator of hemostatic function. It can indicate impairment of hepatic synthetic function  of  coagulation  factors,  but  evaluation  of  the  entire coagulation cascade requires other testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Albumin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Albumin is the most abundant plasma protein. It is synthesized exclusively by hepatocytes and accounts for about 15% of all the protein synthesized by the liver. Albumin concentration is a major determinant of countless metabolic processes and the bioavailability of a wide variety of substances, because substrates are o ft en transported bound to albumin. A diminished serum albumin concentration can be an indicator of protein malnutrition, a protein-losing disease such as nephrotic syndrome, or a severe reduction in the synthetic capacity of the liver.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Serologic and Genetic Testing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antigen and antibody detection is the cornerstone in elucidating the di ff erential diagnosis of viral and/or autoimmune hepatitis.  Similarly,  abnormal  levels  of  protein  markers  are diagnostic in α 1 - antitrypsin de fi ciency, Wilson's disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and genetic testing can be a valuable  adjunct  for  con fi rmation  of  the  suspected  diagnosis  of certain heritable liver diseases.

HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gilbert's Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common example of a hereditary hyperbilirubinemia (present in varying degrees in about 10% of the general population) is Gilbert's syndrome, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. Th e primary defect is  a  mutation  in  the  glucuronosyl  transferase  enzyme,  but usually about one third of normal enzyme activity is present. Plasma bilirubin concentrations seldom exceed 5 mg/dL but will  increase  twofold  to  threefold  with  fasting  or  illness  or stress.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Crigler-Najjar Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Crigler-Najjar  syndrome  is  a  rare  hereditary  form  of  severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that results from a mutation in the glucuronosyl transferase enzyme. Typically glucuronosyl transferase activity is reduced to less than 10% of normal. Children who lack e ff ective enzyme function are jaundiced in the perinatal period. Kernicterus can develop. Optimal treatment for a neurologically intact child includes exchange transfusion in the neonatal period, daily phototherapy throughout childhood, and early liver transplantation before brain damage develops. Long-term phenobarbital therapy may decrease jaundice by stimulating the activity of glucuronosyl transferase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bilirubin phototherapy lights should be available for management of anesthesia in children with this syndrome. Fasting should be minimized because this stress is known to increase plasma bilirubin concentration. Morphine is metabolized by a glucuronosyl transferase enzyme system di ff erent from that de fi cient in Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Th erefore, morphine can be safely administered to these patients. Barbiturates, inhaled anesthetics,  and  muscle  relaxants  are  acceptable  choices  in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dubin-Johnson Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dubin-Johnson  syndrome  is  caused  by  decreased  ability  to transport organic ions from hepatocytes into the biliary system, which results in conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Despite the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, these patients are not cholestatic. Inheritance of this syndrome is autosomal recessive. Th e disorder is benign.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign Postoperative Intrahepatic Cholestasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign  postoperative intrahepatic cholestasis  may  occur when surgery is prolonged, especially if it is complicated by hypotension,  hypoxemia,  and  the  need  for  blood  transfusion. Th e  hyperbilirubinemia  may  be  caused  by  an  increase in bilirubin production (breakdown of transfused red blood cells or resorption of a hematoma) and/or decreased hepatic clearance of bilirubin. Jaundice with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually apparent within 24 to 48 hours. Results of liver function tests other than those for bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase are usually normal or only mildly abnormal. Th is condition typically resolves in tandem with improvement in the underlying surgical or medical condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis is a rare hereditary metabolic disease presenting as cholestasis in infancy and end-stage cirrhosis before adulthood. Pruritus may be severe. Th e precise metabolic defect responsible for this disease has not been identi fi ed. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment.  Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis or cirrhosis is in fl uenced by the presence of malnutrition, portal hypertension, coagulation  abnormalities,  hypoalbuminemia,  and  chronic hypoxemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISEASES OF THE BILIARY TRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cholelithiasis and in fl ammatory biliary tract disease constitute  major  health  problems  in  the  United  States.  Approximately 30 million Americans have gallstones. Th e prevalence of gallstones is signi fi cantly higher in women than in men. Th e  prevalence  rises  with  increasing  age,  obesity,  rapid weight  loss,  and  pregnancy.  Gallstone  formation  is  most likely related to abnormalities in the physicochemical characteristics of the various components of bile. Approximately 90%  of  gallstones  in  countries  consuming  a  Western  diet high in  protein  and  fat  are  radiolucent,  composed  primarily of cholesterol. Th e remaining gallstones are usually radiopaque and are typically composed of calcium bilirubinate. Th ese gallstones develop most o ft en in patients with cirrhosis or hemolytic anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Cholecystitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who have gallbladder or biliary tract stones can exhibit no symptoms (silent disease), acute symptomatic disease, or chronic  intermittently  symptomatic  disease.  Obstruction  of the cystic duct or common bile duct by a gallstone causes acute in fl ammation. Cholelithiasis is present in 95% of patients with acute  cholecystitis.  Obstruction  of  the  cystic  duct,  which  is nearly always due to a gallstone, produces acute in fl ammation of the gallbladder.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of acute cholecystitis include nausea, vomiting,  fever,  abdominal  pain,  and  right  upper  quadrant tenderness.  Severe  pain  that  begins  in  the  mid-epigastrium, moves to  the  right  upper  quadrant,  and  may  radiate  to  the back, and is caused by a stone lodged in a duct is designated biliary  colic. Th is  pain  is  extraordinarily  intense  and  usually begins  abruptly  and  subsides  gradually.  Patients  may  notice dark urine and scleral icterus. Most jaundiced patients have stones in the common bile duct at the time of surgery. Laboratory testing commonly demonstrates leukocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute cholecystitis are treated  with  intravenous fl uids  and  opioids  to  manage  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 13 DISEASES OF THE LIVER AND BILIARY TRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
277

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pain. Febrile patients with leukocytosis are given antibiotics. Surgery is typically considered when the patient's condition has  stabilized.  Laparoscopic  cholecystectomy  is  the  procedure of choice. In approximately 5% of patients, laparoscopic cholecystectomy  must  be  converted  to  open  cholecystectomy  because  in fl ammation  obscures  the  anatomy.  Patients with  septic  shock,  peritonitis,  pancreatitis,  or  coagulopathy may undergo open cholecystectomy or ultrasonographically guided percutaneous cholecystostomy. Cholangiography can be performed during surgery, and common duct stones can be removed concurrently or subsequently by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  considerations  for  laparoscopic  cholecystectomy are similar to those for other laparoscopic procedures. Insu ffl ation  of  the  abdominal  cavity  (pneumoperitoneum) results in increased intraabdominal pressure that may interfere  with  the  adequacy  of  ventilation  and  venous  return. Changes  in  cardiovascular  function  resulting  from  insuffl ation include an immediate decrease in venous return and cardiac output and an increase in mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance. During the next several minutes, there is partial restoration of cardiac output, but blood pressure and heart rate typically remain unchanged. Th is pattern of cardiovascular responses is most likely the result of interactions caused by increased abdominal pressure, neurohumoral responses,  and  absorbed  carbon  dioxide.  Placement  of  the patient in reverse Trendelenburg's position favors movement of abdominal contents away from the operative site and may improve ventilation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  use  of  opioids  during  anesthesia  for  this  operation is  controversial  because  these  drugs  can  cause  spasm  of  the sphincter  of  Oddi.  However,  opioids  have  o ft en  been  used without  any  adverse  e ff ects,  which  emphasizes  that  not  all patients  respond  to  opioids  with  sphincter  of  Oddi  spasm. It  has  been  suggested  that  the  incidence  of  opioid-induced sphincter spasm is quite low (<3%). It is possible to antagonize this spasm by intravenous administration of glucagon, or naloxone or nitroglycerin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choledocholithiasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e term choledocholithiasis indicates that gallstones are present  in  the  common  bile  duct.  Stones  typically  lodge  at  the point of insertion of the common bile duct into the ampulla of Vater. Patients with choledocholithiasis may present with signs  of  cholangitis  (fever,  shaking  chills,  jaundice,  right upper quadrant pain) or jaundice alone and a history of pain suggestive of cholecystitis. Not all stones obstruct the common duct. Some pass into the duodenum or into a pancreatic duct, which results in acute pancreatitis. Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations typically increase markedly and abruptly when a stone obstructs the common bile duct.  Aminotransferase  concentrations  are  only  modestly increased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute obstruction of the common bile duct by a stone may mimic ureterolithiasis because of the similarities in location and severity  of  the  pain,  but  liver  function  tests  distinguish between  these  two  conditions.  Acute  in fl ammation  of  the head of the pancreas may produce obstruction of the common bile duct. Computed tomography or ERCP helps distinguish pancreatitis from choledocholithiasis. Symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction or viral hepatitis may produce abdominal pain that is similar to that of biliary tract disease. Th e epigastric pain may be similar to that in patients with pancreatic carcinoma. Acute intermittent porphyria can also cause severe abdominal pain, but alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin concentrations are normal in this condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endoscopic  sphincterotomy  is  the  initial  treatment  for patients with choledocholithiasis. ERCP can be used to identify the cause of common bile duct obstruction and can also be used to remove a stone or place a stent. Sphincterotomy is also  the  recommended treatment for patients with retained bile  duct  stones  a ft er  gallbladder  or  biliary  tract  surgery. Operative  exploration  of  the  common  bile  duct  is  reserved for the few patients in whom endoscopic sphincterotomy is unsuccessful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEPATITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatitis is an in fl ammatory disease of the liver parenchyma. It is o ft en due to viral infection but can also be caused by autoimmune mechanisms or  by  ingestion  of  chemicals,  such  as drugs, alcohol, or solvents that are toxic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatitis  may  occur  with  minimal  symptoms  but  is  frequently complicated by at least malaise and jaundice. Acute hepatitis may be a self-limiting illness, but it can also progress to  chronic  hepatitis,  cirrhosis,  hepatocellular  carcinoma,  or liver failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Viral Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e vast majority of cases of acute viral hepatitis in the United States  are  caused  by  one  of  four  viruses:  hepatitis  A  virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or hepatitis D virus. However,  there  are  other  viruses  such  as  herpes  simplex  virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus that can also cause acute hepatitis. Hepatitis A virus is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis (50%), followed in incidence by hepatitis B virus (35%) and hepatitis C virus (15%). Hepatitis D virus occurs only in patients with hepatitis B and is present as a coinfection. Di ff erentiating the various kinds of viral hepatitis is di ffi cult based solely on the clinical presentation and routine laboratory testing of liver function (bilirubin, AST, ALT, and alkaline  phosphatase  levels).  A  de fi nitive  diagnosis  requires serologic testing (Table 13-2) and, occasionally, liver biopsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of acute viral hepatitis is symptomatic. Avoidance of  alcohol  consumption,  restriction  of  excessive  physical exertion, and good nutrition are essential. In addition, it is necessary to monitor for signs of progression to either fulminant liver failure or chronic hepatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Viral  hepatitis  can  be  prevented  by  avoidance  of  exposure to activities with a high risk of viral exposure and active

immunization  with  virus-speci fi c  vaccine.  A ft er  successful vaccination, regular serum antibody titer monitoring is prudent. If needed, a booster immunization can ensure e ff ective protection. In cases of acute viral exposure, passive immunization with pooled gamma globulin is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  development of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma  are  risks  of  chronic  hepatitis  B  and  C  infection, although decades may pass before the adverse e ff ects occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug-Induced Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  large  variety  of  medications  (analgesics,  anticonvulsants, antibiotics,  antihypertensives,  and  many  others)  can  cause hepatic  in fl ammation  resulting  from  idiosyncratic  reaction or dose-related toxicity. Th e onset of clinical signs is usually 2 to 6 weeks a ft er exposure but can be delayed for as long as 6  months a ft er  starting  the  medication.  Because  the  clinical symptoms and signs and the histologic appearance of the liver can be identical to those of acute viral hepatitis, prompt and accurate diagnosis is imperative. Failure to identify and discontinue the o ff ending drug may have dire consequences.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acetaminophen overdose is a well-known cause of hepatocellular toxicity and liver necrosis. High concentrations of toxic metabolites of this compound overwhelm the conjugative capacity of the liver by exhausting glutathione stores. Oral N -acetylcysteine administration within the fi rst 8 hours a ft er acetaminophen ingestion can dramatically reduce the extent of parenchymal injury (see Chapter 25).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autoimmune Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
By de fi nition, autoimmune hepatitis is an in fl ammatory condition of the liver that is caused by a cellular immune response against  self-antigens  in  the  native  liver. Th is  illness  has  a prevalence of 10 to 20 per 100,000 and is much more common in women (70%) than in men. A concurrent autoimmune illness is o ft en present. Th e diagnosis is con fi rmed by the combination of clinical fi ndings, laboratory test results (for bilirubin, liver enzymes, serum autoantibodies, immunoglobulin G concentration), and histologic evaluation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  no  curative  intervention  to  treat  autoimmune hepatitis, so the goal of treatment is to induce a long-lasting remission with the use of corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive drugs. In case of progression to end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation may be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Halothane Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For anesthesiologists, halothane hepatitis is an especially relevant and unique form of hepatitis. In genetically susceptible individuals, certain volatile anesthetics (halothane, en fl urane, iso fl urane, des fl urane) can elicit an immune-mediated hepatotoxic reaction. Th e most compelling evidence for this is the presence of circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies in the majority of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  halothane  hepatitis. Th ese antibodies are directed against microsomal proteins on the surface of hepatocytes that have been covalently modi fi ed by the reactive oxidative tri fl uoroacetyl halide metabolite of halothane to form neoantigens. Th is acetylation of liver proteins, in e ff ect, changes these proteins from "self" to "nonself" (neoantigens),  which  results  in  the  formation  of  antibodies against this new protein and a form of autoimmune hepatitis. Antitri fl uoroacetyl antibody testing is speci fi c  to  this  condition. Because of its relatively high degree of drug metabolism, halothane  is  the  most  common  volatile  anesthetic  to  cause hepatitis,  with  an  estimated  incidence  of  about  1  in  20,000 administrations in adult patients. Sensitized individuals may show cross-reactivity with other fl uorinated volatile anesthetic

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
agents. Sevo fl urane is an exception, however, because it has a di ff erent chemical structure and does not produce tri fl uoroacetylated metabolites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Hepatic Dysfunction

<!-- PAGE=? -->
New-onset  postoperative  jaundice  is  best  evaluated  via  a systematic  approach.  First,  the  prospect  of  benign  postoperative  intrahepatic  cholestasis-a  relatively  common occurrence-should  be  considered;  the  prevalence  of  this condition  increases  with  prolonged  surgery,  hypotension, hypoxemia, and massive blood transfusion. Next, the presence of a large occult hematoma, hemolysis, or sepsis should be considered. Finally, drug-induced or immune-mediated hepatotoxicity  can  be  considered.  Discontinuation  of  all possible contributing drugs and supportive therapy (intravascular volume restoration, oxygen supplementation, drainage of pathologic fl uid collections, intravenous antibiotics, etc.) are essential while the reason for the jaundice is being established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic Hepatitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic hepatitis is de fi ned as any hepatic in fl ammation that lasts  longer  than  6  months. Th is  diagnosis  is  corroborated by  elevated  serum  concentrations  of  liver  enzymes  and/or bilirubin and histologic evidence of ongoing in fl ammation. In the United States alcoholic liver disease is the most common cause  of  chronic  liver  disease  and  cirrhosis.  Chronic hepatitis C infection is the second most prevalent cause of chronic hepatitis. Th ere can be a wide range of disease severity in chronic hepatitis, so the prognosis can be quite variable.  Mild  forms  of  chronic  hepatitis  may  not  signi fi cantly impact  quality  of  life.  However,  advanced  and  progressive hepatitis does interfere with daily activities. Severe chronic hepatitis evolves into cirrhosis with compromise of multiple organ systems.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CIRRHOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Progressive parenchymal liver damage and co-existent tissue regeneration disrupt normal hepatic architecture and lead to nodular transformation. Th is  altered  morphology is observable  with  computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography. Histologic examination may help to di ff erentiate the cause of cirrhosis (alcoholic cirrhosis, postnecrotic cirrhosis, primary or secondary biliary cirrhosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, α 1 -antitrypsin de fi ciency, or other disorders.)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fatigue,  malaise,  and  jaundice  are  typically  present,  and later the symptoms and signs of advanced liver disease such as spider angiomata, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and ascites appear.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory fi ndings include elevated bilirubin, aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase concentrations; an increased INR;  thrombocytopenia;  and  a  decreased  serum  albumin concentration. Hypoglycemia is common due to inadequate gluconeogenesis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Portal Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  tandem with the fi brotic degeneration of the liver in cirrhosis and the resultant increase in resistance to intrahepatic blood fl ow, portal vein blood fl ow decreases and portal hypertension  develops.  Ascites,  hepatomegaly,  splenomegaly,  and peripheral edema are typically present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascites and Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascites and cirrhosis frequently co-exist. Contributory factors for the development of ascites include portal hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and sodium and water retention (Figure 13-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When ascites formation is signi fi cant,  medical  therapy  is directed at correcting the underlying hypoalbuminemia and the sodium and water retention. Adherence to a low-sodium diet and administration of an aldosterone antagonist, such as spironolactone, can promote a gradual diuresis and a reduction in the volume of ascites. Diuresis should not exceed 1 L of fl uid per day to prevent hypovolemia and azotemia. For ascites that is resistant to medical therapy, paracentesis or insertion of a  transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt can be considered.  Less  commonly the ascitic fl uid  can  be  returned  to the intravascular space by a LeVeen shunt, which is a subcutaneous one-way conduit between the peritoneal cavity and the internal jugular vein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the clinical condition of a patient with ascites deteriorates suddenly, the ascitic fl uid must be analyzed for turbidity, leukocytosis, and bacterial growth. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has a very high morbidity and mortality even with timely initiation of antibiotic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastroesophageal Varices

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because portal hypertension interferes with splanchnic venous blood fl ow,  submucosal  veins  at  the  gastroesophageal  junction become dilated to allow for increased collateral fl ow via the azygous and hemiazygous veins. Not all cirrhotic patients develop  varices,  and  not  all  patients  with  varices  develop bleeding.  However,  if  variceal  bleeding  occurs,  it  is  usually hemodynamically signi fi cant. Patients with massive bleeding or  co-existent  hepatic  encephalopathy  may  require  endotracheal intubation to protect the airway and prevent pulmonary aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variceal bleeding can be controlled by endoscopic therapy, including  variceal  banding  and  sclerotherapy.  To  prevent recurrent bleeding, a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can be inserted or a surgical portosystemic shunt created  in  selected  patients. Th ese  shunts  may  not  prolong overall survival, but they are e ff ective in preventing recurrent bleeding.  Medical  treatment  of  esophageal  varices  includes administration of propranolol or nadolol, which reduces portal hypertension and reduces the risk of rebleeding.

Hepatic Encephalopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuropsychiatric  changes  o ft en  appear  with  declining  liver function. A ff ected areas may include cognition, motor function, personality, and consciousness. Asterixis and slow or fl attened waves on the electroencephalogram are pathognomonic signs  of  advanced  liver  disease  with  encephalopathy.  Portosystemic shunting may exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy by allowing ammonia and other metabolic byproducts to bypass hepatic clearance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e treatment of hepatic encephalopathy includes restriction of protein intake to reduce ammonia production, enteral administration of nonabsorbable disaccharides (lactulose) or antibiotics (neomycin) to decrease ammonia absorption, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and avoidance of all forms of  opioids,  sedative-hypnotic  drugs,  and  anesthetic  drugs  if possible.

It is presumed that accumulation of vasodilatory compounds such as prostaglandins or interleukins is at least partially responsible for the increased cardiac output and the arteriovenous shunting seen in cirrhosis. Reduced blood viscosity  resulting  from  hypoalbuminemia  and  anemia  may also play a role.

In  addition  to  the  peripheral  vasodilation  seen  with  hepatic cirrhosis,  signi fi cant  intrapulmonary  shunting  and  ventilation/perfusion mismatch occurs in up to one quarter of these patients. Signs and symptoms include dyspnea and hypoxemia, which  may  worsen  in  the  upright  position.  Di ff erentiation between  intrapulmonary  shunting  and  right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting can be achieved using contrast echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e only de fi nitive treatment for severe hepatopulmonary syndrome  is  liver  transplantation.  Administration  of  somatostatin and supplemental oxygen is used as supportive therapy until a donor organ becomes available.

Portopulmonary Hypertension

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Co-existent portal vein and pulmonary artery hypertension has a  prevalence of less than 4% in cirrhotic patients. Portopulmonary hypertension typically presents years a ft er the diagnosis of cirrhosis, and symptoms can include dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope. Right-sided heart dysfunction is common. Th e severity  of  portopulmonary  hypertension  is  independent  of the severity of the cirrhosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cirrhotic patients with portopulmonary hypertension have a very limited life expectancy. Liver transplantation is the only known curative therapy, but it can be recommended only if pulmonary vascular resistance is not severely increased. Patients with  end-stage  liver  disease  who  have  a  mean  pulmonary artery pressure of more than 45 mm Hg are poor candidates for  liver  transplantation. Th e  1-year  mortality  in  this  subset of patients is more than 80% with or without surgery. In rare cases, if severe pulmonary hypertension is responsive to medical  therapy,  such  as  treatment  with  prostaglandins  or  nitric oxide, then liver transplantation might be attempted. Perioperative monitoring and treatment of such a patient should be carried out in concert with an experienced pulmonologist.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatorenal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Functional  renal  failure that  is  associated  with  severe  liver disease is called hepatorenal syndrome. Th e prognosis of this disorder is very poor even though there is no intrinsic renal abnormality. Th e  exact  pathophysiology of hepatorenal syndrome  is  unknown,  but  it  appears  that  dehydration  and diminished renal blood fl ow o ft en precede the decrease in glomerular fi ltration rate and development of azotemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  replacement  therapy  is  the  mainstay  of  supportive treatment until the underlying liver dysfunction can be normalized or a donor organ becomes available for transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatorenal syndrome can be categorized into type 1 and type 2 forms based on rapidity of onset, that is, how fast the serum creatinine level rises and creatinine clearance declines. Short-term mortality is very high in both varieties of hepatorenal syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulopathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  liver  synthesizes  most  of  the  coagulation  factors  of  the coagulation cascade. In addition, hepatocytes produce a number of anticoagulant proteins (protein S, protein C, protein Z, antithrombin III) and the anti fi brinolytic plasminogen activator inhibitor. Th e  liver  is  also  essential  for  clearance  of  activated coagulation factors from the circulation. End-stage liver disease can be accompanied by numerous disturbances in this intricate system of clot formation and clot dissolution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with end-stage liver disease evaluation of coagulation function requires insight into the complex hemostatic abnormalities  that  can  be  present  and  interpretation  of  the results of a number of both quantitative and qualitative tests of coagulation function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE LIVER FAILURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Definition

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute liver failure is de fi ned as the rapid development of severe liver damage with impaired synthetic function and encephalopathy in someone who previously had normal liver function or  well-compensated  liver  disease.  By  de fi nition,  acute  liver failure develops in less than 4 weeks (measured from the fi rst appearance of physical signs such as jaundice to the loss of 80% to 90% of hepatic function). Acute liver failure includes fulminant hepatic failure, that is, liver failure that occurs within 8 days of the onset of symptoms. Acute liver failure o ft en a ff ects young people and carries a very high mortality. Th e underlying cause and the grade of encephalopathy on presentation are important determinants of outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Impaired synthetic function and encephalopathy are critical events in this disorder. In most cases of acute liver failure there  is  widespread  hepatocellular  necrosis  and  a  variable amount of hepatic parenchymal in fl ammation. Patients with acute  liver  failure  are  at  increased  risk  of  progressing  from mild encephalopathy to cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and coma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Etiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common causes of acute liver failure are acetaminophen overdose, idiosyncratic drug reaction, acute viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Less common causes include Wilson's disease and Reye's syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulopathy, renal failure, cardiorespiratory complications, and  severe  metabolic  derangements  are  frequent.  Intensive care unit admission and close observation are essential; supportive  therapy  must  include  restoring  intravascular fl uid volume, normalizing electrolyte concentrations, and providing  mechanical  ventilation  if  needed.  "Liver  dialysis"  (using an  extracorporeal  system  somewhat  like  a  kidney  dialysis machine that pumps blood through a series of fi lters to remove unwanted materials) is evolving as a therapeutic option and is  available  as  an  experimental  treatment  at  some  medical centers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intracranial  pressure  monitoring  is  controversial.  Information about intracranial  pressure  could  be  very  helpful  in controlling  this  pressure,  but  placement  of  an  intracranial pressure sensor in the presence of severe coagulopathy carries a signi fi cant risk of intracranial hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Outcome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mortality  from  acute  liver  failure  is  high,  in  excess  of  80%, despite  the  accessibility  of  sophisticated  multidisciplinary intensive care. Survival is strongly dependent on what caused the  liver  failure  and  whether  a  known  antidote  for  the  speci fi c  underlying  cause  exists,  such  as N -acetylcysteine  for

ace  taminophen poisoning. Liver transplantation is an option if  a  donor organ is available, but the short-term mortality is still higher than 65% even with transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHESIA FOR PATIENTS WITH DECREASED LIVER FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Identifying  the  population  of  patients  with  liver  disease can  be  challenging,  because  clinical  manifestation  of  liver dysfunction  occur  only  a ft er  a  substantial  decline  in  liver function has occurred. However, routine preoperative liver function testing in all preoperative patients is not a practical  way  to fi nd  the  occasional  person  with  liver  dysfunction. Currently, with the prevalence of alcoholic and hepatitis C-related  cirrhosis  increasing,  the  number  of  patients  with compromised liver function requiring surgery is on the rise. An estimated  1  in  700  patients  undergoing  elective  surgery has  abnormal  liver  enzyme  levels  and  is  at  increased  risk for  perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality  related  to  hepatic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk Assessment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  liver  disease  have  a  diminished  physiologic reserve  with  which  to  respond  to  surgical  stress  and,  as  a result,  are  at  increased  risk  for  bleeding,  infection,  hepatic decompensation, and death. Th e  extent  of  liver  damage and the type of surgery are the two main determinants of perioperative risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Child-Pugh Score

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Child-Pugh  score  was  developed  speci fi cally  to  predict surgical mortality in patients with cirrhosis. It assigns points for fi ve  variables  (total  bilirubin  level,  serum  albumin  level, INR, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy) that are combined into a single score to categorize patients into Child-Pugh class A, B, or C (Tables 13-3 and 13-4). Th e predicted perioperative mortality for intraabdominal surgery in these patient groups is 10%, 30%, and 80%, respectively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  general,  patients  in  Child-Pugh  classes  A  and  B  are suitable candidates for surgery when preoperative optimization and attentive perioperative care are provided. Patients in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 13-2 Algorithm for the management of surgical patients with abnormal liver function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Child-Pugh class C are usually treated medically if the disease process permits. Surgery, if necessary, should be delayed until liver function improves (Figure 13-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimal  preoperative  management  may  decrease  the incidence  of  perioperative  complications  and  death.  In addition to the standard history taking, physical examination,  medication review, and laboratory assessment, evaluation for acute or ongoing hepatic deterioration is critically important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative Care

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NUTRITION, METABOLISM, AND ELECTROLYTE LEVELS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malnutrition and malabsorption are common in patients with advanced  liver  disease.  Vitamin  de fi ciencies  and  hypoalbuminemia have consequences for a number of organ functions and for pharmacokinetics as well. Improvement in diet, especially  caloric  enhancement, protein enrichment as tolerated, and vitamin supplementation, are desirable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As a consequence of diminished hepatic gluconeogenesis, hypoglycemia is likely. Blood glucose monitoring is warranted, and a glucose infusion may be required during surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyponatremia  despite  an  increased  total  body  sodium content is  common, because the degree of free water retention exceeds the degree of sodium retention. Administration of an aldosterone antagonist combined with consumption of a low-sodium diet help to correct this abnormality. In patients receiving  diuretic  therapy  creatinine  and  electrolyte  levels should be monitored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENCEPHALOPATHY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  degree  of  preoperative  hepatic  encephalopathy  may  or may  not  parallel  the  extent  of  liver  dysfunction.  Encephalopathy is exaggerated by infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and the presence of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. New onset of neurologic symptoms and signs requires investigation for the potential cause. Lethargic or unconscious patients may require endotracheal intubation for airway protection. Th e presence of preoperative encephalopathy is associated with a greatly increased perioperative mortality rate in patients undergoing nonhepatic surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONARY COMORBIDITIES AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to evaluation for the possible presence of hepatopulmonary syndrome and/or portopulmonary hypertension, preoperative  assessment  of  liver  function  must  include  an evaluation of the risk of aspiration and measurement of oxygen saturation with the patient breathing room air, pulmonary function testing, and measurement of pulmonary artery pressure if appropriate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  chronic  liver  disease,  especially  those  with ascites, frequently have increased gastric volumes and delayed gastric emptying. Th erefore, rapid-sequence induction of general  anesthesia  with  cricoid  pressure  is  prudent  to  facilitate endotracheal intubation and airway protection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  cirrhosis  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing renal  dysfunction.  Gastrointestinal  bleeding,  hypotension, hypoperfusion,  large-volume  paracentesis,  and  administration  of  potentially  nephrotoxic  medications  all  increase  the likelihood of acute renal deterioration. An increasing serum creatinine  concentration  and  a  decreasing  creatinine  clearance are ominous signs in patients with marginal liver function. Hepatorenal syndrome has no speci fi c remedy. However, maintenance of euvolemia and renal replacement therapy are essential while the patient tries to recover from the underlying hepatic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients bene fi t from monitoring for the presence of metabolic  acidosis,  particularly  lactic  acidosis,  and  correction  of acid-base and electrolyte imbalances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CIRCULATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A hyperdynamic circulation is a prominent feature of hepatic insu ffi ciency. Th e  decreased  systemic  vascular  resistance  is, to some extent, compensated for by an increased cardiac output. However, hypoalbuminemia and the resulting decrease in plasma oncotic pressure can cause fl uid to shi ft to the interstitial space, so edema is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In hypotensive patients, invasive monitoring (arterial line, cardiac output measurement), intravascular volume replacement, and vasopressor therapy may be necessary. In euvolemic, vasodilated  patients,  vasopressor  administration  can  help restore  blood  pressure  without  compromising  tissue  perfusion.  Phenylephrine,  norepinephrine,  and  vasopressin  are commonly used for this purpose during liver transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COAGULATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coagulopathy is very common. Th e combination of reduced procoagulant  factor  production  and  simultaneous  decreases in  anticoagulant  modulator  concentrations  typically  result in  excessive  bleeding.  Laboratory  testing  of  clotting  factor concentrations, fi brinogen  levels,  platelet  counts,  and  other parameters,  combined  with  clinical  observation  of  bleeding and thromboelastography may be particularly helpful in diagnosing the cause of the bleeding diathesis and devising an optimal treatment plan.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  malnutrition is present, vitamin K administration is helpful to enhance hemostasis via production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelets, or a combination of these products may be indicated.  Transfusion  therapy  is  best  guided  by  laboratory analysis of the underlying problem rather than simply use of an empiric formula for infusion of the various blood products. A dysfunctional liver has a diminished capacity to metabolize citrate, a component of blood products and cell saver infusates, so monitoring of ionized calcium concentration is necessary. Intravenous calcium administration is o ft en indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHARMACOKINETICS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacokinetics  in  patients  with  hepatic  dysfunction  can be altered by impaired hepatic synthetic function, increased volume of distribution, decreased plasma protein binding of medications, and decreased clearance of drugs. For example, a larger initial dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxant is necessary to achieve an e ff ective plasma concentration resulting from the increase in volume of distribution, but subsequent doses of these drugs should be reduced to re fl ect  decreased hepatic  drug  clearance.  Cisatracurium  may  be  particularly useful in patients with liver disease because its elimination is independent of liver function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postsurgical Recovery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver failure is the most common cause of postoperative death in patients with cirrhosis. For optimal postoperative observation and care, admission to an intensive care unit is prudent, especially if the patient's condition was unstable during surgery. In addition to monitoring postoperative liver function, critical  care  will  also  include  maintaining  hemodynamics, ensuring satisfactory oxygenation and ventilation, frequently

LIVER TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Approximately  7000  liver  transplantation  surgeries  are  performed annually in the United States. Th e  1-year survival is more  than  85%,  the  3-year  survival  is  currently  more  than 80%, and the 5-year survival is more than 70%. Liver transplantation, once considered an experimental surgical procedure, has become the treatment of choice for various forms of severe or irreversible liver dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
More  than  90%  of  livers  for  transplantation  are  cadaveric  organs.  Live  donor  liver  transplantation,  which  usually involves removal of an entire lobe of the liver, produces excellent  results  in  children.  However,  adult-to-adult  live  donor liver transplantation is o ft en problematic because of size mismatching. Th e small-for-size syndrome is not uncommon and manifests as liver dysfunction within the fi rst week a ft er surgery. It appears that cirrhotic patients do better with a donor liver at least as large as their native liver.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alcoholism,  chronic  progressive  hepatitis  (especially  that caused  by  hepatitis  C  virus),  and  hepatocellular  carcinoma were all considered contraindications to liver transplantation in the past, but now these entities have become the most frequent indications for this surgery. Less common indications include  primary  sclerosing  cholangitis, α 1 -antitrypsin  de fi -ciency,  nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis,  hemochromatosis,  Wilson's disease, and acute liver failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Organ Allocation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To facilitate fair distribution of the limited number of allogra ft s among the 17,000 patients or so on the national liver transplantation waiting lists, the United Network for Organ Sharing and Eurotransplant International Foundation use the Model for  End-Stage  Liver  Disease  (MELD)  scoring  system. Th is replaced the Child-Pugh system for liver transplant purposes. Th e MELD score is used to predict the chance of 90-day mortality without liver transplantation and is calculated based on three laboratory test results:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3 glyph[triangleright] 8 × log e (bilirubin in mg / dL) GLYPH<c=12,font=/AAAAAU+STIXGeneral-Regular-Identity-H> 11 glyph[triangleright] 2 × log e (INR) GLYPH<c=12,font=/AAAAAU+STIXGeneral-Regular-Identity-H> 9 glyph[triangleright] 6 × log e (creatinine in mg / dL) GLYPH<c=12,font=/AAAAAU+STIXGeneral-Regular-Identity-H> 0 glyph[triangleright] 643

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MELD scores can range from 6 to 40, and patients are ranked on the waiting list according to their scores. Th e patients with the  highest  scores  are  at  the  top  of  the  list.  Patients'  MELD scores  are  recalculated  regularly  to  re fl ect  the  frequently changing conditions in potential transplant recipients. When

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MELD score does not re fl ect  the  severity  of  the  underlying liver disease and its prognosis, as in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, a MELD score is assigned based on the staging of the cancer, o ft en according to the Milan criteria, which classify a single liver tumor of 5 cm or less or a total of not more than three tumors with none larger than 3 cm as potentially suitable for treatment by liver transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Procedure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery for removal of the native liver and implantation of the donor liver has three phases: the dissection phase, the anhepatic phase, and the reperfusion or neohepatic phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anhepatic stage begins  when  the  blood  supply  to  the native liver is interrupted by clamping of the hepatic artery and portal vein. To avoid a marked decrease in venous return and cardiac output as well as splanchnic venous congestion during occlusion of the inferior vena cava, a venovenous bypass system is o ft en used. Placement of the donor liver may require vigorous retraction near the diaphragm, leading to compromise of ventilation and oxygenation. Because of the lack of liver metabolic function during the anhepatic phase, metabolic acidosis, decreased drug metabolism, and citrate intoxication are likely. A calcium infusion may be needed to treat hypocalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e dissection phase involves mobilizing the vascular structures  around  the  liver  (hepatic  artery,  portal  vein,  suprahepatic and infrahepatic vena cava), isolating the common bile duct, and removing the native liver. Cardiovascular instability resulting from hemorrhage, venous pooling as a result of decreases  in  intraabdominal  pressure,  and  impaired  venous return resulting from surgical retraction are not uncommon during this phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e reperfusion or neohepatic  phase begins  a ft er  surgical anastomosis  of  the  major  vascular  structures  to  the  donor liver.  Before  the  vascular  clamps  are  removed,  the  allogra ft is fl ushed  to  remove  air,  debris,  and  preservative  solutions. Despite this step, subsequent unclamping can cause signi fi cant hemodynamic  instability,  dysrhythmias,  severe  bradycardia, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. Once the allogra ft begins to function, hemodynamic and metabolic stability are gradually restored and urine output increases. Recovery of the capacity to metabolize drugs occurs soon a ft er reperfusion of the gra ft . Clotting parameters usually normalize with administration of clotting factors. Postoperative support of ventilation and oxygenation may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver function test results return to normal following successful liver transplantation. Liver transplantation also results in reversal of the hyperdynamic circulation that characterizes liver  failure.  Oxygenation  improves,  although  intrapulmonary  shunts  may  persist  and  contribute  to  ventilation/perfusion  abnormalities.  Normal  physiologic  mechanisms  that protect hepatic blood fl ow are blunted a ft er liver transplantation. Th e liver is normally an important source of autotransfusion of blood volume in shock states via a vasoconstrictive response,  and  this  mechanism  may  be  impaired  a ft er  liver transplantation.

Recent Advances in Liver Transplantation

Th e most recent developments in liver transplantation include blood-sparing transfusion strategies and early extubation a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BLOOD TRANSFUSION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current  understanding  of  the  complexities  of  hemostatic mechanisms  and  the  widespread  use  of  advanced  diagnostic  tests  of  coagulation  function  have  resulted  in  a  dramatic reduction in the amount of blood transfusion per case. Th is reduction in blood transfusion has also reduced the incidence of citrate toxicity and hypervolemia and has positively a ff ected postoperative outcome.  Intensive care unit and  hospital lengths of stay have become shorter.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EARLY POSTOPERATIVE EXTUBATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When the duration of surgery is shorter and the intraoperative course is uneventful, shortening the usual period of postoperative mechanical ventilation may be considered in some patients.  Transplantation  centers  are  becoming  increasingly interested  in fast-tracking appropriate  patients,  to  optimize both patient care and perioperative resource utilization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Diseases  of  the  liver  and  biliary  tract  can  be  categorized as parenchymal liver disease (hepatitis and cirrhosis) and cholestasis with or without obstruction of the extrahepatic biliary pathway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Bilirubin  is  the  degradation  product  of  hemoglobin  and myoglobin.  Unconjugated  bilirubin  is  transported  to  the liver,  where  it  is  conjugated  by  glucuronosyl  transferase. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with an increase in bilirubin production, decreased hepatic uptake of bilirubin,  or  decreased  conjugation  of  bilirubin.  Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with decreased canalicular transport of bilirubin, acute or chronic hepatocellular dysfunction, or obstruction of the bile ducts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  use  of  opioids  during  anesthesia  for  gallbladder  or common bile duct surgery is controversial because these drugs can cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. However, it  is  possible  to  antagonize  this  spasm  with  intravenous administration of glucagon, nitroglycerin, or naloxone.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute  hepatitis  is  most  o ft en  a  result  of  viral  infection but can also be caused by drugs and toxins. In the United States, approximately 50% of acute viral hepatitis in adults is  due  to  infection  with  hepatitis  A  virus,  35%  to  infection  with  hepatitis  B  virus,  and  15%  to  infection  with hepatitis C virus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Major complications of hepatitis B and C infection include the development of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Drugs  (analgesics,  volatile  anesthetics,  antibiotics,  antihypertensives,  anticonvulsants,  tranquilizers)  can  cause hepatitis  indistinguishable  histologically  from  acute  viral

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hepatitis.  Many of these drug reactions are idiosyncratic; that is, they are rare, unpredictable, and not dose dependent. Failure to discontinue the o ff ending drug may result in progressive hepatitis and even death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Halothane  hepatitis,  a  rare  form  of  hepatic  dysfunction, can follow administration of volatile anesthetics, especially halothane,  in  genetically  susceptible  individuals.  Microsomal proteins on the surface of hepatocytes that have been modi fi ed by the tri fl uoroacetyl halide metabolite of halothane form neoantigens. Formation of antibodies against these proteins produces a form of autoimmune hepatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ En fl urane,  iso fl urane,  and  des fl urane  can  form  tri fl uoroacetyl  metabolites,  which  results  in  cross-sensitivity  with halothane. However, the incidence of hepatitis a ft er use of these anesthetics is very much lower than a ft er halothane administration because they undergo a much lower degree of metabolism. Sevo fl urane does not undergo metabolism to  tri fl uoroacetylated  metabolites. Th erefore,  unlike  the other fl uorinated volatile anesthetics, sevo fl urane does not produce immune-mediated hepatotoxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Chronic  hepatitis  is  characterized  by  long-term  abnormalities in levels of liver function markers and evidence of in fl ammation on liver biopsy specimens. Chronic hepatitis is de fi ned as disease that lasts 6 months or longer. Th e most common diseases that cause chronic hepatitis are autoimmune hepatitis and chronic viral hepatitis (infection with hepatitis B or C virus).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Portal hypertension is the result of an increase in resistance to blood fl ow through the portal venous system as a result of the fi brotic cirrhotic process. Portal hypertension combined  with  hypoalbuminemia  and  increased  secretion  of vasoconstrictor and antinatriuretic factors and antidiuretic hormone causes development of ascites.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Surgery for liver transplantation is characterized by three phases: the dissection phase, the anhepatic phase, and the reperfusion  or  neohepatic  phase. Th e  dissection  phase involves mobilizing the vascular structures around the liver (hepatic artery, portal vein, suprahepatic and infrahepatic vena cava), isolating the common bile duct, and removing the native liver. Th e anhepatic stage begins when the blood supply to the native liver is interrupted by clamping of the hepatic artery and portal vein. Th e reperfusion or neohepatic phase begins a ft er surgical anastomosis of the major vascular structures to the donor liver.
