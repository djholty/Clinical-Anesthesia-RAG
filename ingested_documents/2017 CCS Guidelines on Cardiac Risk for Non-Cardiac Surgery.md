ABSTRACT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines Committee and key Canadian opinion leaders believed there was a need for up to date guidelines that used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system of evidence assessment for patients who undergo noncardiac surgery. Strong recommendations included: 1) measuring brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal fragment of proBNP (NT-proBNP) before surgery to enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation in patients who are 65 years of age or older, are 45-64 years of age with signi /uniFB01 cant cardiovascular disease, or have a Revised Cardiac Risk Index score /C21 1; 2) against performing preoperative resting echocardiography, coronary computed tomography angiography, exercise or cardiopulmonary exercise testing, or pharmacological stress echocardiography or radionuclide imaging to enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation; 3) against the initiation or continuation of acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of perioperative cardiac events, except in patients with a recent coronary artery stent or who will undergo carotid endarterectomy; 4) against a 2

Worldwide 1 in every 30-40 adults has major noncardiac surgery (ie, de /uniFB01 ned in this report as surgery requiring overnight hospital admission) annually, 1 and > 10 million of the > 200,000,000 patients having surgery will suffer a major cardiac complication (ie, cardiac death, myocardial infarction/ injury, cardiac arrest) in the /uniFB01 rst 30 days after surgery. 2 Moreover, the number of patients who undergo surgery is increasing, as is their mean age and number of cardiac risk factors. 3 Major perioperative cardiac complications are important because they account for at least a third of perioperative deaths, 2 result in substantial morbidity, 2 prolong hospitalization, 4 increase cost, 5 and affect intermediate and long-term prognosis. 6

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although previous perioperative cardiac risk guidelines exist, 7,8 members of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Guidelines Committee and several Canadian opinion leaders believed there was a need for up-to-date cardiac guidelines for patients who undergo noncardiac surgery using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system of evidence assessment for guidelines. 9 These individuals believed that this process could result in some recommendations divergent from previous perioperative guidelines. The CCS Guidelines Committee appointed co-chairs, a primary panel, and a secondary panel to develop these guidelines. Beyond CCS members, these panels also included a variety of medical specialists who belong to the Canadian Anesthesiologists ' Society, Canadian Association of General Surgeons, Canadian Association of Thoracic Surgeons, Canadian Orthopaedic Association, Canadian Society of Internal Medicine, and Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery; members are listed in Appendix 1.

Guidelines Development

The primary panel established the scope of the guidelines (ie, 4 themes: preoperative cardiac risk assessment, perioperative cardiac risk modi /uniFB01 cation, monitoring for perioperative cardiac events, and management of perioperative cardiac du risque cardiaque p /C19 eriop /C19 eratoire ; 3) contre l ' introduction ou la continuation de l ' acide ac /C19 etylsalicylique pour pr /C19 evenir les /C19 ev /C19 enements cardiaques p /C19 eriop /C19 eratoires, except /C19 e chez les patients ayant subi l ' implantation r /C19 ecente d ' une endoprothèse coronarienne ou qui subiront une endart /C19 eriectomie carotididienne ; 4) contre l ' introduction des a 2agonistes ou des b -bloqueurs dans les 24 heures qui pr /C19 ecèdent l ' intervention chirurgicale ; 5) la suspension des inhibiteurs de l ' enzyme de conversion de l ' angiotensine et des antagonistes des r /C19 ecepteurs de l ' angiotensine II 24 heures avant l ' intervention chirurgicale ; 6) la facilitation de l ' abandon du tabac avant l ' intervention chirurgicale ; 7) la mesure quotidienne de la troponine de 48 à 72 heures après l ' intervention chirurgicale chez les patients qui avaient une mesure /C19 elev /C19 ee des NT-proBNP/BNP avant l ' intervention chirurgicale ou s ' il n ' y avait eu aucune mesure des NT-proBNP/BNP avant l ' intervention chirurgicale, chez ceux qui ont un score RCRI /C21 1, ou qui sont âg /C19 es de 45 à 64 ans et qui ont une maladie cardiovasculaire importante, ou qui sont âg /C19 es de 65 ans ou plus ; 8) l ' introduction du traitement par acide ac /C19 etylsalicylique et statines chez les patients qui souffrent de dommages myocardiques et d ' infarctus après l ' intervention chirurgicale.

complications), identi /uniFB01 ed topics and working groups, searched the literature, developed the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment tables, voted on the recommendations, and wrote the guidelines. The secondary panel reviewed the guidelines manuscript and made suggested edits and comments, which the primary panel addressed. Next the guidelines were sent to the CCS Guidelines Committee; they also provided suggested edits and comments that the primary panel addressed before /uniFB01 nally submitting the guidelines to the CCS Council.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of uncertainty regarding the reliability of data that were published by Dr Don Poldermans, 10 the committee decided to exclude studies for which he was the /uniFB01 rst or senior author. If a study by Dr Poldermans was included in a metaanalysis, the panel only included the meta-analysis in a summary of /uniFB01 ndings table if his study had results that were consistent with the results from the other studies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During an in-person meeting and several conference calls, the primary panel reviewed the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment tables for each topic. Before discussing any topic all panel members had to declare if they had any /uniFB01 nancial or intellectual con /uniFB02 icts of interest. If a panel member had a con /uniFB02 ict of interest, they were allowed to participate in the discussion but were not allowed to vote on the recommendation. Supplemental Table S1 shows details of all declared con /uniFB02 icts of interest and individual voting results.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The panel used the GRADE recommendation rating system, and recommendations were graded as a strong or conditional recommendation on the basis of high, moderate, low, or very low quality of evidence. 11 Supplemental Table S2 shows, for each GRADE recommendation, the corresponding balance of bene /uniFB01 ts vs the risks and burdens, the methodological quality of the supporting evidence, and the implications. 11

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each recommendation required at least two-thirds of the noncon /uniFB02 icted primary panel members to agree during a vote on a GRADE of recommendation rating. If this was not achieved, the primary panel re-evaluated the evidence and another vote

If two-thirds of the panel members believed the evidence was too weak to support a recommendation, then no recommendation was made. If two-thirds of the panel members believed that a recommendation was indicated only on the basis of values and preferences for a topic with no direct research evidence (eg, communicating to patients their perioperative cardiac risk), then a good practice statement was made. 12

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Cardiac Risk Assessment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Accurate preoperative cardiac risk estimation can serve several functions. Valid estimates of the risks and bene /uniFB01 ts of surgery can facilitate informed decision-making about the appropriateness of surgery. Accurate cardiac risk estimation can also guide management decisions (eg, consideration of endovascular vs open surgical approach) and inform decisions around monitoring (eg, troponin measurements) after surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Which Patients Should Undergo Cardiac Risk Assessment Before Noncardiac Surgery?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our recommendations only pertain to patients (1) 45 years of age and older or (2) patients 18-44 years of age with known signi /uniFB01 cant cardiovascular disease (ie, coronary artery disease, cerebral vascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, congestive heart failure, severe pulmonary hypertension, or a severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality, such as aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy), because these patients have, or are at risk of having, an underlying cardiac substrate that puts them at risk of a perioperative cardiac complication. 2,13-16 Moreover, our recommendations apply to noncardiac surgeries that require at least an overnight stay in the hospital after surgery, because of the availability of evidence and these surgeries are most likely to produce suf /uniFB01 cient cardiac stressors to put these patients at risk of a cardiac complication. 2,13

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Figure 1 provides an overview of our approach to preoperative cardiac risk assessment and perioperative cardiac monitoring. We divided surgeries into 3 categories on the

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
basis of the timing of surgery (ie, emergency, urgent/semiurgent, and elective), and these categories in /uniFB02 uenced our recommendations regarding preoperative cardiac risk assessment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regarding whether physicians should undertake a preoperative cardiac risk assessment, our recommendations represent good practice statements. We believe that providing patients with the opportunity to engage in shared decisionmaking for major health care decisions d including the decision about undergoing elective surgery d irrespective of its effect on other patient-important outcomes, is of value in itself. Providing an accurate risk assessment is a prerequisite for shared decision-making in the perioperative setting. Among patients who undergo elective surgery, patients who are 45 years of age or older or 18-44 years of age with known signi /uniFB01 cant cardiovascular disease have the most to gain from preoperative cardiac risk evaluation d in other elective surgery patients the risk assessment will result in a suf /uniFB01 ciently low risk that it is very unlikely to in /uniFB02 uence decisions regarding surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If a patient requires emergency surgery (ie, an acute life- or limb-threatening condition), we believe the vast majority of patients ' values and preferences will favour the bene /uniFB01 ts of surgery over the risks; therefore, surgery should not be delayed unnecessarily. We believe most patients ' values and preferences will favour the bene /uniFB01 ts of urgent surgery (eg, surgery for an acute bowel obstruction or hip fracture) or semiurgent surgery (ie, surgery for a cancer that has the potential to metastasize) over the risks, unless there is an unstable cardiovascular condition (eg, unstable angina, acute stroke), severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality, or severe pulmonary hypertension. If this is the case, this information might in /uniFB02 uence the decision around delaying, cancelling, or proceeding with surgery, and the choice of the surgical and anaesthetic techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GOOD PRACTICE STATEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who require emergency surgery, we recommend against delaying surgery for a preoperative cardiac risk assessment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who require urgent or semiurgent surgery, we recommend undertaking preoperative cardiac risk assessment only if the patients ' history or physical examination suggests there is a potential undiagnosed severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality, severe pulmonary hypertension, or an unstable cardiovascular condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who undergo elective noncardiac surgery who are 45 years of age or older or 18-44 years of age with known signi /uniFB01 cant cardiovascular disease, we recommend they undergo preoperative cardiac risk assessment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Preoperative cardiac risk assessments should be undertaken by a physician or surgeon with substantial knowledge in this area (eg, a thorough understanding of these perioperative guidelines) and who is pro /uniFB01 cient in cardiac clinical evaluation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk communication

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is an ethical requirement to accurately apprise patients about the bene /uniFB01 ts and risks of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GOOD PRACTICE STATEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend communicating to patients their perioperative cardiac risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S3 and S4 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and the GRADE quality assessment for communicating perioperative cardiac risk, respectively. A survey of 104 general internists who performed an average of 17 preoperative consults a month showed marked variability in de /uniFB01 nitions of low, moderate, and high risk. 17 With these results, there is substantial risk of misunderstanding between individuals when they hear subjective terms of risk. A systematic review of high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in surgical and nonsurgical settings showed that patients have a more accurate perception of risk if probabilistic information is presented as numbers like event rates (natural frequencies), rather than words (ie, subjective terms like low, moderate, or high chance), probabilities, or summarized as effect measures such as relative risk (RR) reduction. 18

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RECOMMENDATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend explicit communication of perioperative cardiac risk on the basis of the expected event rate among 100 patients or the range of risk consistent with the 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval (CI) of the risk estimate (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. An example of communicating perioperative cardiac risk quantitatively follows. ' Ms Smith, if we had 100 patients with the same underlying conditions that you have who were to undergo the same type of surgery as you, we would expect 8 to 12 of these patients to suffer a heart attack, cardiac arrest, or die within the /uniFB01 rst 30 days after surgery. This also means we would expect 88 to 92 of these patients to go through surgery without one of these complications. '

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methods of preoperative cardiac risk assessment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Researchers have evaluated 3 methods of estimating perioperative cardiac risk (ie, clinical risk indices, cardiac biomarkers, and noninvasive cardiac testing) that can provide the required data for risk communication in addition to routine clinical evaluation.

indices, respectively. These risk indices include the most validated clinical risk index (known as the R evised C ardiac R isk I ndex [RCRI]), 13 and 2 risk indices that were recently developed using data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP). 15,19 Although some risk factors (eg, severe aortic stenosis) have important perioperative prognostic implications, a risk factor might not show up in a risk index because few or no patients in the original study had the relevant risk factor or it was not assessed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The RCRI includes 6 factors, each worth 1 point (ie, history of ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, preoperative insulin use, preoperative creatinine > 177 m mol/L, and high-risk surgery; Table 1). 13 In a systematic review that included 792,740 patients from 24 studies, the RCRI showed moderate discrimination to predict major perioperative cardiac complications. 20

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Table 2 and Supplemental Table S7 show the pooled risk estimates of external validation studies of the RCRI that were published in the past 15 years, systematically monitored perioperative troponin measurements, and reported event rates for the various RCRI scores. The results showed risk estimates for myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or death of 3.9% (95% CI, 2.8%-5.4%) for an RCRI score of 0, 6.0% (95% CI, 4.9%-7.4%) for an RCRI score of 1, 10.1% (95% CI, 8.1%-12.6%) for an RCRI score of 2, and 15.0% (95% CI, 11.1%-20.0%) for an RCRI score /C21 3. 21-25 These values are higher than the risk estimates on the basis of the original data that were used to derive the RCRI. 13,26 The likely explanation for these differences is that the original RCRI

study monitored creatine kinase muscle and brain isoenzyme and excluded emergency surgery patients, whereas the external validation studies monitored troponin measurements that are much more sensitive than creatine kinase muscle and brain isoenzyme, and some studies included emergency surgery patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The NSQIP M yocardial I nfarction and C ardiac A rrest (MICA) risk index and the A merican C ollege of S urgeons (ACS) NSQIP risk index have both been developed using large data sets. 15,19 In these studies, these risk indices showed superior discrimination compared with the RCRI; however, it is highly probable that the NSQIP MICA and the ACS NSQIP risk indices underestimated cardiac risk, because patients did not undergo systematic measurements of perioperative troponin levels in these studies. Without cardiac biomarker screening more than half of all perioperative myocardial infarctions go undetected. 27 This likely explains the low number of perioperative myocardial infarctions in these studies that developed the NSQIP MICA and the ACS NSQIP risk indices. 15,19 Moreover, the NSQIP MICA and the ACS NSQIP risk indices have not undergone external validation in a study that has systematically monitored troponin measurements after noncardiac surgery. For these reasons the panel favoured the RCRI for cardiac risk prediction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RECOMMENDATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When evaluating cardiac risk, we suggest clinicians use the RCRI over the other available clinical risk prediction scores (Conditional Recommendation; LowQuality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Self-reported functional capacity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some groups have recommended assessing patients ' selfreported functional capacity to determine their metabolic equivalents (METs), to guide perioperative cardiac risk assessment. 28 There are, however, limited data to inform this issue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 1999, Reilly et al. evaluated 600 consecutive patients who underwent major noncardiac surgery and showed that after adjustment for age, patient self-reported functional capacity (METs) did not predict perioperative cardiovascular complications (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.81; 95% CI, 0.94-3.46). 29 Similarly, Wiklund et al. determined METs in 5939 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery and showed after adjustment for age that patients ' METs were not independently predictive of major perioperative cardiac complications. 30 Moreover, the data raised concerns about observer bias in the estimation of patients ' METs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the limitations of the evidence, the primary panel unanimously decided not to make a recommendation on how to use patient self-reported functional capacity to estimate perioperative cardiac risk. A large prospective cohort study (scheduled to report in 2017) that is evaluating the prognostic capabilities of a physicians ' assessment of patients ' METs vs other measures (eg, cardiopulmonary testing) will

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac biomarkers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Brain natriuretic peptides (BNPs) and N-terminal fragment of proBNP (NT-proBNP) are released from the myocardium in response to various stimuli such as myocardial stretch and ischemia. 32-34 Several prospective observational studies have evaluated the prognostic capabilities of NTproBNP and BNP to predict major cardiovascular events after noncardiac surgery. Supplemental Tables S8 and S9 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for the prognostic capabilities of NT-proBNP and BNP, respectively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An individual patient data meta-analysis included 2179 patients from 18 studies and showed that a preoperative NT-proBNP/BNP measurement was independently associated with the primary outcome (ie, death or nonfatal myocardial infarction) at 30 days after noncardiac surgery (aOR, 3.40; 95% CI, 2.57-4.47; P < 0.001). 35 Importantly, a preoperative NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before noncardiac surgery improved risk prediction among patients who did and did not suffer the primary outcome. Values /C21 300 ng/L for NT-proBNP and /C21 92 mg/L for BNP were identi /uniFB01 ed as signi /uniFB01 cant thresholds associated with an increased risk of the primary outcome. According to these thresholds, 7.6% of patients had an elevated NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before noncardiac surgery. Death or nonfatal myocardial infarction within 30 days after surgery occurred in 4.9% of patients with preoperative NT-proBNP/BNP values below these thresholds compared with 21.8% of patients with NT-proBNP/BNP values at or above these thresholds (Table 3). These /uniFB01 ndings were consistent with results from previous metaanalyses. 35-39

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RECOMMENDATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend measuring NT-proBNP or BNP before noncardiac surgery to enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation in patients who are 65 years of age or older, are 45-64 years of age with signi /uniFB01 cant cardiovascular disease, or have an RCRI score /C21 1 (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

Values and preferences. Cost and accessibility were considered important determinants of biomarker selection. Considering cost, we restricted testing to patient groups that had a baseline clinical risk estimate > 5%. Data from the V ascular Events i n Noncardiac S urgery Pat i ents C o hort Evaluatio n (VISION) Study showed that patients 65 years of age or older or 45-64 years of age with known cardiovascular disease have a baseline risk > 5% for cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days after surgery, whereas patients without these characteristics have a /C20 2.0% 30-day event rate. 2 Compared with cardiac imaging and noninvasive cardiac stress testing, NT-proBNP/ BNP biomarkers are inexpensive and avoid the need for return visits.

Practical tip. Hospitals that do not analyze NT-proBNP/ BNP in their core laboratory can obtain an instrument to allow clinicians to obtain NT-proBNP as a point of care test in the preoperative setting, offering biomarker information within minutes.

Resting echocardiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S10 and S11 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for the prognostic capabilities of preoperative resting echocardiography, respectively. Two small studies of 339 and 570 patients suggested that a low ejection fraction was a borderline signi /uniFB01 cant independent predictor of major cardiovascular complications within 30 days after noncardiac surgery. 40,41 The largest study (N ¼ 1923) to assess the prognostic capabilities of preoperative echocardiographic parameters suggested that several parameters (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%) were independent predictors of major perioperative cardiovascular complications; however, a preoperative NT-proBNP measurement was a much stronger independent predictor. 42 The prognostic capabilities of an RCRI threshold /C21 2 increased with the addition of an NT-proBNP threshold of /C21 301 ng/L (ie, an RR of 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.8 went to an RR of 3.7; 95% CI, 2.7-5.0; P < 0.001); however, use of echocardiographic parameters in addition did not result in a further increase in the RR.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of these data and our recommendation to measure a preoperative NT-proBNP or BNP in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery who are 65 years of age or older, or 45-64 years of age with known cardiovascular disease, the current evidence does not support the use of routine preoperative echocardiography for risk assessment in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery.

enhance perioperative cardiac risk estimation, if a patient requires urgent/semiurgent or elective surgery and their clinical examination suggests the patient has an undiagnosed severe obstructive intracardiac abnormality (eg, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) or severe pulmonary hypertension, then urgent echocardiography should be obtained before surgery to inform the anesthesiologist, surgeon, and medical team of the type and degree of disease. Moreover, if a physician ' s clinical assessment suggests a patient might have an undiagnosed cardiomyopathy then echocardiography should be performed to facilitate optimization of long-term cardiac health. Physicians should consider the urgency of the surgery when deciding whether echocardiography is obtained before or after surgery.

Coronary computed tomographic angiography

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S12 and S13 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for preoperative coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA), respectively. Of the preoperative CCTA studies the VISION CCTA study was the highest-quality study. 22 This was a prospective cohort study conducted at 12 centres in 8 countries that evaluated the prognostic capabilities of preoperative CCTA to enhance perioperative risk prediction beyond clinical data in 955 patients. The CCTA results were blinded unless signi /uniFB01 cant left main disease was identi /uniFB01 ed, and patients had daily troponin measurements for 3 days after surgery. 22 The primary outcome of cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 74 patients (7.7%) within 30 days of surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The study showed, compared with the RCRI alone, that preoperative CCTA /uniFB01 ndings improved risk estimation (ie, extensive obstructive disease had an adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.76; 95% CI, 1.12-12.62) among patients who suffered the primary outcome, but also overestimated risk among patients who did not suffer the primary outcome. Although CCTA /uniFB01 ndings can appropriately improve risk estimation among patients who will suffer the primary outcome, CCTA /uniFB01 ndings are more than 5 times as likely to lead to an inappropriate overestimation of risk among patients who will not suffer a perioperative cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction. The overall absolute net reclassi /uniFB01 cation in a sample of 1000 patients is that CCTA will result in an inappropriate estimate of risk in 81 patients (on the basis of risk categories of < 5%, 5%15%, and > 15% for the primary outcome). 22

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overestimating risk can have negative consequences. For example, many patients who have a positive preoperative cardiac stress test have their surgery delayed while they are sent for coronary angiography with a plan for coronary revascularization, which might provide no bene /uniFB01 t. 43,44 Overestimating cardiac risk might also result in delays and cancellations of bene /uniFB01 cial surgery or inappropriate use of postoperative highintensity beds, precluding access for patients at greater risk.

Exercise stress testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing

Supplemental Tables S14 and S15 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for preoperative exercise stress testing, respectively. Only a few studies have addressed the preoperative value of exercise stress testing to enhance risk prediction of postoperative cardiovascular complications, and the overall number of patients and events were small. 45-48 Results did not show an association between electrocardiogram (ECG) changes during exercise and postoperative outcome. 46-48 Two studies showed that low performance capacity was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative cardiovascular events, but neither study performed a risk-adjusted analysis. 45,48

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S16 and S17 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), respectively. Few studies have assessed the prognostic capabilities of CPET to independently predict 30-day cardiac outcomes. The largest prospective cohort study included 1725 patients who underwent elective major abdominal or thoracic surgery and showed CPET was a weak independent predictor of longterm postoperative mortality. 49 Other studies showed similar results, 50-53 with various strength of the association between CPET and mortality, but none determined if CPET performance allowed for improved risk reclassi /uniFB01 cation in addition to clinical evaluation. The value of preoperative exercise testing or CPET to enhance perioperative cardiac risk reclassi /uniFB01 cation in addition to clinical evaluation alone remains unclear, is inconvenient for patients, and costs signi /uniFB01 cantly more than NT-proBNP or BNP measurement.

Supplemental Tables S20 and S21 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for perioperative initiation and continuation of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), respectively. The P ulmonary E mbolism P revention (PEP) trial showed that ASA prevents venous thromboembolism (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81) in patients who undergo hip fracture surgery. 54 In PEP, ASA was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.00-1.78); however, there was no systematic monitoring of cardiac biomarkers after surgery, and there were only 184 myocardial infarctions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The P eri o perative Is chemic E valuation-2 (POISE-2) trial was a large RCT of 10,010 patients who underwent a wide spectrum of in-hospital noncardiac surgeries. 55 Patients who underwent a carotid endarterectomy, had received a baremetal stent in the 6 weeks before surgery, or had received a drug-eluting stent in the 12 months before surgery were excluded from the trial. Patients had systematic monitoring of cardiac biomarkers or enzymes for the /uniFB01 rst 3 days after surgery. POISE-2 showed no effect of ASA on myocardial infarction and cardiac or all-cause mortality. POISE-2, similar to PEP, showed perioperative ASA increased the risk of major bleeding. POISE-2 included 5628 patients who were not previously taking ASA and 4382 patients who were taking ASA chronically but had stopped taking it a minimum of 3 days (median of 7 days) before surgery. The results were consistent in these 2 groups of patients. In POISE-2 the risk of bleeding related to surgery had passed 8-10 days after surgery.

generation. Physicians should discontinue ASA at least 3 days before noncardiac surgery to reduce the risk of major bleeding. 56 In patients with an indication for chronic ASA, it is important to restart ASA when the risk of bleeding related to surgery has passed (ie, 8-10 days after major noncardiac surgery). 55 Perioperative ASA continuation might be reasonable for some surgical interventions to prevent local thrombosis (eg, free /uniFB02 ap, acute limb ischemia). When a patient suffers a myocardial injury or thrombotic event after surgery in the absence of bleeding, there might be a net value to restarting ASA sooner after surgery than 8-10 days.

b -Blockade initiation before noncardiac surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S22 and S23 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for perioperative b -blocker initiation, respectively. A recent meta-analysis that included data from > 10,000 patients in 14 trials showed that perioperative b -blockers initiated within 24 hours of noncardiac surgery reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction but increased the risk of death, nonfatal stroke, hypotension, and bradycardia. 57 This meta-analysis included data from the POISE trial, which randomized 8351 patients with, or at risk of, coronary artery disease to receive extended-release metoprolol or placebo starting 2-4 hours before induction of anesthesia and continued for 30 days. 58 The meta-analysis showed that the increased risk of death and stroke was qualitatively unchanged without the POISE data.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some authors have advocated for the initiation and titration of b -blockade starting weeks before surgery 59 ; however, most patients are seen in preoperative clinics within days to weeks before surgery, making b -blocker dose titration challenging. Moreover, whatever b -blocker dose a patient tolerates before surgery does not necessarily inform a safe perioperative dose because hypotension is common after surgery. 60 Although some authorities advocate beginning b -blockers more than 24 hours before noncardiac surgery, there are no reliable data to support this practice.

No RCT informs the risks and bene /uniFB01 ts of continuing vs holding perioperative b -blockade during the perioperative period in patients chronically taking a b -blocker. Although there are inconsistent results, one large observational study suggested in riskadjusted analyses that continuing chronic b -blocker usage decreases perioperative mortality, whereas perioperative withholding of a b -blocker in patients taking a b -blocker chronically increased mortality. 61

Supplemental Tables S30 and S31 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for the perioperative withholding of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), respectively. Three RCTs (total N ¼ 188 patients) have looked at the effect of preoperative continuing vs withholding an ACEI or ARB around the time of noncardiac surgery. 64-66 All 3 trials showed that preoperative continuation of an ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased risk of intraoperative hypotension (pooled RR 2.53; 95% CI, 1.08-5.93). Only one trial reported on cardiovascular complications, but the number of events was too small to draw any conclusions. 65 In other perioperative studies, clinically important hypotension has been independently associated with an increased risk of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. 58,60 The highest risk for clinically important hypotension after noncardiac surgery is the day after surgery. 60

Coronary artery revascularization before noncardiac surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S36 and S37 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for coronary artery revascularization before noncardiac surgery, respectively. One trial randomized 216 patients to undergo coronary angiography followed by coronary revascularization, if applicable, followed by carotid endarterectomy, and 210 patients to undergo carotid endarterectomy without undergoing coronary angiography. 69 Among the 216 patients assigned to coronary angiography before carotid endarterectomy, 68 (31%) had signi /uniFB01 cant coronary artery disease on angiography. Sixty-six of these patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and then while still taking ASA and clopidogrel underwent carotid endarterectomy a mean of 4 days later; 2 patients underwent coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and carotid endarterectomy during one anesthetic period.

At a median of 2.7 years after randomization, mortality was 22% in the coronary revascularization group and 23% in the no-revascularization group (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.70-1.37; P ¼ 0.92). Vascular surgery was undertaken a median of 48 days after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and 41 days after PCI. The CARP trial excluded patients with left main coronary artery disease.

For patients with stable coronary artery disease who undergo noncardiac surgery, we recommend against preoperative prophylactic coronary revascularization (Strong Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence).

Practical tip. In patients with CCS class III-IV or unstable angina, obtaining coronary revascularization before noncardiac surgery seems prudent; however, an individual risk-bene /uniFB01 t assessment is required in patients who require urgent/semiurgent noncardiac surgery.

Smoking cessation before noncardiac surgery

Supplemental Tables S38 and S39 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for preoperative smoking cessation interventions, respectively. A meta-analysis of 4 trials that included 653 patients reported no effect of a preoperative smoking cessation intervention compared with standard care on major perioperative cardiovascular complications (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.17-1.96); however, there were only 16 events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A meta-analysis of 9 trials that included 1251 patients showed that preoperative smoking cessation interventions increase smoking cessation at the time of surgery, and the more intensive interventions increased smoking cessation at 12 month follow-up (RR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.57-5.55). 74 The more intensive interventions started smoking cessation measures 4 weeks before surgery, and the treatments included smoking cessation counselling and nicotine replacement therapy. The studies were at high risk of bias with high heterogeneity; however, because of the importance of smoking cessation on long-term cardiac outcomes, the panel found the perioperative smoking cessation data compelling.

Troponin monitoring

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S40 and S41 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for postoperative troponin monitoring, respectively. Most myocardial infarctions occur within 48 hours of noncardiac surgery when patients are receiving analgesic medications that can mask ischemic symptoms. 27 This provides an explanation as to why 65% of patients who suffer a perioperative myocardial infarction do not experience ischemic symptoms, and without perioperative troponin monitoring these myocardial infarctions would go undetected. Asymptomatic myocardial infarctions are associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (aOR, 4.00; 95% CI, 2.65-6.06) similar to symptomatic myocardial infarctions (aOR, 4.76; 95% CI, 2.688.43). 27 Moreover, asymptomatic perioperative troponin elevation at levels adjudicated as myocardial injuries due to ischemia d that do not ful /uniFB01 l the universal de /uniFB01 nition of myocardial infarction d are also associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (aHR, 3.30; 95% CI, 2.26 e 4.81). 2

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The largest prospective international cohort study (VISION; N ¼ 15,133) showed that the detection of an elevated troponin T level in the postoperative period was the strongest predictor of 30-day mortality. 75 The prognostic importance of an elevated troponin measurement after surgery was supported by a previous meta-analysis of 14 studies that enrolled 3318 patients. 6 The meta-analysis showed that an elevated troponin level was an independent predictor of allcause mortality (OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 4.1-10.9) at 1 year after surgery. 6

Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) was de /uniFB01 ned as a peak fourth-generation troponin T /C21 0.03 ng/mL believed to be due to myocardial ischemia. 2 MINS was observed in 8% of patients in the VISION study and was associated with a marked increase in 30-day mortality (9.8% vs 1.1%), and had the largest population attributable risk of all the complications after surgery. 2 Most of these MINS patients (84%) remained asymptomatic and were only detected through the routine surveillance of postoperative troponin levels. 2 The strong association between an elevated troponin level detected during routine postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because most patients who suffer a postoperative myocardial infarction or MINS are asymptomatic, routine troponin monitoring can detect patients who are at markedly increased risk of death within 30 days of surgery. Although the optimal management of patients with MINS remains an area of ongoing investigation, we believe that these individuals can bene /uniFB01 t from intensi /uniFB01 cation of medical management and close monitoring during their postoperative recovery.

We recommend obtaining daily troponin measurements for 48-72 hours after noncardiac surgery in patients with a baseline risk > 5% for cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction at 30 days after surgery (ie, patients with an elevated NTproBNP/BNP measurement before surgery or, if there is no NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before surgery, in those who have an RCRI score /C21 1, age 45-64 years with signi /uniFB01 cant cardiovascular disease, or age 65 years or older) (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

Supplemental Tables S42 and S43 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for obtaining a postoperative 12-lead ECG. The association between the occurrence of ischemic changes on a postoperative ECG and the occurrence of adverse cardiac events has been shown in several studies. 78,79

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The largest prospective study to address the prognostic value of a postoperative ECG showed that new ischemic /uniFB01 ndings were an independent predictor of subsequent major cardiac events (aOR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7; P ¼ 0.009). 80 Another small study in vascular patients noted that 88% of patients who had ischemic /uniFB01 ndings on any postoperative ECG had changes detected on the immediate postoperative ECG (15 minutes after surgery); the concordance between ischemia on an ECG and elevation of troponin T level was 85%. 81 The frequent onset of myocardial ischemia during the early postoperative period ( < 60 minutes) was also seen in a study using continuous 12-lead ECG recordings after surgery. 82

We suggest performing a postoperative ECG in the postanesthetic care unit in patients with an elevated NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before surgery or, if there is no NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before surgery, in those who have an RCRI score /C21 1, age 45-64 years with signi /uniFB01 cant cardiovascular disease, or age 65 years or older (Conditional Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence).

Postoperative telemetry

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S44 and S45 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for postoperative telemetry, respectively.

The largest trial included 1994 patients older than the age of 60 years who underwent a high-risk noncardiac surgery. There was no difference in mortality or morbidity, but there was an increase in pulmonary embolism in patients randomized to PACM. 85 All studies were included in a meta-analysis of PACM use, along with an additional 5 studies (2384 patients) that enrolled intensive care unit patients or those with acute heart failure. Overall, the meta-analysis did not support any association between PACM use and improved outcomes. 86

RECOMMENDATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend against the use of pulmonary artery catheters in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

Postoperative shared-care management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S48 and S49 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for shared-care management of patients who undergo noncardiac surgery, respectively. Surgeons are commonly busy in operating rooms, which limits their ability to rapidly respond to medical complications on surgical /uniFB02 oors. For example, among the 5001 patients given placebo in the POISE-2 trial, the median duration of clinically important hypotension during surgery was 15 minutes, whereas on the /uniFB01 rst postoperative day it was 150 minutes ( P < 0.001). 60 These data suggest a need for pathways to facilitate more rapid management of cardiovascular compromise on surgical /uniFB02 oors.

Perioperative Cardiac Risk Assessment & Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
29

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Shared-care models, between surgeons and medical specialists (eg, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, geriatrician, internist) who are readily available to help with perioperative management of cardiovascular complications, have the potential to improve outcomes. A meta-analysis showed a mortality advantage in patients who had surgery for a hip fracture who were comanaged by surgeons and geriatricians compared with surgeons alone. 87

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RECOMMENDATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We suggest shared-care management of patients with an elevated NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before surgery or if there is no NT-proBNP/BNP measurement before surgery, in those who have an RCRI score /C21 1, age 45-64 years with signi /uniFB01 cant cardiovascular disease, or age 65 years or older (Conditional Recommendation; Low-Quality Evidence).

Management of Postoperative Events

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASA and statin in patients who suffer MINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental Tables S50 and S51 show the summary of /uniFB01 ndings and GRADE quality assessment for ASA and statin in patients who suffer MINS. One prospective cohort study and one retrospective case-control study with propensity scorematching have investigated the question of initiation of ASA and statin therapy in patients who had suffered a myocardial injury or myocardial infarction after noncardiac surgery. 27,88 In the prospective cohort study, among the 415 patients who suffered a myocardial infarction after noncardiac surgery, patients who had started receiving ASA and statin had a signi /uniFB01 cant reduction in 30-day mortality (aOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.29-0.99, and aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13-0.54, respectively). 27

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The retrospective case controlled study by Foucrier et al. 88 comprised a total of 66 patients who suffered a myocardial injury after major vascular surgery. The primary outcome was the occurrence of a major cardiac event (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or pulmonary edema requiring hospitalization) at 1 year. Cardiovascular medication intensi/uniFB01 cation referred to the introduction of at least 1 of 4 cardiovascular medications (ie, antiplatelet, statin, b -blocker, and ACEI). Patients with no modi /uniFB01 cation of their cardiovascular treatment had an HR of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.13-2.42; P ¼ 0.004) for the primary outcome compared with a matched control group. In contrast, patients who received intensi /uniFB01 cation of cardiovascular treatment had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.10-1.19; P ¼ 0.45) for the primary outcome compared with the matched control group.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RECOMMENDATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend the initiation of long-term ASA in patients who suffer a myocardial injury or myocardial infarction after noncardiac surgery (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We recommend the initiation of long-term statin therapy in patients who suffer myocardial injury or myocardial infarction after noncardiac surgery (Strong Recommendation; Moderate-Quality Evidence).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Values and preferences. Although these data are limited to risk-adjusted observational data, the panel believed that the current available data support the use of ASA and a statin in patients who suffer a myocardial injury or myocardial infarction after noncardiac surgery. Panel members also considered the overwhelming evidence of the bene /uniFB01 cial effects of ASA and statin after cardiac events in the nonsurgical setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Practical tip. Although our recommendations focus on ASA and statin therapy in patients who suffer a myocardial injury or myocardial infarction after noncardiac surgery, these patients should be followed-up by a medical specialist to monitor their status and optimize medications and undertake prognostic tests on the basis of their expert clinical judgement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conclusions and Future Research

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Throughout the past 2 decades, large clinical trials and prospective observational studies have advanced our understanding of predicting, modifying the risk of, monitoring for, and managing perioperative cardiac complications. Despite these advances, cardiac complications after noncardiac surgery remain a substantial public health problem. There is a need for more large international studies to evaluate promising lines of investigation. Examples include the use of remote, automated, continuous, noninvasive, hemodynamic, and ischemic monitors with alert systems on surgical /uniFB02 oors, the prevention or minimization of perioperative bleeding, and management strategies for treating MINS. The evaluation of such lines of investigation holds the potential to substantially improve the safety of noncardiac surgery for the > 200 million adults who annually undergo these procedures.

| ASA                                   | Withhold at least 3 days before surgery y and restart ASA when the risk of bleeding related to surgery has passed (ie, 8-10 days after major noncardiac surgery) |
| b -Blocker                            | Continue the b -blocker during the perioperative period; however, if a patient ' s systolic blood pressure is low before surgery, physicians should consider decreasing or holding the dose of the b -blocker before surgery |
| ACEI/ARB                              | Withhold ACEI/ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery and restart ACEI/ARB on day 2 after surgery, if the patient is hemodynamically stable |
| Statin                                | Continue the statin during the perioperative period                                                                     |
| Smoking                               | Discuss and facilitate smoking cessation (eg, nicotine replacement therapy), ideally starting /C21 4 weeks before surgery |
| ASA (new initiation)                 | Do not initiate ASA for the prevention of perioperative cardiac events                                                  |
| b -Blocker (new initiation)          | Do not initiate a b -blocker within 24 hours before noncardiac surgery                                                 |
| a 2 -Agonist                         | Do not initiate an a 2 -agonist for the prevention of perioperative cardiovascular events                               |
| Calcium channel blocker               | Do not initiate a calcium channel blocker for the prevention of perioperative cardiovascular events                     |
| Coronary revascularization            | Do not undertake preoperative prophylactic coronary revascularization for patients with stable coronary artery disease   |
