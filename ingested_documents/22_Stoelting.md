Epidemic, pandemic, contagious, evasive, virulent, deadly, resistant, evolutionary -these words illustrate the nature of infectious diseases and the impact they have had since their fi rst appearance as well as the continuing scourge they impose on humankind. On December 4, 1967, Dr. William H. Stewart, the  U.S.  surgeon  general,  informed  a  meeting  of  state  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANTONIO HERNANDEZ CONTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
territorial  health  o ffi cials  that  infectious  diseases  were  now conquered. He extolled the fi ndings of  the  Centers  for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) a year earlier. Epidemic diseases such as smallpox and bubonic plague were declared things of the past. Typhoid fever, polio, and diphtheria were ostensibly heading in the same direction. Although syphilis, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis were not quite so readily eradicated, it was felt to be only a matter of time before every plague that had ever struck fear into the hearts of decent Americans would be a distant memory.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With the wisdom of hindsight, the irony of these proclamations is clearly evident. Th e premature declaration of "mission accomplished"  appears  naive  and  even  foolhardy. Th e  grim reality is that we have probably experienced only a temporary reprieve from the devastation of plagues and infectious diseases. Th e twentyfi rst century has already been marked by a resurgence of infectious diseases, most notably of viral origin. Between 1973 and 2003, more than 36 new infectious diseases were identi fi ed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite past declarations of medical victory in eradicating microbial organisms responsible for a wide array of pestilence, the presence of infectious agents as a comorbid condition in patients coming for surgery remains a signi fi cant issue for the perioperative physician.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious diseases are di ff erent from other co-existing illnesses in several respects. First, patients may have co-existing infectious diseases that impact perioperative care when they come for surgery. Th ese infections may be manifest or occult. Preexisting infectious diseases may be the reason for the surgery or may alter the risks associated with the surgery. Second, every patient undergoing surgery is at risk of acquiring an infectious disease during the perioperative period. Patients undergoing surgery are vulnerable to infection both at the surgical site and where natural defenses are breached, such as the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, the bloodstream, and sites of invasive monitoring. Th ese infectious diseases can be passed on to other patients and to health professionals in the perioperative period, and health care workers themselves may serve as active agents in transmitting infectious diseases to patients.

INFECTION PREVENTION OVERVIEW

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotic Resistance

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before  modern  times,  humans  had  little  understanding  of infection  and  were  subject  to  many  devastating  pandemics, such as the Black Death of the fourteenth century. Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, bacteria have undergone thousands of mutations resembling a darwinian "survival of the fi ttest" evolutionary response to antibiotic exposure, which has perpetuated the need for new antibiotics. Most classes of antibiotics were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s, and these drugs are directed at a few speci fi c aspects of bacterial physiology: biosynthesis of the cell wall, DNA, and proteins. During the past 40 years, only two new chemical classes of antibiotics  have  been  developed.  One  reason  for  widespread  drug resistance among bacterial pathogens is the limited choice of antibiotics  that  manipulate  only  a  narrow  range  of  bacterial functions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious diseases that were presumably eradicated, such  as  tuberculosis,  are  demonstrating  a  resurgence.  Some reemerging pathogens, such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, have resistance to previously successful antimicrobial therapies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multidrug-resistant organisms cause an increasing number of bacterial infections in hospitals, and bacteria are emerging with resistance to all available antibiotics. Much of the attention is presently focused on resistant gram-positive organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. New drugs are in development to combat gram-positive organisms. However,  there  is  virtually  no  development  of  antibiotics  active against resistant gram-negative pathogens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Site Infections

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  site  infections  (SSIs)  have  been  the  focus  of  much attention  during  the  past  30  years,  and  the  major  emphasis has been on completely preventing the occurrence of surgeryrelated infections and their associated morbidity and mortality. In 2002, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),  in  collaboration  with  the  CDC,  implemented  the national  Surgical  Infection  Prevention  Project  (SIPP). Th e key  measures  being  monitored  by  this  project  are:  (1)  the proportion of patients who receive parenterally administered antibiotics within 1 hour before incision (within 2 hours for vancomycin  and fl uoroquinolones),  (2)  the  proportion  of patients who receive prophylactic antimicrobial therapy consistent  with  published  guidelines,  and  (3)  the  proportion  of patients whose prophylactic antibiotic is discontinued within 24 hours a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite the implementation of numerous sets of drug and policy guidelines, SSIs continue to occur at a rate of 2% to 5% for extraabdominal surgery and up to 20% for intraabdominal surgery. SSIs are among the most common causes of nosocomial infection, accounting for 14% to 16% of all nosocomial infections in hospitalized patients. SSIs are a major source of morbidity and mortality, rendering patients 60% more likely

to spend time in the intensive care unit (ICU), fi ve times more likely  to  require  hospital  readmission,  and  twice  as  likely  to die.  A  recent  resurgence in SSIs may be attributable to bacterial resistance, the increased implantation of prosthetic and foreign materials, as well as the poor immune status of many patients undergoing surgery. Th e universal adoption of simple measures, including frequent hand washing and appropriate administration of prophylactic antibiotics,  has  been  emphasized as a method of decreasing the incidence of SSIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SSIs are divided into super fi cial infections (involving skin and subcutaneous tissues), deep infections (involving fascial and muscle layers), and infections of organs or tissue spaces (any  area  opened  or  manipulated  during  surgery)  (Figure 22-1). S.  aureus, including  methicillin-resistant S.  aureus, is the  predominant cause of SSIs. Th e  increased  proportion of SSIs caused by resistant pathogens and Candida species may re fl ect  the  increasing  numbers  of  severely  ill  and  immunocompromised surgical patients and the impact of widespread use of broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RISK FACTORS FOR SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  risk  of  developing  an  SSI  is  a ff ected  by  patient-related, microbe-related, and wound-related factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patient-related  factors  include  chronic  illness,  extremes of age, baseline immunocompetence or inherent or acquired immunocompromise,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  corticosteroid therapy. Th ese factors are associated with an increased risk of developing an SSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Microbial factors  include  enzyme  production,  possession of a polysaccharide capsule, and the ability to bind to fi bronectin in blood clots. Th ese are some of the mechanisms by which  microorganisms  exploit  weakened  host  defenses  and initiate infection. Bio fi lm formation is particularly important

<!-- PAGE=? -->
in  the  development  of  prosthetic  material  infections  (i.e., prosthetic joint infection). Coagulase-negative staphylococci produce glycocalyx and an associated component called slime that  physically  shield  bacteria  from  phagocytes  or  inhibit antimicrobial  agents  from  binding  with  or  penetrating  into the bacteria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Devitalized tissue, dead space, and hematomas are woundrelated  features  associated  with  the  development  of  SSIs. Historically,  wounds  have  been  described  as clean,  contaminated, and dirty according to the expected number of bacteria entering the surgical site. Th e presence of a foreign body (i.e., sutures or mesh) reduces the number of organisms required to induce an SSI. Interestingly, the implantation of major devices such as prosthetic joints and cardiac devices is not associated with a higher risk of SSIs. Risk factors for SSI are summarized in Table 22-1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SSIs typically present within 30 days of surgery with localized in fl ammation of the surgical site and evidence of poor wound healing. Systemic features of infection, such as fever and malaise, may occur soon therea ft er.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere may be nonspeci fi c evidence of infection, such as an elevated white blood cell count, poor blood glucose control, and elevated  levels  of  in fl ammatory markers, such as  C-  reactive protein. However, surgery is a great confounder, because surgery  itself  causes  in fl ammation  and  thus  renders  surrogate markers of infection less reliable. Purulence at the wound sight is highly suggestive of infection. Th e gold standard in documenting a wound infection is growth of organisms in an aseptically obtained culture specimen. Approximately one third of organisms cultured are staphylococci ( Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis ), Enterococcus species  makes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
up more than 10%, and Enterobacteriaceae make up the bulk of the remaining culprits. Table 22-2 lists the criteria for diagnosing an SSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Active infections should be treated aggressively before surgery,  and  when  possible,  surgery  should  be  postponed  until infection has resolved. If a localized area of infection is present at the intended surgical site, surgery should be postponed until the localized infection is treated and/or resolves spontaneously. If a patient has clinical evidence of infection, such as fever, chills, or malaise, e ff orts should be made to identify the source of the infectious  process.  Several  studies  have  shown  that  smoking may increase not only the incidence of respiratory tract infection but also the incidence of wound infections. Preoperative cessation of smoking for 4 to 8 weeks before orthopedic surgery decreases the incidence of wound-related complications. Significant preoperative alcohol consumption may result in generalized immunocompromise. One month of preoperative alcohol abstinence reduces postoperative morbidity in alcohol users.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for infection, and optimization of preoperative diabetes treatment may decrease perioperative infection. Malnutrition, whether manifesting as cachexia or obesity, is associated with an increased perioperative  infection  rate.  Appropriate  diet  and/or  weight loss may be bene fi cial before major surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
S.  aureus is  the  organism  most  commonly  implicated  in SSIs, and many individuals are carriers of S. aureus in the anterior nares. Th is carrier state has been identi fi ed as a risk factor for S. aureus wound infections. Topical mupirocin applied to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
469

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the anterior nares has been successful in eliminating S. aureus and decreasing the risk of infection. However, there is concern that  this  practice  may  promote  development  of  mupirocinresistant S. aureus. Active surveillance programs to eliminate nasal  colonization  in  hospital  surgical  personnel  have  controlled outbreaks of S. aureus SSIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hair clipping at the planned surgical site is acceptable, but shaving increases the risks of SSI, probably because microcuts serve as entry portals for microorganisms. Preoperative skin cleansing  with  chlorhexidine  has  been  shown  to  reduce  the incidence of SSIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylactic  Antibiotics. It  was  recognized  many  years ago that prophylactic administration of antimicrobial agents prevents postoperative wound infections. Th is is particularly true when the inoculum of bacteria is high, such as in colon, rectal,  or  vaginal  surgery,  or  when  the  procedure  involves insertion of an arti fi cial implant, for example, a hip prosthesis or heart valve. Th e organisms that are implicated in SSIs are usually those that are carried by the patient in the nose or on the skin. Unless the patient has been in the hospital for some time before surgery, these are usually community organisms that have not developed multiple drug resistance. Timing of antibiotic  prophylaxis  (within  1  hour  of  surgical  incision) is  important,  since  these  organisms  are  introduced  into  the bloodstream  at  the  time  of  incision.  For  most  procedures, a  single  dose  of  antibiotic  is  adequate.  Prolonged  surgery (>4 hours) may necessitate a second dose. Prophylaxis should be discontinued within 24 hours of the procedure. For cardiac surgery, the Joint Commission (formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) has recommended that the duration of prophylaxis be increased to 48 hours. A fi rst-  generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin is  e ff ective  for  many  types  of  surgery.  In  general,  the  spectrum of bacteria against which cephalosporins are e ff ective, their low incidence of side e ff ects, and the tolerability of these drugs have made them the ideal choice for prophylaxis. For high-risk  patients  and  procedures,  the  selection  of  another appropriate  antibiotic  plays  a  critical  role  in  decreasing  the incidence of SSIs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  the  small  bowel  is  entered,  coverage  for  gramnegative organisms is important, and for procedures involving the large bowel and the female genital tract, the addition of coverage  against  anaerobic  organisms  is  appropriate.  Infections associated with clean surgery are caused by staphylococcal  species,  whereas infections associated with contaminated surgery are polymicrobial and involve the fl ora of the viscus entered.  Guidelines  for  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  for  those considered at risk of infective endocarditis are published by the  American  Heart  Association.  Additional  considerations are listed in Table 22-3.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Physical  and  Physiologic  Preventive  Measures. Several simple  physical  measures  have  been  studied  to  determine their e ff ects on the incidence of postoperative infection. Much

of the work has focused on the oxygen tension at the wound site. Destruction of organisms by oxidation, or oxidative killing, is the most important defense against surgical pathogens and  depends  on  the  partial  pressure  of  oxygen  in  contaminated tissue. In patients with normal peripheral perfusion, the subcutaneous oxygen tension is linearly related to the arterial oxygen tension. An inverse correlation has been demonstrated between subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension and the rate of wound infections Tissue hypoxia appears to increase the vulnerability to infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypothermia  has  been  shown  to  increase  the  incidence of SSI. In a study in which patients were randomly assigned to hypothermia and normothermia groups, SSI was found in 19% of patients in the hypothermia group, but in only 6% of those in the normothermia group. Radiant heating to 38° C increases  subcutaneous oxygen tension. Th is  may  be  one  of the  mechanisms  for  the  decreased  infection  risk  associated with increased body temperature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen. An easy method of improving oxygen tension is to  increase  the  concentration  of  inspired  oxygen.  Studies  of patients  undergoing  colorectal  resection  have  demonstrated that perioperative administration of 80% oxygen decreases the incidence of SSI in this patient group. It is unknown whether perioperative  administration  of  80%  oxygen  decreases  the incidence of SSI in other surgical settings. Th e universal adoption of this treatment protocol remains controversial, since a prolonged period of high inspired oxygen tension might cause pulmonary damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Analgesia. Superior treatment of surgical pain is associated with  increased  postoperative  subcutaneous  oxygen  partial pressures at wound sites. Adequate analgesia may therefore be associated with a decreased incidence of SSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carbon  Dioxide. Hypocapnia occurs  frequently  during anesthesia and can be deleterious for many reasons, particularly because  of  the  vasoconstriction  it  causes.  Such  vasoconstriction could impair perfusion of vital organs. Hypercapnia causes vasodilation and increases skin perfusion. Intriguing research has shown that mild intraoperative hypercapnia increases the oxygen tension in subcutaneous tissue and in the colon.

Glucose. Th e results of studies to date suggest that in the perioperative period, the ideal blood glucose goal should be a narrow physiologic range with minimal variability. A high blood  glucose  concentration  is  thought  to  inhibit  leukocyte function and to provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth. Interestingly, the therapy for hyperglycemia may itself have  bene fi cial  e ff ects. Th e  administration  of  glucose,  insulin, and potassium stimulates lymphocytes to proliferate and attack  pathogens.  Glucose,  insulin,  and  potassium  may  play an important role in restoring immunocompetence to patients with immunocompromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wound-Probing  Protocols. Current  studies  suggest  that infection  of  contaminated  wounds  can  be  decreased  by  following wound-probing protocols. Wound probing is a bedside technique that combines the bene fi ts of primary and secondary wound closure. Use of this technique has been shown to decrease length of stay and SSIs, but the exact mechanism of its e ff ect is not clearly understood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BLOOD-BORNE INFECTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bloodstream Infections

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are among the top three nosocomial  infections.  Anesthesiologists  may  play  an  important role in the prevention and o ft en the treatment of BSIs. Central venous catheters are the major cause of nosocomial bacteremia  and  fungemia.  Catheter-related  bloodstream  infections are  common,  costly,  and  potentially  lethal. Th ese  infections are monitored by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System of the CDC. A total of 80,000 cases of central venous catheter-associated BSI are estimated to occur annually  in  the  United  States,  and  the  attributable  mortality risk is estimated to be 12% to 25% for each infection. Th e NNIS System recommends that the rate of catheter-associated BSIs be expressed as the number of catheter-associated BSIs per 1000 days of central venous catheter exposure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  typically  have  nonspeci fi c  signs  of  infection  with no  obvious  source. Th ere  is  no  cloudy  urine,  purulent  sputum, pus drainage, or wound in fl ammation. Th ere is only an indwelling catheter. In fl ammation at the catheter insertion site is suggestive. A sudden change in a patient's condition, such as mental status changes, hemodynamic instability, altered tolerance for nutrition, and generalized malaise, can indicate a BSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Catheter-associated BSIs are de fi ned as bacteremia or fungemia in a patient with an intravascular catheter with at least one  blood  culture  positive  for  a  recognized  pathogen  not related  to  another  separate  infection,  clinical  manifestations of infection, and no other apparent source for the BSI except the catheter. BSIs are considered to be associated with a central line if the line was in use during the 48-hour period before the

From National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System report, data summary from January 1990-May 1999, issued June 1999. Am J Infect Control . 1999;27(6):520-532.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
development of the BSI. If the time interval between the onset of infection and device use is longer than 48 hours, then other sources of infection must be considered. Th e diagnosis is more compelling if, a ft er catheter removal, the same organisms that grew in the blood culture grow from the catheter tip. Table 22-4 lists pathogens commonly associated with BSI.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  best  "treatment"  of  central  venous  catheter-related  BSIs is prevention. However, if infection is suspected, the source of the infection should be removed as soon as possible and broadspectrum antimicrobial therapy should be initiated. Once culture  results  are  available,  antibiotic  therapy  can  be  targeted to the speci fi c organism. Because of antibiotic resistance patterns, it is di ffi cult to strike a compromise between providing appropriate initial empirical coverage and not exhausting the last-line antimicrobial agents with the fi rst salvo of antibiotic therapy. Treatment of patients with BSIs is similar to treatment of patients with sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many central venous catheters are placed by anesthesiologists who may not be informed about BSIs that develop days later.  Preventing  BSIs  related  to  central  venous  catheter  use can be minimized by implementing a series of evidence-based steps  shown  to  reduce  catheter-related  infection.  A  recent interventional study targeted fi ve evidence-based procedures recommended by the CDC and identi fi ed as having the greatest e ff ect in reducing the rate of catheter-related BSIs and the fewest barriers to implementation. Th e fi ve interventions are (1) hand washing with soap and water or an alcohol cleanser before catheter insertion or maintenance, (2) using full-barrier precautions (hat, mask and sterile gown, sterile area covering) during central venous catheter insertion, (3) cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, (4) avoiding the femoral site and peripheral arms if possible, and (5) conducting routine daily

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
inspection of catheters and removing them as soon as they are deemed unnecessary. In this study, use of these evidence-based interventions resulted in a large and sustained reduction (up to 66%) in rates of catheter-related BSIs that was maintained throughout the 18-month study period. Th e  subclavian  and internal jugular venous routes carry less risk of infection than the femoral route, but the decision regarding anatomic location also has to consider the higher risk of pneumothorax with a subclavian catheter. During insertion, catheter contamination rates can be further reduced by rinsing gloved hands in a solution of chlorhexidine in alcohol before handling the catheter. Sterility must be maintained with frequent hand decontamination and cleaning of catheter ports with alcohol before accessing them. Th e  same  high  standards  of  sterility  should be applied with regional anesthetic catheters. Central venous catheters may be coated or impregnated with antimicrobial or antiseptic agents. Th ese catheters have been associated with a lower incidence of BSIs. Concerns about widespread adoption of drug-impregnated catheters center on increased costs and promotion of antimicrobial resistance. However, use of such catheters may be indicated for the most vulnerable patients, such as those with severe immunocompromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transfusion of red blood cells and blood components increases the  incidence  of  postoperative  infection  via  two  mechanisms: direct transmission of organisms and immunosuppression. Even autologous blood transfusion results in natural killer cell inhibition  and  is  intrinsically  immunosuppressive. Th e  mechanisms of immunosuppression may be related to the infusion of donor leukocytes  or  their  byproducts.  Blood  transfusion-associated immunosuppression may be decreased by leukodepletion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transfusion of cellular blood components has been implicated in transmission of viral, bacterial, and protozoal diseases. Over the past 20 years, reductions in the risk of viral infection from blood components have been achieved. Minipool nucleic acid  ampli fi cation  testing  detects  human  immunode fi ciency virus, and hepatitis B and C virus during the time before antibodies develop. Th is sensitive and speci fi c test has decreased the risk of human immunode fi ciency virus 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis C virus transmission to 1 in 2 million blood transfusions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the success in detecting viral infection, bacterial contamination of blood products has emerged as the greatest  residual  source  of  transfusion-transmitted  disease.  Each year,  approximately  9  million  units  of  platelet  concentrates are  transfused  in  the  United  States.  An  estimated  1  in  1000 to 3000 platelet units is contaminated with bacteria. Platelets, to  maintain  viability  and  function,  must  be  stored  at  room temperature, which creates an excellent growth environment for bacteria. Th e prevalence of severe episodes of transfusionassociated  bacterial  sepsis  is  approximately  1  in  50,000  for platelet units and 1 in 500,000 for red blood cell units. Implementation  of  bacterial  detection  methods  will  improve  the safety  and  extend  the  shelf  life  of  platelets. Th e  best  way  to avoid infectious complications related to transfusion is simply to avoid or minimize the use of transfusions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several postoperative management strategies can decrease the  incidence  of  catheter-related  BSI:  (1)  removal  of  central lines and pulmonary artery catheters as soon as possible, and (2)  avoidance  of  unnecessary  parenteral  nutrition  and  even administration of dextrose-containing fl uid, since these may be associated with an increased risk of BSI. Food and glucose can usually be withheld for a short period or delivered into the gut rather than into a vein.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis is  an  umbrella  term encompassing those conditions in which there are pathogenic microorganisms in the body. Sepsis may be life threatening because of complications precipitated by an organism, its toxins, and the body's own defensive in fl ammatory response. (A similar response may occur in the absence of  infection,  and  this  is  sometimes  called systemic in fl ammatory response syndrome. ) Sepsis is a spectrum of disorders on a continuum with localized in fl ammation at one end and a severe generalized in fl ammatory response with multiorgan failure at the other (Figure 22-2). Severe sepsis is de fi ned as acute organ

Surgery and anesthesia should ideally be postponed until sepsis  is  at  least  partially  treated.  However,  sometimes  the underlying cause of sepsis requires urgent surgical intervention.  Such  surgery  may  be  termed source  control surgery. Examples of septic sources are abscesses, infective endocarditis, bowel perforation or infarction, infected prosthetic device (e.g., intravenous catheter, intrauterine device, or pacemaker), endometritis, and necrotizing fasciitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bacterial  components  such  as  endotoxin,  through  their action  on  neutrophils  and  macrophages,  can  induce  a  wide range of proin fl ammatory  factors and counterregulatory host  responses  that  turn  o ff production  of  proin fl ammatory cytokines.  As  a  result  of  sepsis,  the  proin fl ammatory  reaction (systemic in fl ammatory response syndrome) can become exaggerated by associated activation of the complement system  and  coagulation  cascade,  widespread  arterial  vasodilation,  and  altered  capillary  permeability. Th is  may  result  in multiorgan dysfunction and death.

Signs and symptoms of sepsis are o ft en nonspeci fi c, and presentation  varies  according  to  the  initial  source  of  infection. Th e systemic in fl ammatory response syndrome is an important component of sepsis (Table 22-5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sepsis may result in multiple organ system failure. Features of  infection, including fever, altered mental status, encephalopathy,  and  hyperglycemia,  may  be  present. Septic  shock refers to hemodynamic instability that may accompany sepsis along with perfusion abnormalities that may include but are not limited to lactic acidosis, oliguria, or a change in mental status. Classically, hypotension, bounding pulses, and a wide pulse  pressure  are  present. Th ese  are  characteristic  signs  of high-output  cardiac  failure  and  distributive  shock,  both  of which may occur with sepsis. Patients who are receiving inotropic agents or vasopressor support may not be hypotensive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  diagnosis  of  sepsis  is  surmised  from  history,  signs,  and symptoms. Con fi rmation is based on the isolation of a speci fi c causative pathogen. It is important to identify the culprit microbe  to  ensure  that  antimicrobial  therapy  is  appropriate

syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome requires fulfillment of two or more of the following criteria in a variety of clinical scenarios, not necessarily involving infection: White blood cell count > 12,000/mm 3  or < 4000/mm 3  or more than 10% band forms Heart rate > 90 beats/min Temperature > 38° C or < 36° C Respiratory rate > 20 breaths/min or Pa CO 2 < 32 mm Hg

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and targeted. Specimens for culture should be sent from all sources  where  organism  growth  is  suspected.  Blood,  urine, and sputum specimens are a minimum. Tissue sampling from speci fi c sources such as heart valves, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fl uid can also be important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initial treatment of sepsis is provision of broad antimicrobial coverage coupled with supportive care of failing organs. Th e speed and appropriateness of therapy administered in the initial hours of sepsis can dramatically in fl uence outcome. Th e replication of virulent bacteria can be so rapid that every minute  may be crucial. As soon as speci fi c  microbiologic information is available, therapy should be tailored to the speci fi c organism  and  its  sensitivities.  Choice  of  an  antibiotic  must also take into account the ability of the drug to penetrate various  tissues,  including  bone,  cerebrospinal fl uid,  lung  tissue, and abscess cavities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  targeted  antimicrobial  therapy,  supportive treatment  relating  to  organ  system  dysfunction  is  essential. Early goal-directed optimization that targets oxygen delivery and cardiac output might improve outcome in sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis in sepsis depends on the virulence of the infecting pathogen(s), the stage at which appropriate treatment is initiated, the in fl ammatory response of the patient, the immune status of the patient, and the extent of organ system dysfunction. It is impossible to predict the outcome for any individual patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important considerations for a patient with sepsis requiring surgery are whether the surgery may be postponed pending treatment of sepsis and whether the patient's condition may be improved before surgery. A treatment algorithm for septic patients (Figure 22-3) suggests goal-directed optimization  of  the  condition  of  patients  with  sepsis.  Resuscitation should  be  targeted  to  achieve  mean  arterial  pressure  greater than 65 mm Hg, central venous pressure of 8 to 12 mm Hg, adequate urine output, a "normal" pH without a metabolic (lactic) acidosis, and a mixed venous oxygen saturation above 70%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative management of patients with sepsis is challenging.  Patients  with  sepsis  may  have limited physiologic reserve, which renders them vulnerable to hypotension and hypoxemia with induction of anesthesia. Invasive monitoring, such as intraarterial  blood  pressure  and  central  venous  pressure  monitoring, is usually indicated. Establishment of su ffi cient intravenous access to allow for volume resuscitation as well as transfusion of blood and blood components is essential. Antimicrobial prophylaxis appropriate for surgery is indicated. Ideally, this would be combined with the treatment regimen for the pathogen thought to be responsible for the sepsis. Prophylactic antibiotics should ideally be administered within 30 minutes of skin incision.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  sepsis  invariably  merit  ICU  admission  a ft er surgery. In the ICU, the priorities are to support failing organ systems, to target antimicrobial therapy, and to try to minimize the likelihood of new infection, such as fungal infection, infection with Clostridium di ffi cile, or the emergence of a resistant organism. Another important postoperative priority is to continue antimicrobial therapy only for as long as it is indicated. Broad guidelines for the treatment of patients with sepsis in the ICU have been published in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GASTROINTESTINAL INFECTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clostridium difficile Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C.  di ffi cile is  an  anaerobic,  gram-positive,  spore-forming bacterium  that  is  the  major  identi fi able  cause  of  antibioticassociated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. It is clear today that most antibiotics can alter bowel fl ora facilitating the growth of C. di ffi cile. With the frequent use of broad-  spectrum antibiotics,  the  incidence  of C.  di ffi cile diarrhea  has  risen dramatically.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of risk factors for C. di ffi cile -associated diarrhea have been identi fi ed: advanced age, severe underlying disease, gastrointestinal surgery, presence of a nasogastric tube, use of antiulcer medications, admission to an ICU, long duration of hospital stay, long duration of antibiotic administration (risk doubles a ft er 3 days), use of multiple antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy or general immunocompromise, recent surgery, and sharing of a hospital room with a C. di ffi cile -infected patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C. di ffi cile infection is also the most common cause of diarrhea  in  health  care  settings,  resulting  in  increased  hospital stays and higher morbidity and mortality among patients. Th e prevalence of asymptomatic colonization in the hospital, especially in older people, is more than 20%. C. di ffi cile is extremely hardy, can survive in the environment for prolonged periods of time, and is resistant to common disinfectants, which leads to  transmission  from  contaminated  surfaces  and  airborne spores. In approximately one third of those colonized, C. diffi cile produces toxins that cause diarrhea. Th e  two principal toxins are toxin A and toxin B. Toxin B is approximately 1000 times  more  cytotoxic  than  toxin  A.  Toxin  A  activates  macrophages and mast cells. Activation of these cells causes the production of in fl ammatory mediators, which leads to fl uid secretion and increased mucosal permeability. Toxin A is also an enterotoxin in that it loosens the tight junctions between the  epithelial  cells  that  line  the  colon,  which  helps  toxin  B enter into epithelial cells.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most frequent symptoms of C. di ffi cile infection are diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients may be febrile with abdominal tenderness and distention. With perforation, patients may have an acute abdomen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  gold  standard  for  diagnosis  of C.  di ffi cile infection  is detection of C. di ffi cile via enzyme-linked immunoassay for C. di ffi cile toxins A and B in stool.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapy for patients with C. di ffi cile -associated diarrhea consists of fl uid and electrolyte replacement, withdrawal of current antibiotic therapy if possible, and institution of targeted antibiotic treatment to eradicate C. di ffi cile. Antibiotic treatment should be given orally, if possible. Th e fi rst-line regimen is oral metronidazole 400 mg three times daily. An alternative is oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily. Vancomycin has a theoretical advantage over metronidazole, since it is not well absorbed and may therefore reach the site of infection better. Th e major downside to vancomycin is that it may promote the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional therapies may include probiotics such as Saccharomyces boulardii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Th ese may be useful in restoring normal bowel fl ora.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
C.  di ffi cile infection  accounts  for  considerable  increases  in length of hospital stays and more than $1.1 billion in health care costs each year in the United States. Th e  condition is a common  cause  of  signi fi cant  morbidity  and  even  death  in elderly, debilitated, and immunocompromised patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  generally  the  sickest  patients  with C.  di ffi cile colitis, including those whose infection does not improve with conventional therapy, who come for surgery such as subtotal colectomy  and  ileostomy.  If  the  patient  is  in  hemodynamically unstable condition, major surgery should be deferred and an ileostomy, cecostomy, or colostomy performed as a temporizing intervention. Surgery is associated with high mortality. Resuscitation and preoperative treatment of metabolic derangements may be bene fi cial. Patients with C. di ffi cile infection should be scheduled for surgery at the end of the surgical day so that the operating room can undergo additional cleaning to minimize the risk of transmission to subsequent patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  fulminant C.  di ffi cile colitis  are  very  ill,  and hemodynamic  instability  is  likely  during  anesthesia.  Invasive monitoring, including an intraarterial catheter and central venous catheter, may guide fl uid administration and the use of inotropes and vasopressors. Dehydration, acid base abnormalities, and electrolyte imbalances occur because of diarrhea. Opiates decrease intestinal motility, which may exacerbate toxin-mediated disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One of the most important considerations is to prevent the spread of C. di ffi cile. Th e spores are hardy and are not destroyed by alcohol. Strict contact and isolation precautions are essential,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
routine use of disposable gloves and gowns is important, and vigorous hand washing with soap and water may remove spores. Stethoscopes and neckties are potential repositories for spores.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CUTANEOUS INFECTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing so ft tissue  infection is  a  nonspeci fi c  term that may encompass such diagnoses as gas gangrene, Fournier's gangrene, severe cellulitis, and " fl esh-eating" infections. One of the most important aspects  of  these  infections  is  that  the  severity  may be  underappreciated  at  the  time  of  presentation. Th e  responsible  organisms  are  highly  virulent,  the  clinical  course  is  fulminant, and mortality is high (up to 75%). Fournier's gangrene was eponymously named for the French physician Jean Alfred Fournier,  who described scrotal gangrene in fi ve  young  men. He noted a sudden onset, rapid progression to gangrene, and absence of a de fi nite cause. Necrotizing so ft tissue infections are surgical emergencies and represent a subclass of severe sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At presentation patients may have general features of infection,  including  malaise,  fever,  sweating,  and  altered  mental status. Pain is invariable and may be out of proportion to the physical signs. Speci fi c  features may include scrotal swelling and erythema, vaginal discharge, tissue in fl ammation, pus, or subcutaneous air (crepitus). Th e cutaneous signs are o ft en surprisingly mild and do not re fl ect the extent of tissue necrosis, because necrotizing skin infections begin in deep tissue planes. Hypotension is an ominous sign and may presage progression to septic shock. Th e resolution of pain may also be ominous, since this may occur with the progression to gangrene.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History is important in suggesting a diagnosis. Older patients and patients with a history of alcohol use, malnutrition, obesity, trauma, cancer, burns, vascular disease, and diabetes are more susceptible, as are patients taking immunosuppressant therapy or those infected with HIV . Th ere may be a high white blood  cell  count,  thrombocytopenia,  coagulopathy,  electrolyte abnormalities, acidosis, hyperglycemia, elevated levels of markers of in fl ammation such as C-reactive protein, and radiographic evidence of extensive necrotic in fl ammation/necrosis with subcutaneous air. Ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be used to delineate the extent of tissue necrosis. Blood, urine, and tissue samples should be sent to the laboratory for culture. Organisms most frequently  grown  from  necrotic  tissue  include Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Bacteroides species, Clostridium perfringens, and gram-negative organisms, especially Escherichia coli. Polymicrobial infection is common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e de fi nitive treatment is extensive débridement of necrotic tissue  coupled  with  antimicrobial  therapy,  which  typically includes coverage of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic  organisms.  Empirical  broad-spectrum  antibiotic  coverage  is  provided  initially,  and  treatment  can  subsequently  be targeted to the speci fi c organism(s) based on culture results.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Necrotizing so ft tissue infection is associated with a high mortality.  If  patients  survive  the  initial  insult,  they  may  remain vulnerable  to  secondary  infection. Th ey  may  also  require repeated anesthesia for débridements, skin gra ft s, and reconstructive surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anesthesiologist  should  treat  patients  with  necrotizing  so ft tissue  infection  as  having  severe  sepsis  and  should resuscitate preoperatively with goal-directed therapy, including administration of intravenous fl uids and optimization of global oxygen delivery, with success re fl ected by resolution of lactic acidosis or an increase in mixed venous oxygen saturation. However, surgical débridement should not be postponed, because delay is associated with increased mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Concern has been raised about the use of etomidate for induction of anesthesia in patients with septic shock, since they may already have adrenal insu ffi ciency, which theoretically may be worsened by even a single dose of etomidate. Major fl uid shi ft s, blood loss, and release of cytokines occur intraoperatively. Good intravenous  access  is  essential,  and  invasive  intraarterial  and central venous monitoring may provide valuable information. Blood should be cross-matched and readily available. Patients are at risk of developing both hypovolemic and septic shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Like  patients  with  sepsis,  patients  with  necrotizing  so ft tissue infection are at risk of developing multiple organ failure. Postoperative admission to an ICU is prudent. Antibiotic therapy  and fl uid  resuscitation  should  be  continued  in  the postoperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetanus

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetanus is caused by the gram-negative bacillus Clostridium tetani and occurs when a wound or entry site becomes contaminated with bacterial spores. Production of the neurotoxin tetanospasmin is responsible for the clinical manifestations of tetanus. With the exception of botulinum toxin, tetanospasmin is the most powerful microbe-produced poison known. Tetanospasmin, when absorbed into wounds, spreads centrally along motor nerves to the spinal cord or enters the systemic circulation  to  reach  the  central  nervous  system. Th e  toxin migrates  into  synapses,  where  it  binds  to  presynaptic  nerve terminals and inhibits or stops the release of certain inhibitory neurotransmitters  such  as  glycine  and γ -aminobutyric  acid. Because the motor nerve has no inhibitory signals from other

<!-- PAGE=? -->
476

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
nerves, the chemical signal to the motor nerve of the muscle intensi fi es, which causes the muscle to tighten up in a continuous contraction or spasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tetanospasmin a ff ects the nervous system in several areas: in the spinal cord, tetanospasmin suppresses inhibitory internuncial neurons, which results in generalized skeletal muscle contractions  (spasms),  and  in  the  brain,  there  is fi xation  of toxin by gangliosides. Th e fourth cerebral ventricle is believed to have selective permeability for tetanospasmin, which results in early manifestations of trismus and neck rigidity. Sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity may manifest as the disease progresses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trismus is the presenting symptom of tetanus in most patients. Th e  greater  strength of the masseter muscles, compared with the opposing digastric and mylohyoid muscles, results in lockjaw, and these patients may initially seek dental attention. Rigidity of the facial muscles results in the characteristic appearance described as risus sardonicus. Spasm of laryngeal muscles can occur at any time. Intractable pharyngeal spasms following tracheal extubation have been described in patients with unrecognized tetanus. Dysphagia may be due to spasm of the pharyngeal muscles. Spasm of the intercostal muscles and the diaphragm interferes  with  adequate  ventilation. Th e  rigidity  of  abdominal and lumbar muscles accounts for the opisthotonic posture. Skeletal muscle spasms are tonic and clonic in nature and are excruciatingly  painful. Th e  increased  skeletal  muscle  work  is associated with dramatic increases in oxygen consumption, and peripheral vasoconstriction can contribute to hyperthermia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
External stimulation, including sudden exposure to bright light,  unexpected  noise,  or  tracheal  suction,  can  precipitate generalized  skeletal  muscle  spasms,  leading  to  inadequate ventilation  and  death.  Hypotension  has  been  attributed  to myocarditis. Isolated and unexplained tachycardia may be an early  manifestation  of  hyperactivity  of  the  sympathetic  nervous  system,  but  more  o ft en  this  hyperactivity  manifests  as systemic hypertension. Sympathetic nervous system responses to external stimuli are exaggerated, as demonstrated by tachydysrhythmias and labile blood pressure. In addition, excessive sympathetic nervous system activity is associated with intense peripheral vasoconstriction and diaphoresis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  patients  with  tetanus  is  directed  toward  controlling  the  skeletal  muscle  spasms,  preventing  sympathetic hyperactivity, supporting ventilation, neutralizing circulating toxin, and surgically débriding the a ff ected area to eliminate the source of the toxin. Diazepam (40 to 100 mg/day IV) is useful  for  controlling  skeletal  muscle  spasms.  Occasionally, administration of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants and mechanical ventilation are necessary. Indeed, early protection of  the  upper  airway  is  important,  since  laryngospasm  may accompany generalized skeletal muscle spasms. Overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system can be managed with intravenous administration of β -blockers such as propranolol and esmolol. Th e circulating exotoxin may be neutralized by intrathecal  or  intramuscular  administration  of  human  antitetanus  immunoglobulin. Th is  neutralization  does  not  alter  the symptoms already  present  but  does  prevent  additional  exotoxin from reaching the central nervous system. Penicillin and metronidazole  can  destroy  the  toxin-producing  vegetative forms of C. tetani.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthesia  including  tracheal  intubation  is  a  useful approach  for  surgical  débridement.  Surgical  débridement  is delayed until several hours a ft er the patient has received antitoxin, because tetanospasmin is mobilized into the systemic circulation  during  surgical  resection.  Invasive  monitoring  is indicated and should include continuous recording of systemic blood pressure and measurement of central venous pressure. Volatile anesthetics are useful for maintenance of anesthesia if  excessive  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity  is  present. Drugs  such  as  lidocaine,  esmolol,  metoprolol,  magnesium, nicardipine, and nitroprusside should be readily available to treat excessive sympathetic nervous system activity during the perioperative period.

Pneumonia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combined  with  in fl uenza,  community-acquired  pneumonia is one of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. Streptococcus pneumoniae is by far the most frequent cause of bacterial pneumonia in adults. S.  pneumoniae causes typical pneumonia. In fl uenza virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia, legionella, adenovirus, and other microorganisms may cause atypical pneumonia. Th e pneumonia is considered atypical because these organisms are not commonly pneumoniaproducing  bacteria,  do  not  respond  to  common  antibiotics, and can cause uncommon symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with depressed consciousness may experience aspiration, which, in the presence of underlying diseases that impair host defense mechanisms, may manifest as aspiration pneumonia. Alcohol- and drug-induced alterations of consciousness, head trauma, seizures, other neurologic disorders, and administration of sedatives are most o ft en responsible for the development of aspiration  pneumonia.  Patients  with  abnormalities of deglutition or esophageal motility resulting from placement  of  nasogastric  tubes,  esophageal  cancer,  bowel obstruction, or repeated vomiting are also prone to aspiration. Poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease predispose to development of pneumonia a ft er aspiration because of the presence of increased bacterial fl ora. Induction and recovery from anesthesia may place patients at increased risk of aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  manifestations  of  pulmonary  aspiration  depend on the nature and volume of aspirated material. Aspiration of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
477

<!-- PAGE=? -->
large volumes of acidic gastric fl uid produces fulminant pneumonia and arterial hypoxemia. Aspiration of particulate material may result in airway obstruction, and smaller particles may produce atelectasis. In fi ltrates are most common in dependent areas of the lungs. Penicillin-sensitive anaerobes are the most likely cause of aspiration pneumonia. Hospitalization or antibiotic therapy alters the usual oropharyngeal fl ora, so aspiration pneumonia in hospitalized patients o ft en involves pathogens that are uncommon in community-acquired pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE PNEUMONIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  pneumonia  occurs  in  approximately  20%  of patients  undergoing  major  thoracic,  esophageal,  or  upper abdominal surgery but is rare a ft er other procedures in previously fi t patients. Chronic lung disease increases the incidence of  postoperative  pneumonia  threefold.  Other  risk  factors include obesity, age older than 70 years, and operations lasting longer than 2 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LUNG ABSCESS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung abscess may develop a ft er bacterial pneumonia. Alcohol abuse and poor dental hygiene are important risk factors. Septic pulmonary embolization, which is most common in intravenous drug abusers, may also result in the formation of a lung abscess. Th e fi nding of an airfl uid level on the chest radiograph signi fi es rupture of the abscess into the bronchial tree. Foul-smelling  sputum  is  characteristic.  Antibiotics  are  the mainstay of treatment of a lung abscess. Surgery is indicated only when complications such as empyema occur. Th oracentesis is necessary to establish the diagnosis of empyema, and treatment requires chest tube drainage and antibiotics. Surgical drainage is necessary to treat chronic empyema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An initial chill followed by abrupt onset of fever, chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, rigors, cough, and copious sputum production  o ft en  characterize  bacterial  pneumonia  Nonproductive cough is a feature of atypical pneumonia. A detailed history may suggest possible causative organisms. Hotels and whirlpools are associated with outbreaks of Legionnaires disease. Fungal pneumonia may occur with cave exploration and diving. Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia may follow contact with birds, and Q fever may follow contact with sheep. Alcoholism increases the risk of aspiration. Patients who are immunocompromised, such as those with acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome (AIDS), are at risk of fungal pneumonia, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest  radiography  may  be  extremely  helpful  in  diagnosing pneumonia. Di ff use in fi ltrates are suggestive of an atypical pneumonia, whereas a lobar opaci fi cation is suggestive of a  typical  pneumonia.  Atypical  pneumonia  occurs  more  frequently in young adults. Radiography is useful for detecting pleural  e ff usions  and  multilobar  involvement.  Leukocytosis is  typical,  and arterial hypoxemia may occur in severe cases of bacterial pneumonia. Arterial hypoxemia re fl ects intrapulmonary shunting of blood resulting from perfusion of alveoli fi lled with in fl ammatory exudates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Microscopic  examination  of  sputum  plus  cultures  and sensitivity  testing  may  be  helpful  in  suggesting  the  cause  of the  pneumonia  and  in  guiding  antibiotic  treatment.  Unfortunately,  sputum  specimens  are  frequently  inadequate,  and organisms  do  not  always  grow  from  sputum.  Interpretation of sputum culture results may be challenging. If there is suspicion of tuberculosis, sputum specimens should be sent for testing for acid-fast bacilli. Antigen detection in urine is a  good test for Legionella, whereas blood antibody titers are helpful in diagnosing Mycoplasma pneumonia. Sputum polymerase chain reaction testing is useful for diagnosing Chlamydia infection. Blood cultures usually yield negative results, but are important to rule out bacteremia. HIV infection is an important risk factor for pneumonia and should be ruled out when pneumonia is suspected.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For severe pneumonia, empirical therapy is typically a combination of antibiotic agents. However, local patterns of antibiotic resistance should always be considered before initiating therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapy is advised for 10 days for pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae and for 14 days for that caused by M. pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae. When symptoms resolve, therapy can be switched from intravenous to oral. Th e inappropriate prescription  of  antibiotics  for  nonbacterial  respiratory  tract infections  is  common  and  promotes  antibiotic  resistance.  It has  recently  been  demonstrated  that  even  brief  administration of a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin to healthy subjects  promotes  resistance  of  oral  streptococcal fl ora  that lasts for months. Resistance of S. pneumoniae is  becoming a problem.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e Pneumonia Severity Index (Table 22-6) is a useful tool for aiding  clinical  judgment,  guiding  appropriate  management, and suggesting prognosis. Old age and co-existing organ dysfunction have a negative impact. Physical examination fi ndings associated with worse outcome are the following:

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

Anesthesia  and  surgery  should  ideally  be  deferred  if  acute pneumonia  is  present.  Patients  with  acute  pneumonia  are o ft en  dehydrated  and  may  have  renal  insu ffi ciency.  Fluid management  can  be  challenging,  since  overhydration  may worsen  gas  exchange  and  morbidity.  If  general  anesthesia is  used,  a  protective  ventilation  strategy  is  appropriate  with tidal volumes of 6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body mass and mean airway pressures of less than 30 cm H 2 O. Th e anesthesiologist can  perform  pulmonary  hygiene  including  actively  removing  secretions  during  the  period  of  intubation,  even  via bronchoscopy if needed. Endotracheal intubation o ff ers  the opportunity  to  obtain  distal  sputum  specimens  for  Gram's staining and culture.

Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in the ICU and makes up one third of all nosocomial infections. VAP is de fi ned as pneumonia developing  more  than  48  hours  a ft er  the  patient  has  been  intubated and mechanical ventilation initiated. Between 10% and 20%  of  patients  who  have  endotracheal  tubes  and  undergo mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 hours acquire VAP , with mortality rates ranging from 5% to 50%. Several simple interventions may decrease the occurrence of VAP, including ensuring meticulous hand hygiene, providing oral care, limiting  patient  sedation,  positioning  patients  semi-upright,  performing repeated aspiration of subglottic secretions, limiting

DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
VAP is  di ffi cult  to  di ff erentiate  from  other  common  causes of  respiratory  failure,  such  as  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome and pulmonary edema. VAP is usually suspected when a  patient  develops  a  new  or  progressive  in fi ltrate  on  chest radiograph, leukocytosis, and purulent tracheobronchial secretions. An endotracheal tube or a tracheostomy tube provides  a  foreign  surface  that  rapidly  becomes  colonized  with upper airway fl ora. However, the mere presence of potentially pathogenic organisms in tracheal secretions is not diagnostic of VAP. A standardized diagnostic algorithm for VAP employing clinical and microbiologic data is used in the NNIS System and in the clinical pulmonary infection score to promote diagnostic consistency among clinicians and investigators. A Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score greater than 6 is consistent with a diagnosis of VAP (Table 22-7). In approximately half of patients suspected on clinical grounds of having VAP , the  diagnosis  remains  in  doubt  and  cultures  of  specimens from the distal airway do not grow organisms. Th e accurate diagnosis of VAP can be elusive.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e treatment of VAP includes supportive care for respiratory failure plus antibiotics against the organism most likely to be implicated. Th e  most  common  pathogens  are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus. Prognosis is improved if treatment is initiated early. Th erefore, despite the high rate of false-positive diagnoses, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be initiated to cover resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Treatment should be narrowed to target speci fi c organisms once results of culture and sensitivity testing are available and should be stopped at 48 hours if culture results are negative. Figure 22-4 presents an algorithm to guide treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  VAP  frequently  require  anesthesia  for  tracheostomy.  Major  surgery  should  be  deferred  until  the  pneumonia has resolved and respiratory function has improved. Tracheostomy is not an emergency procedure, and it may be ill advised to proceed when the patient has minimal pulmonary reserve. One of the major goals for the anesthesiologist in  this  situation  is  to  ensure  that  patients  with  V AP  do  not

experience a setback following anesthesia and tracheostomy. Because patients with respiratory failure may be PEEP dependent, a PEEP valve should be used to decrease the likelihood of "de-recruitment" of alveoli during transport to the operating room. In the operating room, protective mechanical ventilation should be used. Ideally, the same ventilator settings, mode  of  ventilation,  and  PEEP  that  were  used  in  the  ICU should be continued.

Th e in fl uenza pandemic of 1918 was one of the major plagues to have a ff ected humankind. It is estimated that this "Spanish fl u" infected as many as 500 million people worldwide and led to the death of as many as 50 to 100 million people around the world in just 25 weeks. Th e Spanish fl u was caused by an H1N1 strain of in fl uenza virus, which continues to cause human in fl uenza pandemics. Th e 1957 and 1968 pandemics did not approach the catastrophic level of the 1918 pandemic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
H1N1 in fl uenza (so named based on the speci fi c types of the capsular peptides hemagglutinin and neuraminidase that are  found  on  the  virus)  continues  to  impact  society  to  this day, and CDC estimates for the 2009 pandemic of in fl uenza A (H1N1) in the United States from April 2009 to January 2010 was  57  million  cases,  257,000  hospitalizations,  and  11,700 deaths. In seasonal in fl uenza, the greatest mortality is among the  very  young  and  the  very  old.  In  contrast,  the  1918  and 2009 epidemics a ff ected children and younger adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In fl uenza A virus and the virus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are examples of respiratory viruses that may be associated with rampant courses, high virulence, and high mortality. From 2002 to 2003, SARS occurred without any warning and was a grim reminder of our vulnerability to new infectious diseases (Figure 22-5). SARS a ff ected populations in Asia, the Paci fi c Rim, and Canada. Th e causative agent for SARS is thought to be an RNA coronavirus that is passed along through direct contact and droplet spread. Th is virus is viable ex vivo for 24 to 48 hours. Twenty percent of the victims of the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak were health care  workers. Th ere  were  over  8000  documented  cases  of SARS coronavirus infection and approximately 700 deaths in 29 countries.

A  new  strain  of  avian  in fl uenza  or  "bird fl u,"  the  H5N1 strain, which is a subtype of in fl uenza A, is now threatening humankind. In fl uenza  is  an  RNA  orthomyxovirus  that,  like other  RNA viruses, mutates at an alarming rate. Th e  World Health  Organization  (WHO)  has  reported  that  478  human cases of avian in fl uenza occurred between 2003 and 2010 with 286  deaths.  Many  cases  were  in  young  children.  Currently, H5N1 in fl uenza A is passed from bird to human. Th is  virus has not developed a high a ffi nity for human respiratory tract receptors. Th erefore,  human-to-human  transmission  is  not sustained, and cases have occurred only in small clusters.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms include  nonspeci fi c  complaints  of  viral  infection such as cough, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, arthralgias, and muscle pain. In more severe cases, patients may show respiratory  distress,  confusion,  and  hemoptysis.  Signs  may  include fever,  tachycardia,  sweating,  conjunctivitis,  rash,  tachypnea, use of accessory respiratory muscles, cyanosis, and pulmonary features of pneumonia, pleural e ff usion, or pneumothorax. A chest radiograph may show patchy in fi ltrates, areas of opaci fi -cation, pneumothoraces, and/or evidence of pleural e ff usion. Both H5N1 in fl uenza A virus and SARS coronavirus infection may cause acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Th ese  viruses  exhibit  a  propensity  to  bind  to  receptors in the lower respiratory tract. Th erefore, they may create primary hemorrhagic bronchitis and pneumonia with di ff use alveolar damage and destruction. Complications include multiple organ failure and severe sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the context of an outbreak, history, symptoms, and presentation are usually su ffi cient to suggest the diagnosis. A de fi nitive diagnosis is made by detection of the virus in sputum. Th e problem with serologic testing is that it may take 2 to 3 weeks for  seroconversion  (development  of  antibodies)  a ft er  infection. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test kits are available and are useful for diagnosing both SARS coronavirus infection and H5N1 in fl uenza A.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vaccine development is a key component in the prevention of widespread viral infection and in the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with viral infection. Th us far, there is no vaccine for the SARS coronavirus or for the H5N1 in fl uenza A virus. For H5N1 in fl uenza, neuraminidase inhibitors have  been  developed,  including  zanamivir  and  oseltamivir. Th ese drugs may decrease the severity of infection, but insu ffi -cient quantities of these drugs may be available in the event of a major outbreak. Other pharmacologic treatments for in fl uenza include amantadine and rimantadine. Antiviral drugs are of modest bene fi t and help only if administered within the fi rst 48 hours of symptoms. Th ere is no proven drug therapy that attenuates the course of SARS.

Th e mainstay of treatment for in fl uenza and SARS is supportive care.

PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis  depends  on  the  virulence  of  the  infecting  virus as well as the susceptibility of the infected person. In fl uenza and SARS may trigger a marked in fl ammatory response and a  cytokine  storm.  A  clinical  picture  indistinguishable  from severe bacterial sepsis may result. Superinfection with bacteria has been described and considerably worsens the outcome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anesthesiologist  should  assess  the  patient  with  an appreciation  of  the  potential  lethality  of  the  infection.  Both patient and family should be counseled about the high risks associated  with  SARS  coronavirus  infection.  Since  primary transmission  is  via  direct  and  indirect  respiratory  droplet spread, these viruses are highly contagious. Strict patient isolation should be enforced, and precautions to protect health care workers must be taken. Contact precautions are also necessary because the viruses can be spread via fomites such as clothing, contaminated surfaces, and exposed skin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ideally,  infected  patients  should  be  cared  for  in  rooms with  negative  pressure  to  decrease  aerosolized  spread  and contagion.  Barrier  precautions  include  the  use  of  full-body disposable  oversuits,  double  gloves,  goggles,  and  powered air-purifying  respirators  with  high-e ffi ciency  particulate  air fi lters. If these are not available, N95 masks (which block 95% of particles) should be used rather than regular surgical masks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aerosolized particles may be generated during all invasive airway procedures, ventilation with noninvasive and positive pressure ventilator support modes, suctioning, sputum induction,  highfl ow  oxygen  delivery,  aerosolized  or  nebulized medication delivery, and interventions that stimulate coughing. If mechanical ventilation is required, protective ventilation  as  for  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  is  indicated. Tidal volumes should be limited to 6 to 8 mL/kg lean body mass, and mean airway pressure should be less than 30 cm H2O. Sudden cardiorespiratory compromise could indicate an expanding pneumothorax. Draining of pleural e ff usions may improve ventilation and gas exchange.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Precautions to prevent spread of infection should be ongoing. Th e same treatment principles as for acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis should apply.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tuberculosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the obligate aerobe responsible for tuberculosis (TB). Th is  organism survives and thrives in tissues with high oxygen concentrations, which is consistent with the increased presentation of TB in the apices of the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the past, many cases of TB in the United States were due to  reactivation of infection, especially in elderly individuals. However, from 1985 to 1992, the United States was confronted with  an  unprecedented  resurgence  in  TB. Th is  resurgence was accompanied by a rise in multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, de fi ned as TB caused by M. tuberculosis strains resistant to the most e ff ective fi rst-line drugs, that is, isoniazid and rifampin. In addition, virtually untreatable strains of the TB organism are  emerging  worldwide.  Extensively  drug-resistant  (XDR) strains  of M.  tuberculosis are  resistant  to  second-line  therapeutic agents, including fl uoroquinolones and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs used to treat TB (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). Mortality rates for patients with XDR TB are similar to those for TB patients in the preantibiotic era. Unfortunately, drug-resistant TB is a human-created problem resulting from poor adherence of infected patients to the medical regimen or improper treatment regimen design. Worldwide, approximately 2 billion persons are infected with M. tuberculosis. In  2008,  WHO  estimated  that  440,000  new cases of MDR TB occurred worldwide with 150,000 deaths.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At  present,  most  cases  of  TB  in  the  United  States  occur in minority racial and ethnic groups, foreign-born individuals from areas where TB is endemic (Asia and Africa), intravenous drug abusers, and patients who are HIV seropositive or have AIDS. Any patient with TB should be tested for HIV , since there is a high association between the two infections. However, even in patients who are HIV negative, MDR TB has a 26% mortality rate. Th e epidemiologic rise in the incidence of TB coincided with the initial AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost  all M.  tuberculosis infections  result  from  inhalation  of  aerosolized  droplets.  It  has  been  estimated  that  up to  600,000  droplet  nuclei  are  expelled  with  each  cough  and that  the  expelled  organisms  remain  viable  for  several  days. Although a single infectious unit is capable of causing infection in susceptible individuals, prolonged exposure in closed environments  is  optimal  for  transmission  of  infection.  It  is estimated that 90% of patients infected with M. tuberculosis never become symptomatic and are identi fi ed only by conversion of the tuberculin skin test or by results on an interferon release assay. O ft en patients who acquire the infection early in life do not become symptomatic until much later. Patients who are HIV seropositive or immunocompromised with AIDS are at much higher risk of becoming symptomatic, especially a ft er initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of TB is based on the presence of clinical symptoms, the epidemiologic likelihood of infection, and the results of diagnostic tests. Symptoms of pulmonary TB o ft en include persistent nonproductive cough, anorexia, weight loss, chest pain, hemoptysis, and night sweats. Th e most common test for TB is the tuberculin skin test (Mantoux's test). Th e skin reaction is read in 48 to 72 hours, and a positive reaction is generally de fi ned as induration of more than 10 mm. For patients with  severe  immunocompromise,  including  but  not  limited to AIDS, a reaction of 5 mm or more is considered positive. Because the skin test is nonspeci fi c, the utility of the skin test is  limited. Th e  tuberculin  skin  test  result  may  be  positive  if the individual has received a bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
vaccine  or  if  the  individual  has  been  exposed  to  TB,  or  to other mycobacteria, even if no viable mycobacteria are present at the time of the skin test. Th e CDC and WHO have now accepted  two  interferon  release  assays  as  equivalent  to,  and possibly even better than, the tuberculin skin test in sensitivity and speci fi city. Th ese are the QuantiFERON TB Gold In-Tube test and the T-SPOT. TB test. Both are blood tests that measure release  of  interferonγ from  sensitized  lymphocytes  that  are incubated with two peptides from the TB bacillus. Results of these tests are not a ff ected by prior BCG immunization, nor do the tests cross-react with common environmental mycobacteria or Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chest radiographs are important for the diagnosis of TB. Apical  or  subapical  in fi ltrates  are  highly  suggestive  of  TB. Bilateral  upper  lobe  in fi ltration  with  cavitation  is  also  common. Patients with AIDS may demonstrate a less classic picture on chest radiography, which may be further confounded by the presence of Pneumocystis pneumonia. Tuberculous vertebral  osteomyelitis  (Pott's  disease)  is  a  common  manifestation of extrapulmonary TB.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sputum  smears  and  cultures  are  used  to  diagnose  TB. Smears are examined for the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Th is test  is  based  on  the  ability  of  mycobacteria  to  take  up  and retain neutral red stains a ft er an acid wash. It is estimated that 50% to 80% of individuals with active TB have positive sputum smear results. Although the absence of acid-fast bacilli does not rule out TB, a sputum culture positive for M. tuberculosis provides a de fi nitive diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Health care workers are at increased risk of occupational acquisition of TB, and TB is twice as prevalent in physicians as in the general population. Nosocomial outbreaks of TB have occurred especially among patients with AIDS. Anesthesiologists are at increased risk of nosocomial TB by virtue of events surrounding the induction and maintenance of anesthesia that may induce coughing (tracheal intubation, tracheal suctioning,  mechanical  ventilation).  Bronchoscopy  is  a  particularly high-risk procedure for anesthesiologists and has been associated  with  conversion of the tuberculin skin test. As a fi rst step in preventing occupational acquisition of TB, anesthesia personnel should participate in annual tuberculin screening so that those who develop a positive skin test result may be o ff ered  chemotherapy. Th e  decision  to  initiate  TB  chemotherapy is not trivial, since treatment carries serious toxicity. A baseline chest radiograph is indicated when a positive tuberculin skin test result fi rst occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antituberculous chemotherapy has decreased mortality from TB by more than 90%. With adequate treatment, more than 90% of patients who have susceptible strains of M. tuberculosis have bacteriologically negative sputum smears within 3 months.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some argue that, for the protection of the community, people who have positive results on a skin test should receive chemotherapy with isoniazid. However, isoniazid is a potentially toxic drug. Th e toxicity of isoniazid manifests in the peripheral nervous system, liver, and possibly the kidneys. Neurotoxicity may be prevented by daily administration of pyridoxine. Hepatotoxicity is most likely to be related to metabolism of isoniazid by hepatic acetylation. Depending on genetically determined traits,  patients  may  be  characterized as slow or rapid acetylators.  Hepatitis  appears  to  be  more  common in rapid acetylators,  consistent with their greater production of hydrazine, a  potentially  hepatotoxic  metabolite  of  isoniazid.  Persistent elevations of serum transaminase concentrations mandate that isoniazid be discontinued, but mild, transient increases do not.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other fi rst-line drugs used to treat TB include rifampicin, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol. Adverse e ff ects of  rifampicin  include  thrombocytopenia,  leukopenia,  anemia, and renal failure. Hepatitis associated with increases in serum transaminase concentrations occurs in approximately 10% of patients being treated with rifampicin. To be curative, treatment for pulmonary TB should continue for 6 months. Extrapulmonary TB usually requires a longer course of antituberculous therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  preoperative  assessment  of  patients  considered  to  be at risk of having TB includes taking a detailed history, with questions concerning the presence of a persistent cough and tuberculin  test  status.  Patients  with  HIV  or  AIDS  should undergo a thorough review of systems to elicit a possible history of TB.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elective  surgical  procedures  should  be  postponed  until patients are no longer considered infectious. Patients are considered  noninfectious  if  they  have  received  antituberculous chemotherapy,  are  improving  clinically,  and  have  had  three consecutive  negative fi ndings  on  sputum  smears.  If  surgery cannot  be  delayed,  it  is  important  to  limit  the  number  of involved personnel, and high-risk procedures (bronchoscopy, tracheal intubation, and suctioning) should be performed in a negative-pressure environment whenever possible. Patients should be transported to the operating room wearing a tightfi tting N95 face mask to prevent casual exposure of others to airborne bacilli. Sta ff should also wear N95 masks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A high-e ffi ciency particulate air fi lter  should be placed in the anesthesia delivery circuit between the Y connector and the mask, laryngeal mask airway, or tracheal tube. Bacterial fi lters should be placed on the exhalation limb of the anesthesia delivery circuit to decrease the discharge of tubercle bacilli into the ambient air.  Anesthesia  equipment  should  be  sterilized  with standard methods using a disinfectant that destroys tubercle bacilli.  Use  of  a  dedicated  anesthesia machine and ventilator is  recommended. Postoperative care should, if possible,  take place in a negative-pressure isolation room.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each year, over 16,000 patients in the United States receive solid organ transplants, and this number is expected to continue rising. Patients who have received solid organ transplants (liver, kidney, heart, or lung) present unique perioperative challenges

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 22 INFECTIOUS DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to the anesthesiologist. Because of advances in surgical technique,  immunosuppressive  therapy,  and  medical  management, this patient population has a 1-year survival rate of 80% to  90%,  so  these  patients  are  coming  for  additional  surgical procedures not necessarily related to their organ transplant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To prevent allogra ft rejection, solid organ transplant recipients commonly receive a combination of immunosuppressive agents. Th e  mechanisms  of  action  of  immunosuppressants include  blunting  of  general  antibody  responses,  depression of  cell-mediated  immunity,  downmodulation of lymphocyte and  macrophage  function,  inhibition  of  cell  proliferation, blocking of T-cell activation, and depletion of T-cells. Regardless of the e ff ect, immunosuppression is variable and depends on dosage, duration of therapy, and time since transplantation. Immunosuppression is most intense in the fi rst  few  months immediately a ft er transplantation and becomes progressively less intense as immunosuppressive therapy is gradually withdrawn over time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immunosuppression  in  transplant  recipients  can  also  be a ff ected  by  metabolic  abnormalities,  damage  to  mucocutaneous  barriers,  foreign  bodies  that  interrupt  these  barriers (such as surgical incisions, chest tubes, biliary drains, endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters), and the possible presence of  immunomodulating viruses such as cytomegalovirus and HIV. Th erefore, the resultant state of immunosuppression in the  posttransplantation  patient  is  a  dynamic  condition  that impacts the development of infectious diseases and/or cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious Disease Occurrence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e best approach to infection control in the solid organ transplant  recipient  is  prevention.  If  prevention  is  not  possible, immediate diagnosis and treatment is essential. Th e challenges in managing infectious diseases in organ transplant recipients are many and include the following: (1) the spectrum of infective  organisms is diverse and unusual, (2) the in fl ammatory response is blunted because of immunosuppressive therapy so that clinical and radiologic fi ndings may be limited, and (3) antimicrobial  coverage  is  complex  and  typically  empirically based. Th ere are three major time periods during which speci fi c infectious disease processes occur in the posttransplantation patient: the fi rst month, the second through sixth months, and  beyond  the  sixth  month  a ft er  transplantation.  In  addition, these periods may be in fl uenced by surgical factors, the net level of immunosuppression present, and environmental exposures. De fi ning the time period a ft er transplantation will assist the clinician in determining likely infectious processes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During the fi rst month a ft er transplantation, active infections  can  be  harbored  within  the  allogra ft and  are  typically bacterial  or  fungal.  In  addition,  anatomic  defects  related  to surgery  must  be  addressed  if  they  foster  infection,  such  as devitalized tissue and undrained fl uid collections that are at high risk for microbial seeding. Th e only common viral infection during the fi rst month a ft er transplantation is reactivated herpes simplex virus infection in individuals positive for this virus before transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e period from the second through the sixth month a ft er transplantation may be marked by unusual infections. Th ese may  be  either  community-acquired  or  opportunistic  infections.  Opportunistic  pathogens  possess  very  little  virulence in healthy hosts, but can cause serious infections in patients with immunocompromise or immune defects. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole is commonly  given  as  prophylaxis  for Pneumocytis pneumonia during the fi rst 6 months a ft er transplantation  in  all  solid  organ  gra ft recipients  and  for  longer periods in heart and lung transplant recipients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition,  high-dose  immunosuppression  may  lead  to reactivation disease syndromes caused by organisms present in the recipient before transplantation. TB has become especially common and occurs in 1% of the posttransplant population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
From 6 months a ft er transplantation onward, most transplant recipients do fairly well from an infectious disease standpoint and usually only sustain infections paralleling those seen in the community at large. However, another group of patients may have chronic or progressive viral infections with hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, cytomegalovirus, or Epstein-Barr virus. Th e  most commonly occurring viral infection is varicella-zoster virus infection manifesting as herpes zoster.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with chronic or recurrent rejection are generally taking high dosages of immunosuppressants and are predisposed to acquiring the opportunistic infections typically seen in  posttransplantation  patients  during  the  second  to  sixth months.  In  addition,  posttransplantation  patients  with  HIV and/or AIDS must be more closely followed for evidence of infections,  both  common  and  opportunistic.  HIV  highly active antiretroviral therapeutic regimens must be maintained and can complicate immunosuppressive drug dosing.

Patients who have received solid organ transplants comprise a wide clinical spectrum, and it is di ffi cult to make any generalizations about this patient population. Overall, the preoperative assessment should focus on determining the degree of immunosuppression and allogra ft function, examining for the presence of any infection, and evaluating any co-existing medical diseases. Laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood  count,  full  metabolic  panel,  liver  function  tests,  viral panels with viral loads as indicated, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram. If patients are currently receiving immunosuppressants,  blood  levels  of  immunosuppressive  agents  should also  be  obtained  when  possible.  Findings  elicited  on  history taking, review of systems, and physical examination may serve as indicators for additional laboratory testing or further specialist evaluations. Evidence of active rejection is a contraindication to elective surgery. However, one may be faced with managing  anesthesia  in  a  posttransplantation  patient  with active rejection who requires explantation of the transplanted organ. Th is is considered an urgent or emergent procedure.

the  perioperative  period.  If  the  posttransplantation  patient manifests any active infection, surgery should be delayed or cancelled until additional consultation is obtained.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRAOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  anesthetic  techniques-general  anesthesia,  regional  anesthesia, and sedation-have been used successfully in posttransplantation patients. Selection of anesthetic technique should be based on the type of surgery to be performed, the patient's associated comorbid conditions, the presence of contraindications for speci fi c anesthetic techniques, and the potential for interactions between immunosuppressant drugs and anesthetic drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of regional anesthesia in immunosuppressed patients remains controversial, since studies have demonstrated that  infections  may  occur  secondary  to  neuraxial  blockade. However,  few  studies  have  evaluated  the  frequency  of  epidural  abscesses  or  meningitis  in  the  immunocompromised population.  Information  on  the  incidence  of  infection  during peripheral nerve blockade and pain procedures in immunocompromised  posttransplantation  patients  is  scant.  With regard  to  general  anesthesia,  nasal  intubation  should  be avoided, because it may introduce nasal bacterial fl ora into the systemic circulation. Overall, general anesthesia is considered to  create  more  generalized  immunosuppressant  e ff ects  than regional anesthesia, although levels of speci fi c and nonspeci fi c biologic markers indicating immune suppression are not consistently  depressed.  Cyclosporine  may  delay  the  metabolism of  neuromuscular  blockers,  speci fi cally  pancuronium  and vecuronium. Invasive monitoring may be warranted, but strict use of aseptic technique is critical in this patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because of the high potential for further immunosuppression secondary to anesthesia and surgery, the posttransplantation patient must be observed for any clinical deterioration in gra ft function or a potential infectious disease process. All antibiotics regimens must be strictly followed and monitored closely. Because  of  the  blunted  in fl ammatory response in immunosuppressed patients, signs and symptoms of active infection are o ft en di ffi cult to detect.

HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS INFECTION AND ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e disease syndrome now known as AIDS was fi rst described in 1981 and was initially termed gay-related immune disorder because it was identi fi ed in a group of homosexual men in Los Angeles,  California. Th e  etiologic  mechanism  was  unknown at  that  time.  However,  severe  immune  dysfunction was present and was clinically manifested by the occurrence of unusual malignancies and opportunistic infections in previously healthy individuals. Th e disease was later reclassi fi ed as acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome (AIDS). In 1984, the cause of AIDS was elucidated and was found to be a retrovirus, which was named human immunode fi ciency virus (HIV) type 1 and type 2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th irty years later, HIV infection and the associated AIDS pandemic continue to pose a major threat to global health. It is estimated that more than 50 million people worldwide (or approximately  0.6%  of  the  world's  population)  are  infected with HIV, and AIDS is thought to have caused more than 26 million deaths worldwide. Th ere are approximately 1.2 million  people  in  the  United  States  living  with  HIV  infection and/or AIDS. HIV infection continues to spread. Th e  most rapid  increases  are  being  observed  in  southern  and  central Africa  and  in  Southeast  Asia. Th roughout  the  world,  the predominant mode of HIV transmission is by heterosexual sex, with women representing a large proportion of the new infections. In the United States, the primary means of transmission is via sex in men who have sex with men. However, the mechanism for disease transmission is variable and may also  include  spread  via  heterosexual  sex,  intravenous  drug use,  vertical  transmission  from  pregnant  mother  to  child, and blood transfusion. Although HIV antiretroviral therapy has decreased the rate of disease progression, there is no cure available and almost 600,000 people have died of AIDS in the United States since the epidemic began. Research continues into development of a vaccine to prevent the acquisition of HIV infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recent treatment modalities known as highly  active  antiretroviral  therapy (HAART)  have  been  e ff ective  in  halting HIV replication and thereby delaying the transition from HIV infection to AIDS or delaying the progression of AIDS itself. An increasing number of patients coming for surgery are HIV seropositive or have AIDS. Th erefore, anesthesiologists should be familiar with this infectious disease and syndrome and its impact on anesthetic management. An understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV, the multiple organ system involvement of  HIV  and  AIDS,  the  possible  drug  interactions  occurring with HIV therapy, side e ff ects related to HAART, and associated opportunistic infections will serve to better guide preoperative assessment and anesthetic planning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  seroconversion  illness  occurs  approximately  2  to  3 weeks a ft er  inoculation  with  the  HIV  virus. Th e  acute  viral phase is typically marked by a fl ulike illness associated with fever,  fatigue,  headache,  night  sweats,  pharyngitis,  myalgias, and  arthralgias. Th erefore,  signs  and  symptoms  during  the period a ft er the initial infection may mimic those of any common fl ulike illness. Within 1 to 2 weeks a ft er inoculation with HIV, the virus initiates rapid replication. A ft er several months, there  is  a  gradual  decrease  in  the  viremia.  As  the  immune system responds, viral replication decelerates, and a balance develops between host immune defenses and viral replication. Th e resulting viral level can be described as a steady-state rate of viral production equal to the rate of viral destruction and suppression. Generalized lymphadenopathy is a hallmark of HIV infection and may persist until HAART is initiated. An HIV-positive individual is not considered to have AIDS unless one of the AIDS-de fi ning diagnoses is present.

As noted earlier, HIV belongs to the family of retroviruses. It is characteristically cytopathic (cell damaging) with a long latency period and a chronic course of infection. When the fi rst cases of AIDS appeared, its pathogenesis was frustratingly elusive because the disease does not appear immediately a ft er infection  with  HIV .  It  has  been  shown  that  the  steady-state viral level is a reliable predictor of the rate of progression from simple HIV positivity to the development of AIDS. In general, higher basal viral levels correspond to more rapid disease progression. Weight loss and failure to thrive are among the fi rst manifestations  patients  display  as  HIV  infection  progresses from the chronic latent phase to the development of AIDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With the advent of HAART, the prognosis of those infected with  HIV  has  been  dramatically  improved. Th erefore,  it is  important  that  the  stigma  attached  to  HIV  infection  be removed so that high-risk individuals feel comfortable undergoing testing. Th e standard test to diagnose HIV infection is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the results of which become positive when antibodies to HIV are present. Th is  is  typically  4  to  8  weeks  a ft er infection. Th is  test  is  not a  measure of viral load but simply indicates the presence of antibodies to HIV . During the initial period of infection, there is  signi fi cant  viremia  and  patients  are  highly  infectious,  but antibodies may not be present. Th erefore, a false-negative test result may occur. If a positive diagnosis is made, infection is con fi rmed with a Western blot test or by direct measurement of HIV viral load in the blood. HIV viral load is measured via polymerase chain reaction RNA analysis. If a patient is tested within a very short period a ft er the initial infection, the ELISA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
test result may be negative or inconclusive. Nucleic acid testing of HIV RNA is the most speci fi c and sensitive test for HIV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since HIV is lymphotropic and has a particular a ffi nity for CD4 +  cells, measurement of these cells is useful in assessing the degree of HIV progression. CD4 +  cell levels are measured as cells per cubic millimeter. Ninety-eight percent of helper T lymphocytes (CD4 +  T cells) are located in lymph nodes, which are the major site of viral replication and T-cell destruction. During the acute infectious period, CD4 +  cell counts decline dramatically then rise again. Over the course of 8 to 12 years, there is a gradual involution of lymph nodes with a concomitant slow decrease in CD4 +  T cell counts that is accompanied by an increase in viral load as the inexorable onset of AIDS occurs (Figure 22-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A ft er the diagnosis of HIV infection is con fi rmed, a patient will undergo further testing to determine viral genotype and phenotype. In addition, HIV sensitivity and resistance to existing HAART agents as well as coreceptor usage will be determined. Th ese  new  testing  modalities  have  been  extremely e ff ective in minimizing resistance when HAART is initiated, because selection of HAART agents is tailored to each individual  patient.  For  the  purposes  of  disease  surveillance  and disease severity estimation and management, patients who are HIV positive are classi fi ed as having AIDS only when at least one of the AIDS-de fi ning diagnoses is present (Table 22-8).

that  encompasses  a  continuum  of  clinical  signs  from  acute infection to clinical latency, then to clinical progression, and eventually to development of AIDS with associated opportunistic  infections  and  ultimately  death.  However,  the  clinical continuum from HIV infection to AIDS can be interrupted, delayed, or distorted by the institution of HAART. Opportunistic infections are caused by pathogens with no intrinsic virulence and require a compromised immune system or defect to proliferate. Because subclinical and clinical multiple organ system involvement is a hallmark of HIV infection, the anesthesiologist should be adept at eliciting a history and reviewing systems to detect any of the myriad co-existing diseases that could be present, as well as performing a thorough physical examination to detect pertinent pathologic conditions.

CARDIAC MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac involvement in the course of HIV infection is common, but o ft en subclinical. Up to 50% of HIV-positive patients have abnormal echocardiographic fi ndings at some point during their disease. HIV is an extremely trophic virus with a high a ffi nity for the myocardium, and evidence has demonstrated

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the presence of HIV in myocardial cells. Le ft ventricular dilatation  and  cardiac  dysfunction may result. In addition, pulmonary hypertension is present in about 1% of patients with HIV infection or AIDS. Cardiac disease may be exacerbated by HAART, especially when protease inhibitors are utilized. Protease inhibitors may cause premature atherosclerosis and diastolic  dysfunction  leading  to  heart  failure.  Myocardial infarction has been reported even in young patients with HIV infection. Approximately 25% of patients with HIV infection have pericardial e ff usions. Myocarditis, which is more common in advanced disease, may be caused by toxoplasmosis, disseminated cryptococcosis, coxsackievirus B infection, cytomegalovirus infection, lymphoma, aspergillosis, and HIV infection itself. In addition, HIV is trophic for vascular structures and has been implicated in the development of multifocal abdominal aortic aneurysms in adults and children, as well as aortic arch, aneurysms, and aortic dissection in adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic disease, ranging from AIDS dementia to infectious and  neoplastic  involvement,  may  be  common,  especially  as AIDS progresses. HIV enters the central nervous system early in the course of infection, and the central nervous system is considered a reservoir for HIV . Th ree diagnoses comprise the majority of predominantly focal cerebral diseases complicating  AIDS:  cerebral  toxoplasmosis,  primary  central  nervous system lymphoma, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Cryptococcus  neoformans, HIV ,  and  the  TB  bacillus can cause meningitis. Aggressive generalized cerebrovascular disease  may  occur  as  a  complication  of  HAART.  Increased intracranial pressure may develop with active HIV infection resulting from the presence of intracranial masses or opportunistic infections. Peripheral neuropathy is the most frequent neurologic  complication  in  HIV-positive  patients.  Approximately 35% of patients with AIDS show clinical evidence of polyneuropathy  or  myopathy,  Autonomic  nervous  dysfunction may also appear with or without the presence of central nervous system involvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONARY MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pulmonary  manifestations  in  HIV-positive  patients  are typically  caused  by  opportunistic  infections.  Complications include respiratory failure,  pneumothorax, and chronic pulmonary disease. Cavitary lung disease can be due to pyogenic bacterial lung abscess, pulmonary TB, fungal infections, and Nocardia infection. Kaposi's sarcoma and lymphoma can also a ff ect  the  lungs.  Adenopathy  can  lead  to  tracheobronchial obstruction  or  compression  of  the  great  vessels.  Endobronchial  Kaposi's  sarcoma  may cause massive hemoptysis. HIV directly a ff ects the lungs and may cause a destructive pulmonary syndrome similar to emphysema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumocytis  jiroveci pneumonia  (PCP),  formerly  called Pneumocytis carinii pneumonia, does not usually occur until the CD4 +  count falls below 200 cells/mm 3 and fortunately has become less common with the use of HAART. With PCP, an

AIDS-de fi ning illness, the chest radiograph can be normal but typically shows bilateral ground-glass opacities. Pneumothoraces may be evident or there may be several pneumatoceles. High-resolution computed tomographic scans reveal a groundglass  appearance,  even  when  chest  radiograph fi ndings  are normal. Pulmonary function tests show reduced lung volumes with  decreased  compliance  and  diminished  di ff using  capacity.  Measurements of oxygen saturation during exercise may be more helpful than lung function tests. If PCP is suspected, fi beroptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage should be performed. Th e advantage of an early diagnosis compensates for the high frequency of negative examination fi ndings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disseminated TB is a potential cause of severe respiratory failure,  and  respiratory  secretions  should  be  examined  routinely for acid-fast bacilli in HIV/AIDS patients with pulmonary in fi ltrates. Bacterial pneumonia may also be the cause of severe acute respiratory failure. Bacteria may be detected in sputum or bronchial washings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENDOCRINE MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adrenal insu ffi ciency should be considered since this may occur with advanced HIV infection. Random measurement of cortisol levels and tests of adrenal stimulation may reveal absolute or relative adrenal insu ffi ciency, and this is the most serious endocrine complication in HIV-positive patients. In HIV-positive patients taking protease inhibitor therapy, glucose intolerance, disorders of lipid metabolism, and fat redistribution are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMATOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e hematopoietic system is widely a ff ected by HIV infection, and the most common early fi nding of HIV infection is anemia. Lymphocytosis,  with  an  increase  mainly  in  CD8 +   T  lymphocytes, may appear within 2 weeks of initial HIV infection. Bone marrow involvement can occur secondary to HIV infection itself and/or to opportunistic infection. Th is can produce leukopenia, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. In addition, bone marrow suppression may develop a ft er initiation of zidovudine therapy. Th rombocytopenia typically worsens as CD4 +  counts diminish to less than 250 cells/mm 3 . HIV-  positive patients may be prone to either hypercoagulable states or coagulation abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RENAL MANIFESTATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIV-positive patients may develop renal diseases secondary to HIV infection, viral hepatitis, associated drug use, or HAART. Protease  inhibitor  therapy  has  been  speci fi cally  implicated in  both  toxic  acute  tubular  necrosis  and  nephrolithiasis.  In addition, nephrotic syndrome may occur as a result of HIVassociated nephropathy. HIV-associated nephropathy is especially common in African American men and commonly leads to end-stage renal disease.

currently  in  use,  and  two  groups  of  agents  are  undergoing clinical investigations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  continued  interest  in  developing  treatment  regimens that have a higher safety pro fi le, lower rate of side e ff ects or  complications,  and  easier  dosing  regimens.  Antiretroviral  drugs  used  to  treat  HIV  infection  are always employed in  combinations  of  at  least  three  agents.  Patients  who  have developed  resistance  to  commonly  used  HAART  regimens or  have  advanced  AIDS may require four agents and possibly additional booster medications designed to increase drug bioavailability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decision to initiate HAART is based on multiple factors,  and  once  begun,  treatment  entails  a  lifelong  commitment. Nonadherence to the medical regimen for any reason is one of the main causes of the development of viral resistance and treatment failure. Initiation of HAART is not necessarily a benign process, and implementation of HAART may result in a myriad of drug-related complications. Some patients who are in the early phase of HIV infection may decide, in conjunction with their physicians, not to immediately implement therapy and choose simply to be monitored.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
begin HAART. Early institution of HAART is linked to greater long-term survival and lower morbidity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As noted earlier, a typical antiretroviral regimen consists of at least three drugs, and drug selection is based on viral sensitivity, resistance patterns, coreceptor subtypes, and virulence subtypes.  In  some  circumstances,  combinations  of  four  or more drugs are used, such as when drug resistance patterns are evident when the patient is undergoing a rapid clinical decline. Th e aim of therapy in treatment-naive patients is to achieve an undetectable viral load by 24 weeks of therapy and to improve and extend the length and quality of life. Numerous side e ff ects and drug interactions complicate such   regimens and decrease adherence.  Patients  may  develop  a  myriad  of  adverse  drug reactions, and some are potentially fatal (Table 22-9).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients begin HAART immediately when there is evidence that  CD4 + cell  counts  are  diminishing  rapidly,  counts  have already fallen below 200 cells/mm 3 , or a patient with newly diagnosed HIV infection already meets AIDS-de fi ning criteria.  New  recommendations  advocate  that  HAART  be  instituted when CD4 +  cell counts approach 500 cells/mm 3  or soon a ft er the initial HIV diagnosis when the patient can realistically

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  who begin HAART may also develop a reaction known  as immune  reconstitution in fl ammatory  syndrome (IRIS). IRIS occurs as a result of restoration of basic immune competence with HAART and the gradual improvement and strengthening of the immune system. IRIS leads to a paradoxical deterioration of general clinical symptoms in the context of improving CD4 +  counts and a reduced viral load. IRIS is marked by the appearance and/or exacerbation of previously silent clinical diseases such as hepatitis A, B, and C; PCP; TB; and any other dormant opportunistic infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Concurrent  use  of  zidovudine  and  corticosteroids  may result  in  severe  myopathy  and  respiratory  muscle  dysfunction.  In  addition,  reports  have  documented  several  cases  of respiratory failure related to HAART initiation. Of particular

importance  to  anesthesiologists  is  that  patients  receiving HAART  are  subject  to  long-term  metabolic  complications, including lipid abnormalities and glucose intolerance, which may  result  in  the  development  of  diabetes,  coronary  artery disease,  and  cerebrovascular  disease.  HAART  has  also  been implicated in fat redistribution to the neck, back of the neck, and abdomen. Th is phenomenon may make airway management more di ffi cult or increase intraabdominal pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protease  inhibitors,  particularly  ritonavir  and  saquinavir, act as inhibitors of cytochrome P-450. In contrast, drugs such as  nevirapine  are  inducers  of  hepatic  microsomal  enzymes. Th ese  variable  e ff ects  on  liver  enzyme  mechanics  further complicate the dosing of HAART drugs and other drugs that undergo hepatic metabolism, including anesthetic and analgesic drugs. Th erefore, caution must be used when administering pharmacologic agents that may be metabolized via these pathways, because drug duration and anticipated e ff ect  may be highly variable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Before 1995, the prospects for treatment of HIV infection were dismal, and a diagnosis of HIV infection was inevitably followed by death. Today, the situation has changed dramatically as  a  result  of  several  independent  factors:  (1)  an  improved understanding of the pathogenesis of HIV infection; (2) the availability  of  surrogate  markers  of  immune  function  and plasma viral burden, speci fi cally  CD4 + cell  counts  and  HIV viral load quanti fi cation, to determine if HAART is e ff ective; (3) the use of CD4 + cell counts and viral load determinations by researchers to determine minimal e ff ective concentrations of HAART and thereby improve its risk/bene fi t pro fi le; (4) the development of viral genotypic-phenotypic pro fi ling, coreceptor subtyping, and sensitivity and resistance pattern analysis, which has enabled optimal selection of speci fi c HAART regimens; (5) the continued development of new and more powerful drugs; (6) the completion of several large clinical end-point trials that have conclusively demonstrated that antiretroviral combinations signi fi cantly delay the progression of HIV disease and improve long-term survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with HIV infection and/or AIDS are usually managed by  an  internist,  primary  care  provider,  or  infectious  disease specialist. Although a medical evaluation by one of these physicians immediately before surgery is not mandatory, it may be helpful to obtain a consultation if the patient is unable to delineate  pertinent  medical  history  and  management  speci fi cally related to HIV infection and/or AIDS. Additional information from primary care and infectious disease specialists may be especially pertinent in patients in advanced stages of AIDS.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Not all patients with HIV/AIDS are receiving HAART, and it is important to understand what current treatment strategies are being utilized for each speci fi c patient. Some patients may be  waiting  for  further  deterioration  in  clinical  and  immune status before initiating HAART, whereas a subset of patients may  be  on  physician-approved  "drug  holidays,"  and  other patients may simply be unable to tolerate the adverse e ff ects of HAART. Regardless of whether a patient is receiving HAART and has an undetectable viral load, patients with HIV/AIDS should  always  be  considered  a  potential  source  of  disease transmission. In patients who are not receiving HAART, initiating HAART to minimize viral load to improve overall clinical condition in the period immediately before surgery is not indicated, Studies have indicated that HAART has no protective e ff ect in reducing perioperative risk, and the initiation of HAART within 6 months of surgery actually increases overall morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  with  HIV  infection.  In addition, the occurrence of IRIS a ft er HAART is begun may paradoxically worsen the patient's overall condition and further delay surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  HIV  infection,  AIDS,  and  HAART  can  potentially impact multiple organ systems, it is advisable to order a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel including renal function  studies,  liver  function  tests,  and  coagulation  studies.  A chest radiograph and electrocardiogram are also useful preoperatively regardless of age or lack of related disease. If a patient with  HIV  infection  or  AIDS  has  any  signs  or  symptoms  of possible cardiac dysfunction, echocardiography or stress testing  may also be indicated with additional consultation by a cardiologist as indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is  little  speci fi c  information concerning the overall risk of anesthesia and surgery in the HIV-positive patient. Th e American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status assessment and the inherent surgical risk probably provide a measure of global risk assessment. An ASA status of 2 is typically  assigned  to  HIV-positive  patients without any  clinical evidence of immunocompromise or acute deterioration; these patients may or may not be receiving HAART. Patients with AIDS may be classi fi ed as having an ASA status of either 3 or 4 depending on the severity of co-existing disease processes related  or  unrelated  to  HIV  infection.  In  addition,  patients with  advanced  AIDS  may  be  receiving  HAART  but  for  all practical purposes may be minimally responsive to it; CD4 + cell counts may be low and viral load may range from undetectable  to  low,  moderate,  or  high. Th is  information,  when combined with the stage of the HIV infection, the degree of clinical immunosuppression, and the presence and severity of opportunistic infections or neoplasms, may o ff er the best predictor of global perioperative risk in the HIV-positive patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e speci fi c utility of obtaining a CD4 +  cell count and viral load determination before surgery has not been demonstrated. Various  studies  have  shown  that  there  is  no  signi fi cant  difference  in  perioperative  outcomes  in  HIV-positive  or  AIDS patients whose CD4 +  cell counts are higher than 50 cells/mm 3 compared with outcomes in patient populations without HIV/ AIDS  matched  for  the  same  surgery,  comorbid  conditions, and ASA status. Viral load level is also not a predictor of perioperative outcome unless viral load exceeds 30,000 copies/mL. HAART does not o ff er any real protective e ff ects or decrease

the  overall  morbidity  and  mortality  associated  with  surgery and  anesthesia.  However,  patients  with  HIV  infection  and AIDS do demonstrate a higher overall mortality 1 year a ft er surgery  than  similar  cohorts  without  HIV/AIDS. Th is  has been attributed to HIV infection and/or AIDS itself and not to the surgical procedure performed or the anesthetic used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In general, if a patient is HIV positive and has never met AIDS-de fi ning criteria, one can presume the patient's CD4 + cell  count  is  higher  than  200  cells/mm 3 .  However,  patients with AIDS-de fi ning diagnoses or a history of AIDS (with or without HAART) may have widely varying CD4 +  cell counts. Not all  HIV-positive  patients  receiving  HAART  have  undetectable viral loads, so viral load quanti fi cation does not assist the  anesthesiologist  in  any  meaningful  manner  during  the perioperative period. In addition, even if viral load is undetectable, universal precautions must continue to be employed since this does not imply that HIV cannot be transmitted. HIV persistence is a known phenomenon, and HIV remains dormant in lymph nodes and central nervous system reservoirs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since  patients  with  HIV  infection  or  AIDS  can  manifest a  wide  array  of  co-existing  diseases,  every  patient  should undergo  a  thorough  history  taking,  review  of  systems,  and physical  examination  particularly  focused  on  subclinical  or clinical  manifestations  of  cardiac,  pulmonary,  neurologic, renal,  and  hepatic  disorders  related  to  HIV  or  AIDS.  With regard to selection of anesthetic method, any anesthetic technique  is  acceptable  unless  there  is  a  speci fi c  contraindication to regional anesthesia. Consideration should be given to addressing  potential  HAART-drug  interactions  when  using pharmacologic agents in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overall, HIV infection and AIDS do not increase the risk of postsurgical complications, including death, up to 30 days postoperatively. Th us, surgical intervention should not be limited because of HIV status and concern for subsequent complications.  However,  during  anesthesia,  tachycardia  is  more frequently seen in HIV-positive patients, and postoperatively high fever, anemia, and tachycardia are more frequent.

Selection of a particular anesthetic technique should take into account both HIV/AIDS-related comorbidities and any other clinical  issues.  Overall,  no  speci fi c  anesthetic  technique  has been shown to be superior or inferior in patients with HIV infection  or  AIDS.  Speci fi cally  in  patients  with  AIDS,  focal neurologic lesions may increase intracerebral pressure, which precludes neuraxial anesthesia. Spinal cord involvement, peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy may occur with cytomegalovirus or HIV infection itself. Th erefore, succinylcholine could conceivably be hazardous in this setting. HIV infection is associated with autonomic neuropathy, and this can manifest perioperatively as hemodynamic instability during anesthesia or in the ICU. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be helpful in patients with severe autonomic dysfunction. Steroid supplementation may decrease hemodynamic instability and should be considered in cases of unexplained, persistent hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several studies indicate that general anesthesia and opiates may have a negative e ff ect on immune function. Although this immunosuppressive e ff ect is probably of little clinical importance  in  healthy  individuals,  the  implications  for  the  HIVinfected patient are unknown. Immunosuppression resulting from general anesthetics occurs within 15 minutes of induction and may persist for as long as 3 to 11 days. Th e psychological stress of undergoing anesthesia and surgery may also lead to some degree of generalized immunosuppression. However, no studies have been undertaken to determine speci fi c e ff ects in HIV-positive patients. Aside from CD4 +  cell count and viral load, there are no speci fi c markers of immune status in this patient population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIV infection and AIDS are increasing in women of childbearing  age,  and  there  has  been  much  study  of  this  patient population.  Although  research  has  demonstrated  the  e ff ectiveness of zidovudine in parturient women, monotherapy has limited  long-term  bene fi t,  because  HIV  resistance  develops rapidly. Th erefore, in pregnancy, combination therapy is preferable, and acceptable multidrug regimens are available. Data suggests that cesarean section decreases the incidence of vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child. A combination of antiretroviral therapy and elective cesarean section reduces the rate of vertical transmission to 2%. However, cesarean section  is  a  major  surgical  intervention  that  has  well-reported complications. Many practitioners in the past did not recommend elective cesarean section for HIV-infected women who were adherent to antiretroviral treatment regimens and had undetectable HIV viral loads. However, studies demonstrate that cesarean section can proceed safely. Unfortunately, HIVpositive  women  with  low  CD4 +   lymphocyte  counts  whose infants would likely bene fi t most from caesarean delivery are also the women who are most likely to experience perioperative complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIV-positive  parturient  women  who  are  given  regional anesthesia  have  not  had  neurologic  or  infectious  complications  related  to  the  anesthetic  or  obstetric  course.  In  the immediately postpartum period, immune function status has remained essentially unchanged, as has the severity of the preexisting HIV disease. Th ere have been concerns that epidural and  lumbar  puncture  in  HIV-positive  patients  might  allow entry of the virus into the central nervous system. However, the natural history of HIV infection includes central nervous system involvement early in the clinical course. Th e  central nervous system is known to be a reservoir of HIV . Th e safety of epidural blood patches for treatment of post-dural puncture  headache  has  been  reported  in  HIV-positive  patients. Fear  of  disseminating  HIV  from  the  bloodstream  into  the central nervous system is not warranted.

A  limited  number  of  retrospective  studies  have  evaluated the  long-term  consequences  of  undergoing  anesthesia  and surgery in HIV-positive and AIDS patients, but many of the studies  conducted  in  the  pre-HAART  era  yielded  con fl icting  results.  Newer  studies  are  now  examining  surgical  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
anesthetic-related  morbidity  and  mortality  in  HIV-positive patients  who  had  been  receiving  HAART. Th erefore,  it  is important to understand the impact that HAART has had on overall well-being in the HIV-positive population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  appears that patients with HIV infection and AIDS do not experience any statistically signi fi cant increases in perioperative complications compared with similar cohorts who are not HIV positive. No statistically signi fi cant di ff erences have been noted with regard to wound healing, SSI rates, wound dehiscence, number of complications, length of hospital stay, number of follow-up visits to the surgeon, or need for further operative  procedures  to  treat  surgical  complications.  However,  1-year  mortality  is  higher  overall  in  patients  who  are HIV   positive  and/or  have  AIDS. Th is  is  hypothesized  to  be due to HIV infection itself. Patients with CD4 + cell counts of less than 50 cells/mm 3  and patients with viral loads of more than 30,000 copies/mL fare the worst in terms of postoperative mortality. Patients with HIV infection may have a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia than non-HIV +  patients. Proper diagnosis and treatment typically leads to resolution of the pulmonary infection without sequelae.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE  II)  scoring  signi fi cantly  underestimates  mortality risk in HIV-positive patients admitted to the ICU with a total lymphocyte count of less than 200 cells/mm 3 . Th is is   particularly true of patients admitted with pneumonia or sepsis. Th ere is a diverse range of indications for critical care in patients with HIV infection.  Historically,  respiratory  failure  caused  by  PCP  was the most common reason for ICU admission and accounted for  a  third  of  ICU  admissions  in  HIV-positive  patients. Th e need for mechanical ventilation for PCP and other pulmonary disorders is associated with a mortality rate of more than 50%. In contrast, admission to the ICU and mechanical ventilation for nonpulmonary disorders is associated with a mortality rate of less than 25%. In patients with septic shock, however, HIV infection is an independent predictor of poor outcome. In the era of HAART, fewer patients with HIV infection are admitted to the ICU with AIDS-de fi ning illnesses. Many patients are now admitted to the ICU with unrelated critical illnesses and are found coincidentally to be infected with HIV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initiation  of  HAART  has  improved  overall  outcomes regardless  of  the  clinical  stage  of  HIV  infection.  However, HAART does not o ff er  any  protective  e ff ect  during  surgery and anesthesia. As noted earlier, patients who begin HAART within 6 months of surgery experience a higher incidence of perioperative complications, perhaps because of IRIS.
