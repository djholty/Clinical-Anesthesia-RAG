The presence of nutritional disturbances or inborn errors of metabolism will significantly influence the management of  anesthesia  (Table  15-1).  The  pathophysiology  and  the associated  anesthetic  implications  of  the  most  frequently encountered of these diseases are highlighted in this chapter.  Inborn  errors  of  metabolism  manifest  as  a  variety  of metabolic  defects  that  may  complicate  the  management of  anesthesia.  In  some  instances,  these  defects  are  clinically asymptomatic and manifest only in response to specific  triggering  events,  such  as  ingestion  of  certain  drugs or foods.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PORPHYRIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyrias are a group of metabolic disorders each of which results from the de fi ciency of a speci fi c enzyme in the heme synthetic pathway. Th erefore, this category of inborn errors of metabolism is characterized by overproduction of porphyrins. Porphyrins are essential for many vital physiologic functions, including oxygen transport and storage. Th e  synthetic pathway involved in the production of porphyrins is determined by a sequence of enzymes. A defect in any of these enzymes results in accumulation of the preceding intermediate form of porphyrin and produces a form of porphyria (Figure 15-1). In human physiology, heme is the most important porphyrin and is bound to proteins to form hemoproteins that include hemoglobin  and  cytochrome  P-450  isoenzymes.  Production  of heme is regulated by the activity of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase, which is present in mitochondria. Th e formation of ALA synthetase is controlled by the endogenous concentration of heme, which ensures that the level of heme production parallels  requirements.  ALA  synthetase  is  readily  inducible, and therefore supply can respond rapidly to increased heme requirements  such  as  those  resulting  from  administration of  drugs  that  need  cytochrome  P-450  isoenzymes  for  their metabolism.  In  the  presence  of  porphyria,  any  increase  in heme requirements results in accumulation of pathway intermediates,  that  is,  those  chemicals  compounds  immediately preceding the site of enzyme block.

Classification

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyrias  are  classi fi ed  as  either  hepatic  or  erythropoietic depending  on  the  primary  site  of  overproduction  or  accumulation of the precursors or porphyrins (Table 15-2). Only acute forms of porphyria are relevant to the management of anesthesia, because they are the only forms of porphyria that may result in life-threatening reactions in response to certain drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Porphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute porphyrias are inherited autosomal dominant disorders with variable expression. Th e enzyme defects in porphyria are de fi ciencies rather than absolute de fi cits. Although there is no direct in fl uence of gender on the pattern of inheritance, attacks occur more frequently in women and are most frequent during the third and fourth decades of life. Attacks are rare before puberty or following the onset of menopause. Acute attacks of porphyria are most commonly precipitated by events that

(such as before elective surgery), dehydration, stress (such as that  associated  with  anesthesia  and  surgery),  and  infection. Pregnancy in these patients is o ft en associated with spontaneous abortion. Furthermore, pregnancy may be complicated by systemic hypertension and an increased incidence of lowbirth-weight infants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute attacks of porphyria are characterized by severe abdominal  pain,  autonomic  nervous  system  instability,  electrolyte disturbances,  and  neuropsychiatric  manifestations  ranging from  mild  to  life-threatening  events.  Skeletal  muscle  weakness that may progress to quadriparesis and respiratory failure is  the  most potentially lethal neurologic manifestation of an acute  attack  of  porphyria.  Central  nervous  system  involvement with upper motor neuron lesions, cranial nerve palsies, and abnormalities of the cerebellum and basal ganglia are seen less  frequently.  However,  these  lesions  in  combination  with autonomic neuropathy and hypovolemia can cause signi fi cant cardiovascular instability. Seizures may occur during an attack of acute porphyria. Psychiatric disturbances may develop but, despite  classic  tales  of  werewolf  behavior  and  other  bizarre psychiatric problems, mental disorders are not very common. Gastrointestinal symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting and  diarrhea.  However,  notwithstanding  severe  abdominal pain  that  may  mimic  acute  appendicitis,  acute  cholecystitis, or renal colic, clinical examination of the abdomen typically yields  normal fi ndings.  Abdominal  pain  is  thought  to  be related to autonomic neuropathy. Dehydration and electrolyte disturbances  involving  sodium,  potassium,  and  magnesium may  be  prominent.  Tachycardia  and  hypertension  or,  less commonly, hypotension are manifestations of cardiovascular instability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complete  and  prolonged  remissions  are  likely  between episodes, and many individuals with the genetic defect never develop  symptoms.  It  is  important  to  note,  however,  that patients  at  known  risk  of  porphyria  but  previously  asymptomatic (silent or latent porphyria) may experience their fi rst symptoms in response to administration of triggering drugs during the perioperative period. ALA synthetase concentrations are increased during all acute attacks of porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRIGGERING DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs may trigger an acute attack of porphyria by inducing the  activity  of  ALA  synthetase  or  interfering  with  its  negative  feedback control at the fi nal common pathway of heme synthesis (see Figure 15-1). It is not possible to predict which drugs will be porphyrinogenic, although chemical groupings such as  the  allyl  groups  present  on  barbiturates  and  certain steroid structures have been incriminated in the induction of porphyria. Only the acute forms of porphyria are a ff ected by drug-induced enzyme induction. It is not clear why the manifestations  of  nonacute  porphyrias  are  apparently  una ff ected by  enzyme-inducing  drugs.  For  example,  potent  enzyme inducers  of  ALA  synthetase,  including  the  anticonvulsants, do not exacerbate or precipitate  porphyria  cutanea  tarda  or the  erythropoietic  porphyrias. Th e  labeling  of  drugs  as  safe or unsafe for patients with porphyria is o ft en based on anecdotal experience with the use of particular agents in porphyric patients and reports of the induction of acute attacks. Drugs may be tested in cell culture models for their ability to induce ALA synthetase activity or for their e ff ects on porphyrin synthesis. Alternatively, the action of drugs on the porphyrin synthetic pathway can be investigated in animal models. Both cell culture and animal models tend to overestimate the  porphyrinogenicity of drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  di ffi cult  to  assess  the  porphyrinogenic  potential  of anesthetic drugs, since other factors such as sepsis or stress may  also  precipitate  a  porphyric  crisis  in  the  perioperative period.  Any  classi fi cation  of  anesthetic  drugs  with  regard to their ability to precipitate a porphyric crisis is likely to be imperfect (Table 15-3). Particular care is needed when selecting  drugs  for  patients  with  acute  intermittent  porphyria  or clinically  active  forms  of  porphyria  and  when  prescribing drugs  in  combination,  because  exacerbation  of  porphyria  is more likely under these circumstances.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Intermittent Porphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Of  all  the  acute  porphyrias,  acute  intermittent  porphyria a ff ecting the central and peripheral nervous system produces the most serious symptoms (systemic hypertension, renal dysfunction) and is the one most likely to be life threatening. Th e defective enzyme is porphobilinogen deaminase, and the gene encoding this enzyme is located on chromosome 11.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variegate Porphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Variegate  porphyria  is  characterized  by  neurotoxicity  and cutaneous  photosensitivity  in  which  bullous  skin  eruptions occur on exposure to sunlight as a result of the conversion of porphyrinogens  to  porphyrins. Th e  enzyme  defect  is  at  the level of protoporphyrinogen oxidase, and the gene encoding this enzyme is on chromosome 1. Th e incidence of variegate porphyria is highest in South Africa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary Coproporphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute attacks of hereditary coproporphyria are less common and less severe than attacks of acute intermittent porphyria or variegate porphyria. Th ese patients typically experience neurotoxicity and cutaneous hypersensitivity, although these signs tend to be less severe than is seen in variegate porphyria. Th e defective enzyme is coproporphyrinogen oxidase, encoded by a gene on chromosome 9.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyria Cutanea Tarda

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Porphyria  cutanea  tarda  is due  to  an  enzymatic  defect (decreased  hepatic  activity  of  uroporphyrinogen  decarboxylase)  transmitted  as  an  autosomal  dominant  trait.  ALA synthetase activity is unimportant in this form of porphyria,

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and drugs capable of precipitating attacks in other forms of porphyria do not provoke attacks of porphyria cutanea tarda. Likewise,  neurotoxicity  does  not  accompany  this  form  of porphyria.  Signs  and  symptoms  of  porphyria  cutanea  tarda most o ft en appear as photosensitivity reactions, especially in men older than 35 years of age. Porphyrin accumulation in the liver can be associated with hepatocellular necrosis. Anesthetic drugs are not hazardous in a ff ected patients, although the choice of drugs should take into consideration the likely presence of liver disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythropoietic Uroporphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythropoietic uroporphyria is a rare form of porphyria transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. In contrast to porphyrin synthesis in the liver, porphyrin synthesis in the erythropoietic system is responsive to changes in hematocrit and tissue oxygenation.  Hemolytic  anemia,  bone  marrow  hyperplasia, and splenomegaly are o ft en present. Infections are common, and  photosensitivity  can  be  severe.  Of  note,  the  urine  of a ff ected patients turns red when exposed to light. Neurotoxicity and abdominal pain do not occur, and administration of barbiturates does not adversely alter the course of the disease. Death usually occurs during early childhood.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythropoietic Protoporphyria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Erythropoietic  protoporphyria  is  a  more  common,  but  less debilitating,  form  of  erythropoietic  porphyria.  Signs  and symptoms include photosensitivity, vesicular cutaneous eruptions, urticaria, and edema. In occasional patients cholelithiasis develops secondary to increased excretion of protoporphyrin. Administration  of  barbiturates  does not adversely  a ff ect  the course of the disease, and survival to adulthood is common.

Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  principles  of  safe  anesthetic  management  of  patients  with porphyria include the identi fi cation of susceptible individuals and the determination of potentially porphyrinogenic drugs. Laboratory identi fi cation of porphyric individuals is not easy since many show only subtle or even no biochemical abnormalities during an asymptomatic phase. In the presence of a suggestive family history, determination of erythrocyte porphobilinogen activity is the most appropriate screening test for patients with suspected acute  intermittent  porphyria.  A  careful  family  history  should be  obtained  and  a  thorough  physical  examination  performed (although there is o ft en no clinical evidence or only subtle skin lesions), and the presence or absence of peripheral neuropathy and autonomic nervous system instability should be noted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines for drug selection include the following: (1) Th ere is evidence that a single exposure to a potent inducer can be well tolerated, but not during an acute attack. (2) Exposure to multiple potential inducers is more dangerous than exposure to any single agent. (3) Lists of "safe" and "unsafe" anesthetic drugs and adjuncts may be based on animal or cell culture experiments, so the actual clinical e ff ects of these agents may be unknown. Note that the American Porphyria Foundation maintains up-to-date information on all aspects of these diseases, and a drug database with information about drugs and acute porphyria can be found at http://www.drugs-porphyria.com.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If an acute exacerbation of porphyria is suspected during the perioperative period, particular attention must be given to skeletal muscle strength and cranial nerve function, since these symptoms and signs may predict impending respiratory failure and an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration. Cardiovascular examination may reveal systemic hypertension and tachycardia, which necessitate treatment before induction of anesthesia. Postoperative mechanical ventilation may be required during an acute porphyric crisis.  During  an  acute  exacerbation,  severe  abdominal pain may mimic a surgical abdomen. Patients experiencing an acute porphyric crisis must be assessed carefully for fl uid balance and electrolyte status, especially the presence of hyponatremia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative starvation should be minimized, but if a prolonged fast is unavoidable, administration of a glucose-saline infusion  should  be  considered,  since  caloric  restriction  has been linked to the precipitation of attacks of acute porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE PREMEDICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benzodiazepines are commonly selected for preoperative anxiolysis.  Aspiration  prophylaxis  that  includes  antacids  and/or histamine-2 receptor antagonists is  acceptable.  Interestingly, cimetidine has been recommended for treatment of acute porphyric crises since this drug may decrease heme consumption and inhibit ALA synthetase activity. Cimetidine cannot, however, prevent an acute attack of porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROPHYLACTIC THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No speci fi c  prophylactic  therapy  has  shown  proven  bene fi t. However, because carbohydrate administration can suppress porphyrin  synthesis,  administration  of  oral  carbohydrate supplements (20 g/hr) preoperatively may be recommended. If oral feedings are not possible, then infusion of 10% glucose in saline is an option.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia  has  been  implicated  in  triggering  acute  attacks of  porphyria.  However,  most  patients  with  porphyria  can be  safely  anesthetized  if  appropriate  precautions  are  taken. Patients with evidence of active porphyria or a history of acute porphyric crises are at increased risk. Short-acting anesthetic drugs are presumed to be safe because their rapid elimination limits the time of exposure for enzyme induction. However, repeated or prolonged use of these drugs, such as by continuous  intravenous  infusion,  could  result  in  a  di ff erent  clinical outcome. A number of case reports have described the successful use of intermittent propofol administration in patients with  porphyria,  but  there  are  not  enough  data  to  validate propofol administration by continuous infusion in porphyria patients. It is likely that exposure to several potential enzymeinducing drugs may be more dangerous than exposure to any one drug, so the anesthetic plan must take this into account.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
REGIONAL ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  no  absolute  contraindication  to  the  use  of  regional anesthesia in patients with porphyria. However, if a regional anesthetic  is  being  considered,  it  is  essential  to  perform  a neurologic  examination  before  initiating  the  blockade  to minimize  the  likelihood  that  worsening  of  any  preexisting neuropathy would be erroneously attributed to  the  regional anesthetic.  Autonomic nervous system blockade induced by the regional anesthetic could unmask cardiovascular instability, especially in the presence of autonomic neuropathy, hypovolemia, or both. Th ere is no evidence that any local anesthetic has ever induced an acute attack of porphyria or neurologic damage  in  porphyric  individuals.  Regional  anesthesia  has been safely used in parturient women with acute intermittent porphyria. Regional anesthesia is used very infrequently, however, in patients experiencing an attack of acute intermittent porphyria because of concerns about hemodynamic instability, mental confusion, and porphyria-related neuropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GENERAL ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e total dose of drugs administered and the length of exposure to anesthetic drugs may in fl uence the risk of triggering a porphyric crisis in vulnerable patients (see Table 15-3). Th e availability  of  relatively  short-acting  anesthetic  drugs  has likely contributed to the safety of anesthesia in the presence of porphyria. Perioperative monitoring should consider the frequent presence of autonomic dysfunction and the possibility of blood pressure lability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Propofol has been used safely for induction of anesthesia in patients with porphyria, although the use of prolonged continuous infusions of this drug is of unproven safety. Ketamine

<!-- PAGE=? -->
310

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
has been used safely in the presence of quiescent acute intermittent porphyria. Th e  use of etomidate is controversial. All barbiturates must be considered unsafe for anesthetic use even if the porphyria is in a quiescent phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nitrous oxide is well established as a safe inhaled anesthetic in patients with porphyria. Safe use of iso fl urane has also been described. Th e relatively short duration of action of sevo fl urane and des fl urane are desirable characteristics for drugs in this patient population. However, experience is too limited to make fi rm  recommendations  about  their  use.  Opioids  have been  administered  safely  to  these  patients.  Neuromuscular blocking drugs do not seem to introduce any predictable risk when administered to these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiopulmonary Bypass. In theory, cardiopulmonary bypass  is  a  potential  risk  factor  for  patients  with  porphyria because  of  the  additional  stresses  introduced  by  hypothermia, pump-induced hemolysis, blood loss and the consequent increase in heme demand by the bone marrow, and the large number of drugs that are typically administered. Interestingly, clinical  experience  does  not  support  an  increased  incidence of  porphyric crises in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT OF A PORPHYRIC CRISIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst step in treating an acute porphyric crisis is removal of any known triggering factors. Adequate hydration and carbohydrate loading are necessary, via either an enteral or a parenteral route. Sedation using a phenothiazine can be useful. Pain o ft en necessitates administration of opioids. Nausea and vomiting are treated with conventional antiemetics. β -Blockers can be administered to control tachycardia and hypertension. Since traditional anticonvulsants are regarded as unsafe, seizures may be treated with  a  benzodiazepine  or  propofol.  Electrolyte  disturbances, including hypomagnesemia, must be treated aggressively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Administration of heme (3 to 4 mg/kg IV daily for 4 days) is  indicated  a ft er  a  day  or  two  of  the  crisis  if  the  patient  is no better a ft er receiving conservative therapy. Heme may be administered  as  hematin,  heme  albumin,  or  heme  arginine. It  is  presumed that heme supplements the intracellular pool of heme and thus suppresses ALA synthetase activity. Heme arginine is more stable than hematin and lacks the potential adverse e ff ects associated with hematin (renal failure, coagulopathy,  thrombophlebitis).  Somatostatin  decreases  the  rate of  formation  of  ALA  synthetase  and,  in  combination  with plasmapheresis,  may  e ff ectively  decrease  pain  and  induce remission.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF PURINE METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gout

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism and may be classi fi ed as primary or secondary. Primary gout is due to an inherited metabolic  defect  that  leads  to  overproduction  of  uric  acid. Secondary gout is hyperuricemia resulting from an identi fi -able cause, such as administration of chemotherapeutic drugs leading to the rapid lysis of purine-containing cells. Gout is characterized  by  hyperuricemia  with  recurrent  episodes  of acute arthritis caused by deposition of urate crystals in joints. Deposition of urate crystals typically initiates an in fl ammatory response that causes pain and limited motion of the joint. At least half of the initial attacks of gout are con fi ned to the fi rst metatarsophalangeal joint, that is, the joint at the base of the great toe. Persistent hyperuricemia also results in deposition of urate crystals in extraarticular locations, manifested most o ft en  as  nephrolithiasis.  Urate  crystal  deposition  can  also occur in the myocardium, aortic valve, and extradural spinal regions. Th e  incidence  of  systemic  hypertension,  ischemic heart  disease,  and  diabetes  mellitus  is  increased  in  patients with gout.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  gout  is  designed  to  decrease  the  plasma  concentrations of uric acid by administration of uricosuric drugs (such as probenecid) or drugs that inhibit the conversion of purines  to  uric  acid  by  xanthine  oxidase  (allopurinol).  Colchicine, which lacks any e ff ect on purine metabolism, is considered  the  drug  of  choice  for  management  of  acute  gouty arthritis. It relieves joint pain presumably by modifying leukocyte migration and phagocytosis. Side e ff ects of colchicine include vomiting and diarrhea. Large doses of colchicine can also produce hepatorenal dysfunction and agranulocytosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of gout focuses on prehydration to facilitate continued renal elimination of uric acid. Administration of sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine also facilitates excretion of uric acid. Even with appropriate precautions, acute attacks of gout o ft en follow surgical procedures in patients with a history of gout.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extraarticular  manifestations  of  gout  and  side  e ff ects  of drugs used to control the disease deserve consideration when formulating the plan for anesthesia management. Renal function is evaluated, since clinical manifestations of gout usually increase  with  deteriorating  renal  function.  Abnormalities detected on the electrocardiogram could re fl ect urate deposits  in  the  myocardium. Th e  increased  incidence  of  systemic hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus in patients with gout must be considered. Although rare, adverse renal  and  hepatic  e ff ects  may  be  associated  with  the  use  of probenecid and colchicine. Limited temporomandibular joint motion from gouty arthritis, if present, can make direct laryngoscopy di ffi cult.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a genetically determined disorder of  purine  metabolism  that  occurs  exclusively  in  males.  Biochemically, the defect is characterized by decreased or absent

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
activity  of  hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, which leads to excessive purine production and increased uric acid concentrations throughout the body. Clinically, patients are  o ft en  mentally  retarded  and  exhibit  characteristic  spasticity  and  self-mutilation.  Self-mutilation  usually  involves trauma to perioral tissues, and subsequent scari fi cation may caused di ffi culties with direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation.  Seizure  disorders  associated  with  this  syndrome  are o ft en treated with benzodiazepines. Athetoid dysphagia may increase the likelihood of aspiration if vomiting occurs. Malnutrition  is  o ft en  present.  Hyperuricemia  is  associated  with nephropathy, urinary tract calculi, and arthritis. Death is o ft en due to renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  is  in fl uenced  by  co-existing renal dysfunction and possible impaired metabolism of drugs administered  during  anesthesia. Th e  presence  of  a  spastic skeletal  muscle  disorder  suggests  caution  in  using  succinylcholine. Th e  sympathetic  nervous  system  response  to  stress is enhanced, which requires caution in the administration of exogenous catecholamines to these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of carbohydrate metabolism typically re fl ect genetically determined enzyme defects (Table 15-4). Th e defect can result in a de fi ciency or an excess of a precursor or end product of metabolism that is normally involved in the production of glycogen from glucose. In some instances, an alternate metabolic pathway is used. Ultimately, the signs and symptoms of a speci fi c disorder of carbohydrate metabolism are a re fl ection of  the  e ff ects  produced by alterations in the amount of precursors  or  end  products  of  metabolism  that  result  from  the enzyme defects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1a

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycogen storage disease type 1a (von Gierke's disease) is due to  absent  or  insu ffi cient  amounts  of  the  enzyme  glucose-6phosphatase.  As  a  result,  glycogen  cannot  be  hydrolyzed  in hepatocytes, neutrophils, and possibly other cells, which leads to its intracellular accumulation. Hypoglycemia can be severe, and oral feedings are required every 2 to 3 hours to maintain acceptable  blood  glucose  concentrations.  Chronic  metabolic acidosis is present and may lead to osteoporosis. Mental retardation, growth retardation, and seizures resulting from hypoglycemia are likely. Hepatomegaly results from accumulation of glycogen in the liver. Renal enlargement, also caused by accumulation of glycogen, can manifest as chronic pyelonephritis. A hemorrhagic diathesis may be due to platelet dysfunction, and recurrent epistaxis and bleeding a ft er minor trauma and surgery may occur. Facial and truncal obesity is present. Survival beyond 2 years of age is unusual, although surgical creation of a portocaval shunt may bene fi t some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia must include provision of exogenous  glucose  to  prevent  intraoperative  hypoglycemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring of the arterial pH and blood glucose concentration is helpful, because these patients o ft en become acidotic because of an inability to convert lactic acid to glycogen. Lactate-containing solutions for intravenous infusion are also avoided to minimize the theoretical possibility of metabolic acidosis because of lactate administration during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycogen Storage Disease Type 1b

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glycogen storage disease type 1b is a rare autosomal recessive disease in which glucose-6-phosphate, a product of metabolic cleavage of glycogen, cannot be transported to the inner surface of microsomes because of a de fi ciency in its transport system. Th us, this disease is a variant of glycogen storage disease type 1a. In glycogen storage disease type 1b, glycogen accumulates in the liver, kidneys, and intestinal mucosa, and glucose availability  to  tissues  is  impaired.  Hypoglycemia  and  lactic acidosis ensue. Clinical signs and symptoms resemble those described  for  glycogen  storage  disease  type  1a.  In  addition, patients with type 1b experience recurrent infections resulting from impaired neutrophil activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If  surgery  is  planned,  preoperative  fasting  is  minimized, and  glucose-containing  infusions  are  administered  intravenously throughout the perioperative period. Strict asepsis is important.  Preoperative  normalization  of  the  blood  glucose concentration  may  improve  platelet  function  and  decrease the likelihood of intraoperative bleeding. Intraoperative monitoring of blood glucose concentration is recommended, since hypoglycemia may be profound and di ffi cult to recognize during general anesthesia. Lactic acidosis develops as a result of the incomplete conversion of glycogen. For this reason, monitoring of arterial pH is helpful. Administration of lactate-containing solutions is not recommended. Iatrogenic hyperventilation and its associated respiratory alkalosis may stimulate the release of lactate from skeletal muscles and aggravate  metabolic  acidosis.  Treatment  of  signi fi cant  metabolic acidosis might include administration of sodium bicarbonate.

DISORDERS OF AMINO ACID METABOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although there are more than 70 known disorders of amino acid  metabolism,  most  are  extremely  rare.  Classic  manifestations  include  mental  retardation,  seizures,  and  aminoaciduria  (Table  15-5).  In  addition,  metabolic  acidosis,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
hyperammonemia, hepatic failure, and thromboembolism can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  disorders  of amino  acid  metabolism  is  directed  toward  maintenance  of intravascular fl uid  volume  and  acid-base  homeostasis.  Use of  anesthetics  that  could  evoke  seizure  activity  should  be avoided, since these patients are likely to have seizure disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phenylketonuria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Phenylketonuria is the prototype of disorders attributable to abnormal  amino  acid  metabolism.  Phenylalanine  accumulates  as  a  result  of  an  enzymatic de fi ciency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Clinical features include mental retardation and seizures. Th e  skin  may  be  friable  and  vulnerable  to  damage from pressure or friction created by adhesive materials. Also, these patients are likely to have associated vitamin B 12 de fi -ciency, especially with their strict die. If this is the case and the patient has B 12 de fi ciency resulting from a lack of supplementary vitamin treatment, nitrous oxide should probably be avoided. Th ese patients may also be more sensitive to narcotics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Homocystinuria

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Homocystinuria is due to failure of transsulfuration of precursors of cystine, an important constituent of cross-linkages in collagen.  Manifestations  of  the  disease  caused  by  increased blood and urine concentrations of homocystine re fl ect weakened collagen and include dislocation of the lens, osteoporosis,  a  marfanoid habitus, kyphoscoliosis, brittle light-colored hair, malar fl ush, and vascular disease in the coronary, cerebral, and renal arteries. Complications arising from this vascular disease are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality early in life. Mental retardation may also be a prominent fi nding. Th e  diagnosis  of  homocystinuria  is  con fi rmed by demonstrating homocystine in the urine. Plasma homocystine acts as an atherogenic and thrombophilic agent. Th romboembolism can be life threatening and is presumed to re fl ect activation of Hageman factor by homocystine, which results in increased platelet adhesiveness. Measures to minimize the risk of thromboembolism during the perioperative period should include  administration  of  pyridoxine  or  betaine,  both  of which decrease homocystine concentrations and thus platelet adhesiveness. Preoperative hydration, infusion of dextran, and early ambulation may also help prevent deep vein thrombosis.

Maple Syrup Urine Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maple syrup urine disease is a rare inborn error of metabolism  that  results  from  defective  carboxylation  of  branchedchain amino acids. In the absence of adequate enzyme activity, consumption  of  foods  containing  branched-chain  amino acids results in the accumulation of these amino acids as well as  ketoacids  in  tissues  and  blood.  Excess  concentrations  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
leucine are usually higher than those of isoleucine or valine since leucine is the predominant amino acid in most proteins. Th e presence of these amino acids in the urine gives it a maple syrup odor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Growth  retardation and delayed  psychomotor  development are o ft en a consequence of this chronic metabolic imbalance. Infection or fasting commonly results in acute metabolic decompensation, with increased plasma levels of branched-chain amino  acids  and  ketoacids  resulting  from  the  breakdown  of endogenous proteins. Increased plasma levels of ketoacids contributes to the production of metabolic acidosis. Hypoglycemia is  a  possibility and presumably re fl ects the ability of increased plasma leucine concentrations to stimulate release of insulin. A potentially fatal encephalopathy may accompany this disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  is  directed  at  decreasing  the  plasma  levels  of branched-chain  amino  acids  and  ketoacids  with  peritoneal dialysis  or  hemodialysis.  Parenteral  nutrition  using  preparations  devoid  of  branched-chain  amino  acids  may  also  be e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery and anesthesia introduce a number of hazards in the perioperative management of patients with maple syrup urine disease. For example, catabolism of body proteins produced by surgery or infection can result in increased blood concentrations of branched-chain amino acids. Even blood in the gastrointestinal tract, as can occur following tonsillectomy, produces  an  added  metabolic  load  in  patients  with  maple syrup urine disease. Accumulation of branched-chain amino acids in the circulation can produce neurologic deterioration during the perioperative period. Th e danger of hypoglycemia in a ff ected patients is exacerbated by the period of fasting that precedes elective surgery. Th erefore, it is useful to initiate an intravenous infusion of glucose-containing solution intraoperatively. Measurement of arterial pH is helpful for detecting metabolic acidosis caused by accumulation of ketoacids.

Methylmalonyl-Coenzyme A Mutase Deficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase de fi ciency  is  an  inborn error  of  metabolism  that  can  result  in  methylmalonicacidemia. Acute treatment includes intravenous administration of crystalloid solution containing bicarbonate. Events during the perioperative period that increase protein catabolism (fasting, bleeding into the gastrointestinal tract, stress, tissue destruction) may predispose to acidosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Experience with anesthesia in patients with this disorder is  limited,  and  recommendations  are  based  more  on  theory than on clinical experience. For example, nitrous oxide may be avoided based on the theoretic concern that this inhaled anesthetic could predispose to methylmalonicacidemia in susceptible patients, because of nitrous oxide-induced inhibition of cobalamin coenzymes. Th e impact of preoperative fasting on amino acid metabolism and intravascular fl uid volume is lessened by permitting ingestion of clear fl uid up to 2 hours before surgery. Generous administration of intravenous fl uids and glucose  is  also  helpful  in  minimizing  hypovolemia  and protein catabolism.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute  attacks  of  porphyria  are  characterized  by  severe abdominal  pain,  autonomic  nervous  system  instability, electrolyte  disturbances,  and  neuropsychiatric  manifestations. Th ese  can  range  from  mild  disturbances  to  lifethreatening events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Skeletal muscle weakness that may progress to quadriparesis  and  respiratory  failure  is  the  potentially  most  lethal neurologic manifestation of an acute attack of porphyria. Seizures may also occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Because  carbohydrate  administration  can  suppress  porphyrin synthesis, carbohydrate supplementation preoperatively may be recommended to reduce the risk of an attack of acute porphyria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In  a  patient  with  phenylketonuria  and  vitamin  B 12 de fi -ciency, nitrous oxide should probably be avoided.
