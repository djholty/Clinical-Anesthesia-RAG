Key Points

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  in  the  United States, superseded only by heart disease. Th e lifetime risk of developing cancer is estimated to be one in two for men and one in three for women. Th e lifetime risk of dying from cancer is one in four for men and one in fi ve for women. About 90% of patients with cancer require surgery for reasons both related and unrelated to the cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, approximately 65% of patients diagnosed with cancer survive for at least 5 years, which means that a growing number of patients will come to surgery a ft er successful cancer treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e anesthetic implications of cancer stem not only from the cancer itself, but also from the therapies employed for its treatment.  In  addition,  since  the  median  age  at  diagnosis  is 65 years, patients with cancer o ft en have comorbid conditions that a ff ect their perioperative course.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MECHANISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer results from an accumulation of genetic mutations that causes dysregulation of cellular proliferation. Genes are involved in  carcinogenesis by virtue of inherited traits that predispose to cancer (e.g., altered metabolism of potentially carcinogenic compounds), mutation of a normal gene into an oncogene that promotes the conversion of normal cells into cancer cells, or inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene, which triggers malignant transformation. A critical gene related to cancer in humans is the tumor suppressor p53. Th is gene is not only essential for cell viability, but critical for monitoring damage to DNA. Inactivation of p53 is an early step in the development of many types of  cancer.  Stimulation of oncogene formation by carcinogens (tobacco, alcohol, sunlight) is estimated to be responsible for 80% of cancers in the United States. Tobacco accounts for more cases of cancer than all other known carcinogens combined.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fundamental event that causes cells to become malignant is an alteration in their DNA structure. Th ese mutations occur in cells of target tissues, and these cells then become ancestors of the entire future tumor cell population. Evolution to more undi ff erentiated cells re fl ects high mutation rates and contributes to the development of tumors that are resistant to therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer  cells  must  evade  the  host's  immune  surveillance system, which is designed to seek out and destroy tumor cells. Most mutant cancer cells stimulate the host's immune system to form antibodies. Th is protective role of the immune system is  apparent  in  those  with  acquired  immunode fi ciency  syndrome and recipients of organ transplants who are maintained on long-term immunosuppressive drugs. Th ese groups have a higher incidence of cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most  cancers  produce  solid  tumors.  Cancer  o ft en  becomes clinically evident when tumor bulk compromises vital organ function. Th e  initial  diagnosis  is  frequently  made by aspiration cytology or biopsy. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize antigens for speci fi c cancers may aid in the diagnosis of cancer. A commonly used staging system for solid tumors is the TNM system based on tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastases (M). Th is system groups cancers into stages  ranging  from  I  (best  prognosis)  to  IV  (poorest  prognosis). Tumor invasiveness is related to the release of various tumor mediators that modify the surrounding microenvironment in such a way as to permit cancer cells to spread along the lines of least resistance. Lymphatics lack a basement membrane, so local spread of cancer is in fl uenced by the anatomy of the regional lymphatics. For example, regional lymph node involvement occurs late in squamous cell cancer of the vocal cords because these structures have few lymphatics, whereas regional lymph node involvement is an early manifestation of supraglottic cancer because this region is rich in lymphatics. Imaging  techniques  including  computed  tomography  (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used for further delineation of tumor presence and spread.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most cancers are treated by a multimodal approach involving surgery,  radiation  therapy,  and/or  chemotherapies  that  vary by tumor type and stage. Th e development of more e ff ective cancer treatments has dramatically improved survival. However, use of these more powerful therapies is associated with toxicities and adverse e ff ects that have the potential to a ff ect nearly every organ system. Some of these e ff ects are transient; others produce permanent sequelae. All of them have important potential consequences in the perioperative care of cancer patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditional Chemotherapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Traditional chemotherapy involves the use of cytotoxic agents that target rapidly dividing cells and interfere with replication. Th ey are divided into classes based on mechanism of action: alkylating  agents,  antimetabolites,  antibiotics,  microtubule assembly  inhibitors,  hormonal  agents,  and  various  miscellaneous  or  mixed-mechanism  drugs. Alkylating  agents form reactive  molecules  that  cause  DNA  cross-linking  problems such as abnormal base pairing and strand breaks that interfere primarily with DNA but also with RNA and protein synthesis and replication. Antimetabolites are structural analogues of folic acid, purines, or pyrimidines that block enzymes necessary  for  nucleic  acid  and  protein  synthesis. Antitumor  antibiotics form complexes with DNA or RNA that inhibit their subsequent synthesis. Microtubule assembly inhibitors include the  vinca  alkaloids  and  taxanes,  both  of  which  act  on  the mitotic process by interfering with microtubule assembly or disassembly. Th e growth of certain tumor types, notably breast and prostate, is responsive to hormonal agents. Hormones are not cytotoxic, so they o ft en stimulate tumor regression but do not cause cell death. Several other drugs have been shown to have  anticancer  properties. Th e  epipodophyllotoxins  act  by inhibiting the topoisomerase II enzyme, which causes DNA strand breaks that lead to apoptotic cell death. Th e topoisomerase I inhibitors work by a similar mechanism but on a different enzyme.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Targeted Chemotherapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Targeted chemotherapy utilizes a new set of chemotherapeutic agents  directed  against  speci fi c  processes  involved  in  tumor cell proliferation and migration. Th e fi rst targeted therapy was that developed for estrogen receptors present in certain types of  breast  cancers.  Binding  of  estrogen  to  estrogen  receptors is  an important step in the growth of these tumor cells, and estrogen receptor blockade turned out to be an e ff ective way to reduce tumor spread.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other  targeted  therapies  have  been  developed  against  a number of cell processes, including secretion of growth factors that facilitate gene expression, angiogenesis (creation of new blood vessels), cell migration, and tumor growth. Growth factors  such  as  endothelial  growth  factor  (EGF),  vascular

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 23 CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
495

<!-- PAGE=? -->
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinases are involved in growth and di ff erentiation of normal cells, but they are usually overexpressed or mutated on cancer cells. Binding of growth factors to receptors on the cell membrane induces  a  cascade  of  signal  transduction  events  that  o ft en involve activation of the enzyme tyrosine kinase. Absence of these  signals  may  lead  to  apoptosis.  Drugs  have  now  been developed that block these growth factors, their receptors, or their associated tyrosine kinases. Included among the targeted therapies are monoclonal antibodies that act on extracellular receptors such as EGF and VEGF, as well as small molecules that  penetrate  cell  membranes  and  block  intracellular  signaling pathways. Cancer cells have the ability to mutate and develop resistance to targeted therapies, so targeted therapies are o ft en used in conjunction with other drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
damage to surrounding tissue. Radiation can be administered through external beam technology or through radioactive pellets implanted into a target organ (e.g., radioactive "seeds" for treatment of prostate cancer). Technologic advances such as three-dimensional imaging and conformal radiotherapy that allow  radiation  energy  to  be  matched  to  tumor  shape  have helped minimize damage to surrounding tissue.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adverse Effects of Cancer Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bone  marrow  suppression,  cardiovascular  and  pulmonary toxicity,  and  central  and  peripheral  nervous  system  damage are  among  the  most  serious  adverse  e ff ects  of  cancer  treatment.  However,  dysfunction  of  nearly  every  organ  system has been described. Th e following sections present a systemspeci fi c review of toxicities related to cancer treatment. Tables 23-1 and 23-2 summarize the adverse e ff ects of selected chemotherapies and radiation treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation  induces  cell  death  by  causing  damage  to  DNA. Th e sensitivity of a cell to radiation injury is in fl uenced by its phase in the cell cycle and its ability to repair DNA damage. For  the  treatment  of  cancer,  radiation  timing  and  delivery are  adjusted  to  maximize  therapeutic  bene fi t  and  minimize

CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

Anthracyclines  like  doxorubicin  (Adriamycin)  and  idarubicin  are  the  chemotherapeutic  drugs  most  o ft en  associated with cardiotoxicity. Th ese drugs are commonly used to treat

<!-- PAGE=? -->
cancers  such  as  leukemias  and  lymphomas.  Anthracyclines impair  myocyte  function  via  the  formation  of  free  radicals, which interfere with mitochondrial activation and cause lipid peroxidation. Cardiotoxicity may be acute or chronic. Acute toxicity begins early in treatment with the development of dysrhythmias,  QT  prolongation,  and  cardiomyopathy  and  then reverses with discontinuation of therapy. Chronic toxicity (le ft ventricular dysfunction and cardiomyopathy) can occur in an early-onset form that usually appears within 1 year of treatment and a late-onset form that can emerge several years or decades a ft er completion of therapy. Risks factors for cardiotoxicity include a large cumulative dose of drug (for doxorubicin, >300 mg/m 2 ), a history of high-dose bolus administration, and a history of concomitant radiation therapy or use of other cardiotoxic drugs. Th e cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin may be decreased by the use of free radical scavengers such as dexrazoxane or liposomal preparations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitoxantrone, which is structurally similar to the anthracyclines, has also been associated with cardiomyopathy, as have other  drugs  including  cyclophosphamide,  clofarabine,  and certain of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Baseline echocardiography  is  recommended  for  all  patients  before  anthracycline treatment.  Periodic  echocardiography  is  advised  in  patients receiving high-dose therapy and those with underlying cardiac impairment or signi fi cant risk factors for heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pericarditis, angina, coronary artery vasospasm, ischemiarelated electrocardiographic changes, and conduction defects  are  other  cardiac  complications  related  to  cancer chemotherapy.  Fluorouracil  and  capecitabine  cause  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
highest  incidence  of  chemotherapy-related  ischemia.  Estimates vary widely from 1% to 68% for fl uorouracil and from 3% to 9% for capecitabine. Paclitaxel and thalidomide can cause  severe  bradycardia  requiring  pacemaker  implantation. Arsenic, lapatinib, and nilotinib frequently cause QT prolongation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertension has emerged as a relatively common adverse e ff ect  of  treatment  with  newer  targeted  chemotherapeutic drugs such as bevacizumab, trastuzumab, sorafenib, and sunitinib, and occurs in as many as 35% to 45% of patients. Th e pathophysiology of the cardiac damage associated with these drugs  is  probably  directly  related  to  inhibition  of  EGF  and VEGF. Although important to tumor cell proliferation, these growth  factors  also  play  a  role  in  normal  myocyte  growth, repair, and adaptation to pressure loads.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who receive radiation to the mediastinum are at risk for developing myocardial fi brosis, pericarditis, valvular fi brosis,  conduction  abnormalities,  and  accelerated  development  of  coronary  artery  disease.  Incidence  is  related  to cumulative radiation exposure as well as concomitant administration of cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary  toxicity  is  a  well-recognized  complication  of bleomycin therapy. Other agents associated with pulmonary damage  include  busulfan,  cyclophosphamide,  methotrexate, lomustine,  carmustine,  mitomycin,  and  the  vinca  alkaloids. Th e mechanism of injury di ff ers for each drug. In the case of bleomycin, free radical formation seems to be a factor. EGF receptor blockade is the postulated mechanism reported with erlotinib and ge fi tinib, both of which are EGF receptor blockers.  Type  II  pneumocytes possess EGF receptors that play a role in alveolar repair.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumonitis  or  bronchiolitis  obliterans  with  organizing pneumonia occurs in 3% to 20% of patients treated with bleomycin,  depending  on  dose.  Pulmonary fi brosis  can  develop decades a ft er treatment. Risk factors include preexisting lung disease, smoking, and radiation exposure. Baseline and serial pulmonary function testing and chest radiography are o ft en performed.  Of  note,  evidence  suggests  that  intraoperative exposure  to  high  concentrations  of  oxygen  may  exacerbate preexisting  bleomycin-induced  lung  injury  and  contribute to  postoperative ventilatory failure. Perioperative corticosteroid administration may be of bene fi t in treating bleomycininduced pneumonitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fi brosis are complications of radiation to the thorax or total body irradiation. Symptoms typically  begin  within  the fi rst  2  to  3  months  of treatment and generally regress within 12 months of treatment completion.  However,  subclinical  abnormalities  revealed  by pulmonary  function  testing  reportedly  occur  in  up  to  50% of  patients  exposed  to  radiation  for  treatment  of  childhood cancers. Radiation recall pneumonitis is  a  recognized clinical syndrome  in  which  patients  with  prior  radiation  exposure manifest symptomatic pneumonitis a ft er exposure to a second pulmonary toxin.

RENAL SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many  of  the  chemotherapeutic  agents  can  be  nephrotoxic; among  the  most  commonly  cited  are  cisplatin,  high-dose methotrexate, and ifosfamide. Renal insu ffi ciency and hypomagnesemia  are  the  typical  presenting  signs  of  cisplatinrelated  nephrotoxicity.  Ifosfamide  usually  causes  proximal tubule  dysfunction  marked  by  proteinuria  and  glucosuria. Leucovorin, a folic acid precursor, can be helpful in treating methotrexate-related renal failure. Renal insu ffi ciency usually resolves with cessation of treatment and supportive therapy. Prehydration and avoidance of other nephrotoxins limit the risk of renal toxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyclophosphamide is o ft en associated with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) via a direct e ff ect on renal tubules, but this condition is usually benign. Th e most serious adverse e ff ect of cyclophosphamide is  hemorrhagic  cystitis,  which  can  cause  hematuria  severe enough to produce obstructive uropathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  chemotherapy  or  high-dose  radiation  therapy can  induce  tumor  cell  lysis  that  causes  the  release  of  large amounts of uric acid, phosphate, and potassium. Hyperuricemia can cause uric acid crystals to precipitate in renal tubules, which leads to acute renal failure. Calcium phosphate deposition may exacerbate the condition. Radiation exposure can cause glomerulonephritis or glomerulosclerosis with permanent  injury  marked  by  chronic  renal  insu ffi ciency  and  systemic hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEPATIC SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antimetabolites such as methotrexate, as well as asparaginase, arabinoside,  plicamycin,  and  streptozocin,  have  been  associated  with  acute  liver  dysfunction.  However,  chronic  liver disease is uncommon. Radiation-induced liver injury is also typically dose dependent and reversible.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  severe  form  of  liver  dysfunction  in  cancer patients  is sinusoidal  obstruction  syndrome. Th is  usually occurs in patients receiving total body irradiation in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; however, several chemotherapeutic agents have also been associated with this syndrome, including busulfan, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,  and  dactinomycin.  Mortality  ranges  from  19% to 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AIRWAY AND ORAL CAVITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mucositis  is  a  painful  in fl ammation  and  ulceration  of  the mucous membranes of the digestive tract. Oral lesions begin as  mucosal whitening followed by the development of erythema  and  tissue  friability.  Oral  mucositis  is  a  relatively common  adverse  e ff ect  of  high-dose  chemotherapy  and radiation to the head and neck. Mucositis can also occur in the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Chemotherapeutic drugs associated with mucositis include the anthracyclines,  taxanes,  and  platinum-based  compounds, as well as antimetabolites such as methotrexate and fl uorouracil. Mucositis associated with chemotherapy o ft en begins during the fi rst week of treatment and typically resolves a ft er treatment  is  terminated.  Mucositis  associated  with  radiation therapy usually has a more delayed onset. Patients with mucositis are at risk of infection from spread of oral bacteria. Narcotics are frequently required to achieve adequate analgesia. In its most severe form, pseudomembrane formation, edema, and bleeding may cause airway compromise or risk of aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation to  the  head  and  neck  can  result  in  permanent tissue fi brosis  that  may  limit  mouth  opening  and  neck  and tongue  mobility.  Airway fi brosis  and  tracheal  stenosis  may result in di ffi culty in ventilation and intubation that is not recognized on physical examination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost  all  chemotherapy  and  radiation  therapy  produce gastrointestinal  adverse  e ff ects.  Nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea, and  enteritis  are  common.  Diarrhea  is  frequent  with fl uorouracil,  melphalan,  anthracyclines,  and  the  topoisomerase inhibitors.  In  the  short  term,  these  symptoms  can  produce dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, and malnutrition, but these  e ff ects  are  usually  transient.  Radiation,  however,  may produce permanent sequelae such as adhesions and stenotic lesions  anywhere  along  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is a unique complication associated with asparaginase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ENDOCRINE SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hyperglycemia  is  a  common  adverse  e ff ect  of  glucocorticoid therapy, as is suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which may become evident during stress or surgery. Adrenal suppression is reversible, but it may take up to a year for adrenal function to return to normal. SIADH can be seen with cyclophosphamide,  ifosfamide,  cisplatin,  and  melphalan,  although symptomatic hyponatremia is uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Total body irradiation in the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and radiation therapy for head and neck cancers  can  cause  panhypopituitarism  and/or  hypothyroidism,  which  typically  becomes  symptomatic  during  the fi rst few years following treatment. Patients with a history of radiation exposure to the neck are also at increased risk of thyroid cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMATOLOGIC SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myelosuppression is the most frequent adverse e ff ect associated with chemotherapy. In most cases, this e ff ect is transient, and blood cell counts return to normal within a week following therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bleeding is relatively common in patients on chemotherapy and  may  be  the  result  of  thrombocytopenia  and/or  platelet dysfunction. Depletion of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors  contributes  to  this  problem.  Bleeding  has  also  been associated  with  the  angiogenesis  inhibitor  bevacizumab  as well  as  several  of  the  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors,  particularly when used in conjunction with other drugs. For this reason, it has been recommended that bevacizumab therapy be withheld before major surgery.

Tumors release procoagulants such as tissue factor that create a hypercoagulable state. Some chemotherapeutic drugs can exacerbate this condition. Th alidomide and the related drug lenalidomide pose an especially high risk of venous thromboembolism,  particularly  when  used  in  combination  with glucocorticoids and doxorubicin. Other drugs associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism include cisplatin and tamoxifen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation-induced coagulation disorders occur as a delayed e ff ect  and  involve  coagulation necrosis of vascular endothelium.  Postradiation  bleeding  in  the  rectum,  vagina,  bladder, lung, and brain have been reported.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NERVOUS SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chemotherapy  can  cause  a  number  of  neurotoxic  adverse e ff ects,  including  peripheral  neuropathy  and  encephalopathy. Virtually  all  patients  treated  with  vincristine  develop  paresthesias  in  their  hands  and  feet.  Autonomic  neuropathy  may accompany the paresthesias. Th ese changes are usually reversible. Cisplatin causes dose-dependent large fi ber neuropathy by damaging dorsal root ganglia. Loss of proprioception may be su ffi ciently severe to interfere with ambulation. Consideration of  regional  anesthesia in patients being treated with cisplatin must take into account the fact that subclinical neurotoxicity is present in a large percentage of these patients and cisplatin neurotoxicity may extend several months beyond discontinuation  of  treatment.  Paclitaxel  causes  dose-dependent  ataxia that  may  be  accompanied  by  paresthesias  in  the  hands  and feet  and  proximal  skeletal  muscle  weakness.  Corticosteroids (prednisone or its equivalent at 60 to 100 mg/day) may cause a myopathy characterized by weakness of the neck fl exors and proximal weakness of the extremities. Th e fi rst sign of corticosteroid-induced neuromuscular toxicity is di ffi culty rising from the sitting position. Respiratory muscles may also be a ff ected. Corticosteroid-induced  myopathy  usually  resolves  when  the drug is discontinued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer chemotherapeutic drugs can cause encephalopathy, delirium, and/or cerebellar ataxia. Examples include high-dose cyclophosphamide and methotrexate. Prolonged administration of methotrexate, especially in conjunction with radiation therapy, can lead to progressive irreversible dementia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumor Lysis Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumor  lysis  syndrome  is  caused  by  sudden  destruction  of tumor  cells  by  chemotherapy  or  radiation,  leading  to  the release  of  large  amounts  of  uric  acid,  potassium,  and  phosphate. Th is syndrome occurs most o ft en a ft er induction treatment for hematologic neoplasms, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Acute renal failure can develop because of uric acid crystal formation and/or calcium phosphate deposition in the kidney.  Hyperkalemia  and  cardiac  dysrhythmias  are  more likely in the presence of renal dysfunction. Hyperphosphatemia can lead to secondary hypocalcemia, which increases the risk of cardiac dysrhythmias from hypokalemia and can cause neuromuscular symptoms such as tetany.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CANCER IMMUNOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of monoclonal antibodies to detect proteins encoded by  oncogenes  or  other  types  of  tumor-associated  antigens (TAs)  is  a  common  method  for  identifying  cancer.  TAs ( α -fetoprotein,  prostate-speci fi c  antigen,  carcinoembryonic antigen) are present on cancer cells and normal cells, but concentrations are higher on tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies to various TAs can be labeled with radioisotopes and injected to monitor the spread of cancer. Because TAs are present on normal  tissues,  measurement  of  these  antigens  may  be  less useful for the diagnosis of cancer than for monitoring disease in patients with known malignancies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immunomodulators

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumor  cells  are  antigenically  di ff erent  from  normal  cells, and  evidence  now  con fi rms that  the  body  is  able  to  mount an immune response against TAs in a process similar to that which causes allogra ft rejection.  However,  because  TAs  also exist  on  normal  cells,  they  are  only  weakly  antigenic.  Adjuvants  are  compounds  that  potentiate  the  immune  response. Examples include bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and naturally occurring interferons such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferonα (INFα ),  and  granulocyte-macrophage  colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF). Th ese agents are used to augment the host's intrinsic anticancer capabilities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer Vaccines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appreciation of the role of TAs in eliciting an immune response is now driving the development of cancer vaccines. Two types of cancer vaccines exist: preventive and therapeutic. Th e preventive vaccines target infectious agents know to contribute to cancer development. Two preventive vaccines are currently marketed, one against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18 and another against hepatitis B virus (HBV). HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers and are also a causal factor in some cancers of the vagina, vulva, anus, penis, and oropharynx. Chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. HBV vaccination is now recommended in childhood as part of a strategy to reduce not only the risk of HBV infection but also the incidence of hepatocellular cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  premise  behind  therapeutic  cancer  vaccines  is  that injection  of  tumor  antigen  can  be  used  to  stimulate  an immune system response against tumor cells. In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the fi rst therapeutic cancer vaccine, sipuleucel-T (Provenge) for the treatment of some cases of  metastatic  prostate  cancer.  Sipuleucel-T  is  an autologous vaccine produced by isolating antigen-presenting cells  from the patient's own immune system, then culturing them with a protein consisting of prostatic acid phosphatase linked to GM-CSF. Treatment elicits an immune response that has shown e ffi cacy in reducing tumor progression. Vaccines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
are  in  development for a number of other cancers. Some of these are made from weakened or killed cancer cells that contain TAs, others from immune cells that have been modi fi ed to  express  TAs.  Still  others  are  being  made  synthetically.  A novel type of cancer vaccine uses "naked" DNA or RNA that codes for TAs. Injection of the vaccine either directly or via a virus carrier induces massive TA production, which in turn promotes a robust immune response that is intended to halt tumor progression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PARANEOPLASTIC SYNDROMES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic syndromes are pathophysiologic disturbances that a ff ect an estimated 8% of patients with cancer. Sometimes, symptoms of a paraneoplastic syndrome manifest before the cancer diagnosis and may actually result in cancer detection. Certain of these conditions (superior vena cava obstruction, increased intracranial pressure) may manifest as life-threatening medical emergencies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fever and Cachexia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fever may occur with any type of cancer but is particularly likely  with  metastases  to  the  liver.  Increased  body  temperature  may  accompany  rapidly  proliferating  tumors  such  as leukemias and lymphomas. Fever may re fl ect tumor necrosis, in fl ammation, the release of toxic products by cancer cells, or the production of endogenous pyrogens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer cachexia is a frequent occurrence in cancer patients. In  addition  to  the  psychologic  e ff ects  of  cancer  on  appetite, cancer  cells  compete  with  normal  tissues  for  nutrients  and may eventually cause nutritive death of normal cells. Tumor factors such as proteolysis-inducing factor and host response factors such as tumor necrosis factorα , IFNγ , and IL-6 also contribute  to  muscle  atrophy  and  lipolysis.  Hyperalimentation is indicated for nutritional support when malnutrition is severe, especially if surgery is planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes are the result of antibody-mediated damage to the nervous system. Antibodies produced by the host in response to TAs cross-react with elements  of  the  nervous  system,  which  leads  to  neurologic dysfunction. Th e  vast  majority  of  paraneoplastic  neurologic syndromes  (80%)  manifest before the  diagnosis  of  cancer. Th ey can a ff ect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Th ey are relatively rare-occurring in about 1% of cancer  patients-but  are  seen  disproportionately  in  those  with small cell lung cancer, lymphoma, and myeloma. Examples are limbic  encephalitis,  paraneoplastic  cerebellar  degeneration, Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is caused by antibodies to voltagegated calcium channel receptors and is commonly associated with  small  cell  lung  cancer.  Myasthenia  gravis  is  caused  by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor and is o ft en present in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
patients with thymoma. Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents may be observed in these myasthenic disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ese paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes o ft en present a diagnostic challenge because symptoms are nonspeci fi c and the underlying cancer diagnosis is usually unknown. Antibodies to tumor-associated material (called onconeural antibodies ) are present in the serum of some but not all patients. Immunosuppression is the mainstay of treatment of these syndromes. Corticosteroids and immunoglobulin therapies are frequently employed. Plasmapheresis may also be required to reduce the antibody burden. Once the condition is diagnosed, screening for an underlying malignancy is indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrine Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic  endocrine  syndromes  arise  from  hormone or peptide production within tumor cells (Table 23-3). Most occur a ft er the diagnosis of cancer has been established. Treatment of the underlying tumor is the preferred management.

SIADH a ff ects  approximately 1% to 2% of cancer patients, with most cases related to small cell lung cancer. Headache

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
and nausea are early symptoms that may progress to confusion, ataxia, lethargy, and seizures. Symptoms depend on the degree of hyponatremia and the rapidity with which it develops. SIADH resolves with treatment of the underlying tumor. Vasopressin receptor antagonists and demeclocycline are  the  pharmacologic  therapies  available  if  symptoms  are severe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HYPERCALCEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients and is considered a poor prognostic indicator. Th ere  are  several  di ff erent  mechanisms  for  the  hypercalcemia seen in cancer patients. Th e  most common is secretion of a parathyroid hormone-related protein by tumor cells that binds to parathyroid hormone receptors in the bone and kidney. Th is type occurs commonly with squamous cell cancers of  the  kidneys,  lungs,  pancreas,  and  ovaries.  Hypercalcemia can also be caused by local osteolytic activity associated with bone  metastases,  especially  from  breast  cancer,  multiple myeloma, and some lymphomas. Occasionally, tumors secrete vitamin D.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  rapid  onset  of  hypercalcemia  that  occurs  in  patients with cancer may present as lethargy or coma. Polyuria accompanies hypercalcemia and may lead to dehydration. Treatment includes hydration with normal saline. Intravenous bisphosphonates or calcitonin may also be indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CUSHING'S SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cushing's  syndrome  is  most  commonly  associated  with neuroendocrine tumors of the lung such as small cell lung cancer  and  carcinoid.  It  is  caused  by  tumor  secretion  of either  adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH)  or  corticotropin-releasing  factor  (CRF).  Clinical  symptoms  include hypertension, weight gain, central obesity, and edema. Th e diagnosis can be con fi rmed by measuring serum concentrations of ACTH or CRF and by performing a dexamethasone suppression  test,  which  involves  administration  of  dexamethasone  followed  by  measurement  of  urinary  cortisol levels.  Normally  administration  of  dexamethasone  causes a  marked  reduction  in  urinary  cortisol  concentration.  In patients with paraneoplastic Cushing's syndrome, however, there  is  no  reduction  in  urinary  cortisol  level  a ft er  dexamethasone administration. Treatment includes agents that block  steroid  production  such  as  ketoconazole  and  mitotane.  Antihypertensives  and  diuretics  may  also  be  needed for symptom management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HYPOGLYCEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intermittent  hypoglycemic episodes can occur with insulinproducing islet cell tumors in the pancreas or with non-islet cell  tumors  outside  of  the  pancreas  that  secrete  insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2). Patients with islet cell tumors demonstrate  a high serum  insulin  level.  In  contrast,  those  with non-islet  cell  tumors  that  secrete  insulin-like  substances demonstrate a low serum insulin level and an elevated level of IGF-2.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic glomerulopathies occur in a variety of di ff erent forms, including membranous glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome,  and  amyloidosis.  Many  involve  renal  deposition  of  immunoglobulins  or  immune  complexes  containing tumor antigens with host antibodies. Amyloidosis is marked by deposition of a unique protein called amyloid and is most o ft en associated with renal cell carcinoma. Glomerulopathies are relatively common in lymphoma and leukemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dermatologic and Rheumatologic Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic  dermatologic  and  rheumatologic  conditions can  occur  without  overt  evidence  of  malignancy,  but  their appearance should initiate screening for an underlying cancer. Acanthosis nigricans is a thickening and hyperpigmentation of the skin. It usually occurs in the axilla or neck and is most commonly related to insulin resistance or other non-cancer-related conditions. When found on the palms, it is almost always associated with cancer, most o ft en an adenocarcinoma. Dermatomyositis  is  an  in fl ammatory  condition  that  causes  proximal muscle weakness as well as characteristic skin changes, including a rash on the eyelids and hands. It can be seen with ovarian, breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy-commonly  known  as clubbing -involves subperiosteal  bone  deposition  that  causes  a  characteristic remodeling of the phalangeal sha ft s. It is classically associated with intrathoracic tumors or metastases to the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic Abnormalities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paraneoplastic hematologic syndromes are rarely symptomatic but are usually present with advanced cancer. Paraneoplastic eosinophilia  is  related  to  production  of  speci fi c  interleukins that  promote  eosinophilic  di ff erentiation  and  is  most  o ft en seen in leukemia and lymphoma. Eosinophilia can sometimes cause wheezing or occasionally end-organ damage resulting from eosinophilic in fi ltration. Granulocytosis usually occurs with solid tumors, particularly large cell lung cancer. Pure red cell  aplasia  is  commonly associated with thymoma, but also occurs with leukemia and lymphoma. Underlying malignancy is the diagnosis in about a third of patients with thrombocytosis (platelet count >400,000/mm 3 ). It appears to be caused by tumor-released cytokines such as IL-6.

LOCAL EFFECTS OF CANCER AND METASTASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Superior Vena Cava Syndrome/Superior Mediastinal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstruction of the superior vena cava is caused by spread of cancer  into  the  mediastinum  or  directly  into  the  caval  wall and is most o ft en associated with lung cancer. Veins above the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
level of the heart, particularly the jugular veins and veins in the arms, become engorged. Edema of the face and upper extremities is usually prominent. Increased intracranial pressure manifests as nausea, seizures, and decreased levels of consciousness and is most likely due to the increase in cerebral venous pressure. Compression of the great vessels may cause syncope.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Superior mediastinal syndrome is the combination of superior vena cava syndrome and tracheal compression. Hoarseness, dyspnea,  and  airway  obstruction  may  be  present  because  of tracheal compression. Treatment consists of prompt radiation therapy or chemotherapy for symptomatic relief. Bronchoscopy and/or  mediastinoscopy  to  obtain  a  tissue  diagnosis  can  be very hazardous, especially in the presence of co-existing airway obstruction and increased pressure in the mediastinal veins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal Cord Compression

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal cord compression results from the presence of metastatic lesions in the epidural space, most o ft en breast, lung, or prostate cancer or lymphoma. Symptoms include pain, skeletal muscle weakness,  sensory  loss,  and  autonomic  dysfunction.  CT  and MRI can visualize the limits of compression. Radiation therapy is a useful treatment when neurologic de fi cits are only partial or in development. Corticosteroids are o ft en administered to minimize  the  in fl ammation and edema that  can  result  from radiation directed at tumors in the epidural space. Once total paralysis has developed, the results of surgical laminectomy or radiation treatment to decompress the spinal cord are poor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Increased Intracranial Pressure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metastatic brain tumors, most o ft en from lung and breast cancer, present initially as mental deterioration, focal neurologic de fi cits, or seizures. Treatment of an acute increase in intracranial pressure caused by a metastatic lesion includes corticosteroids, diuretics, and mannitol. Radiation therapy is the usual palliative treatment, but surgery can be considered for patients with  only  a  single  metastatic  lesion.  Intrathecal  administration of chemotherapeutic drugs is usually necessary when the tumor involves the meninges.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CANCER PAIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer  patients  may  experience  acute  pain  associated  with pathologic fractures, tumor invasion, surgery, radiation treatment,  and  chemotherapy.  Pain  is  frequently  related  to metastatic spread of the cancer, especially to bone. Nerve compression or in fi ltration may also cause pain. Patients with cancer who experience frequent and signi fi cant pain o ft en exhibit signs of depression and anxiety.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer pain resulting from organic causes may be subdivided into  nociceptive  and  neuropathic  pain.  Nociceptive  pain includes somatic and visceral pain and refers to pain caused by  the  peripheral  stimulation  of  nociceptors  in  somatic  or visceral structures. Somatic pain is related to tumor involvement of somatic structures such as bones or skeletal muscles and is o ft en described as aching, stabbing, or throbbing. Visceral pain is related to lesions in a hollow or solid viscus and is described as di ff use, gnawing, or crampy if a hollow viscus is involved and as aching or sharp if a solid viscus is involved. Nociceptive pain is typically responsive to both nonopioid and opioid  medication.  Neuropathic  pain  involves  peripheral  or central a ff erent neural pathways and is commonly described as burning or lancinating pain. Patients experiencing neuropathic pain o ft en respond poorly to opioids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Trauma associated with surgery for removal of cancerous tissue may also be a cause of chronic pain. Scars and injury of so ft tissue and of sensory a ff erents that innervate the surgical area may contribute to the development of chronic pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug therapy is the cornerstone of cancer pain management because of its e ffi cacy, rapid onset of action, and relatively low cost. Mild to moderate cancer pain is initially treated with nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen. NSAIDs are especially e ff ective for managing bone pain, which is the most common type of cancer pain. Th e next step in management of cancer pain is the addition of codeine or one of its analogues. When cancer pain is severe, more potent opioids  are  employed.  Morphine  is  commonly  selected  and can be administered orally. When the oral route of administration is inadequate, alternative routes (intravenous, subcutaneous, epidural, intrathecal, transmucosal, transdermal) are considered.  Fentanyl  is  available  in  transdermal  and  transmucosal  delivery  systems.  Tolerance  to  opioids  does  occur and may necessitate dosage adjustment. Fear of addiction is a major reason why opioids are underutilized, but addiction is rare when these drugs are correctly managed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricyclic  antidepressant  drugs  are  indicated  for  patients with  depressive  symptoms. Th ese  drugs  may  also  exhibit analgesic  properties  by  potentiating  the  e ff ects  of  opioids. Anticonvulsants  are  useful  for  the  management  of  chronic neuropathic pain. Corticosteroids can decrease pain perception,  have  a  sparing  e ff ect  on  opioid  requirements,  improve mood, increase appetite, and lead to weight gain. Multimodal analgesia  with  local  anesthetics  and  adjunctive  agents  such as  gabapentin  and  ketamine  may  be  e ff ective  in  preventing both acute and chronic pain and reducing analgesic use a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial Analgesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial analgesia is an e ff ective way to control pain in cancer patients undergoing surgery and may play a role in providing  preemptive  analgesia.  Neuraxial  analgesia  with  local anesthetics provides immediate pain relief in patients whose pain cannot be alleviated with oral or intravenous analgesics and is frequently employed for the treatment of cancer pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
502

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuraxial analgesia is not used in patients with local infection, bacteremia, and systemic infection because of the increased risk of epidural abscess. However, in the setting of intractable cancer pain, there may be a role for epidural analgesia despite the risk of meningeal infection. Morphine may be administered intrathecally or epidurally for management of acute and chronic cancer pain. Spinal opioids may be delivered for weeks to months via a long-term, subcutaneously tunneled, exteriorized  catheter  or  an  implanted  drug  delivery  system. Th e implantable systems can be intrathecal or epidural and typically  feature  a  drug  reservoir  and  the  capability  for  external programming. Patients are typically considered for neuraxial opioid  administration  when  systemic  opioid  administration has  failed  because  of  the  occurrence  of  intolerable  adverse e ff ects  or  inadequate  analgesia.  Neuraxial  administration  of opioids is  usually  successful,  but  some  patients  may  require the addition of a dilute concentration of local anesthetic to the infusate to achieve adequate pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurolytic Procedures

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurolytic  procedures  intended  to  destroy  sensory  components of nerves cannot be used without also destroying motor and  autonomic  nervous  system fi bers.  Important  considerations  in  determining  the  suitability  of  a  destructive  nerve block are the location and quality of the pain, the e ff ectiveness  of  less  destructive  treatment  modalities,  the  inherent risks associated with the block, the availability of experienced anesthesiologists to perform the procedures, and the patient's anticipated life expectancy. In general, constant pain is more amenable to destructive nerve block than is intermittent pain. Neurolytic celiac plexus block with alcohol or phenol has been used to treat pain originating from abdominal viscera, especially in the context of pancreatic cancer. Th e block is associated with signi fi cant adverse e ff ects, but analgesia usually lasts 6 months or longer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroablative  or  neurostimulatory  procedures  for  managing  cancer  pain  are  reserved  for  patients  whose  pain  is unresponsive  to  other  less  invasive  procedures.  Cordotomy involves interruption of the spinothalamic tract in the spinal cord and is considered for treatment of unilateral pain involving  the  lower  extremity,  thorax,  or  upper  extremity.  Dorsal rhizotomy  involves  interruption  of  sensory  nerve  roots  and is  used when pain is localized to speci fi c dermatomal levels. Dorsal column stimulators or deep brain stimulators may be used in select patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation of patients with cancer includes consideration of the pathophysiologic e ff ects  of  the  disease  and recognition  of  the  potential  adverse  e ff ects  of  cancer  treatments  (Table  23-4).  In  addition,  the  patient's  underlying medical comorbidities must not be overlooked. Correction of nutrient  de fi ciencies,  electrolyte  abnormalities,  anemia,  and coagulopathies may be needed preoperatively. In most cases, laboratory  evaluation  should  include  complete  blood  count, coagulation  pro fi le,  serum  electrolyte  concentrations,  and transaminase  levels.  Chest  radiography,  echocardiography, pulmonary  function  evaluation,  and  other  specialized  testing should be used if clinical suspicion warrants. Th ere are no speci fi c rules regarding the preoperative management of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, most of them have the potential to impair wound healing, especially the growth factor and angiogenesis inhibitors. It has been suggested that surgery be delayed  for  4  to  8  weeks  a ft er  treatment  with  bevacizumab because  of  an  increased  risk  of  bleeding  and  postoperative wound complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Potential pulmonary or cardiac toxicity is a consideration in patients being treated with chemotherapeutic drugs known to  be  associated  with  these  complications. Th e  myocardialdepressant  e ff ects  of  anesthesia  can  unmask  cardiac  dysfunction related to cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs such as  doxorubicin. Th erefore,  when  major  surgery  is  planned, preoperative echocardiography may be indicated. Since several chemotherapeutic agents can cause electrocardiographic abnormalities such as QT prolongation, a baseline electrocardiogram should be reviewed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A preoperative history of drug-induced pulmonary fi brosis (dyspnea, nonproductive cough) or congestive heart failure will  in fl uence the subsequent management of anesthesia. In patients treated with bleomycin, it may be helpful to perform arterial blood gas monitoring in addition to oximetry and to carefully  titrate  intravascular fl uid  replacement,  since  these patients are at risk of developing interstitial pulmonary edema, presumably  because  of  impaired  lymphatic  drainage  in  the lung. Bleomycin-associated pulmonary injury may be exacerbated by high oxygen concentrations; therefore, it is prudent to adjust the delivered oxygen concentration to the minimum that provides adequate oxygen saturation. Nitrous oxide may augment the toxicity of methotrexate, so it is best avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e presence of hepatic or renal dysfunction should in fl uence the choice and dose of anesthetic drugs and muscle relaxants. Although it is not consistently observed, the possibility of a prolonged response to succinylcholine is a consideration in  patients  being  treated  with  alkylating  chemotherapeutic drugs  like  cyclophosphamide. Th e  presence  of  paraneoplastic syndromes such as myasthenia gravis and Eaton-Lambert syndrome  may  also  a ff ect  the  patient's  response  to  muscle relaxants.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Attention to aseptic technique is important, because immunosuppression occurs with most chemotherapeutic agents and is  exacerbated  by  malnutrition.  Immunosuppression  produced by anesthesia, surgical stress, or blood transfusion during the perioperative period could have deleterious e ff ects on the patient's subsequent response to his or her cancer. Adrenal suppression may be present in patients who are being treated with steroids. Th ose who have been receiving more than 20 mg of prednisone (or its equivalent) per day for longer than 3  weeks  are  considered  most  at  risk.  Recovery  of  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may take up to a year. A typical steroid replacement regimen is hydrocortisone 100 mg IV

Intubation  in  the  presence  of  oral  mucositis  may  cause bleeding. Patients with cancers of the head, neck, and anterior mediastinum may exhibit airway compromise. Patients with a history of radiation exposure may have airway deformities that are di ffi cult to recognize on physical examination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recent  evidence  suggests  that  anesthetics  and  analgesics  have  immunomodulatory  properties  (see  Chapter  24). Intravenous opioids tend to blunt natural killer cell activity, producing an immunosuppressive e ff ect that supports the proliferation of tumor cells. Th e use of neuraxial anesthesia may preserve  the  host's  intrinsic  anticancer  defenses  better  than general anesthesia. However, coagulopathies may prevent the use  of  these  techniques  in  some  cancer  patients.  Peripheral nerve blocks may be utilized, but baseline peripheral neuropathies  related  to  chemotherapeutic  drugs  such  as  vincristine and cisplatin should be well documented.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative care must include adequate attention to pain management. Many cancer patients have been treated for pain related to their underlying diagnosis. Th erefore, narcotic dosing must be adjusted to account for possible drug tolerance. Prophylaxis  against  infection  and  thromboembolism  must also be considered.

COMMON CANCERS ENCOUNTERED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common cancers in adults encountered by anesthesiologists in the surgical setting are lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. Lung cancer is the second most common malignancy in men, surpassed only by prostate cancer; in women the incidence of lung cancer is increasing and it is now exceeded only by breast cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women. It is largely a preventable disease, since about 90% of lung cancer deaths are related to cigarette smoking. Fiveyear survival varies signi fi cantly based on stage at diagnosis: 50% of patients with only local disease may survive 5 years, but  only  2%  of  those  with  distant  metastases  evident  at  the time of diagnosis will be alive 5 years later.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ETIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  strong  association  between  cigarette  smoking  and  lung cancer  is  well  established.  Smoking  marijuana  produces  a greater carbon monoxide and tar burden than smoking a similar quantity of tobacco, and thus its use may pose an additional risk factor for lung cancer in cigarette smokers. Th e mutagens and carcinogens present in cigarette smoke may cause chromosomal damage and over time may cause malignancy. Other carcinogens  that  cause  lung  cancer  are  ionizing  radiation (byproduct of coal and iron mining), asbestos (increases the incidence of lung cancer in nonsmokers and acts as a synergistic cocarcinogen with tobacco smoke), and naturally occurring radon gas. Adjuvant radiation therapy for breast cancer following mastectomy is also associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  a  familial  risk  of  lung  cancer  that  is  related  to genetic  and  ecogenetic  factors  and  to  exposure  to  passive smoking. Inhalation of second-hand smoke increases the risk of lung cancer and contributes to the development of childhood  respiratory  infections  and  asthma.  Cigarette  smokers who develop emphysema are at increased risk of developing lung  cancer.  Acquired  immunode fi ciency  syndrome may be associated  with  an  increased  incidence  of  lung  cancer.  Following cessation of cigarette smoking, the risk and incidence of lung cancer decreases to that of nonsmokers a ft er approximately 10 to 15 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with lung cancer have features related to the extent of  the  disease,  including  local  and  regional  manifestations, signs and symptoms of metastatic disease, and various paraneoplastic syndromes related indirectly to the cancer. Cough, hemoptysis, wheezing, stridor, dyspnea, or pneumonitis from airway obstruction may be presenting clinical signs. Mediastinal  metastases  may  cause  hoarseness  (recurrent  laryngeal nerve  compression),  superior  vena  cava  syndrome,  cardiac dysrhythmias,  or  congestive  heart  failure  from  pericardial e ff usion and tamponade. Pleural e ff usion results in increasing dyspnea and o ft en chest pain. Generalized weakness, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss are common.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HISTOLOGIC SUBTYPES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical manifestations of lung cancer vary with the histologic subtype.  Non-small  cell  lung  cancer,  which  includes  squamous cell  carcinoma,  adenocarcinoma,  and  large  cell  carcinoma, accounts for about 85% of all new cases of lung cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Squamous cell cancers arise in major bronchi or their primary  divisions  (central  origin)  and  are  usually  detected  by cytologic analysis of sputum. Th ese tumors tend to grow slowly and  may  reach  a  large  size  before  they  are fi nally  detected. Hemoptysis, bronchial obstruction with associated atelectasis, dyspnea, and fever from pneumonia are common presenting signs. Cavitation may be evident on chest radiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adenocarcinomas most o ft en originate in the lung periphery. Th ese  tumors  commonly  present  as  subpleural  nodules and have a tendency to invade the pleura and induce pleural  e ff usions  that  contain  malignant  cells.  Lung  adenocarcinomas may be di ffi cult to di ff erentiate morphologically from malignant mesothelioma or adenocarcinoma that has metastasized from other sites such as breast, gastrointestinal tract, or pancreas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Large cell carcinomas are usually peripheral in origin and present as large, bulky tumors. Like adenocarcinomas, these tumors metastasize early and preferentially to the central nervous system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Small cell carcinomas are usually of central bronchial origin  and  have  a  high  frequency  of  early  lymphatic  invasion, especially to lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and metastases to liver, bone, central nervous system, adrenal glands, and pancreas. Prominent mediastinal lymphadenopathy may lead to the erroneous diagnosis of malignant lymphoma. Superior vena  cava  syndrome  may  result  from  mediastinal  compression. Small cell tumors have a marked propensity to produce polypeptides  and  ectopic  hormones,  which  results  in  metabolic  abnormalities. Th e  tumors  are  not  usually  detected  in these patients until the disease process is widespread.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cytologic analysis of sputum is o ft en su ffi cient for the diagnosis of lung cancer, especially when the cancer arises in proximal endobronchial locations where shedding of cells is likely to occur. Peripheral lesions as small as 3 mm can be detected by high-resolution CT. Lung cancer screening has been recommended for patients who are at highest risk, such as cigarette smokers with chronic obstructive lung disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Flexible fi beroptic  bronchoscopy,  in  combination  with biopsy,  brushings,  or  washings,  is  a  standard  procedure  for initial  evaluation of lung cancer. Peripheral lung lesions can be diagnosed by percutaneous fi ne-needle aspiration guided by fl uoroscopy,  ultrasonography,  or  CT.  Video-assisted  thoracoscopic  surgery  is  useful  for  diagnosing  peripheral  lung lesions and pleura-based tumors. CT is sensitive for detecting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 23 CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
pulmonary  metastases.  Brain  MRI  and  head  CT  are  useful for detecting metastases even in patients without neurologic abnormalities. Mediastinoscopy and video-assisted thoracoscopy provide the opportunity to biopsy lymph nodes and stage the tumor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatments for lung cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Th e  preferred treatment depends on cell type, stage, and the patient's underlying health.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary function testing is used to evaluate the patient's candidacy for lung resection. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second  (FEV 1 )  and  di ff using  capacity  for  carbon  monoxide (D lco )  are  considered among the most useful predictors of postoperative  complications.  If  FEV 1 is  more  than  2  L  and D lco is more than 80%, patients are at low risk of postoperative respiratory complications. When patients are not clearly in  a  low-risk  category,  predicted  postoperative  pulmonary function can be evaluated. Predicted postoperative pulmonary function takes into consideration preoperative lung function, the amount of lung tissue that will be resected, and the relative contribution of that tissue to overall lung function. Ideally, its calculation is based on preoperative pulmonary function test results as well as some quantitative measure of di ff erential lung function,  such  as  ventilation-perfusion  scanning.  Predicted postoperative  FEV 1 can  also  be  estimated  using  a  formula that takes into account the number of lung segments expected to be removed: predicted postoperative FEV 1 = preoperative FEV1 × (number of segments remaining postoperatively/total number  of  lung  segments).  In  general,  if  predicted  postoperative FEV 1 is  less  than  0.8  L,  patients  are  considered poor candidates  for  pneumonectomy.  Cardiopulmonary  exercise testing with measurement of maximum oxygen consumption is another test that can be used to evaluate patients at high risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery has little  e ff ect  on  survival  when  the  disease  has spread  to  mediastinal  lymph  nodes  or  when  metastases  are present. Even among those considered to have surgically curable  disease,  recurrent  metastatic  disease  develops  in  half of  patients  within  5  years.  For  these  reasons,  many  patients with non-small cell lung cancers are candidates for chemotherapy  alone  or  in  combination  with  surgery  or  radiation therapy. Video-assisted thoracoscopy is the preferred surgical approach, especially for wedge resection and lobectomy. Standard thoracotomy is needed for more complex procedures or pneumonectomy. In most patients, radiation therapy is e ff ective in palliating symptoms from tumor invasion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation therapy is the preferred treatment for small cell carcinoma  because  it  is  particularly  radiosensitive  and  the cancer is not detected in most patients until disease is extensive. Chemotherapy is used as an adjunct.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  lung  cancer includes preoperative consideration of tumor-induced e ff ects such  as  malnutrition,  pneumonia,  pain,  and  ectopic  hormone  production  leading  to  imbalances  like  hyponatremia or hypercalcemia. When resection of lung tissue is planned, it is important to evaluate underlying pulmonary and cardiac function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemorrhage and  pneumothorax  are  the  most  frequently encountered  complications  of  mediastinoscopy. Th e  mediastinoscope can also exert pressure on the right innominate artery, causing loss of the radial pulse and an erroneous diagnosis of cardiac arrest. Likewise, unrecognized compression of the right innominate artery, of which the right carotid artery is a branch, may manifest as a postoperative neurologic de fi cit. Bradycardia during mediastinoscopy may be due to stretching of the vagus nerve or tracheal compression by the mediastinoscope. Lung resection requires the ability to perform differential lung ventilation, such as with a double-lumen tube or bronchial blocker.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colorectal Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colon cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Almost all colorectal cancers are adenocarcinomas, and the disease generally occurs in adults older than 50 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ETIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most colorectal cancers arise from premalignant adenomatous polyps. Although adenomatous polyps are common (present in >30% of patients aged >50 years), fewer than 1% become malignant. Large polyps, especially those larger than 1.5 cm in  diameter,  are  more  likely  to  contain  invasive  cancer.  It  is thought  that  adenomatous  polyps  require  5  to  10  years  of growth  before  they  develop  into  a  cancer. Th e  evolution  of normal colonic mucosa to a benign adenomatous polyp that contains cancer and then to life-threatening invasive cancer is  associated  with  a  series  of  genetic  events  that  involve  the mutational activation of a proto-oncogene and the loss of several genes that normally suppress tumorigenesis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most colorectal cancers appear to be related to diet. Th ere is  a  direct  correlation  between  colorectal  cancer  incidence and the amount of calories, animal fat, and meat protein consumed.  Family  history  of  colorectal  cancer,  in fl ammatory bowel disease, and cigarette smoking for longer than 35 years are also risk factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e rationale for colorectal cancer screening is that early detection and removal of localized super fi cial tumors and precancerous lesions in asymptomatic individuals increases the cure rate. Screening programs (digital rectal examination, examination of the stool for occult blood, colonoscopy) appear to be particularly useful for persons who have fi rst-degree relatives with a history of the disease, especially if these relatives developed colorectal cancer before 55 years of age.

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

Th e presenting signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer re fl ect the anatomic location of the cancer. Because stool is relatively

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
liquid as it passes into the right colon through the ileocecal valve, tumors in the cecum and ascending colon can become large and markedly narrow the bowel lumen without causing obstructive  symptoms.  Ascending  colon  cancers  frequently ulcerate, which leads to chronic blood loss in the stool. Th ese patients  experience  symptoms  related  to  anemia,  including fatigue and, in some patients, angina pectoris.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stool  becomes  more  concentrated  as  it  passes  into  the transverse  colon.  Transverse  colon  cancers  cause  abdominal cramping, occasional bowel obstruction, and even perforation. Abdominal  radiographs  reveal  characteristic  abnormalities in the colonic gas pattern, re fl ecting narrowing of the lumen ("napkin ring lesion"). Colon cancers developing in the rectosigmoid portion of the large intestine result in tenesmus and thinner stools. Anemia is unusual despite the passage of bright red blood from the rectum (o ft en attributable to hemorrhoids).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colorectal cancers initially spread to regional lymph nodes and then through the portal venous circulation to the liver, which represents the most common visceral site of metastases. Colorectal cancers rarely spread to lung, bone, or brain in the absence of liver metastases. A preoperative increase in the serum  concentration  of  carcinoembryonic  antigen  suggests that the tumor will recur following surgical resection. Carcinoembryonic antigen is a glycoprotein that is also increased in the presence of other cancers (stomach, pancreas, breast, lung) and certain nonmalignant conditions (alcoholic liver disease, in fl ammatory bowel disease, cigarette smoking, pancreatitis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e prognosis for patients with adenocarcinoma of the colorectum depends on the depth of tumor penetration into the bowel wall and the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement and distant metastases (liver, lung, bone). Radical surgical resection, which includes the blood vessels and lymph nodes draining the involved bowel, o ff ers the best potential for cure. Surgical management of cancers that arise in the distal rectum may necessitate a permanent colostomy (abdominoperineal resection). Because most recurrences occur within 3 to 4 years, the cure rate for colorectal cancer is o ft en estimated by 5-year survival rates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation  therapy  is  considered  for  patients  with  rectal tumors, since the risk of recurrence following surgery is signi fi cant. Postoperative radiation therapy causes transient diarrhea and cystitis, but permanent damage to the small intestine and bladder is uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for surgical resection of colorectal  cancers  may  be  in fl uenced  by  anemia  and  the  e ff ects  of metastatic lesions in liver, lung, bone, or brain. Chronic large bowel  obstruction  probably  does  not  increase  the  risk  of aspiration during induction of anesthesia, although abdominal  distention  could  interfere  with  adequate  ventilation  and oxygenation.  Blood  transfusion  during  surgical  resection  of colorectal  cancers  has  been  alleged  to  be  associated  with  a decrease in the length of patient survival. Th is  could  re fl ect immunosuppression produced by transfused blood. For this reason, careful review of the risks and bene fi ts of blood transfusions in these patients is prudent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prostate Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e reported number of cases of prostate cancer has increased dramatically  in  recent  years,  which  presumably  re fl ects  the widespread use of prostate-speci fi c antigen (PSA) testing. Th e incidence of prostate cancer is highest in African Americans and  lowest  in  Asians. Th e  presence  of  the  hereditary  prostate  cancer  gene  mutation  ( HPC1 )  greatly  increases  the  risk of developing prostate cancer. Th e possibility that vasectomy may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer has not been substantiated. Prostate cancer is almost always an adenocarcinoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of PSA-based screening has changed the way prostate cancer is diagnosed. An increased serum PSA concentration may indicate the presence of prostate cancer in asymptomatic men and prompt a digital rectal examination. Detection of a discrete nodule or di ff use induration on digital rectal examination  raises  suspicion  of  prostate  cancer,  especially  in  the presence  of  impotence  or  symptoms  of  urinary  obstruction (frequency, nocturia, hesitancy, urgency). However, the rectal examination can evaluate only the posterior and lateral aspects of the prostate. If the rectal examination indicates the possible presence of cancer, transrectal ultrasonography and biopsy are needed regardless of the PSA concentration. Th ere is a much greater likelihood of detecting cancer if the PSA level is higher than 10 ng/mL, regardless of the fi ndings on rectal examination. Infrequently, patients have symptoms of metastatic disease, such as bone pain and weight loss, at presentation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Focal,  well-di ff erentiated  prostate  cancers  are  usually  cured by  transurethral  resection.  However,  recurrent  disease  may develop  in  up  to  16%  of  these  patients  within  8  years.  For this  reason, more aggressive treatment such as radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy may be indicated in subsets of these patients, especially those younger than 65 years of age. If lymph nodes are involved, radical prostatectomy or de fi nitive radiation  therapy  may  be  recommended.  Radical  prostatectomy can be performed via a retropubic or perineal approach. Use of the retropubic approach permits the surgeon to take lymph node samples for frozen section before beginning the prostatectomy.  Radiation  therapy  can  be  delivered  either  by an external beam or by implantation of radioactive seeds. Th e decision  to  select  surgery  or  radiation  therapy  is  based  on the adverse e ff ects of each treatment and the patient's overall health. Impotence and urinary incontinence are risks of radical prostatectomy. Preservation of the neurovascular bundles on each side of the prostate may decrease the risk of impotence following surgery. Radiation therapy produces impotence less o ft en, but debilitating cystitis or proctitis may develop.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hormone therapy is  indicated  for  management  of  metastatic prostate cancer, because these tumors are under the trophic  in fl uence  of  androgens.  Androgen  deprivation  therapy dramatically  reduces  testosterone  levels  and  causes  tumor regression.  Androgen  deprivation  can  be  accomplished  by surgical  castration,  administration  of  exogenous  estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol, use of analogues of gonadotropinreleasing  hormone (GNRH) that inhibit the release of pituitary  gonadotropins, use of antiandrogens such as fl utamide that block the action of androgens at target tissues, and use of combination therapy, such as an antiandrogen in combination with a GNRH agonist or bilateral orchiectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When advanced prostate cancers become resistant to hormone therapy, incapacitating bone pain o ft en develops. Systemic  chemotherapy  with  mitoxantrone  plus  corticosteroids or  estramustine  plus  a  taxane  may  be  e ff ective  in  palliating pain. In the terminal phases of the disease, administration of high doses of prednisone for short periods may produce subjective improvement.

Breast Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Women in the United States have a 12% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Th e  risk  of  death  from  breast  cancer  is approximately  3%.  Most  women  in  whom  breast  cancer  is diagnosed do not die of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RISK FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  principal  risk  factors  for  development  of  breast  cancer are increasing age (75% of cases occur in patients >50 years of  age)  and  family  history  (a fi rst-degree  relative  diagnosed with breast cancer before age 50 increases the risk threefold to  fourfold).  Reproductive risk factors that increase the risk of breast cancer include early menarche, late menopause, late fi rst pregnancy, and nulliparity, all of which are presumed to prolong exposure of the breasts to estrogen. Two breast cancer susceptibility genes ( BRCA1 and BRCA2 ) are mutations that are inherited as autosomal dominant traits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SCREENING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recommended screening strategies for breast cancer include the triad of breast self-examination, clinical breast examination by a professional, and screening mammography. Clinical breast examination by a professional and regular mammography  appear  to  decrease  mortality  from  breast  cancer  by approximately one third in women older than age 50. Annual screening  mammography  is  generally  recommended  for  all women beginning between the ages of 40 and 50 years. A small percentage of breast cancers are not detected by mammography, so alternative screening methods such as ultrasonography and/or MRI may be of value in selected patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Axillary lymph node invasion and tumor size are the two most important  determinants  of  outcome  in  patients  with  early breast  cancer.  Other  established  prognostic  factors  include the estrogen and progesterone receptor content of the primary tumor and its histologic grade. Th e absence of estrogen and progesterone  receptor  expression  is  associated  with  a  worse prognosis. Most tumors that express receptors are responsive to endocrine therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although radical mastectomy (removal of the involved breast, axillary  contents,  and  underlying  chest  wall  musculature) was the principal treatment for invasive breast cancer in the past,  it  is  seldom  used  in  current  practice.  Breast  conservation  therapy,  including  lumpectomy  with  radiation  therapy, simple mastectomy, and modi fi ed radical mastectomy provide similar survival rates. Because the likelihood of distant micrometastases  is  highly  correlated  with  the  number  of  lymph nodes invaded by tumor, axillary lymph node dissection provides prognostic information. Sentinel lymph node mapping involves injection of a radioactive tracer or isosulfan blue dye into the area around the primary breast tumor. Th e injected substance tracks rapidly to the dominant axillary lymph node (sentinel node). If the sentinel node is tumor free, the remaining lymph nodes are also likely to be tumor free, and further axillary surgery can be avoided. Th e morbidity associated with breast cancer surgery is now largely related to adverse e ff ects of lymph node dissection such as lymphedema and restricted arm motion. Obesity, weight gain, and infection in the arm are additional risk factors for development of lymphedema. To minimize the risk of lymphedema, it is reasonable to protect the ipsilateral arm from venipuncture, compression, infection, and exposure to heat.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Radiation treatment is an important component of breast conservation  therapy,  since  lumpectomy  alone  is  associated with a high incidence of recurrence. Radiation therapy a ft er a mastectomy is reserved for women with extensive local disease, such as skin and chest wall invasion and extensive lymph node involvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many women with early-stage breast cancer already have distant micrometastases at the time of diagnosis. Systemic therapy is intended to prevent or delay recurrence of the disease. Tamoxifen and other chemotherapeutic agents as well as ovarian ablation are the most commonly used modes of systemic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a mixed estrogen agonistantagonist  o ft en  referred  to  as  a selective  estrogen  receptor modulator. It  acts  as  an  estrogen  antagonist  on  tumor  cells but has agonist properties on some other targets. Five years of tamoxifen therapy in patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors is associated with a signi fi cant  reduction in the risk of  recurrence.  Bene fi ts  of  tamoxifen  therapy  are  similar  for patients with node-positive and node-negative disease. However, tamoxifen does not alter outcome in patients with minimal or no estrogen receptor expression on their tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tamoxifen can cause body temperature disturbances (hot fl ashes), vaginal discharge, and an increased risk of developing

<!-- PAGE=? -->
508

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
endometrial  cancer.  Megestrol  (progestin)  may  be  administered to decrease the severity of the hot fl ashes associated with tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen lowers serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein concentrations, but the importance of these e ff ects in reducing the risk of ischemic heart disease is unclear. Tamoxifen preserves bone density in postmenopausal women by its proestrogenic e ff ects and may decrease the incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures of the hip, spine, and radius. Th ere is an increased risk of thromboembolic events, including  deep  vein  thrombosis,  pulmonary  embolism,  and stroke, with tamoxifen therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chemotherapy. Combination chemotherapy decreases the  rate  of  recurrence  and  mortality  from  breast  cancer  in patients with both node-positive and node-negative disease. Th e  maximum bene fi t  seems  to  be  in  women  younger  than 50 years of age with node-positive disease. A commonly used combination chemotherapy regimen includes cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fl uorouracil. Th e chemotherapy dose is an important determinant of cell kill. Conventional adjuvant chemotherapy usually begins within a few months of surgery. Chemotherapy  or  radiation  therapy  may  be  administered before surgery to selected patients in an attempt to decrease tumor size and improve breast conservation. In women at high risk who have multiple positive lymph nodes, high-dose chemotherapy with alkylating drugs combined with autologous bone marrow transplantation may be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chemotherapy for breast cancer has adverse e ff ects such as nausea and vomiting, hair loss, and bone marrow suppression that  typically  resolve  following  treatment. Th e  most  serious late sequelae of chemotherapy are leukemia and doxorubicininduced cardiac impairment. Patients with symptoms of cardiac disease or congestive heart failure should be evaluated with electrocardiography  and  echocardiography.  Myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia can occur a ft er chemotherapy,  but  the  incidence  is  low  (0.2%  to  1.0%).  High-dose radiation therapy may be associated with brachial plexopathy or nerve damage, pneumonitis, and/or pulmonary fi brosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supportive Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Palliation  of  symptoms  and  prevention  of  complications are primary goals when treating advanced breast cancer. Th e most common site of breast cancer metastasis is bone. Regular administration of bisphosphonates in addition to hormone therapy or chemotherapy can decrease bone pain and lower the incidence of bone complications by inhibiting osteoclastic activity.  Adequate pain control is usually achieved with sustained-release oral and/or transdermal opioid preparations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation includes a review of potential adverse e ff ects  related  to  chemotherapy.  Placement  of  intravenous catheters in the arm at risk of lymphedema is avoided because of  the  potential  to  exacerbate  lymphedema  and  the  susceptibility  to  infection.  It  is  also  necessary  to  protect  that  arm from compression (as from a blood pressure cu ff )  and  heat exposure. Th e presence of bone pain and pathologic fractures is noted when considering regional anesthesia and when positioning  the  patient  during  surgery.  Selection  of  anesthetic drugs, techniques, and special monitoring is in fl uenced more by  the  planned  surgical  procedure  than  by  the  presence  of breast  cancer.  Of  note,  if  isosulfan  blue  dye  is  injected  during the surgical procedure, it is likely that pulse oximetry will demonstrate  a  transient  spurious  decrease  in  the  measured oxygen saturation, usually a 3% decrease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LESS COMMON CANCERS ENCOUNTERED IN CLINICAL PRACTICE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Less commonly encountered cancers include cardiac tumors, head and neck cancers, and cancers involving the endocrine glands, liver, gallbladder, genitourinary tract, and reproductive organs.  Lymphomas and leukemias are examples of cancers that involve the lymph glands and blood-forming elements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac Tumors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  tumors  may  be  primary  or  secondary,  benign  or malignant. Metastatic  cardiac  involvement-usually  from adjacent lung cancer-occurs 20 to 40 times more o ft en than primary malignant cardiac tumors. Cardiac myxomas account for  40%  to  50%  of  benign  cardiac  tumors  in  adults.  About three  quarters  of  cardiac  myxomas  occur  in  the  le ft atrium, and the remaining 25% occur in the right atrium. Myxomas o ft en demonstrate considerable movement within the cardiac chamber during the cardiac cycle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms of cardiac myxomas re fl ect  interference with fi lling and emptying of the involved cardiac chamber. Le ft atrial myxoma may mimic mitral valve disease with development of pulmonary edema. Right atrial myxoma o ft en mimics tricuspid disease and can be associated with impaired venous return and evidence of right-sided heart failure. Emboli occur in about a third of patients with cardiac myxomas. Th ese emboli are composed of myxomatous material or thrombi that have formed on the tumor. Because most myxomas are located in the le ft atrium, systemic embolism is particularly frequent and  o ft en  involves  the  retinal  and  cerebral  arteries.  Cardiac myxomas may occur as part of a syndrome that includes cutaneous myxomas, myxoid fi broadenomas of the breast, pituitary adenomas, and adrenocortical hyperplasia with Cushing's syndrome.  Echocardiography  can  determine  the  location,  size, shape, attachment, and mobility of cardiac myxomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical resection of cardiac myxomas is usually curative. A ft er  the  diagnosis  has  been  established,  prompt  surgery  is indicated because of the possibility of embolic complications and  sudden  death.  In  most  cases,  cardiac  myxomas  can  be removed easily because they are pedunculated. Intraoperative fragmentation of the tumor must be avoided. All chambers of the heart are examined to rule out the existence of multifocal disease. Mechanical damage to a heart valve or adhesion of the tumor to valve lea fl ets may necessitate valvuloplasty or valve replacement.

Chapter 23 CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic considerations in patients with cardiac myxomas include the possibility of low cardiac output and arterial hypoxemia resulting from obstruction at the mitral or tricuspid  valve.  Symptoms  of  obstruction  may  be  exacerbated  by changes in body position. Th e presence of a right atrial myxoma prohibits placement of right atrial or pulmonary artery catheters. Supraventricular dysrhythmias may follow surgical removal of atrial myxomas. In some patients, permanent cardiac pacing may be required because of atrioventricular conduction abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Head and Neck Cancers

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Head and neck cancers account for approximately 5% of all cancers  in  the  United  States,  with  a  predominance  in  men older  than  50  years  of  age.  Most  patients  have  a  history  of excessive alcohol use and cigarette smoking. Th e most common sites of metastases are lung, liver, and bone. Hypercalcemia may be associated with bony metastases, and altered liver function test results presumably re fl ect alcohol-induced disease. Preoperative nutritional therapy may be indicated before surgical resection. Th e goal of chemotherapy, if selected, is to decrease the bulk of the primary tumor or known metastases and thereby enhance the e ffi cacy of subsequent surgery or radiation treatment. A secondary goal is eradication of occult micrometastases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic considerations in patients with head and neck cancers  include  the  possibility  of  distorted  airway  anatomy that may not be appreciated on external airway examination. Available diagnostic images and the report of nasal fi beroptic examination should be reviewed preoperatively. Preparation must be made for the possibility of di ffi cult ventilation and/ or intubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thyroid Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Papillary  and  follicular  thyroid  carcinomas  are  among  the most curable of all cancers. Th yroid cancers are more frequent in  women. External radiation to the neck during childhood increases the risk of papillary thyroid cancer, as does a family  history of the disease. Medullary thyroid cancers may be associated with pheochromocytomas in an autosomal dominant disorder known as multiple endocrine neoplasia type II. Th is type of thyroid cancer typically produces large amounts of thyrocalcitonin, which provides a sensitive measure of the presence of the disease as well as its successful cure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subtotal and total thyroidectomy result in lower recurrence rates than more limited partial thyroidectomy. Even with total thyroidectomy,  some  thyroid  tissue  remains,  as  detected  by postoperative scanning with radioactive iodine. Risks of total thyroidectomy include recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2%) and permanent hypoparathyroidism (2%). Patients with papillary  thyroid  cancers  require  dissection  of  paratracheal  and tracheoesophageal  lymph  nodes. Th e  growth  of  papillary and  follicular  tumor  cells  is  controlled  by  thyrotropin,  and inhibition  of  thyrotropin  secretion  with  thyroxine  improves long-term survival. External beam radiation can be used for palliative treatment of obstructive and bony metastases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal cancer has two histologic subtypes: squamous cell and  adenocarcinoma.  Excessive  alcohol  consumption  and long-term cigarette smoking are independent risk factors for the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Th e  risk  of  adenocarcinoma  is  highest  in  people  with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of gastroesophageal re fl ux disease. Dysphagia and weight loss are the initial symptoms of esophageal cancer in most patients. Th e dysphagia may be associated with malnutrition. Di ffi culty swallowing may result in regurgitation and increase the risk of aspiration. Th e disease has usually metastasized by the time clinical symptoms are present. Th e lack of a serosal layer around the esophagus and the presence of an extensive lymphatic system are responsible for the rapid spread of tumor to adjacent lymph nodes. However, in patients with Barrett's  esophagus  who  undergo routine endoscopic surveillance, the disease can be diagnosed at a very early stage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Even  with  aggressive  treatment,  the  5-year  survival  rate for  patients  with  squamous  cell  carcinoma  is  only  15%  to 20%. Esophagectomy is o ft en performed for carcinoma of the esophagus  and  is  associated  with  signi fi cant  morbidity  and mortality. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be instituted  before  surgical  resection  is  attempted.  Adenocarcinomas are radioinsensitive, but chemotherapy and surgery may improve survival.  Palliation  may  include  surgical  placement of a feeding tube, bougienage, or endoscopic stent placement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e likelihood of underlying alcohol-induced liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from cigarette smoking,  and cross-tolerance of anesthetic drugs in patients who abuse  alcohol  are  considerations  during  anesthetic  management of patients with esophageal cancer. Extensive weight loss o ft en  parallels  a  decrease  in  intravascular fl uid  volume  and manifests as hypotension during induction and maintenance of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastric Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  incidence  of  gastric  cancer  has  decreased  dramatically since  1930,  when  it  was  the  leading  cause  of  cancer-related death among men in the United States. Achlorhydria (loss of gastric acidity), pernicious anemia, chronic gastritis, and Helicobacter infection  contribute  to  the  development  of  gastric cancer. Th e presenting features of gastric cancer (indigestion, epigastric distress, anorexia) are indistinguishable from those of benign peptic ulcer disease. Approximately 90% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, and approximately half of them occur in the distal portion of the stomach. Gastric cancer is usually far advanced when signs and symptoms such as weight loss, palpable epigastric mass, jaundice, and ascites appear.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complete surgical eradication of gastric tumors with resection of adjacent lymph nodes is the only treatment that may be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE 510

<!-- PAGE=? -->
curative. Resection of the primary lesion also o ff ers the best palliation.  Gastric  cancer  is  relatively  resistant  to  radiation therapy, but it is one of the few gastrointestinal tumors that may have some response to chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver  cancer  occurs  most  o ft en  in  men  with  liver  disease caused by hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus, alcohol consumption, or hemochromatosis. Initial manifestations are typically abdominal  pain,  palpable  abdominal  mass,  and  constitutional symptoms such as anorexia and weight loss. Th ere may be compression of the inferior vena cava and/or portal vein, lower  extremity  edema,  ascites,  and  jaundice.  Laboratory fi ndings re fl ect the abnormalities associated with underlying chronic liver disease. Liver function test results are likely to be abnormal. CT and MRI can determine the anatomic location  of  the  tumor,  although  angiography  may  be  more  useful  for  distinguishing  hepatocellular  cancer  (hypervascular) from hepatic metastases (hypovascular) and for determining whether a tumor is resectable.  Radical  surgical  resection  or liver transplantation o ff ers the only hope for survival, but most patients with liver cancer are not surgical candidates because of extensive cirrhosis, impaired liver function, and the presence  of  extrahepatic  disease.  Chemotherapy  and  radiation therapy are of limited value.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pancreatic Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pancreatic cancer, despite its low incidence, is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women in the United States. Th ere is no evidence linking this cancer to ca ff eine ingestion, cholelithiasis, or diabetes mellitus, but cigarette smoking, obesity, and chronic pancreatitis show a positive correlation. Approximately 95% of pancreatic cancers are ductal adenocarcinomas, with most occurring in the head of the pancreas. Abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss are the usual initial symptoms. Pain suggests retroperitoneal invasion  and  in fi ltration  of  splanchnic  nerves.  Jaundice  re fl ects biliary obstruction in patients with tumor in the head of the pancreas.  Diabetes  mellitus  is  rare  in  patients  who  develop pancreatic cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pancreatic cancer may appear as a localized mass or as diffuse  enlargement  of  the  gland.  Biopsy  is  needed  to  con fi rm the  diagnosis.  Complete  surgical  resection  is  the  only  e ff ective treatment. Patients most likely to have resectable lesions are those with tumors in the head of the pancreas that cause painless jaundice. Extrapancreatic spread eliminates the possibility  of  surgical  cure. Th e  two  most  commonly employed surgical  resection  techniques  are  total  pancreatectomy  and pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple's procedure). Total pancreatectomy  is  technically  easier  but  has  the  disadvantage of producing diabetes mellitus and malabsorption. Even when surgical resection can be performed, only about 10% of patients survive for 5 years. Th e median survival for patients with unresectable tumors is 5 months. Palliative procedures include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgical diversion of the biliary system to relieve obstruction. Celiac plexus block with alcohol or phenol is the most e ff ective intervention for treating the pain associated with pancreatic cancer. A complication of celiac plexus block is hypotension resulting from sympathetic denervation in these o ft en hypovolemic patients. CT guidance of a celiac plexus block may be used to con fi rm proper  needle  placement  before  any  neurolytic  solution  is injected into the celiac plexus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal Cell Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  cell  cancer  most  o ft en  manifests  as  hematuria,  mild anemia, and fl ank pain. Risk factors include a family history of renal cancer and cigarette smoking. Renal ultrasonography can help identify renal cysts, and CT and MRI are useful for determining the presence and extent of disease. Laboratory testing  may  reveal  eosinophilia  and  renal  function  abnormalities. Paraneoplastic syndromes, especially hypercalcemia caused by ectopic parathyroid hormone secretion and erythrocytosis  resulting  from  ectopic  erythropoietin  production, are not uncommon. Th e only curative treatment for renal cell carcinoma  con fi ned  to  the  kidneys  is  radical  nephrectomy with regional lymphadenectomy. Radical nephrectomy is not helpful in patients with distant metastases, but chemotherapy may have some bene fi t.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bladder Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bladder cancer occurs more o ft en  in  men  and  is  associated with cigarette smoking and long-term exposure to chemicals used in the dye (aniline), leather, and rubber industries. Th e most common presenting feature is hematuria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  noninvasive  bladder  cancer  includes  endoscopic  resection  and  intravesical  chemotherapy,  o ft en  with BCG. Carcinoma in situ of the bladder o ft en behaves aggressively  and  may  require  cystectomy  to  help  prevent  muscle invasion  and  metastatic  spread.  In  men,  radical  cystectomy includes removal of the bladder, prostate, and proximal urethra.  In  women,  a  hysterectomy,  oophorectomy,  and  partial vaginectomy are required. Urinary diversion is either by ureteroileostomy (ileal conduit) or creation of an arti fi cial bladder (neobladder) from segments of small bowel. Traditional treatments  for  metastatic  disease  include  radiation  therapy and chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Testicular Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although testicular cancer is rare, it is the most common cancer in young men and represents a tumor that can be cured even when distant metastases are present. Orchiopexy before 2 years of age is recommended for cryptorchidism to decrease the risk of testicular cancer. Testicular cancer usually presents as a painless testicular mass. When the diagnosis is suspected, an inguinal orchiectomy is performed and the diagnosis is histologically con fi rmed. A transscrotal biopsy is not performed

<!-- PAGE=? -->
because  disruption  of  the  scrotum  may  predispose  to  local recurrence  and/or  metastatic  spread  to  inguinal  lymphatics.  Germ  cell  cancers,  which  account  for  95%  of  testicular cancers, can be subdivided into seminomas and nonseminomas. Seminomas metastasize through regional lymphatics to the  retroperitoneum  and  mediastinum,  and  nonseminomas spread hematogenously to viscera, especially the lungs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  seminomas  that  do  not  extend  beyond  the retroperitoneal lymph nodes are treated with radiation. Chemotherapy is recommended when seminomas are large, present with several anatomic levels of nodal involvement, or have spread above the diaphragm. Nonseminomas are not radiation sensitive and are treated with retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and combination chemotherapy.

Cervical and Uterine Cancer

Cancer of the uterine cervix is the most common gynecologic cancer  in  females  aged  15  to  34  years.  Infection  with  HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancers. Vaccination against these viruses is expected to reduce the incidence of cervical cancers in future generations. Carcinoma in situ detected by Papanicolaou's test is treated with cone biopsy, whereas more extensive local disease or disease that has metastasized is treated with some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cancer  involving  the  uterine  endometrium  occurs  most frequently in women 50 to 70 years of age and may be associated with estrogen replacement therapy at menopause, more than  5  years  of  tamoxifen  treatment  for  breast  cancer,  obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Endometrial cancer is  o ft en diagnosed at an early stage because more than 90% of  patients  have  postmenopausal  or  irregular  bleeding. Th e initial  evaluation  of  these  patients  o ft en  includes  fractional dilation and curettage. In the absence of metastatic disease, a total  abdominal  hysterectomy  and  bilateral  salpingo-oophorectomy with or without radiation to the pelvic and periaortic lymph nodes is usually the treatment of choice. Hormone therapy with progesterone may be useful for metastatic disease. Metastatic endometrial cancer responds poorly to traditional chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ovarian Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ovarian cancer is the most deadly of the gynecologic malignancies. Ovarian cancer is most likely to develop in women who experience early menopause or who have a family history of ovarian cancer. Early ovarian cancer is usually asymptomatic, so advanced disease is o ft en present by the time the cancer  is  discovered.  Widespread  intraabdominal  metastases  to lymph nodes, omentum, and peritoneum are frequently present. Surgery is the treatment of choice for both early-stage and advanced ovarian cancer. Aggressive tumor debulking, even if all cancer cannot be removed, improves the length and quality of survival. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy is indicated postoperatively in most women and is usually well tolerated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skin Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Skin  cancer  is  a  very  common  cancer  in  the  United  States. Skin cancers are either melanomas or nonmelanomas. Nonmelanonas include basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.  Basal  cell  carcinoma  is  the  most  common  type of  skin  cancer.  Most  of  these  cancers  grow  super fi cially  and rarely  metastasize,  so  local  treatment  (excision,  topical  chemotherapy, cryotherapy) is usually curative.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Melanoma  accounts  for  only  about  5%  of  all  skin  cancers, but 75% of skin cancer deaths. Th e incidence of cutaneous melanoma is increasing. Sunlight (ultraviolet light) is an important environmental factor in the pathogenesis of melanoma. Th e initial treatment of a suspected lesion is wide and deep  excisional  biopsy,  o ft en  with  sentinel  node  mapping. Melanoma can metastasize to virtually any organ. Treatment of metastatic melanoma focuses on palliation and can include resection of a solitary metastasis, simple or combination chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy.

Bone Cancer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bone cancers include multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MULTIPLE MYELOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Multiple myeloma (plasma cell myeloma) is a malignant neoplasm characterized by poorly controlled growth of a single clone of plasma cells that produce a monoclonal immunoglobulin.  Multiple  myeloma  accounts  for  approximately  10%  of hematologic cancers and 1% of all cancers in the United States. Th e disease is more common in elderly patients (median age at time of diagnosis is 65 years), and it occurs twice as o ft en in African Americans as in Caucasians. Th e cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. Its extent, complications, sensitivity to drugs, and clinical course vary greatly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  frequent  manifestations  of  multiple  myeloma are bone pain (o ft en from vertebral collapse), anemia, thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  hypercalcemia,  renal  failure,  and recurrent bacterial infection re fl ecting bone marrow invasion by tumor cells. Extramedullary plasmacytomas can produce compression of the spinal cord. Th is occurs in approximately 10% of patients. Other extramedullary sites of tumor invasion include the liver, spleen, ribs, and skull. Inactivation of plasma procoagulants by myeloma proteins may interfere with coagulation. Th ese  proteins  coat  the  platelets  and  interfere  with platelet function. Th e presence of hypercalcemia from excessive  bone  destruction  should  be  suspected  in  patients  with myeloma who develop nausea, fatigue, confusion, or polyuria. Renal insu ffi ciency occurs in approximately 25% of patients with  multiple  myeloma  resulting  from  either  deposition  of an  abnormal  protein  (Bence  Jones  protein)  in  renal  tubules or  the  development  of  acute  renal  failure.  Amyloidosis  or immunoglobulin deposition can cause nephrotic syndrome or contribute to renal failure. Th e combination of hypogammaglobulinemia, granulocytopenia, and depressed cell-mediated

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
immunity  increases  the  risk  of  infection.  Development  of fever in patients with multiple myeloma is an indication for antibiotic therapy. In an estimated 20% of patients, multiple myeloma is diagnosed by chance in the absence of symptoms when  screening  laboratory  studies  reveal  increased  serum protein concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  overt  symptomatic  multiple  myeloma  most o ft en  includes  autologous  stem  cell  transplantation  and  chemotherapy.  Palliative  radiation  therapy  is  limited  to  patients who have disabling pain and a well-de fi ned focal process that has not responded to chemotherapy. Th e  median duration of remission is approximately 2 years and the median survival time approximately 3 years, but these vary depending on the cytogenetic characteristics of the myeloma cells. Signs of spinal cord compression resulting from an extramedullary plasmacytoma require early con fi rmation and prompt radiation therapy. Urgent decompressive laminectomy to avoid permanent paralysis may be needed if radiation treatment is not e ff ective.  Chemotherapy reverses mild renal failure in many patients with multiple myeloma, but temporary hemodialysis may be necessary until chemotherapy becomes e ff ective.  Erythropoietin therapy may be indicated to treat anemia. Hypercalcemia requires prompt treatment with volume expansion and saline diuresis. Bed rest is  avoided,  because inactivity leads to further mobilization of calcium from bone and increased risk of deep vein thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  compression  fractures  requires  caution when positioning patients during anesthesia and surgery. Fluid therapy depends on the degree of renal insu ffi ciency and/or hypercalcemia.  Pathologic  fractures  of  the  ribs  may  impair ventilation and predispose to the development of pneumonia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OSTEOSARCOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteosarcoma occurs most o ft en in adolescents and typically involves  the  distal  femur  and  proximal  tibia.  A  genetic  predisposition is suggested by the association of this tumor with retinoblastoma. MRI is used to assess the extent of the primary lesion and the existence of metastatic disease, especially in the lungs. Serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations are likely to be increased, and the levels correlate with prognosis. Treatment  consists  of  combination  chemotherapy  followed by surgical excision or amputation. Successful chemotherapy may permit limb salvage procedures in selected patients. Pulmonary resection may be indicated in patients with solitary metastatic lesions. Nonmetastatic disease is associated with an 85% to 90% survival rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EWING'S SARCOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ewing's sarcoma usually occurs in children and young adults and  most  o ft en  involves  the  pelvis,  femur,  or  tibia.  Ewing's sarcoma is highly malignant, and metastatic disease is o ft en present at the time of diagnosis. Treatment consists of surgery, local radiation therapy, and combination chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHONDROSARCOMA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chondrosarcoma  usually  involves  the  pelvis,  ribs,  or  upper end of the femur or humerus in young or middle-aged adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is tumor o ft en grows slowly and can be treated by radical surgical  excision  of  larger  lesions  and  irradiation  of  smaller lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LYMPHOMAS AND LEUKEMIAS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hodgkin's Lymphoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hodgkin's disease is a lymphoma that seems to have infective (Epstein-Barr virus), genetic, and environmental associations. Another factor that appears to predispose to the development of lymphoma is impaired immunity as seen in patients a ft er organ transplantation or in patients infected with the human immunode fi ciency  virus. Th e  most  useful  diagnostic  test  in patients with suspected lymphoma is lymph node biopsy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hodgkin's lymphoma is a lymph node-based malignancy, and  presentation  consists  of  lymphadenopathy  in  predictable locations, including the neck and anterior mediastinum. Characteristic systemic symptoms also occur, including pruritus, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. Moderately severe anemia is o ft en present. Peripheral neuropathy and spinal cord compression may occur as a direct result of tumor growth.  Bone  marrow  and  central  nervous  system  involvement  is  unusual  in  Hodgkin's  lymphoma  but  not  in  other lymphomas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Staging of the disease is accomplished by CT and positron emission tomographic scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis;  biopsy  of  available  nodes;  and  bone  marrow  biopsy. Precise de fi nition of the extent of nodal and extranodal disease is necessary to select the proper treatment strategy. Radiation  therapy  is  curative  for  localized  early-stage  Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Bulkier  or  more  advanced  Hodgkin's  disease  is treated by combination chemotherapy. Cure can be achieved, with 20-year survival rates approaching 90%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are divided into subtypes based on  cell  type  and  immunophenotypic  and  genetic  features. Th ey can be of B-cell, T-cell, or natural killer cell origin. Treatment and prognosis vary widely depending on subtype. Chemotherapy is the fi rst-line treatment for most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be used in refractory cases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leukemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Leukemia is the uncontrolled production of leukocytes owing to cancerous mutation of lymphogenous or myelogenous cells. Lymphocytic  leukemias  begin  in  lymph  nodes  and  myeloid leukemias  begin  as  cancerous  production  of  myelogenous cells  in  bone marrow with spread to extramedullary organs. Th e principal di ff erence between normal hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia cells is the ability of the latter to continue to divide. Th e result is an expanding mass of cells that in fi ltrates the bone marrow, and renders patients functionally aplastic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 23 CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia  may  be  profound.  Eventually,  bone  marrow  failure leads to fatal infection or hemorrhage caused by thrombocytopenia.  Leukemia  cells  may  also  in fi ltrate  the  liver,  spleen, lymph nodes, and meninges, producing signs of dysfunction at these sites. Extensive use of nutrients by rapidly proliferating cancerous cells depletes amino acid stores, which leads to patient fatigue and metabolic starvation of normal tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia-also known as acute lymphocytic  leukemia -is  the  most  common  leukemia  in  children but  also  occurs  in  adults.  Central  nervous  system  dysfunction  is  common.  A ff ected  patients  are  highly  susceptible  to life-threatening opportunistic infections, including infections caused by Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly Pneumocystis carinii ) and cytomegalovirus. Chemotherapy can cure as many as 80% of children and 40% of adults.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia usually occurs in adults older than 55 years and is more common in men than in women. Th is form of leukemia rarely occurs in children. Th e diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is con fi rmed by the presence of  lymphocytosis  and  lymphocytic  in fi ltrates  in  bone  marrow. Signs and symptoms are highly variable, with the extent of  bone  marrow  in fi ltration  o ft en  determining  the  clinical course.  Autoimmune  hemolytic  anemia  and  hypersplenism that results in pancytopenia may be prominent. Lymph node enlargement  may  obstruct  the  ureters.  Corticosteroids  may be useful in treating the hemolytic anemia, but splenectomy may occasionally be necessary. Single or combination chemotherapy is the usual treatment, with radiation therapy reserved for treatment of localized nodal masses or an enlarged spleen. Five-year survival is approximately 75%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by an increase in the number of myeloid cells in bone marrow and arrest of their  maturation,  which  frequently  results  in  hematopoietic insu ffi ciency (granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia). Clinical signs and symptoms of AML are diverse and nonspeci fi c, but they are usually attributable to leukemic in fi ltration of the bone marrow. Approximately one third of patients with AML have signi fi cant or life-threatening infection when initially seen. Other patients present with complaints of fatigue, bleeding gums or nosebleeds, pallor, and/or headache. Dyspnea on exertion is common due to severe anemia. Leukemic in fi ltration  of  various  organs  (hepatomegaly,  splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy),  bones,  gingiva,  and  the  central  nervous system  can  produce  a  variety  of  signs.  Hyperleukocytosis (>100,000 cells/mm 3 )  can  result  in  signs  of  leukostasis  with ocular and cerebrovascular dysfunction or bleeding. Metabolic abnormalities may include hyperuricemia and hypocalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chemotherapy is administered to induce remission. Fiveyear survival varies from 15% to 70% depending on tumor cell cytogenics and age at diagnosis. Bone marrow transplantation may be a consideration in patients who do not have an initial remission or who experience relapse a ft er chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Retinoic acid syndrome is a unique, potentially lethal complication of induction therapy in patients with acute promyelocytic  leukemia.  It  is  o ft en  but  not  exclusively  associated with treatment with alltrans retinoic acid (tretinoin). Respiratory distress, pulmonary in fi ltrates, fever, and hypotension are common presenting symptoms. Th e  etiology  is  unclear,  but it  may  be  related  to  release  of  cytokines  from  myeloid  cells, which causes capillary leak syndrome. High-dose corticosteroid  administration  is  the  most  commonly  employed  treatment for retinoic acid syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (also known as chronic myeloid leukemia ) manifests as myeloid leukocytosis with splenomegaly. In  most  cases,  there  is  a  prolonged  dormant  phase  in  which patients are asymptomatic. Th e disease then progresses through an accelerated phase followed by blast crisis. Th is latter condition resembles acute leukemia and signals a poor prognosis. High leukocyte counts may predispose to vascular occlusion. Hyperuricemia is common and is treated with allopurinol. Cytoreduction  therapy  with  hydroxyurea,  chemotherapy,  leukapheresis, and splenectomy may be necessary. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is treated with chemotherapeutic agents such as imatinib, which are targeted to the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Th is drug is successful in the vast majority of patients. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or other combined chemotherapies are alternatives if primary treatment is unsuccessful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation o ff ers an opportunity for  cure  for  several  otherwise  fatal  diseases.  Hematopoietic stem cells can be obtained from peripheral blood or from bone marrow. Autologous bone marrow transplantation entails collection of the patient's own bone marrow for subsequent reinfusion, whereas allogeneic transplantation uses bone marrow or  peripheral  blood  elements  from  an  immunocompatible donor. Regardless of the type of bone marrow transplantation, recipients must undergo a preprocedural regimen designed to achieve functional bone marrow ablation. Th is is produced by a combination of total body irradiation and chemotherapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bone  marrow  is  usually  harvested  by  repeated  aspirations from the posterior iliac crest. For allogeneic bone marrow  transplantation  with  major  AB  incompatibility  between donor and recipient, it is necessary to remove mature erythrocytes from the gra ft to  avoid a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Removal of T cells from the allogra ft can decrease the risk of gra ft -versus-host disease. Processing of the harvested bone marrow  may  take  2  to  12  hours. Th e  condensed  volume  of bone marrow (approximately 200 mL) is then infused into the recipient through a central venous catheter. From the systemic circulation, the bone marrow cells pass into the recipient's bone marrow, which provides the microenvironment necessary for

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
maturation and di ff erentiation of the cells. Th e time necessary for bone marrow engra ft ment is usually 10 to 28 days, during which time protective isolation of the patient is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia for Bone Marrow Transplantation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General or regional anesthesia is used during aspiration of bone marrow from the iliac  crests.  Use  of  nitrous  oxide  might  be avoided in the donor because of potential bone marrow depression associated with this drug. However, there is no evidence that nitrous oxide administered during bone marrow harvesting adversely a ff ects marrow engra ft ment and subsequent function.  Substantial fl uid  losses  may  accompany  this  procedure. Blood  replacement  may  be  necessary,  either  by  autologous blood  transfusion  or  by  reinfusion  of  separated  erythrocytes obtained  during  the  harvest.  Perioperative  complications  are rare, although discomfort at bone puncture sites is predictable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications of Bone Marrow Transplantation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  prolonged  myelosuppression,  bone  marrow transplantation is associated with several speci fi c complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gra ft -versus-host disease (GVHD) is a life-threatening complication of bone marrow transplantation manifesting as organ system dysfunction that most o ft en involves the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (Table 23-5). Severe rash, jaundice, and diarrhea are usually seen. Th is response occurs when immunologically  competent  T  lymphocytes  from  the  donor  gra ft target proteins on the recipient's cells. Th ese proteins are usually human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are encoded by the major histocompatibility complex. Even when the patient and  host  are  matched  for  HLAs,  minor  histocompatibility antigens can provoke GVHD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GVHD can be divided into two somewhat distinct clinical entities:  acute  disease,  which  usually  occurs  during  the fi rst 30 to 60 days a ft er bone marrow transplantation, and chronic disease, which develops at least 100 days a ft er transplantation. Th e incidence of acute GVHD is directly associated with the degree  of  incompatibility  between  HLA  proteins.  It  ranges from 35% to 45% in fully matched sibling donors to 60% to 80% in patients with a single HLA mismatch. Patients undergoing  allogeneic  bone  marrow  transplantation  receive  prophylaxis to prevent acute GVHD. Th ese treatments are mainly directed at minimizing the host's immune response. Examples of agents used are tacrolimus and cyclosporine, which inhibit calcineurin, an enzyme that is important for T-cell activation. When it  occurs,  acute  GVHD  is  usually  treated  with  highdose  steroids.  Extracorporeal  photopheresis  is  an  emerging treatment for acute GVHD that involves removal of a patient's white blood cells and their exposure to ultraviolet light, followed  by  reinfusion  into  the  patient. Th is  process  induces cellular  apoptosis,  which  in  turn  prompts  an  acute  antiinfl ammatory response that appears to reduce the risk of gra ft rejection.

Chronic  GVHD  shares  features  typical  of  autoimmune diseases.  Symptoms  include  sclerosis  of  the  skin,  xerostomia,  fasciitis,  myositis,  transaminitis,  pericarditis,  nephritis, and restrictive lung disease. Th e  pathophysiology of chronic GVHD is poorly understood, so treatments are limited. Prophylaxis  against  acute  GVHD  appears  to  reduce  the  risk  of chronic GVHD. Extracorporeal photopheresis has shown bene fi t in some studies. Steroids remain the mainstay of treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GRAFT REJECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gra ft rejection occurs when immunologically competent cells of host origin destroy the cells of donor origin. Th is is rarely seen with transplants from well-matched related donors but can occur with transplants from other donors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  include  infection,  adult  respiratory  distress syndrome,  chemotherapy-induced  lung  damage,  and  interstitial pneumonitis. When interstitial pneumonitis occurs 60 days or longer a ft er bone marrow transplantation, it is most likely due to cytomegalovirus or fungal infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SINUSOIDAL OBSTRUCTION SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sinusoidal  obstruction  syndrome-formerly  called venoocclusive  disease  of  the  liver -may  occur  following  allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and appears to be related to high-dose radiation exposure. Primary symptoms include jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, ascites, and weight gain. Th e syndrome can manifest within days or as late as  a  year  a ft er  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Progressive hepatic and multiorgan failure can develop, and the mortality rate approaches 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Stimulation of oncogene formation by carcinogens (tobacco, alcohol, sunlight) is estimated to be responsible for 80% of cancers in the United States. Tobacco accounts for  more  cases  of  cancer  than  all  other  known  carcinogens combined. Th e fundamental event that causes cells to become malignant is an alteration in the structure of their DNA. Th e responsible mutations occur in cells of target tissues, with these cells then becoming the ancestors of the entire future tumor cell population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 23 CANCER

<!-- PAGE=? -->
515

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ A commonly used staging system for solid tumors is the TNM system based on tumor size (T), lymph node involvement (N), and distant metastasis (M). Th is system further groups cancers into stages ranging from I (best prognosis) to IV (poorest prognosis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Drugs administered for cancer chemotherapy may produce signi fi cant  adverse  e ff ects,  including  cardiomyopathy,  pulmonary fi brosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Th ese adverse e ff ects may have important implications for the management of  anesthesia  during  surgical  procedures  for  cancer  treatment as well as during operations unrelated to the cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Many  patients  with  cancer  exhibit  paraneoplastic  syndromes, some of which are related to ectopic hormone production and others of which are caused by the host's immune response  to  the  tumor  cells.  Examples  include  SIADH, Cushing's syndrome, and Eaton-Lambert syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Mass e ff ects of tumors or metastases can cause lifethreatening oncologic crises. Superior vena cava syndrome results from spread of cancer into the mediastinum or caval wall  that  causes  engorgement  of  the  jugular  and  upper extremity veins and diminished venous return to the heart. Increased intracranial pressure as a result of increased cerebral  venous  pressure  can  lead  to  nausea,  seizures,  and/or diminished  consciousness.  Superior  mediastinal  syndrome exists when tracheal compression accompanies superior vena cava syndrome. Other examples of mass-e ff ect conditions are spinal cord compression and increased intracranial pressure resulting from metastases to the central nervous system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cancer is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized  patients.  It  re fl ects  local  osteolytic  activity  from bone  metastases  (especially  in  breast  cancer)  or  ectopic parathyroid hormonal activity associated with tumors that arise  from  the  kidneys,  lungs,  pancreas,  or  ovaries. Th e rapid onset of hypercalcemia that occurs in patients with cancer  may  manifest  as  lethargy  or  coma.  Polyuria  and dehydration may accompany hypercalcemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Induction  chemotherapy  or  high-dose  radiation  therapy can  destroy  large  numbers  of  tumor  cells  and  result  in tumor  lysis  syndrome,  a  major  feature  of  which  is  acute hyperuricemic  nephropathy  resulting  from  precipitation of  uric  acid  crystals  and  calcium  phosphate  in  the  renal tubules.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Hematopoietic  stem  cell  transplantation  is  a  potentially lifesaving  treatment  for  many  types  of  cancer,  but  it  has serious potential complications.  GVHD  occurs  when immunologically competent T lymphocytes from a donor gra ft target proteins on the recipient's cells and incite a profound immune response. GVHD manifests as organ system dysfunction, most o ft en involving the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract.  Sinusoidal  obstruction syndrome is marked by sudden onset of jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, ascites, and weight gain. Th e syndrome can manifest within days or as late as a year a ft er hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Progressive hepatic and multiorgan failure can develop, and mortality is high.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cancer patients may experience acute pain associated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, pathologic fractures,  and  tumor  invasion.  A  frequent  source  of  pain  is metastatic spread of the cancer, especially to bone. Nerve compression or in fi ltration may be a cause of pain. Patients with cancer who experience frequent and signi fi cant pain o ft en exhibit signs of depression and anxiety.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Drug therapy is  the  cornerstone  of  cancer  pain  management because of its e ffi cacy, rapid onset of action, and relatively low cost. Mild to moderate cancer pain is initially treated with acetaminophen and/or NSAIDs. NSAIDs are particularly e ff ective for managing bone pain. Th e next step in management is the addition of codeine or one of its analogues.  When cancer pain is severe, more potent opioids are employed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Spinal opioids may be delivered for weeks to months via a long-term, subcutaneously tunneled, exteriorized catheter or an implanted drug delivery system. Implantable systems can be intrathecal or epidural. Patients are typically considered for neuraxial opioid administration when systemic opioid administration has failed as a result of intolerable adverse e ff ects or inadequate analgesia. Neuraxial administration of opioids is usually successful, but some patients require the addition of a dilute concentration of local anesthetic  to  the  neuraxial  infusion  to  achieve  adequate  pain control.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Important  aspects  of  determining  the  suitability  of  a destructive nerve block are the location and quality of the pain, the e ff ectiveness of less destructive treatment modalities, life expectancy, the inherent risks associated with the block, and the availability of experienced anesthesiologists to perform the procedure. In general, constant pain is more amenable to destructive nerve block than intermittent pain.
