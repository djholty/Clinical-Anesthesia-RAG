This consensus statement presents a comprehensive and evidence-based set of guidelines for the care of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in both adult and pediatric populations. The guidelines are established by an international panel of experts under the auspices of the American Society of Enhanced Recovery and Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia based on a comprehensive search and review of literature up to September 2019. The guidelines provide recommendation on identifying high-risk patients, managing baseline PONV risks, choices for prophylaxis, and rescue treatment of PONV as well as recommendations for the institutional implementation of a PONV protocol. In addition, the current guidelines focus on the evidence for newer drugs (eg, second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 [5-HT 3 ] receptor antagonists, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists, and dopamine antagonists), discussion regarding the use of general multimodal PONV prophylaxis, and PONV management as part of enhanced recovery pathways. This set of guidelines have been endorsed by 23 professional societies and organizations from different disciplines (Appendix 1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
What Other Guidelines Are Available on This Topic?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Guidelines currently available include the 3 iterations of the consensus guideline we previously published, which was last updated 6 years ago 1-3 ; a guideline published by American Society of Health System Pharmacists in 1999 4 ; a brief discussion on PONV management as part of a comprehensive postoperative care guidelines 5 ; focused guidelines published by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, 6  the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain & Ireland 7  and the Association of Perianesthesia Nursing 8 ; and several guidelines published in other languages. 9-12

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Why Was This Guideline Developed?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The current guideline was developed to provide perioperative practitioners with a comprehensive and up-to-date, evidence-based guidance on the risk stratification, prevention, and treatment of PONV in both adults and children. The guideline also provides guidance on the management of PONV within enhanced recovery pathways.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
How Does This Guideline Differ From Existing Guidelines?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The previous consensus guideline was published 6 years ago with a literature search updated to October 2011. Several guidelines, which have been published since, are either limited to a  specific  populations 7   or  do  not  address  all  aspects  of  PONV  management. 13   The  current guideline was developed based on a systematic review of the literature published up through September 2019. This includes recent studies of newer pharmacological agents such as the second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT 3 ) receptor antagonists, a dopamine antagonist, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists as well as several novel combination therapies. In addition, it also contains an evidence-based discussion on the management of PONV in enhanced recovery pathways. We have also discussed the implementation of a general multimodal PONV prophylaxis in all at-risk surgical patients based on the consensus of the expert panel.   (Anesth Analg 2020;131:411-48)

N ausea and vomiting are two of the most common  adverse  events  in  the  postoperative period with an estimated incidence of 30% in the  general  surgical  population  and  as  high  as  80% in  high  risk  cohorts. 14 This  can  be  a  highly  distressing  experience  and  is  associated  with  significant patient dissatisfaction. 15,16  In addition, the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is also associated with a significantly longer stay in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), 17  unanticipated hospital admission, 18  and increased health care costs. 19

pharmacokinetics,  efficacy,  and  side-effect  profiles, thus the choice of an antiemetic will depend on the clinical context. The benefit of PONV prophylaxis also needs to be balanced with the risk of adverse effects. At an institutional level, the management of PONV is  also  influenced  by  factors  such  as  cost-effectiveness, drug availability, and drug formulary decisions. While there are several published guidelines on the management  of  PONV,  they  are  limited  to  specific patient  populations, 6,7 do  not  address  all  aspects  of PONV management in sufficient detail, 5,13  or are not up to date with current literature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our  group  has  previously  published  3  iterations of  the  PONV  consensus  guideline  in  2003,  2009, and  2014, 1-3   with  the  aim  of  providing  comprehensive,  evidence-based  clinical  recommendations  on the management of a PONV in adults and children. A  systematic  literature  search  identified  over  9000 published studies since the last consensus guideline (literature  search  up  to  October  2011).  In  addition, the  establishment  of  enhanced  recovery  pathways (ERPs) has led to a significant paradigm shift in the approaches to perioperative care. We therefore present this update to incorporate the findings of the most recent studies into our recommendations.

METHODS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Goals of the Guidelines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The goals of the current guidelines were established by the panels as follows: (1) identify reliable predictors of PONV risks in adults and postoperative vomiting (POV) risk in children; (2) establish interventions which reduce the baseline risk for PONV; (3) assess the efficacy of individual antiemetic and combination therapies for PONV prophylaxis including nonpharmacological  interventions;  (4)  ascertain  the  efficacy

of  PONV  and  postdischarge  nausea  and  vomiting (PDNV) treatment with or without prior PONV prophylaxis; (5) determine the optimal dosing and timing of antiemetic prophylaxis; (6) appraise the cost-effectiveness of PONV management strategies; (7) create an algorithm to summarize the risk stratification, risk reduction,  prophylaxis,  and  treatment  of  PONV;  (8) evaluate the management of PONV within ERPs; and (9) propose a research agenda for future studies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Establishment of the Expert Panel

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The  consensus  guideline  was  established  based  on available published clinical evidence, which was reviewed by an international multidisciplinary expert panel. Panel members were invited on a basis of significant contributions in the field of PONV research or representation in professional societies with interest in PONV management, many of whom were also involved in the previous iterations of the guidelines. Panel members were asked to work in groups-each focusing on a given topic-and review the literature identified from the literature search. The first group assessed the risk factors for PONV. Two groups investigated the efficacy of  pharmacological  and  nonpharmacological  interventions for prophylaxis and treatment in adults. The fourth group reviewed the different combination therapies.  The  fifth  group  appraised  the  literature  on  antiemetic therapy within ERPs. The sixth group evaluated the literature on economics and designed the treatment algorithms. The seventh group analyzed pediatric antiemetic prophylaxis and treatment. The findings were then summarized and presented at the consensus meeting. After reviewing the evidence presented, the panel was then asked to reach a consensus on the interpretation and grading of the evidence as well as its clinical relevance. When a consensus was not reached, the majority view was presented, and the lack of full agreement was acknowledged in the guideline.

Literature Search and Review

<!-- PAGE=? -->
With  the  help  of  a  research  librarian  experienced  in search strategy development (Marina Englesakis, University  Health  Network,  Toronto,  ON,  Canada), who was working with a coauthor (F.C.) with input  from  the  members  of  the  consensus  panel,  a standardized literature search was performed to include  publications  from  January  2011  to  February 2019. Continued  literature surveillance  was  done through  September  2019.  The  searching  process  followed  the  Cochrane  Handbook 20   and  the  Cochrane Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews  (MECIR) 21   for  conducting  the  search,  the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses  (PRISMA)  guideline 22,23   for  reporting the search, and the Peer Review of Electronic Search

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All of the following databases used were searched from the inception of the review over the Ovid platform for all topics: Ovid MEDLINE(R); Ovid MEDLINE(R) Epub Ahead of Print  and  In-Process  &  Other  NonIndexed Citations; Embase Classic+Embase; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preliminary  searches  were  conducted,  and  fulltext literature was mined for potential keywords and appropriate  controlled  vocabulary  terms  (Medical Subject Headings for Medline and EMTREE descriptors for Embase).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Our  search  was  restricted  to  studies  in  adults ≥ 18 years  of  age  and  published  in  the  English  language with the exception of the search on pediatric antiemetic prophylaxis and treatment. All duplicate records were removed. Members of the team also manually searched the reference lists of included studies for other relevant studies.  The  relevant  findings  of  the  included  studies were noted and aggregated according to the topic. The full  search strategies used in Medline for the different questions are shown in Supplemental Digital Content, Appendix 2, http://links.lww.com/AA/D80.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Grading of Evidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For the purposes of characterizing the quality of evidence for each intervention, we used a grading system similar  to  that  in  the  previous  guidelines  (Table  1), 3 which  was  previously  reported  by  the  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) in their acute pain management practice guideline. 3,25   This  provides  an objective  standard  against  which  clinical  evidence could be compared.

RESULTS

Guideline 1. Identify Patients' Risk for PONV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk Factors. The  previous guidelines identified independent  risk  factors  that  were  significant  in multivariable analyses of large cohort studies. Patient-specific  risk  factors  for  PONV  in  adults include  female  sex,  a  history  of  PONV  and/or motion sickness, nonsmoking status, and young age (evidence B1). 14,26-31  Certain types of surgery may be associated with an increased risk of PONV including laparoscopic,  bariatric,  gynecological  surgery,  and cholecystectomy (evidence B1). 26,28,31-34  The main risk factors  and  their  relative  contribution  are  summarized in Figure 1. 35  As discussed in the previous versions of the guidelines, studies regarding other commonly discussed  factors  reported  limited  clinical  value (eg, anxiety 36 ), uncertain significance (eg, menstrual cycle, 37 neostigmine, 38,39 and perioperative fasting 40 ), or demonstrated no association with PONV

PONV from nitrous oxide avoidance is 128; the NNT decreases to 23 in anesthesia lasting over an hour, and to 9 in anesthesia lasting over 2 hours. 53  In addition, nitrous  oxide  is  commonly  used  for  labor  analgesia and is  associated  with  the  risk  of  nausea  and  vomiting. 54   In  patients  who  subsequently  require  emergency cesarean delivery (CD), the use of nitrous oxide may interact with the other perioperative PONV risk factors; however, this is not well studied. 55

Patient  Risk  Assessment  for  PONV. PONV risk factors should  be  used  for  risk  assessment  and  to  guide PONV  management. 3 Several recent publications have  challenged  the  utilization  of  risk  factors  to guide management  and  propose  a  more  liberal administration of PONV prophylaxis in patients with lower  risk  of  PONV. 3,57 The  utility  of  this  approach requires  further  validation  with  particular  focus  on the incidence of antiemetic side effects. The National Anesthesia  Clinical  Outcomes  Registry  (NACOR) and the Anesthesiology Quality Institute (AQI) created  customized  data  on  antiemetic  prophylaxis, which has been evaluated and utilized as a marker of  anesthesia  quality  and  a  measure  of  disparity  in

<!-- PAGE=? -->
treatment. 58  The study found that 53% of the patients received ondansetron and/or dexamethasone prophylaxis, and only 17% received both ondansetron and dexamethasone. An objective assessment of risk factors should be taken into consideration to inform and adjust treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk  Scores. PONV  risk  scores  have  been  shown to  reduce the rate of PONV at an institutional level and  can  be  used  to  inform  and  guide  therapy. 59-61 Commonly used risk scores for inpatients undergoing anesthesia  are  the  Koivuranta  score  and  the  Apfel score. 14,30   The  Apfel  simplified  risk  score  is  based on  4  predictors:  female  sex,  history  of  PONV  and/ or  motion  sickness,  nonsmoking  status,  and  use  of postoperative  opioids  (Figure  2). 14   The  incidence of  PONV with the presence of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 risk factors  is  approximately  10%,  20%,  40%,  60%,  and 80%, respectively. 14  The panel classifies patients with 0-1, 2, or 3-plus risk factor into 'low,' 'medium,' and 'high' risk categories, respectively. Koivuranta score includes the 4 Apfel risk predictors as well as length of  surgery  >60  minutes. 30   Some experts and limited publications have suggested 1 or 2 antiemetics should be  administered  to  all  patients  since  risk  scores  are not completely predictive. 3,57  Risk scores represent an objective approach to predict the incidence of PONV or PDNV, with sensitivity and specificity of between 65% and 70%, and should be utilized as a modifier for prophylaxis.

PDNV  presents  a  significant  risk  to  discharged patients who no longer have access to fast-onset intravenous (IV) antiemetics or direct care. A study of 2170 US outpatients reported the incidence of PDNV to be 37% in the first 48 hours after discharge and identified 5 independent predictors of PDNV, including female sex, age <50 years, history of PONV, opioid use in the PACU, and nausea in the PACU. 27  Validation of a simplified  PDNV  risk  score  based  on  these  risk  factors found that the incidence of PDNV with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 of these risk factors to be about 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 60%, and 80%, respectively (Figure 3). 27

The risk factors for POV/PONV in children are different from those in adults 62-65  and are summarized in Figure  4.  Children  are  more  at  risk  for  PONV/POV when they are older than 3 years, subjected to certain surgeries-namely tonsillectomy and eye surgeries, or are postpubertal females (evidence B1). The other risk factors  are  summarized  in  the  aforementioned  figure and have been validated by Kranke et al 66  by using the Postoperative Vomiting in Children (POVOC) score. 67-69

POV/PONV in children. As  previously  proposed  by Eberhart et al, 62  POV risk in children can be predicted based on 4 criteria:  duration  of  surgery  >30  minutes; age  >3  years;  personal  or  first-degree  relative  history of POV/PONV; and strabismus surgery. Based on the presence of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 factors, the risk of POV was 9%, 10%, 30%, 55%, and 70%, respectively (Figure 5). This was subsequently verified by Kranke et al. 66

Guideline 2. Reduce Baseline Risk for PONV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Discussion. Approaches  for  decreasing  baseline  risk are  presented  in  Table  3.  Strategies  recommended to reduce baseline risk for PONV  include (1) minimization  of  perioperative  opioids  with  the  use of  multimodal  analgesic  regimens;  (2)  preferential use of RA; (3) preferential use of propofol infusions as the primary anesthetic 70,71 ; (4) avoidance of volatile anesthetics;  and  (5)  adequate  hydration  in  patients undergoing same-day surgery (Table 3).

Multimodal Systemic  Analgesia. Prophylactic  IV  acetaminophen as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen reduces nausea, only if given before the onset of pain (evidence  A1). 76   After  a  gastrectomy,  IV  acetaminophen,  in  addition  to  continuous  epidural  analgesia, showed  decreased  opioid  use  and  a  significantly reduced incidence of PONV. 77  While oral acetaminophen has also been shown to reduce opioid requirement 78   and  is  considerably  less  costly,  its  effect  on PONV is not well-studied.

inhibitors 50,79,80 and  less  so  intraoperative  ketamine 81 may have a morphine-sparing effect in the postoperative period (evidence A1). An SRMA reported that, in patients with postoperative patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), IV or intramuscular (IM) NSAIDs significantly reduced the risk of PONV, and appears to be more effective than IV acetaminophen (evidence A1). 82  However, there are data to suggest that nonselective NSAIDs are associated  with  anastomotic  leak  in  gastrointestinal (GI) surgery and should be used with caution. 83-85

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative  Dexmedetomidine. Systemic α 2 agonists  (clonidine  or  dexmedetomidine)  administration  decrease postoperative  opioid  consumption  and  PONV  (evidence A1). 86  After laparoscopic cholecystectomy, dexmedetomidine  1 μ g/kg  before  skin  incision  reduced the incidence of PONV similar to dexamethasone 8 mg and  proved  superior  in  lowering  postoperative  pain during the first 24 hours. 87  The same pain and PONV benefits were confirmed when dexmedetomidine was added to an IV sufentanil-ondansetron PCA after thoracotomy. 88  Prophylactic dexmedetomidine 0.5 μ g/kg reduced postoperative pain at 1 hour and, on postoperative days (POD) 1-3, resulted in a faster return to daily activities in ambulatory urologic surgery under inhalation general anesthesia (GA). However, there was no difference versus the placebo in the incidence of PONV or  use  of  antiemetics. 89 Similarly,  intraoperative  infusion of esmolol, a short-acting β -antagonist have been shown to reduce PACU opioid requirement as well as PONV risk (evidence A3). 52

Neuraxial Anesthesia. A  meta-analysis  showed that epidural  anesthesia  significantly  decreases  the  risk  of PONV,  whereas  intrathecal  opioids  may  promote PONV. 90   To  be  effective  after  gynecological  surgery, epidural anesthesia administration may need to be continued after surgery and at a sufficient concentration (eg, lidocaine 10 mg/mL or equivalent). 91  After open colorectal cancer surgery, thoracic epidural anesthesia demonstrated significantly better pain control than IV morphine and with less PONV. 92  Bilateral transversus abdominis  plane  block  (TAP)  decreases  postoperative opioid use and PONV after abdominal surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional  Anesthesia. In  colorectal  surgery,  continuous subfascial plane infusion of ropivacaine and fentanyl IV PCA demonstrated comparable risk of PONV (evidence A3). 94   Conversely,  continuous  local  anesthetic wound infiltration or epidural anesthesia for 48 hours after  open  gastrectomy  was  associated  with  lower morphine  consumption,  less  PONV,  and  a  shorter LOS than morphine PCA (evidence A3). 95  In a review of 18 studies that compared PONV outcomes between RA containing enhanced recovery programs and nonregional anesthesia containing care pathways, 5 found the RA to have improved PONV, 1 found PONV to be higher in the RA group (total knee arthroplasty under spinal  anesthesia  versus  TIVA  with  propofol  and remifentanil 96 ), and 12 found no difference. 97

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Propofol  TIVA. An  SRMA  of  RCTs  showed  that  the PONV  risk  with  propofol  TIVA  is  comparable  to volatile anesthesia plus single-agent prophylaxis (5-hydroxytryptamine 3 [5-HT3] receptor antagonists and droperidol; evidence A1). 71  When used in combination with other prophylactic agents, propofol TIVA further  reduces  the  risk  of  PONV  (evidence A2). 98,99 Subhypnotic doses of propofol infusion, in combination with an antiemetic, also significantly reduced the incidence of PONV (evidence A2). 100,101

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Supplemental  Oxygen. An  SRMA of RCTs showed that supplemental oxygen was not associated with significant change in the overall risk of PONV, but the risk of early vomiting in abdominal surgery was lower. 42

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Novel Interventions. Since the last iteration of the guideline,  a  new  Cochrane  SRMA  identified  6  studies comparing the risk of PONV in patients, who had neuromuscular junction  blockade  reversed  with  sugammadex compared to neostigmine, and reported that the PONV risk is lower with sugammadex (NNT = 16). 75 The quality of evidence was limited, however, due to inclusion of open-label studies as well as risk of bias due to unclear baseline PONV risk of the participants.

Weibel et al 102   conducted an SRMA on the use of IV lidocaine and PONV and reported that in laparoscopic abdominal procedures, the PONV risk is lower with  lidocaine  infusion.  No  benefit  was  seen  with other surgery types. 103

in  children. 104-109   Opioid-sparing  techniques  remain  a mainstay in reducing baseline risk for POV/PONV. RA, most commonly caudal blocks with or without systemic dexamethasone under GA have previously been reported as safe and effective at reducing pain, opioid requirements,  and  rates  of  emesis  in  children. 110 The panel believes that other regional analgesia techniques, such as TAP blocks, may also help in reducing opioid requirements.  In  settings  where  regional  blocks  are contraindicated  or  not  available,  systemic  non-opioid analgesia may be viable alternatives.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
IV lidocaine has been reported to reduce the risk of POV in a double-blinded RCT of 92 children undergoing tonsillectomy. Children receiving a 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine bolus followed by a 2 mg/kg/h lidocaine infusion were 62% less likely to have POV compared to children with saline infusion ( P = .024). 107

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two studies assessed α 2 agonists  and  their  influence on PONV. An SRMA, while statistically heterogeneous, found reduced rates of PONV as a secondary outcome in children receiving intranasal dexmedetomidine  for  separation  anxiety  when  compared  to intranasal  or  oral  midazolam  (evidence  A1). 111   In  a randomized double-blinded study, the oral clonidine group had significantly less  episodes  of  PONV  and need for rescue antiemetics compared to the placebo group. 108  Further evidence is needed in children, but α 2 agonists warrant consideration in multimodal regimens aimed at reducing PONV risk in children.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Two studies compared perioperative IV acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) to saline and found a significantly reduced risk of PONV in the acetaminophen group. One of  the  studies  analyzed  96  children  and  found that  the  incidence  of  POV  during  the  first  6  hours postoperatively was significantly lower in the preoperative acetaminophen group than in the placebo and postoperative  acetaminophen  groups  ( P <  .001). 106 The other study reviewed had 90 children undergoing strabismus surgery and found that rates of PONV were  significantly  lower  in  the  dexamethasone  and acetaminophen groups compared to dexamethasone only group 112  (evidence A2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liberal  fluid  therapy  remains  a  well-established intervention for reducing baseline risk of POV as previously stated in multiple studies from the 2014 guidelines. Further evidence from a single RCT involving 150 children supports our recommendations of liberal therapy with lactated ringer's (30 vs 10 mL/kg) being effective at reducing PONV. 109

Ondansetron. Ondansetron is the most commonly used and studied 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist and is considered the 'gold standard' in PONV management (evidence A1). 199  It has comparable antivomiting and antinausea effects when used as a single or combination medication for prophylaxis or treatment at a 4 mg IV dose or 8 mg oral disintegrating tablet with a 50% bioavailability . 200   The NNT is 6 for prevention of vomiting and 7 for nausea. The number needed to harm (NNH) is 36 for headache, 31 for elevated liver enzymes, and 23 for constipation. 143   Ondansetron  has  similar  effectiveness compared to dexamethasone 4-8 mg 201   and  haloperidol. 202  Ondansetron is less efficacious than ramosetron 0.3  mg  IV , 144,203,204 granisetron  1-3  mg, 205   palonosetron 0.075 mg, 206-208 aprepitant 80 mg orally, 115  and fosaprepitant 150 mg IV. 209  Ondansetron is more efficacious than metoclopramide 10 mg IV 210  and dexmedetomidine. 211

Tropisetron. Tropisetron is a competitive and selective 5-HT3  receptor  antagonist  and  has  antinausea  and antiemetic properties used mostly for chemotherapyinduced  nausea  and  vomiting  (CINV).  While  not approved in the United States,  it  is  used  in  Europe and Asia.  NNT  for  prevention  of  nausea  is  6.7  and 5  for  vomiting  (evidence A1). 157   The  manufacturer's recommended dosing for tropisetron is 2 mg IV; however doses of up to 10 mg IV have been used in clinical trials. 157  Tropisetron 5 mg IV before the start of anesthesia has been found effective for PONV prevention for  breast  and  gynecologic  surgery. 214   Larger  doses appear to have a longer clinical duration. 215  There are no changes from the previous guidelines.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ramosetron. Ramosetron is a second-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist licensed in Japan and Southeast Asia and approved for the treatment of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in  males.  The  most  effective  adult  dose  and route  of  administration  for  PONV  prevention  and treatment is 0.3 mg IV. 152  Side effects include drowsiness,  dizziness,  muscle  pain,  sedation,  constipation, and diarrhea. For PONV prevention, ramosetron 0.3 mg was more effective than ondansetron 4 mg 216  (evidence A1).  When  added  to  a  PCA  opioid  infusion, ramosetron 0.3 mg was more effective than placebo, dexamethasone 10 mg, or palonosetron 0.075 mg. 217 For PONV treatment, ramosetron 0.3 mg has similar effectiveness as ondansetron 4 mg. 218

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Palonosetron. As  a  second-generation  5-HT 3 receptor antagonist, palonosetron has a 40-hour half-life, allosteric  binding,  positive  cooperativity,  receptor  internalization,  and  5-HT 3 /neurokinin  1  (NK1)  receptor inhibition. 219,220 In  several  meta-analysis  studies 146-148 of PONV prevention, palonosetron 0.075 mg was more effective than ondansetron 4 and 8 mg, granisetron 1 mg, dexamethasone 5 and 8 mg, dolasetron 12.5 mg, tropisetron  2  mg,  and  ramosetron  0.3  mg  (evidence A1).  Palonosetron  has  similar  effectiveness  to  aprepitant  40  mg  per  os  (PO). 116   Palonosetron  combined with  sevoflurane/N2O  anesthesia  reduced  the  incidence of PONV as much as a total TIVA technique. 221 Combining  palonosetron  with  TIVA  reduced  PONV more than TIVA alone. 222  Combined with palonosetron 0.075  mg  prophylaxis,  those  receiving  palonosetron 0.075 mg added to a PCA infusion had less PONV than those receiving palonosetron prophylaxis alone. 223

(fosaprepitant) forms (evidence A1). 3  All dosages (40, 80, and 125 mg) have been shown more effective in reducing  the  incidence  of  POV  rather  than  nausea. Aprepitant 40 mg orally has the same PONV prevention effect as palonosetron 0.075 mg IV. 116  Aprepitant 40 and 80 mg orally is more efficacious than ondansetron. 115,224  Fosaprepitant (a prodrug of aprepitant) 150 mg IV is more efficacious than ondansetron. 209,225-227  In a meta-analysis which compared aprepitant to various other antiemetics and placebo, aprepitant reduced the incidence of vomiting on both POD 1 and 2; however, the quality of evidence was limited by the significant heterogeneity in the results. 117  In addition, provisional data  from  a  Cochrane  network  meta-analysis  by Weibel et al 102   suggest that NK1 receptor antagonist monotherapy has similar efficacy to several combination therapies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NK1 receptor antagonists may be useful prophylactic antiemetics when postoperative emesis is highly undesirable,  such  as  in  gastric  and  neurosurgery. Further study is needed on the effect of NK1 receptor antagonists on opioid requirements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Casopitant. Casopitant  has  been  shown  to  be  more effective to reduce POV than nausea (evidence A1). 119121   The use of NK1 receptor antagonists could delay the  time  to  first  vomiting  episode  compared  with ondansetron. Casopitant has not been approved for PONV use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rolapitant. Rolapitant  is  a  long-acting,  NK1  receptor antagonist which may be effective in PDNV because of its  half-life  of  180  hours.  While there was no difference between rolapitant 70 and 200 mg orally and ondansetron 4 mg IV at 24 hours, fewer study patients had  emesis  at  72  and  120  hours  (evidence  A3). 153 Rolapitant has not been approved for PONV use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vestipitant. Six  doses  (4-36  mg)  of  vestipitant  were compared  with  ondansetron  4  mg  for  treatment  of breakthrough  PONV  after  failed  ondansetron  prophylaxis. Although the overall efficacy was noninferior between vestipitant and ondansetron, vestipitant had a lower rate of emesis, suggesting that vestipitant may  possibly  be  useful  for  PONV  similar  to  other NK1 receptor antagonists (evidence A3). 228

for  PONV  prophylaxis  found  no  difference  in  antiemetic efficacy between the 4 and 5 mg vs the 8 and 10 mg dose of dexamethasone. 122  Additionally, with reference to timing, the data support the early dosing of dexamethasone at the beginning of a case rather than at the end for the prevention of PONV. 232  Dexamethasone prophylaxis resulted in comparable incidence of PONV compared to 5-HT3 receptor  antagonists  (primarily ondansetron). 122   One  exception  to  the  equivalence  between  dexamethasone  and  5-HT3  receptor antagonists may be palonosetron, which at a dose of 75 μ g showed superiority over dexamethasone 8 mg for overall PONV reduction in the 0-24 interval. 233,234

Additionally,  as  an  added  advantage  over  5-HT 3 receptor  antagonists,  dexamethasone  reduced  the need  for  analgesics  in  many  studies, 235,236   including cases  with  neuraxial  anesthesia. 237   A  meta-analysis suggested  that  the  opioid-sparing  effects  associated with  dexamethasone  use  in  PONV  do  not  appear to  be  dose-dependent, but evidence is conflicting. 238 Dexamethasone  also  improves  respiratory  parameters, 239   reduces fatigue, provides a better quality of recovery, 240  and reduces the LOS in hospital. 241

The question of safety, as it relates to dexamethasone, has been raised in numerous studies. It appears that  dexamethasone,  especially  given  in  a  single dose,  has  few  adverse  effects.  A  recent  Cochrane Database  analysis  of  37  trials  concluded  that  dexamethasone does not appear to increase the risk for postoperative  infections,  but  with  wide  confidence interval. Additionally, the included studies excluded patients at risk for delayed wound healing, making extrapolation to larger populations difficult. 242  There is  even  a  possible  suggestion  that  dexamethasone decreases  the  incidence  of  infectious  complications in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. 243 An additional review of 56 trials indicated that corticosteroids, primarily dexamethasone did not increase wound  infection  rates,  anastomotic  leak,  wound healing, bleeding, or clinically significant hyperglycemia. 244   Dexamethasone  appears  to  induce  only  a mild blood glucose elevation in patients. 245  Even in the  presence of diabetes, there is minimal evidence to  support  a  clinically  significant  increase  in  blood glucose levels with less elevations reported with the 4  mg  compared  with  higher  dose. 242,244,246,247   Higher doses of dexamethasone, above those typically used for PONV, appear to have a more significant effect on glucose levels. 248  The risk of increased bleeding with the use of dexamethasone has been raised. 249  Based on  the  limited  number  of  available  studies,  dexamethasone does not appear to significantly increase the risk of postoperative bleeding, even in tonsillectomy  patients. 250 Finally,  the  association  of  steroids and  the  possibility  of  cancer  recurrence  has  been addressed in at least 2 fairly recent studies, both in women, demonstrating no evidence for an increased risk with dexamethasone at doses of 4-10 mg. 251,252

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is some evidence that prophylaxis with multiple  doses of dexamethasone is more effective than single intraoperative dose. 253,254  Interval dosing under anesthesia may be possible in very long surgical procedures. However, it is unclear if repeated doses may increase  the  risk  of  corticosteroid-related  complications (such as infection, bleeding, and hyperglycemia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other Corticosteroids. Other corticosteroids appear to have similar efficacy to dexamethasone in terms of a reduction of PONV and analgesic effects. 255  A recent meta-analysis reported that perioperative steroids in knee arthroplasty significantly reduce postoperative pain. 256  Both low (40 mg)  and  high  (125  mg)  doses  of  methylprednisolone have been shown to be effective in reducing PONV . 255,257 In a meta-analysis of hip and knee arthroplasty patients, methylprednisolone,  in  doses  ranging  from  40  to  125 mg, was shown to reduce pain and PONV (evidence A1). 141  Not all steroids appear to have the same relative efficacy toward PONV prevention. In a trial using betamethasone 8 mg in patients undergoing elective breast cancer surgery, there was only a small effect in reducing PONV compared to placebo. 258

Antidopaminergics.

Amisulpride. Amisulpride is a dopamine D2, D3 receptors  antagonist.  It  is  an  oral  antipsychotic  (at  a  dose of 50-1200 mg/d). 259  An IV formulation was recently approved for the management of PONV. Amisulpride 5 mg is more effective than placebo in achieving complete response and reduction in nausea severity (evidence A2), 113,114 while  doses  of  1  and  20  mg  are  not effective (evidence A3). 113  When used for the treatment of established PONV, amisulpride 5 and 10 mg is more effective than placebo in patients who received no prior prophylaxis  (evidence  A3). 188   However,  in  patients who received prior PONV prophylaxis with nonantidopaminergic agents, amisulpride 10 mg but not 5 mg was more effective than placebo for the treatment of established PONV (evidence A3). 260  Administration of amisulpride is associated with mild increase in prolactin level, the clinical significance of which is unclear. Studies have reported that antiemetic dose of amisulpride was not associated with sedation, extrapyramidal side effect, or QTc prolongation. 113,114,188,260-262

Droperidol. Droperidol  is  effective  for  the  prophylaxis of PONV in doses of 0.625-1.25 mg (evidence A1). 130,132 It  is  recommended  to  be  administered  at  the  end  of surgery to optimize antiemetic efficacy in the postoperative period (evidence A1). 132  While droperidol was used as a first-line agent for PONV prophylaxis, its use has  significantly  declined  in  many  countries  following a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) black box

warning in 2001, which imposed restrictions on the use of droperidol due to the risk of sudden cardiac death when used in  doses  >25  mg. 263   Several  studies  have however suggested that antiemetic doses of droperidol are safe, are associated with only a transient prolongation in QTc comparable to that of ondansetron, and are not associated with changes in transmural dispersion of  repolarization. 264,265   The  QT  prolongation  induced by the combination of ondansetron and droperidol is not different from that induced by each drug alone. 266 A large retrospective study involving 20,122 patients who received droperidol 0.625 mg for PONV prophylaxis also found no increase in the risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. 267  A recent study found no statistically  significant difference in the risk of akathisia between  ondansetron  4  mg  (0.8%),  droperidol  0.625 mg (1.2%), and droperidol 1.25 mg (3.4%). 268  A metaanalysis confirmed that low doses of droperidol <1 mg are effective, 269  and given that adverse effects might be dose related, a dose of 0.625 mg is recommended by the panel.

Haloperidol. The use of haloperidol as an antiemetic is not  FDA approved, but interest in its use in PONV increased  following  the  FDA  black  box  warning  on droperidol. 270   Low  doses  of  0.5-2  mg  are  effective for PONV prophylaxis with efficacy and side effects, including QT prolongation, not different from those of 5-HT3  receptor  antagonists  (evidence  A1). 140,271 When given after induction of anesthesia, the efficacy and side-effect profile of haloperidol 1 mg was also not different from droperidol 0.625 mg with no extrapyramidal  side  effects  reported  in  either  group. 272 Haloperidol 2 mg administered at induction of anesthesia or at the end of surgery did not affect the risk of PONV over 24 hours. 273  When used for the treatment of established PONV in PACU, haloperidol 1 mg was not inferior to ondansetron 4 mg in the proportion of PONV-free patients at 4 and 24 hours after administration but was associated with increased sedation. 202

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Metoclopramide. The  antiemetic  efficacy  of  a  10  mg dose of metoclopramide is uncertain. An earlier metaanalysis concluded that this dose has no clinically relevant antiemetic effect. 274  However, this meta-analysis included studies by Fujii et al, which were later found to  be  fabricated. 275 A  more  recent  meta-analysis 142 excluding  the  retracted  studies  by  this  group  concluded that a 10 mg dose of metoclopramide may be effective for the prevention of PONV with an NNT of 8-10  (evidence  A1).  Metoclopramide  was,  however, not effective when used in combination with other antiemetics based on limited numbers of available studies. A  large  study  involving  3140  patients  who  received PONV prophylaxis  with  8  mg  dexamethasone,  randomized patients to placebo, metoclopramide 10, 25, or 50 mg. Only the 25 and 50 mg doses significantly reduced  PONV  (NNT  16.9  and  11.6,  respectively). 34 Extrapyramidal symptoms were rare but were significantly higher in the 25 and 50 mg groups (0.8%) compared with the 10 mg metoclopramide group (0.4%). Metoclopramide may be useful in institutions where other dopamine antagonists are not available, but otherwise may not be very efficacious.

Perphenazine. Perphenazine  is  an  atypical  antipsychotic and a dopamine receptor antagonist. Limited data  suggest  that  perphenazine  is  effective  for  the prophylaxis of PONV without increase in drowsiness or sedation, with the recommended dose being 5 mg IV (evidence A1). 149

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antihistamine. A  meta-analysis  of  trials  comparing dimenhydrinate  to  placebo  suggested  that  it  was effective  for  PONV  prophylaxis  with  an  NNT  of 8  and  5  for  the  early  and  late  postoperative  period, respectively (evidence A1). The optimal dosing, timing,  and  side-effect  profile  when  used  for  the management of PONV are however unclear. 124

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A recent study investigated the impact of 2 doses of  diphenhydramine  (25  and  50  mg)  on  quality  of recovery  following  outpatient  laparoscopic  gynecologic surgery. Only the 50 mg dose reduced the risk of PONV compared with placebo, but the quality of recovery was not different between the diphenhydramine and placebo groups (evidence A3). 276

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Data examining the use of promethazine for PONV prophylaxis are limited. When given at induction of anesthesia,  promethazine  25  mg  alone  or  12.5  mg combined with  ondansetron  2  mg  were  effective  in reducing  PONV  at  24  hours  following  middle  ear surgery. 150  The combination of promethazine 6.25 mg with granisetron 0.1 mg given at the end of surgery, followed by oral promethazine 12.5 mg and granisetron 1 mg given every 12 hours for 3 days, was more effective than promethazine alone in reducing the risk of PONV and PDNV 151  (evidence A2). Promethazine is  also  effective  for  the  treatment  of  established PONV, with doses as low as 6.25 mg being as effective  as  higher  doses  and  associated  with  less  sedation 277,278   (evidence A2). In 2006, the Institute of Safe Medication  Practices  (ISMP)  issued  a  safety  alert with  regards  to  the  administration  of  promethazine by injection; this is followed by an FDA issued black box  warning  in  2009.  The  warning  indicated  a  risk that the drug can leach out from the vein during IV administration and cause serious damage to the surrounding tissue. In addition, injecting promethazine in  an  artery  or  under  the  skin  can  cause  severe  tissue damage including gangrene. As a result of these risks, the FDA stated that deep intramuscular administration is the preferred route of administration. The

Anticholinergics. Transdermal scopolamine is effective for  PONV  prophylaxis  in  PACU  and  for  24  hours postoperatively, with NNT = 6. Onset of effect is 2-4 hours,  and  can  be  applied  presurgery  or  the  night before.  Adverse  events  are  generally  mild,  most commonly  visual disturbances, dry mouth, and dizziness (evidence A1). 154,155

Gabapentinoids-Gabapentin and Pregabalin. Given 1-2 hours  before  surgery,  gabapentin  600-800  mg  orally has been shown to decrease PONV (evidence A1). 281-283 In  laparoscopic  cholecystectomy,  gabapentin  reduced pain severity, total morphine consumption, and PONV (25.2% vs 47.6%). Nausea and vomiting decreased as gabapentin  dosage  increased. 282,284   Preoperative  gabapentin in patients undergoing  abdominal  surgery reduced PONV. 285  Disadvantages of γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogs include sedation, visual disturbances, dizziness,  and  headache.  Gabapentin  was  associated with respiratory depression in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. 282  In 2019, FDA released a drug safety communication warning against the risk of respiratory depression when gabapentinoids are used in combination  with  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  depressants such as opioids; when used as a part of the multimodal analgesic  regimens,  intraoperative  opioids  should  be reduced and increased vigilance for may be warranted, especially in elderly patients. 286

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Midazolam. Meta-analysis showed a reduction in PON, POV, and PONV relative to controls after midazolam administration  at  induction  (evidence  A1). 287   There was no significant difference in PONV between midazolam and ondansetron given 30 minutes before the end of surgery. However, this is not recommended due to  the  possibility  of  sedation-related  adverse  events. Midazolam  combined  with  other  antiemetics  had increased  efficacy  over  single-agent  therapy.  Lower and higher dose midazolam showed no difference in PONV  efficacy  for  prophylaxis  efficacy. 288   The  incidence of PONV was significantly reduced after administration  at  the  end  of  surgery. 289   Midazolam  2  mg given 30 minutes before the end of surgery decreased PONV and was as effective as ondansetron 4 mg. 290 Limited data suggest that midazolam has similar efficacy to ondansetron in treating established PONV. 291

Ephedrine. Ephedrine  0.5  mg/kg  IM  given  near  end surgery  significantly  reduces  PONV  for  3  hours postoperatively.  Antiemetic  effect  and  need  for  rescue  are  comparable  to  droperidol  0.04  mg/kg  IM. Sedation during ambulatory surgery recovery is significantly less than placebo. Changes in mean arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were not significantly  different  from  placebo;  caution  should  be observed with patients at risk for coronary ischemia (evidence A2). 292,293

Pericardium 6  Acupuncture Point (PC6) Stimulation. An updated  Cochrane  review  including  59  trials  with 7667 subjects reported that PC6 stimulation was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of nausea,  vomiting,  and  the  need  for  rescue  antiemetics compared with sham treatment (evidence A1). 294  The review  also  included  a  comparison  of  PC6  acupoint stimulation with 6 different types of antiemetic drugs (metoclopramide, cyclizine, prochlorperazine, droperidol, ondansetron, and dexamethasone), and found no difference in nausea, vomiting, or need for rescue antiemetics  between  PC6  stimulation  and  pharmacoprophylaxis. Trial sequential analyses suggested that further sham-controlled trials or RCT versus antiemetics are unlikely to change the conclusion. On the other hand,  the  evidence  regarding  the  comparison  of  the combination of PC6 stimulation with antiemetic drugs compared to antiemetic drugs alone was of very low quality and inconclusive. The combination was more effective than antiemetic drugs alone for reducing vomiting and need for rescue antiemetics, but not nausea (evidence  A1). 294   Acupoint  stimulation  was  effective in reducing PONV regardless of whether stimulation was initiated before or after induction in anesthesia. 295 Monitoring of neuromuscular function with stimulation  applied  intraoperatively  over  the  median  nerve is  effective  in  reducing  the  incidence  of  early  PONV , especially with the use of tetanic stimulation. 296,297

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to PC6, stimulation of other acupoints has also been used for PONV prophylaxis. One RCT in 2014 reported that stimulation of both the PC6 and L14  acupoints  resulted  in  significantly  lower  incidence  of  PONV  compared  to  PC6  alone  (69.6%  vs 85.7%; P < .05). 298  Another RCT reported that bilateral acupuncture at the ST36 acupoint was associated with significantly lower risk of PONV. 299

Fluids. Adequate hydration is an effective strategy for reducing the risk of PONV. This can be achieved by minimizing perioperative fasting time, or using supplemental IV fluid to maintain clinical euvolemia. A recent  Cochrane  review  showed  that  supplemental crystalloids  (10-30  mL/kg)  reduce  the  risk  of  both early and late PONV as well as the need for rescue antiemetics  (evidence  A1). 73   There  is  no  difference between crystalloids and colloids infusion on the risk

of PONV or need for rescue antiemetics when comparable volumes are used. However, a systematic review reported that colloids were more effective in reducing the risk of PONV in surgeries lasting >3 hours, but not in those lasting <3 hours (evidence A1). 74  Dextrose solutions infused intraoperatively or postoperatively were not found to be effective in reducing the risk of PONV (evidence A1). 300

Carbohydrate Loading. Administration  of  a  preoperative  carbohydrate drink is included in many of the  ERPs.  Studies  investigating  the  impact  of  carbohydrate  drink  on  PONV  have  reported  inconsistent  results,  but  overall,  the  evidence  suggests that  it  has  no  impact  on  the  incidence  of  PONV (evidence A1). 301

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aromatherapy. A recent Cochrane review evaluated the use of aromatherapy for the treatment of PONV, and found that, overall, aromatherapy did not reduce the incidence or severity of nausea, but reduced the need for rescue antiemetics. However, the level of evidence was low. When investigating different types of aromatherapy, the review found that peppermint aromatherapy  was  no  more  effective  than  placebo  in  reducing nausea severity at 5 minutes, but isopropyl alcohol aromatherapy resulted in shorter time to 50% reduction in nausea severity, less need for rescue antiemetics, but no difference in patient satisfaction. On the other hand, isopropyl alcohol vapor inhalation did not reduce the need for rescue antiemetics (evidence A1). 302

Ginger. A  meta-analysis  investigating  the  efficacy  of ginger for PONV prophylaxis reported no reduction in  the  incidence  of  PONV,  but  a  small  reduction  in nausea scores. A subgroup analysis according to dose suggested  a  trend  for  better  outcomes  with  higher doses of 1000 mg ginger compared to lower doses, but differences were not statistically significant, so more data are needed (evidence A1). 303

Supplemental Oxygen. A meta-analysis found that high  inspired  oxygen  concentration  was  not  found to  reduce  the  incidence  of  the  composite  outcome of  PONV,  but  had  a  weak  effect  on  late  nausea.  In patients who received inhalation anesthetics and no prophylactic antiemetics, high inspired oxygen concentration  reduced  both  late  nausea  and  vomiting, but the effect was modest (evidence A1). 304

Chewing  Gum. Chewing  gum is  showing  promise  for the treatment of PONV, with 1 small pilot study suggesting that chewing gum was not inferior to ondansetron for the treatment of PONV in female patients who underwent laparoscopic or breast surgery under GA (evidence A3). 305

Others. Suggestive  techniques  (evidence A1), 306   healing touch (evidence A3), 307  and music (evidence A3) 308 were not found to be effective prophylactic modalities for PONV. Morinda citrifolia Linn (Noni fruit) was found  to  be  effective  in  reducing  the  incidence  of early nausea when used in a dose of 600 mg (evidence A3). 309   Administration  of  a  low-dose  naloxone  infusion reduces postoperative nausea and the need for rescue antiemetics (evidence A1). 310

Combination Therapies. In the review of studies on  combination  therapy  in  adults  since  the  last Consensus  Guideline,  the  panel  determined  that the recommendation remains unchanged. The panel found supporting evidence for the existing guideline and continues to recommend combination antiemetic therapy  for  patients  at  higher  risk  for  PONV.  The literature on combination of 2 or more antiemetics for prevention of PONV is robust and shows superiority over single agents for the majority of studies (evidence A1). 158-163,165,166,168-170,172,174,176,177,180-187,189,190,195,261,311-320 The use of combination therapy for prevention of PONV in  adults  is  firmly  established  in  current  anesthesia practice.

New antiemetic combination therapies have been reported.  These  include  palonosetron  0.075  mg  and dexamethasone  4  or  8  mg. 159,234,321-324   This  regimen was studied in several recent trials, with conflicting results. Bala et al 160  and Cho et al 161  found that palonosetron combined with 8 mg dexamethasone achieved significance for complete response or lower incidence of PONV over palonosetron alone while other studies  reported  no  significant  difference  compared  to palonosetron alone. 178,234,321,322,325   However, additional studies did show palonosetron in combination with other agents was efficacious. 160-164  Most notably, palonosetron plus dexamethasone had lower PONV than ondansetron  plus  dexamethasone  (evidence  A3), 326 and palonosetron plus aprepitant had lower PONV than  ramosetron  plus  aprepitant  (evidence  A3). 173 Although  the  evidence  is  mixed  on  palonosetron alone  versus  palonosetron  in  combination,  further research is needed with palonosetron in combination with other agents for prophylactic therapy.

The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are commonly used alone or in combination with dexamethasone 4 or 8 mg, and  form  the  cornerstone  of  antiemetic  prophylaxis for surgery (evidence A1). In a 2016 meta-analysis, 17 RCTs were assessed with 1402 study participants on combinations of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and dexamethasone.  The  results  were  that  the  combination therapy resulted in significantly reduced risk of PONV and  lower  rescue  antiemetic  requirement  compared to 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alone. In the subgroup analyses  of  individual  5-HT 3 receptor  antagonists, dexamethasone in combination with ondansetron and

palonosetron  significantly  reduced  24-hour  PONV compared  to  5-HT3 receptor  antagonists  alone;  the authors noted the data were insufficient for ramosetron and granisetron to reach a conclusion. 159

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Granisetron  and  tropisetron  combinations  were less frequently studied (evidence A2) and none of the evaluated studies included dolasetron as an agent for combination. 167-169,177 This  is  likely  due  to  removal  of dolasetron's different product presentations from the market  in  certain  countries  centered  on  concern  for risk of developing arrhythmia. In a 2017 study of 1350 large  and  small  bowel  patients,  the  authors  found the addition of a single dose of 8 mg dexamethasone combined with a routine antiemetic (most commonly ondansetron)  significantly  reduced  the  incidence  of PONV at 24 hours and the need for rescue antiemetics for up to 72 hours with no increase in adverse events. 327

The previous guidelines concluded that aprepitant 40 mg in combination with dexamethasone was superior to ondansetron with dexamethasone in preventing vomiting in neurosurgical patients. 3  Two studies have  reported  that  aprepitant  plus  ondansetron  is significantly more efficacious than ondansetron alone (evidence A2). 170,171  Aprepitant 40 mg orally in combination with dexamethasone is more efficacious than ondansetron with dexamethasone. 328  In a recent study comparing  aprepitant  alone  to  aprepitant  plus  scopolamine patch, there was no difference in complete response between the groups. 329  Many of the studies used higher doses of aprepitant (80 vs 40 mg) which was not as common in the 2014 guidelines. 172,174,175,318

Antihistamines  exhibit  antiemetic  benefit  but  are used less frequently than others in combination therapies, due to concern of possible sedation. Betahistine is a strong H 3 receptor antagonist, and 2 studies compared  betahistine  plus  ondansetron  to  ondansetron only for prophylaxis. Both  reported  significantly less  PONV  with  the  combination  prophylaxis. 181,182 Kizilcik et al 194   compared dexamethasone 8 mg plus dimenhydrinate  1  mg/kg  to  dexamethasone  8  mg plus ondansetron 4 mg, and reported that dexamethasone plus dimenhydrinate was more effective.

Our review of the recent literature found limited number  of  combination  studies  that  included  droperidol. 176,177,330  Matsota et al 176  found droperidol plus ondansetron is more effective than either agent alone.

Several  studies  have  reported  that  midazolam, when  used  in  combination  with  antiemetic  agents, further decreased PONV. 167,184,189,190,315,319,331 Grant conducted a meta-analysis of midazolam on PONV with  a  subgroup  analysis  of  midazolam  as  part  of combination therapy and showed increased efficacy over single-agent therapy alone (evidence A1). Grant determined it is likely that PONV can be prevented at subhypnotic doses (<0.05 mg/kg) without the many common  side  effects  associated  with  higher  dose midazolam. 288   Nevertheless,  caution  is  advised  in using midazolam for PONV.

In a clinical trial of 1147 patients, the combination of  amisulpride with ondansetron or dexamethasone was more effective than ondansetron or dexamethasone alone in reducing PONV and rescue antiemetic requirement (evidence A3). 261

Combination therapy research using more than 2 agents is emerging. Examples of triple agent combinations include aprepitant 80 mg + dexamethasone 4-8 mg + ondansetron 4 mg regimen was superior over the dual combination of dexamethasone + ondansetron in patients receiving TIVA combined with neuraxial  blockade  for  elective  laparoscopic  surgery 175 ; haloperidol 2 mg + dexamethasone 8 mg + ondansetron 8 mg which reduced PONV and need for rescue over a single agent but did not show improved efficacy over the 2 agent combination for all end points 180 ; dexamethasone 8 mg + ondansetron 4 mg + droperidol 0.625 mg was compared to placebo and reduced PONV  0-6  hours. 332   More  research  is  needed  for investigating efficacy using 3 or more pharmacological agents prophylactically. Additionally, close monitoring should be considered for possible added risk of side effects with the use of multiple agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  recent  evidence  continues  to  support the use of 2 or more antiemetics, there has not been sufficient  evidence  to  guide  the  clinician  to  select the  most  effective  individual  antiemetic  that  provides the optimal combination over other combination  therapies  with  the  exception  of  using  agents from a different pharmacologic class. 333  The selection of  agents  from  a  different  pharmacological  class  is still  recommended  to  cover  different  receptor  sites to  optimize  the  antiemetic  effect.  The  exact  mechanism is neither clearly established nor is it  clear  as to which receptor site(s) is/are triggered in a patient undergoing  surgery  and  anesthesia.  Both  nausea and  vomiting  may  be  prompted  through  a  variety of central and peripheral mechanisms. Additionally, the  least  effective  optimal  doses  to  be  used  in  the antiemetic combination have not been clearly identified.  The  studies  in  the  latest  review  have  used  a variable range of dosing strategies such as the use of weight-based dosing versus single standard dosing. In some studies, use of higher dosages than the FDAapproved  dosing  has  often  been  used.  The  higher dosing  found  in  the  current  studies  are  8  vs  4  mg dexamethasone, 80 vs 40 mg aprepitant, 8 vs 4 mg ondansetron, 1.25 vs 0.625 mg droperidol, and 10 vs 5 mg tropisetron. 158,160-162,169,172,174,176,180,182,261,311-313,316-319

or both. Another study compared the use of (1) dexamethasone 4 mg IV, (2) acupuncture in the PC6 point, (3) combination of dexamethasone and acupuncture, and reported that the combination was associated with significantly  lower  incidence  of  PONV  than  either intervention alone. 191  White et al 192  compared the use of a disposable acupressure device or a sham device applied to PC6, in combination with 4 mg dexamethasone and 4 mg ondansetron, and found that addition of PC6 acupressure significantly reduced the risk of PONV up to 72 hours postoperatively (12% vs 30%; P = .03). Two recent meta-analyses regarding acupoint stimulation  for  PONV  prophylaxis  both  concluded that  the  quality  of  evidence  for  the  use  of  acupoint stimulation as a part of combination therapy is low due to study limitations and heterogeneity. 294,334

Cost-Effectiveness. With  rising  health  care  costs,  the cost-effectiveness of therapy should be considered in determining  appropriateness  of  PONV  prophylaxis. Proper pharmacoeconomic analysis can also assess the value of using 1 particular drug or drug combination compared to another, taking into consideration both the cost of drugs and patient care. 191,335  Many studies have evaluated  the  cost-effectiveness  of  different  PONV prophylaxis therapies. 191,335-338   However, the majority of these studies are limited by variable methodologies, small sample size, and historically high drug costs as they were performed before the availability of generic antiemetics. 339,340  One point to consider in cost-effective analysis is that for every antiemetic intervention, the absolute  risk  reduction  (ARR)  and  therefore  NNT depends on the relative risk reduction (RRR), which represents  the  efficacy  of  the  intervention,  but  also the control event rate (CER), which in this case is the incidence of PONV. As a result, the higher the baseline incidence of PONV, the lower the NNT would be for any  antiemetic  intervention.  This  supports  the  use of a risk stratification system in optimizing the costeffectiveness of PONV prophylaxis. 25,341

<!-- PAGE=? -->
According  to  established  guidelines,  cost-effective analyses  should  be  conducted  from  both  the  health care sector perspective and the societal perspective. 342-345  Willingness to pay is a reliable measure of the patient perspective in cost-benefit analyses. 346  Studies by Macario et al 346 and Gan et al 347  found that patients are willing to pay approximately $30 to prevent PONV, while  Diez 348   found  parents  are  willing  to  spend approximately $80 to prevent PONV in their children. On the other hand, Dzwonczyk et al 336  found that the average hospital cost and charge per antiemetic drug dose  were  $0.304  and  $3.66,  respectively.  Thus,  the average charge to the patient for 3 antiemetic doses was <$11. From a health care sector perspective, the authors found that the hospital's net profit increased linearly with increased PONV prophylaxis administration. 336

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Modifying  the  anesthetic  regimen  can  be  a  costeffective strategy. 349  A study by Elliott et al 350  showed that  using  propofol  for  induction  and  isoflurane  for maintenance  of  GA  was  associated  with  the  lowest cost per episode of PONV avoided than an induction/ maintenance  combination  of  either  propofol/sevoflurane  or  sevoflurane/sevoflurane.  However,  given availability  of  generic  sevoflurane,  this  cost  analysis may show different results today. It may also prove cost-effective  to  reduce  baseline  risk  through  opioid minimization.  Marrett  et  al 351 reported  that  patients receiving oral immediate-release opioids in outpatient setting had higher risk of hospitalization, emergency department, and clinic visits, as well as higher health care costs due to nausea and vomiting. 351

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High emetogenic surgeries are associated with longer PACU stays and costs. 337  It is estimated that each episode  of  emesis  delays  discharge  from  the  PACU by approximately 20 minutes. 352  While it may appear significant  from  the  patient's  perspective,  the  impact from the health care cost perspective is uncertain. In a retrospective study of patients undergoing ambulatory surgery, Dexter and Tinker 353  showed that the length of  PACU stay for all  patients  would  only  have  been reduced by <5% if PONV had been eliminated in this patient population. Parra-Sanchez et al 338  performed a time-motion  economic  analysis  of  PONV  in  patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. The authors prospectively followed 100 ambulatory surgery patients from the  time  of  surgery  through  the  third  postoperative morning. The authors found that patients who experienced PONV following ambulatory surgery, 60% of them experienced symptoms following discharge. On average, patients with PONV spent 1 hour longer in the PACU, required more nursing time, and incurred greater  total  cost.  PONV  was  associated  with  an adjusted incremental total cost of $74. In bariatric surgery patients, PONV is one of the most common causes of unplanned readmission. 354  PONV does not seem to have  a  measurable  impact  on  rate  of  unanticipated admission, physician visits,  or  time  to  return  to  normal activity 338,339  However, the development of PONV is  associated  with  significantly  lower  postoperative quality of life 338   while high-risk patients demonstrate higher satisfaction with PONV prophylaxis. 355

While there is extensive evidence that multimodal prophylaxis  is  clinically  effective,  the  evidence  on cost-effectiveness  is  limited.  More  cost-effectiveness analyses are needed on PONV management.

when the risk is extremely low and the surgeries last <30 minutes, one may refrain from administering antiemetic prophylaxis. On the other hand, prophylaxis is  recommended  with  increase  in  risk  as  suggested in  Figure  4,  with  combination  therapy  for  children considered high risk for POV/PONV. Intraoperative steroids in combination with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have the strongest evidence in children. Rescue drugs should be reserved only for those in whom prophylaxis has been only partially helpful. Antiemetic drugs  and  dosages  for  POV/PONV  prophylaxis  in children are summarized in Table 6.

Propofol. There  are  now  multiple  systematic  reviews that support the use of propofol TIVA as an effective intervention  for  reducing  baseline  risk  of  PONV  in children  undergoing  strabismus  surgery  (evidence A1). A meta-analysis including 558 patients <18 years of age undergoing GA for strabismus surgery assessed the  rates  of  POV  with  TIVA  compared  to  single pharmacologic prophylaxis. The incidence of POV was similar among both groups. 104  A second meta-analysis of  762  children in 9 RCT's comparing propofol TIVA to no pharmacologic prophylaxis supported previous findings  of  reduced  rates  of  emesis  in  the  propofol group. 104  However, both reviews showed a significant risk  of  oculocardiac  reflex  and  bradycardia  requiring intervention  in  the  TIVA  groups  (evidence  A1). 104,362 The increased rates of oculocardiac reflex in propofol infusion groups have been previously reported in both the adult and pediatric populations and are presumed to  be  related  to  the  parasympathomimetic  effect  of propofol. 105,363 The incidence of this reflex in children is likely more pronounced due to naturally higher vagal tone. While TIVA is an effective antiemetic intervention in children, the benefits of antiemetic prophylaxis with propofol TIVA need to be weighed with the increased risk of bradycardic events in this group. However, this risk  may  be  overcome  with  glycopyrrolate  that  also reduces nausea and vomiting.

NK1 Receptor Antagonists. We identified one new dosefinding  multicenter  double-blinded  RCT  assessing the safety and efficacy of aprepitant in the pediatric population (evidence A3). Salman et al 356  randomized 220  children  (ages  birth-17  years)  to  10,  40  (adult recommended dose), or 125 mg of aprepitant and 0.1 mg/kg  IV  ondansetron.  The  authors  reported  that complete and partial response rates were comparable between the 10, 40, 125 mg dosing groups, which were similar to that of the ondansetron group. There was also no significant difference between the 4 groups in terms of adverse events. 356

efficacy profiles of multiple 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists in  the  pediatric  population  with  ondansetron  being the  most  recognizable  pharmacologic  agent  in  this class  (evidence  A1). 364   Recent  adult  literature  has suggested  that  palonosetron,  a  newer  generation 5-HT3  receptor  antagonist  may  be  more  effective at  reducing  PONV  due  to  its  longer  half-life  than other common  5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Two dose-finding  studies  with  palonosetron  have  since been published in children. Two hundred eighty-six children undergoing GA for dental procedures were randomized to 4 different dosing regimens of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 μ g  or  placebo.  Compared  to  the  placebo  group, PONV  was  significantly  lower  in  all  palonosetron doses with no intergroup variability in rates of PONV or  adverse  drug  events. A  single  2.5 μ g  IV  dose  of palonosetron warrants further evaluation and efficacy comparisons to ondansetron and combination therapy regimens. 360  A second study randomized 150 children into palonosetron dosing regimens of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 μ g/ kg and found significant reductions in PONV rates in all  groups,  but  there  were  no  significant  differences between dosing ranges. 361 Both studies suggest palonosetron may  be an effective antiemetic in children with minimal adverse effects, but a minimum effective dose has yet to be established (evidence A2).

Dexamethasone and Combination Therapy. Dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) is a safe and efficacious antiemetic that has  been  well  studied  in  children.  A  meta-analysis of  13  RCT's  and  2000  patients  found  significantly reduced  rates  of  PONV  in  children  receiving  single pharmacologic prophylaxis with dexamethasone. This same study also found a greater reduction when combined with ondansetron (evidence A1, Table 5). 196 There is now conflicting evidence with regards to combination therapy of dexamethasone  when combined  with  droperidol.

Guideline 5. Provide Antiemetic Treatment to Patients With PONV Who Did Not Receive Prophylaxis or When Prophylaxis Failed

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When PONV prophylaxis has failed, patients should  receive  antiemetic  treatment  from  a  different pharmacological class to the PONV prophylaxis. Administering  repeated  dose  of  antiemetics  from the same class within 6 hours does not confer additional therapeutic benefit when compared to placebo (evidence A2). 368,369  If more than 6 hours has elapsed, administration  of  a  second  dose  of  5-HT 3 receptor antagonist or butyrophenone may be considered if no other alternatives are available. 368

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who did not receive PONV prophylaxis, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron and ramosetron remain the first-line pharmacotherapy for treating established PONV. Recommended treatment rescue antiemetic regimens include ondansetron at 4 mg dose administered orally or IV, 218   ramosetron at 0.3  mg  IV, 218 granisetron  0.1  mg  and  tropisetron  0.5 mg, 370  as well as promethazine 6.25 mg IV. 277,278  In an RCT comparing ondansetron 4 mg to haloperidol 1 mg,  the  authors  reported  largely  comparable  treatment  response.  However,  the  haloperidol  cohort demonstrated significantly more sedation. 202

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is also emerging evidence for the use of NK1 receptor  antagonist  in  treating  established  PONV. Vestipitant, at the doses of 4-36 mg, has demonstrated noninferiority  when  compared  to  ondansetron  in patients who failed PONV prophylaxis. 228

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Other options for treating established  PONV include amisulpride 5-10 mg 188 and droperidol 0.625 mg IV. 371  The use of propofol 20 mg as a rescue antiemetic in the PACU setting has been reported in the past; however, the therapeutic effect is likely to be brief and should be used with caution. 372,373

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several studies have shown that combination therapy with multiple antiemetics may be more effective in treating established PONV. For example, ondansetron + droperidol + dexamethasone is more effective than  ondansetron  +  droperidol 332 ;  and  palonosetron +  dexamethasone  is  more  effective  than  palonosetron alone. 161   In  addition, midazolam 30 μ g/kg plus ondansetron  was  superior  to  ondansetron  alone. 291 There is currently limited evidence as to what is the optimal combination therapy for established PONV, therefore  clinician  discretion  is  advised,  and  the antiemetics  used  in  combination  therapy  should  be selected from different classes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A Cochrane review on the use of aromatherapy for the treatment of PONV reported that isopropyl alcohol therapy appears to reduce the duration as well as the severity of nausea compared to placebo and conventional pharmacotherapy. 302  Another SRMA investigated the use of ginger for the treatment of PONV, and reported a small reduction of nausea score with ginger  compared  to  placebo. 303   Coloma  et  al 374 conducted a clinical trial which compared the use of PC6 acupressure, ondansetron, or both for the treatment of  established  PONV  after  laparoscopic  surgeries, and found that PC6 acupressure was comparable to ondansetron for the treatment of established PONV, and  combination  of  PC6  acupressure  and  ondansetron was associated with significantly higher response rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  providing  rescue  antiemetics  in patients experiencing PONV, patient should be evaluated for reversible causes of PONV, such as excessive opioids,  mechanical  bowel  obstruction,  or  blood  in the pharynx. 3

Postdischarge  Nausea  and  Vomiting. It  is  estimated that  in  ambulatory  surgeries,  approximately  17% of  patients  experience  nausea  and  8%  of  patients experience  vomiting  after  discharge.  Despite  earlier data  suggesting  that  TIVA  may  be  associated  with lower incidence of PDNV, 375  a recent SRMA concluded that  TIVA  and  volatile  anesthesia  were  associated with comparable risk of PDNV. 376

There has been limited new evidence on the prevention of PDNV since the last consensus guideline. The current evidence supports the use of multimodal antiemetics  for  the  prevention  of  PDNV.  An  RCT compared the use of IV ondansetron alone to IV dexamethasone,  IV  ondansetron  and  ondansetron  tablet after discharge, and reported significantly lower rate of PDNV in the latter. 377  Other trials have compared ondansetron monotherapy to combination therapy of ondansetron plus NK1 receptor antagonist (aprepitant

Guideline 6. Ensure General Multimodal PONV Prevention and Timely Rescue Treatment Is Implemented in the Clinical Setting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This section was introduced at the second iteration of this consensus to emphasize the importance of implementing PONV prevention and treatment strategies in  the  clinical  setting.  While  risk-adapted  protocols are more cost-effective and will likely lead to better patient  outcomes  when  implemented  successfully (B2), 60  the compliance with such protocols may not be optimal in a busy clinical environment. Indeed, there is  still  evidence  that  implementation  is  the  weakest  part  in  the  process  from  generating  evidence  to improving health care. Recent publications concluded that  'Adherence  to  PONV  prophylaxis  guidelines … is  still  remarkably  low,' 379 with  less  than  half  of medium to high-risk patients receiving the appropriate prophylaxis. 380  Similar findings were reported in the pediatric population. 381  Since the 2014 consensus guideline, our expert consensus recommendation has been  that  general  multimodal  PONV  prophylaxis should consist of at least 2 PONV prevention interventions for all patients. 3,13

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adoption of a multimodal prevention strategy as the de facto practice has several advantages. It minimizes  the  risk  that  moderate-  to  high-risk  patients receive suboptimal prophylaxis, and it also minimizes the risk of low-risk patients receiving single treatment that is not effective for the individual. 13,382  In addition, general adoption of a multimodal prevention strategies may facilitate clinical implementation of PONV guidelines, 383 and  have  been  used  successfully  in  a number of other ERPs. 384,385

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In this iteration of the guideline, we have reduced the  threshold  for  administering  multimodal  PONV prophylaxis to patients with any risk factors, based on expert consensus, with the aim of making multimodal PONV prophylaxis  an  integral  part  of  anesthesia 382 (Figure 6). In accordance with the recommendations made in this update (guidelines 3 and 4), we would also  suggest,  based  on  expert  consensus,  that  highrisk male patients should receive 3 or more antiemetic prophylaxis (eg, 'always sick after anesthesia' or presenting with 3 or 4 risk factors).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical  PONV  Protocols  and  Algorithms  to  Implement PONV Policies. We recommend that PONV management protocols or algorithms should make it  clear  that  the  individual's  risk  of  PONV  should be  assessed  to  identify  the  high-risk  patients  who may  require  additional  prophylaxis. 2   In  addition to  the  patient's  level  of  PONV  risk,  the  PONV management  strategy  should  take  into  account patient's choice, cost-effectiveness of the treatment at the institution, and patient's preexisting conditions (such as the risk of prolonged QT, Parkinson, and closed-angle glaucoma). 2  This would minimize the risks associated with antiemetic administration, while ensuring that high-risk patients are managed appropriately;  and  is  likely  to  be  the  most  costeffective strategy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical Effectiveness  of  PONV  Protocols. While  the intrinsic efficacy of an intervention is fairly consistent, effectiveness is influenced by institutional compliance, 386   disparity  between  the  2  contributes to  the  gap  between  advances  in  PONV  research and  the  persistent  incidence  of  PONV  in  clinical practice. Despite the efforts to make PONV management guidelines readily available, its clinical implementation  remains  poor  in  both  adults  and pediatric  populations. 387,388   With  the  expanding  role of the electronic medical record systems, some have suggested using of electronic  reminders  to  improve the adherence to PONV guidelines. 389,390

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Timely  treatment  of  PONV  requires  vigilance by the health care providers. However, it has been shown that PONV symptoms are frequently missed, particularly  nausea.  One  observational  study  has reported that only 42% of PONV episodes were recognized in the PACU, with 29% recognized in surgical units. 391

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  has been shown that even with intensive training and education, the tendency to continue with de facto standard practice continues, and the adherence to risk-adapted PONV management protocol remains poor  (between  35%  and  50%  compliance). 392,393   This makes it unlikely that lack of education is the cause for deviation  from  guidelines.  Identifying  and  addressing  the  resistance  to  change  seems  to  be  the  key  in implementing guidelines effectively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Acquisition Costs of Antiemetics. The  cost of antiemetic  medications  is  a  key  factor  to  consider when  designing  a  PONV  management  guideline, and  the  cost  can  vary  significantly  depending  on the  country,  as  well  as  the  price  negotiation  of  the individual institution. Since the last iteration of our consensus guideline, generic versions of palonosetron have  become  commercially  available  in  the  United States;  this  will  likely  have  significant  impact  on  its cost-effectiveness as well as the clinical utilization.

Clinical  Applicability  and  Compliance  With  Guideline. To minimize the incidence of PONV at an organizational level,  introduction  of  PONV management guideline needs to be followed by regular compliance and  outcome  measurements.  This  will  allow  for improvement of the guideline as well as its adherence in the clinical setting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To  further  add  to  the  acceptance  of  combination therapy for the prevention of PONV, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in the United States has established a quality measure for the purpose  of  reducing  the  incidence  of  PONV  through  a merit-based incentive payment system (MIPS). MIPS 430  identifies  the  percentage  of  adult  patients  who undergo a surgical procedure with 3 or more risk factors for PONV and have received combination therapy of at least 2 antiemetic agents of different classes. CMS cites the 2014 Consensus Guideline as the clinical  recommendation  statement  used  in  establishing the measure. 394

Guideline 7. Administer Multimodal Prophylactic Antiemetics in Enhanced Recovery Pathways

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Place of the PONV Management in the General Framework of ERPs. Enhanced recovery is an evolving perioperative care concept. 395,396  In 2016, the American Society for Enhanced  Recovery  (ASER)  released an  Expert  Opinion  Statement  concluding  that  'all patients should receive PONV prophylaxis during the perioperative period. The number of medications used for treatment and prophylaxis should be determined by the number of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors;  medications used should represent different mechanisms  of  action  in  an attempt  to achieve multimodal  benefit.' 397   The  panel  agrees  with  the statements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PONV Management in ERPs Specific to the Type of Surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ERPs  for  various  types  of  surgery  include  specific recommendations for PONV management. 397,398 Interventions which reduce the baseline emetogenic risk factors, such  as the  use  of  propofol  TIVA, minimal preoperative fasting, carbohydrate loading, adequate hydration, and the use multimodal opioidsparing analgesia are recommended. 399  Similar to our general recommendation, we recommend that all ERP patients  should  receive  at  least  2  agents  for  PONV prophylaxis,  with  additional  antiemetics  in  patients who  are  high  risk.  Treatment  of  established  PONV should be prompt and aggressive. 400  For each surgery type, the emetogenicity of the procedure, availability of  effective  RA  technique,  and  expected  course  of postoperative recovery should be considered to optimize the management of PONV.

The introduction of a colorectal ERP with general multimodal PONV prophylaxis significantly reduced the rate of PONV 401  and may reduce the risk of readmission. 402 Several enhanced recovery consensus guidelines recommend the implementation of general multimodal prophylaxis with baseline risk reduction interventions for the prevention of PONV in patients undergoing  gastrointestinal  surgery. 403,404   The  ERPs for colorectal surgery patients are applicable to pancreatic surgery. 405,406

In breast surgery for cancer, a literature review 407 confirms that the use of a paravertebral block (PVB) before the surgery reduces the incidence of PONV. 408 The same is true for the pectoral nerves block (PECs). 409 Other effective interventions include non-opioid analgesia and multimodal PONV prophylaxis. 258,410,411

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In orthopedic surgery, there are limited prospective data on PONV management in the context of ERPs, 412 as pain and weakness are the main reason for delayed postoperative  discharge. 413   In  a  prospective  beforeand-after study (103 vs 105 patients), introduction of perioperative  interventions,  including  multimodal analgesia, opioid-sparing analgesia, and general antiemetic prophylaxis significantly decreased PONV on POD 1 (relative risk = 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43-0.76). 414

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  gynecologic/oncologic  surgery,  general  multimodal  PONV  prophylaxis  is  again  recommended; regional interventions (eg, TAP blocks) may decrease opioid  use  and  postoperative  pain,  but  this  may not  directly  translate  into  a  PONV  advantage  in  all cases. 415,416

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  CD,  specific  risk  factors  include  neuraxial anesthesia, hypotension, reduced cardiac output from aortocaval compression, surgical stimulation, use of uterotonics,  and  post-CD  analgesia  with  neuraxial opioids. A multimodal approach to PONV prevention is the standard of care. 417

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In radical cystectomy  for bladder cancer, the ERAS  Society  recommendations  related  to  PONV include the use of minimally invasive surgery, early oral intake, liberal use of antiemetics, chewing gum, prokinetic  agents,  and  opioid-sparing  analgesia  to minimize  PONV  and  postoperative  ileus. 418   Besides antiemetics, Doppler-guided fluid management reduces  PONV 419   as  does  the  stenting  of  the  ureteroileal anastomosis. 420-422

A recent prospective observational study on ERPs after cardiac surgery reported that regular IV ondansetron prophylaxis for the first 48 hours did not reduce POV and only lower incidence of nausea on POD 3, suggesting the need for a multimodal approach. 423

Management of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  laryngeal  surgery  patients,  PONV prophylaxis with  IV  ondansetron  (4  mg)  and  dexamethasone  (4 mg) 2 hours before the end of surgery is effective. 424

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  multilevel  spinal  surgery,  implementation of a multimodal  analgesia  and  multimodal  PONV  management protocol significantly  reduce  postoperative complications, including PONV. 231

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  summary,  the  PONV  management  strategies implemented in the published ERPs are largely similar to the principle of risk reduction, prophylaxis, and treatment discussed in our consensus guideline. It is therefore the panel's consensus that the content of our guidelines could be applied to ERPs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Research Agenda for PONV

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since the publication of the previous consensus guideline,  there  have  been  significant  research  projects  for the  management  of  PONV,  particularly  around  the newer antiemetics such as amisulpride, palonosetron, and NK1 receptor antagonists, as well as research evaluating the role of PONV management as part of ERPs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
On the other  hand,  adherence  to  PONV  prophylaxis  protocols  remains  a  significant  challenge.  As recommended by our previous guideline and work of others, the use of multimodal antiemetic strategy as general prophylaxis is increasingly common. 3,382

<!-- PAGE=? -->
However,  there are very few  studies directly comparing  the  efficacy  of  a  risk-based  'restrictive' antiemetic  prophylaxis  approach  to  a  more  liberal multimodal antiemetic prophylaxis approach.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since the last iteration of the guideline, a number of new antiemetic combinations has been proposed. However, the optimal multimodal prophylaxis regimen as well as the optimal number of antiemetics in combination therapies remains unclear due to lack of head-to-head  comparisons. 159,170,171,288 Weibel  et  al 102 are  conducting a network meta-analysis on the efficacy of monotherapies as well as combination therapies, their findings will likely shed some light on the efficacy comparisons between some of the combination  therapies.  There  is  also  insufficient  evidence  to determine the choice of optimal combination therapy for the treatment of established PONV. Head-to-head comparisons  between  common  combination  therapies would be invaluable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another aspect that requires additional study is the role of nonpharmacological interventions such as PC6 acupoint stimulation. While PC6 stimulation has been shown to reduce the risk of PONV, its added value as part of multimodal treatment is unclear. In addition, there  are  numerous  modalities  of  stimulation,  such as needle acupuncture, acupressure, needle, or transcutaneous  electrical  stimulation. 294   Further  research is needed to distinguish between the efficacies of the different stimulation modalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Similarly,  while  perioperative  supplemental  fluids have been shown to reduce the risk of PONV, there is conflicting evidence on the choice between colloids and crystalloids. 74  In addition, the optimal volume and time of administration are unclear. Additionally, liberal fluid administration can also be associated with postoperative complications. 425  More studies are needed to assess the risk-benefit profile of fluid therapy and PONV .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is also emerging evidence that antiemetic efficacy  may  be  influenced  by  gene  polymorphisms  as well  as  variation  in  gene  expression  (epigenetics). 426 For example, cytochrome P450 2D6 is involved in the metabolism of several 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists, and ultrarapid  metabolizer  phenotype  may  be  associated with reduced antiemetic efficacy of ondansetron, tropisetron, and others. 427  Another example is the polymorphisms of the serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region, which have been associated with increased risk of PONV. 428  Dopamine receptor 2 gene polymorphism has also been linked to increased risk of PONV. 429  More studies are needed in this area. In addition, there are studies which suggest an association between patient ethnicity and the risk of PONV, 430  and additional studies are needed to confirm this association.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Finally,  both  the  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists Task Force on Acute Pain Management and our group have advocated for using P < .01 as the significance level for statistical analysis to minimize the risk of false-positive findings. 25  However, most recent studies have used a significance level of P < .05. We would strongly encourage prospective investigators to use a significance level of P < .01, with confidence intervals, in future studies; so the clinical relevance of the study findings could be contextualized.

CONCLUSIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The updated PONV consensus guidelines are designed  to  provide  comprehensive  evidence-based clinical  recommendations  on  the  management  of PONV in adults and children. Prevention of PONV should be considered an integral aspect of anesthesia,  achieved  through  risk  assessment,  baseline  risk prevention,  as  well  as  pharmacoprophylaxis.  One major change in this iteration of the guideline is that in  adults,  the  panel  consensus is now to implement multimodal PONV prophylaxis in patients with 1 or 2  risk  factors,  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  risk  of  inadequate  prophylaxis.  However,  clinician  discretion  is advised in assessing the benefits and risks of multimodal prophylaxis based on patient and surgical factors.  Combination  therapy  should  consist  of  drugs from different classes, using minimum  effective doses, and the choice of drugs will be determined by patient factors as well as institutional policy and drug availability. In children, we still recommend the use of multimodal PONV prophylaxis in those at moderate

or high risk and recommend the use of a 5-HT 3 receptor antagonist plus dexamethasone, with opioid and volatile anesthesia sparing strategies as first-line interventions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who develop PONV, prior prophylaxis administration should be assessed, and rescue treatment should consist  of  drugs  from  a  different  class than those used for prophylaxis. If more than 6 hours have elapsed since the administration of a short-acting antiemetic (such as ondansetron or droperidol), a repeat dose could be considered if no other options are available. Unlike PONV prophylaxis, the evidence for the efficacy of PONV rescue treatments is limited, both in terms of monotherapy and combination therapy. However, more data are available for treatment of established PONV (eg, amisulpride). Clinicians are advised to use their judgment, considering the patient factors,  administration  of  prophylaxis,  and  institutional drug availability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PONV management is a vital component of ERPs. With  multimodal  PONV  prophylaxis  now  recommended for all adult surgical patients with any risk factors, the panel recommends that the principles of PONV management as  discussed  in  this  consensus guideline  should  also  apply  to  the  management  of PONV within ERPs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
At an institutional level, design and implementation  of  a  PONV  management  protocol  will  need  to take into account the cost-effectiveness of treatments and availability of drugs. As individual patients may not respond to certain classes of antiemetics, we recommend that institutions should provide antiemetics from  at  least  4  classes.  In  a  busy  clinical  environment, implementation of a more liberal multimodal prophylaxis with at least 2 drugs, and an additional antiemetic  in  high-risk  patients,  as  well  as  continued compliance monitoring may be a more judicious approach in optimizing PONV care.
