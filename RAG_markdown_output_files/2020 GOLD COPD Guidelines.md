GLOBAL STRATEGY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, MANAGEMENT, AND PREVENTION OF COPD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTRODUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world 1   but is projected to be the 3 rd leading cause of death by 2020. More than 3 million people died of COPD in 2012 accounting for  6% of all  deaths  globally. COPD represents an important public health challenge that is both preventable and treatable. COPD is a major cause of chronic morbidity and mortality throughout the world; many people suffer from this  disease  for years  and die prematurely from it or its complications.  Globally, the  COPD  burden  is  projected  to increase in  coming decades because of continued exposure to COPD risk factors and aging of the population. 2

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This Pocket Guide has been developed from the Global  Strategy for the  Diagnosis,  Management,  and  Prevention of  COPD (2020 Report), which aims to provide a non-biased review of the current evidence for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of patients with COPD that can aid the clinician. Discussions of COPD and COPD management, evidence levels, and specific citations from the scientific literature are included in that source document, which is available from www.goldcopd.org.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DEFINITION AND OVERVIEW

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERALL KEY POINTS:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The most common respiratory symptoms include dyspnea, cough and/or sputum production. These symptoms may be under-reported by patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The main risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoking but other environmental exposures such as biomass fuel exposure and air pollution may contribute. Besides exposures, host factors predispose individuals to develop COPD. These include genetic abnormalities, abnormal lung development and accelerated aging.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPD may be punctuated by periods of acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, called exacerbations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In most patients, COPD is associated with significant concomitant chronic diseases, which increase its morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WHAT IS CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD)?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases and influenced by host factors including abnormal lung development. Significant comorbidities may have an impact on morbidity and mortality. There may be significant lung pathology (e.g., emphysema) in the absence of airflow limitation that needs further evaluation ( see Figure ).

WHAT CAUSES COPD?

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Worldwide, the most commonly encountered risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoking . Nonsmokers may also develop COPD. COPD is the result of a complex interplay of long-term cumulative exposure to noxious gases and particles, combined with a variety of host factors including genetics, airway hyper-responsiveness and poor lung growth during childhood. 3-5 The risk of developing COPD is related to the following factors:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
2

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tobacco smoke - cigarette smokers have a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, a greater annual rate of decline in FEV1, and a greater COPD mortality rate than nonsmokers. 6 Other types of tobacco (e.g., pipe, cigar, water pipe) 7-9 and marijuana 10 are also risk factors for COPD, as well as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). 11

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indoor air pollution - resulting from the burning of wood and other biomass fuels used for cooking and heating in poorly vented dwellings, is a risk factor that particularly affects women in developing countries. 12,13

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occupational exposures - including organic and inorganic dusts, chemical agents and fumes, are underappreciated risk factors for COPD. 12,14

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Outdoor air pollution - also contributes to the lungs' total burden of inhaled particles, although it appears to have a relatively small effect in causing COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Genetic factors - such as severe hereditary deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AATD) 15 ; the gene encoding matrix metalloproteinase 12 ( MMP-12 ) and glutathione S -transferase have also been related to a decline in lung function 16 or risk of COPD. 17

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Age and sex - aging and female sex increase COPD risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung growth and development - any factor that affects lung growth during gestation and childhood (low birth weight, respiratory infections, etc.) has the potential to increase an individual's risk of developing COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Socioeconomic status - Poverty is consistently associated with airflow obstruction 18 and lower socioeconomic status is associated with an increased risk of developing COPD. 19,20 It is not clear, however, whether this pattern reflects exposures to indoor and outdoor air pollutants, crowding, poor nutrition, infections, or other factors related to low socioeconomic status.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Asthma and airway hyper-reactivity - asthma may be a risk factor for the development of airflow limitation and COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic bronchitis - may increase the frequency of total and severe exacerbations. 21

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infections - a history of severe childhood respiratory infection has been associated with reduced lung function and increased respiratory symptoms in adulthood. 22

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS AND ASSESSMENT OF COPD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERALL KEY POINTS:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPD should be considered in any patient who has dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, a history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spirometry is required to make the diagnosis; the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70

<!-- PAGE=? -->
3

<!-- PAGE=? -->
confirms the presence of persistent airflow limitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The goals of COPD assessment are to determine the level of airflow limitation, the impact of disease on the patient's health status, and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions, or death), in order to guide therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Concomitant chronic diseases occur frequently in COPD patients, including cardiovascular disease, skeletal muscle dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, depression, anxiety, and lung cancer. These comorbidities should be actively sought and treated appropriately when present as they can influence mortality and hospitalizations independently.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPD should be considered in any patient who has dyspnea, chronic cough or sputum production, and/or a history of exposure to risk factors for the disease ( see Table ). Spirometry is required to make the diagnosis in this clinical context 23 ; the presence of a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70 confirms the presence of persistent airflow limitation and thus of COPD in patients with appropriate symptoms and significant exposures to noxious stimuli. Spirometry is the most reproducible and objective measurement of airflow limitation. It is a noninvasive and readily available test. Despite its good sensitivity, peak expiratory flow measurement alone cannot be reliably used as the only diagnostic test because of its weak specificity. 24 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS A major differential diagnosis is asthma. In some patients with chronic asthma, a clear distinction from COPD is not possible using current imaging and physiological testing techniques. In these patients, current management is similar to that of asthma. Other potential diagnoses are usually easier to distinguish from COPD ( see Table ). Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) screening. The World Health Organization recommends that all patients with a diagnosis of COPD should be screened once especially in areas with high AATD prevalence. 25 A low concentration (< 20% normal) is highly suggestive of homozygous deficiency. Family members should also be screened. Additional investigations The following additional investigations may be considered as part of the diagnosis and assessment of COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Imaging. A  chest  X-ray  is  not  useful  to  establish  a  diagnosis  in  COPD,  but  it  is  valuable  in  excluding  alternative diagnoses  and  establishing  the  presence  of  significant  comorbidities  such  as  concomitant  respiratory  (pulmonary fibrosis,  bronchiectasis,  pleural  diseases),  skeletal  (e.g.,  kyphoscoliosis),  and  cardiac  diseases  (e.g.,  cardiomegaly). Radiological changes associated with COPD include signs of lung hyperinflation (flattened diaphragm and an increase in the volume of the retrosternal air space), hyperlucency of the lungs, and rapid tapering of the vascular markings. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest is not routinely recommended except for detection of bronchiectasis and COPD patients that meet the criteria for lung cancer risk assessment. The presence of emphysema in particular may increase the risk for development of lung cancer. However, CT scanning may be helpful in the differential diagnosis where concomitant diseases are present. In addition, if a surgical procedure such as lung volume reduction, 26 or increasingly  non-surgical  based  lung  volume  reduction 27 is  contemplated,  a  chest  CT  scan  is  necessary  since  the distribution  of  emphysema  is  one  of  the  most  important  determinants  of  surgical  suitability.  A  CT  scan  is  also required for patients being evaluated for lung transplantation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lung volumes and diffusing capacity. COPD patients exhibit gas trapping (a rise in residual volume) from the early stages of the disease, and as airflow limitation worsens, static hyperinflation (an increase in total lung capacity) occurs.  These  changes  can  be  documented  by  body  plethysmography,  or  less  accurately  by  helium  dilution  lung volume measurement. These measurements help characterize the severity of COPD but are not essential to patient management.  Measurement  of  diffusing  capacity  (DLCO)  provides  information  on  the  functional  impact  of emphysema in COPD and is often helpful in patients with breathlessness that may seem out of proportion to the degree of airflow limitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oximetry and arterial blood gas measurement. Pulse oximetry can be used to evaluate a patient's arterial oxygen saturation and need for supplemental oxygen therapy. Pulse oximetry should be used to assess all patients with clinical signs suggestive of respiratory failure or right heart failure. If peripheral arterial oxygen saturation is < 92% arterial or capillary blood gases should be assessed. 28,29

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exercise testing and assessment of physical activity. Objectively measured exercise impairment, assessed by  a  reduction  in  self-paced  walking  distance 30,31 or  during  incremental  exercise  testing  in  a  laboratory, 32 is  a powerful indicator of health status impairment and predictor of prognosis; exercise  capacity may fall in the year before death. 33 Walking tests can be useful for assessing disability and risk of mortality 34 and are used to assess the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation. Both the paced shuttle walk test 35 and the unpaced 6-minute walk test can be  used. 36,37 As  the  course  length  has  a  substantial  impact  on  the  distance  walked,  existing  reference  equations established  for  a  30  meter  course  cannot  be  applied  to  predict  the  distance  achieved  on  shorter  courses. 38 Laboratory testing using cycle or treadmill ergometry can assist in identifying co-existing or alternative conditions e.g., cardiac diagnoses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Composite  scores. Several  variables  identify  patients  at  increased  risk  for  mortality  including  FEV1,  exercise tolerance assessed by walking distance or peak oxygen consumption, weight loss, and reduction in arterial oxygen tension.  A  relatively  simple  approach  to  identifying  disease  severity  using  a  combination  of  most  of  the  above variables  has  been  proposed.  The  BODE  (Body  mass  index,  Obstruction,  Dyspnea,  and  Exercise)  method  gives  a composite score that is a better predictor of subsequent survival than any single component. 40,41 Simpler alternatives that do not include an exercise test have been suggested but all these approaches need validation across a wide range of disease severities and clinical settings to confirm that they are suitable for routine clinical use. 42,43

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Differential  diagnoses. In  some  patients  with  chronic  asthma,  a  clear  distinction  from  COPD  is  difficult  using current  imaging  and  physiological  testing  techniques,  since  the  two  conditions  share  common  traits  and  clinical expressions. Most other potential differential diagnoses are easier to distinguish from COPD ( Table 2.7 ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Biomarkers. There is rapidly increasing interest in the use of biomarkers in COPD. Biomarkers are 'characteristics that  are  objectively  measured  and  evaluated  as  an  indicator  of  normal  biological  or  pathogenic  processes  or pharmacological  responses  to  therapeutic  interventions'.  In  general  such  data  has  proven  difficult  to  interpret, largely as a result of weak associations and lack of reproducibility between large patient cohorts 44 which was further confirmed in the recent SUMMIT study. 45 Recent studies (see Chapter 5 - Exacerbations) have indicated the use of Creactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin 46 in restricting antibiotic usage during exacerbations, although the observed sputum color remains highly sensitive and specific for a high bacterial load during such episodes. At present the assessment of eosinophils provides the best guidance to the use of corticosteroids 44 especially in the prevention  of  some  exacerbations  (see Chapter  3 -  Inhaled  Corticosteroids).  Continued  cautious  and  realistic interpretation of the role of biomarkers in the management of identified clinical traits is required. Other  considerations. It  is  clear  that  some  patients without  evidence  of  airflow  limitation have  evidence  of structural lung disease on chest imaging (emphysema, gas trapping, airway wall thickening) that is consistent with what  is  found  in  patients  with  COPD.  Such  patients  may  report  exacerbations  of  respiratory  symptoms  or  even require treatment with respiratory medications on a chronic basis. Whether these patients have acute or chronic bronchitis,  a  persistent  form  of  asthma  or  an  earlier  presentation  of  what  will  become  COPD  as  it  is  currently defined, is unclear at present and will require further study.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF COPD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASSESSMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The goals of COPD assessment are to determine the level of airflow limitation, its impact on the patient's health status and the risk of future events (such as exacerbations, hospital admissions or death), in order to, eventually, guide therapy. To achieve these goals, COPD assessment must consider the following aspects of the disease separately:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The presence and severity of the spirometric abnormality

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current nature and magnitude of the patient's symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History of moderate and severe exacerbations

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Presence of comorbidities

<!-- PAGE=? -->
7

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Classification of severity of airflow limitation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The classification of airflow limitation severity in COPD ( see Table ) uses specific spirometric cut-points for purposes of simplicity. Spirometry should be performed after the administration of an adequate dose of at least one shortacting inhaled bronchodilator in order to minimize variability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It should be noted that there is only a weak correlation between FEV1, symptoms and impairment of a patient's health status. 47,48 For this reason, formal symptomatic assessment is required.

Assessment of symptoms In the past, COPD was viewed as a disease largely characterized by breathlessness. A simple measure of breathlessness such as the Modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) Questionnaire 49 ( see Table ) was considered adequate for assessment of symptoms, as the mMRC relates well to other measures of health status 50 and predicts future mortality risk. 51,52 However, it is now recognized that COPD impacts patients beyond just dyspnea. 53 For this reason, a comprehensive assessment of symptoms is recommended using measures such as the COPD Assessment Test (CAT™) 54  ( see Figure ) and The COPD Control Questionnaire (The CCQ © ).

Combined COPD assessment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An understanding of the impact of COPD on an individual patient combines the symptomatic assessment with the patient's  spirometric  classification  and/or  risk  of  exacerbations.  The  'ABCD'  assessment  tool  of  the  2011  GOLD update  was  a  major  step  forward  from  the  simple  spirometric  grading  system  of  the  earlier  versions  of  GOLD because it incorporated patient-reported outcomes and highlighted the importance of exacerbation prevention in the  management  of  COPD.  However,  there  were  some  important  limitations.  Firstly,  the  ABCD  assessment  tool performed no better than the spirometric grades for mortality prediction or other important health outcomes in COPD. 55-57 Moreover,  group  'D'  outcomes  were  modified  by  two  parameters:  lung  function  and/or  exacerbation history,  which  caused  confusion. 48 To  address  these  and  other  concerns  (while  at  the  same  time  maintaining consistency and simplicity for the practicing clinician), a refinement of the ABCD assessment tool is proposed that separates spirometric grades from the 'ABCD' groups. For some therapeutic recommendations, ABCD groups are derived exclusively from patient symptoms and their history of exacerbation. Spirometry, in conjunction with patient symptoms and history of moderate and severe exacerbations, remains vital for the diagnosis, prognostication and consideration  of  other  important  therapeutic  approaches.  This  new  approach  to  assessment  is  illustrated  in  the Figure .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  revised  assessment  scheme,  patients  should  undergo  spirometry  to  determine  the  severity  of  airflow limitation  (i.e.,  spirometric  grade).  They  should  also  undergo  assessment  of  either  dyspnea  using  mMRC  or symptoms using CAT™. Finally, their history of moderate and severe exacerbations (including prior hospitalizations) should be recorded. The number provides information regarding severity of airflow limitation (spirometric grade 1 to 4) while the letter (groups A to D) provides information regarding symptom burden and risk of exacerbation which can be used to guide therapy. FEV1 is a very important parameter at the population-level in the prediction of important clinical outcomes such as mortality and hospitalizations or prompting consideration for non-pharmacological therapies such as lung volume reduction or lung transplantation. However, it is important to note that at the individual patient level, FEV1 loses  precision  and  thus  cannot  be  used  alone  to  determine  all  therapeutic  options.  Furthermore,  in  some circumstances, such as during hospitalization or urgent presentation to the clinic or emergency room, the ability to assess patients based on symptoms and exacerbation history, independent of the spirometric value, allows clinicians to initiate a treatment plan based on the revised ABCD scheme alone. This assessment approach acknowledges the limitations of FEV1 in making treatment decisions for individualized patient care and highlights the importance of patient  symptoms and exacerbation risks in guiding  therapies in COPD. The separation  of airflow limitation from clinical  parameters  makes  it  clearer  what  is  being  evaluated  and  ranked.  This  facilitates  more  precise  treatment recommendations based on parameters that are driving the patient's symptoms at any given time. COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

However, with the new proposed scheme, the subject with three moderate exacerbations in the past year would be labelled GOLD grade 4, group D.

EVIDENCE SUPPORTING PREVENTION AND MAINTENANCE THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERALL KEY POINTS:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Smoking cessation is key. Pharmacotherapy and nicotine replacement reliably increase long-term smoking abstinence rates. Legislative smoking bans and counselling, delivered by healthcare professionals improve quit rates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The effectiveness and safety of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid is uncertain at present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacological therapy can reduce COPD symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Each pharmacological treatment regimen should be individualized and guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side-effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference and ability to use various drug delivery devices.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhaler technique needs to be assessed regularly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Influenza vaccination decreases the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pneumococcal vaccination decreases lower respiratory tract infections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary rehabilitation improves symptoms, quality of life, and physical and emotional participation in everyday activities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with severe resting chronic hypoxemia, long-term oxygen therapy improves survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with stable COPD and resting or exercise-induced moderate desaturation, long-term oxygen treatment should not be prescribed routinely. However, individual patient factors must be considered when evaluating the patient's need for supplemental oxygen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with severe chronic hypercapnia and a history of hospitalization for acute respiratory failure, long-term non-invasive ventilation may decrease mortality and prevent re-hospitalization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In select patients with advanced emphysema refractory to optimized medical care, surgical or bronchoscopic interventional treatments may be beneficial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Palliative approaches are effective in controlling symptoms in advanced COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SMOKING CESSATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Smoking cessation has the greatest capacity to influence the natural history of COPD. If effective resources and time are dedicated to smoking cessation, long-term quit success rates of up to 25% can be achieved. 58 Besides individual approaches to smoking cessation, legislative smoking bans are effective in increasing quit rates and reducing harm from second-hand smoke exposure. 59  A five-step program for intervention ( see Table ) 60-62 provides a helpful strategic framework. 60,62,63

E-cigarettes  were  originally  promoted  as  a  form  of  nicotine  replacement  therapy  to  aid  in  smoking  cessation, although the efficacy to aid smoking cessation remains controversial. 64,65 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinoid (CBD) oils, Vitamin E and other flavoring substances and additives have been added to nicotine and promoted to previously non-smoking adolescents and young adults (also known as vaping). Severe acute lung injury, eosinophilic pneumonia,  alveolar  hemorrhage,  respiratory  bronchiolitis  and  other  forms  of  lung  abnormalities  have  been reportedly linked to E-cigarette use. 66-69

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Recently, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and other

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
clinical and public health partners are investigating outbreaks of lung illness associated with e-cigarette product use (devices, liquids, refill pods, and/or cartridges). As of October 22, 2019, 1,604 cases of lung illness and 34 deaths have been associated with using e-cigarette products. 69 All  patients had reported a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping products and most reported a history of using THC-containing products. These latest findings suggest that products containing THC, particularly those obtained off the street or from unofficial sources (e.g., friends, family members, illicit dealers), are linked to most of the cases in the outbreak. 69 In a case cohort analysis, no evidence of infection  was  found,  lung  inflammation  and  injury  was  evident. 69 Patients  were  reported  to  have  had  clinical improvement  with  systemic  glucocorticoid  therapy  and  the  majority  received  prolonged  courses;  specific  clinical recommendations are not available at this time. 68

PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY FOR STABLE COPD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Overview of the medications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacological therapy for COPD is used to reduce symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve exercise tolerance and health status. The classes of medications commonly used to treat COPD are shown in the Table . To date, there is no conclusive clinical trial evidence that any existing medications for COPD modify the long-term decline in lung function. 70-74 Post-hoc evidence of such an effect with long-acting bronchodilators and/or inhaled corticosteroids 75,76 requires confirmation in specifically designed trials.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchodilators

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchodilators are medications that increase FEV1 and/or change other spirometric variables.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bronchodilator medications in COPD are most often given on a regular basis to prevent or reduce symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Toxicity is also dose-related.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of short acting bronchodilators on a regular basis is not generally recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Beta2-agonists

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The principal action of beta2-agonists is to relax airway smooth muscle by stimulating beta2-adrenergic receptors, which increases cyclic AMP and produces functional antagonism to bronchoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There are short-acting (SABA) and long-acting (LABA) beta2-agonists. The effect of SABAs usually wears off within 4 to 6 hours. 77,78 Regular and as-needed use of SABAs improve FEV1 and symptoms. 79

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For single-dose, as-needed use in COPD, there appears to be no advantage in routinely using levalbuterol over conventional bronchodilators. 80 LABAs show duration of action of 12 or more hours and do not preclude additional benefit from as-needed SABA therapy. 81

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Formoterol and salmeterol are twice-daily LABAs that significantly improve FEV1 and lung volumes, dyspnea, health status, exacerbation rate and number of hospitalizations, 82 but have no effect on mortality or rate of decline of lung function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indacaterol is a once daily LABA that improves breathlessness, 83,84 health status 84 and exacerbation rate. 84 Some patients experience cough following the inhalation of indacaterol.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oladaterol and vilanterol are additional once daily LABAs that improve lung function and symptoms. 85,86

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adverse effects. Stimulation of beta2-adrenergic receptors can produce resting sinus tachycardia and has the potential to precipitate cardiac rhythm disturbances in susceptible patients. Exaggerated somatic tremor is troublesome in some older patients treated with higher doses of beta2-agonists, regardless of route of administration. Although hypokalemia can occur, especially when treatment is combined with thiazide diuretics, 87 and oxygen consumption can be increased under resting conditions in patients with chronic heart failure, 88 these metabolic effects decrease over time (i.e., show tachyphylaxis). Mild falls in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) can occur after administration of both SABAs and LABAs 89 but the clinical significance of these changes is uncertain. Despite prior concerns related to the use of beta2-agonists in the management of asthma, no association between beta2-agonist use and loss of lung function or increased mortality has been reported in COPD. 82,90,91

Antimuscarinic drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antimuscarinic drugs block the bronchoconstrictor effects of acetylcholine on M3 muscarinic receptors expressed in airway smooth muscle. 92

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Short-acting antimuscarinics (SAMAs), namely ipratropium and oxitropium, also block the inhibitory neuronal receptor M2, which potentially can cause vagally induced bronchoconstriction. 93

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-acting antimuscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), such as tiotropium , aclidinium , glycopyrronium bromide and umeclidinium have prolonged binding to M3 muscarinic receptors, with faster dissociation from M2

<!-- PAGE=? -->
15

<!-- PAGE=? -->
muscarinic receptors, thus prolonging the duration of bronchodilator effect. 92

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A systematic review of randomized controlled trials concluded that ipratropium, a short acting muscarinic antagonist, alone provided small benefits over short-acting beta2-agonist in terms of lung function, health status and requirement for oral steroids. 94

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LAMA treatments (tiotropium) improve symptoms and health status. 92,95 They also improve the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation 96,97 and reduce exacerbations and related hospitalizations. 95

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical trials have shown a greater effect on exacerbation rates for LAMA treatment (tiotropium) versus LABA treatment. 98,99

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adverse effects. Inhaled anticholinergic drugs are poorly absorbed which limits the troublesome systemic effects observed with atropine. 92,100 Extensive use of this class of agents in a wide range of doses and clinical settings has shown them to be very safe. The main side effect is dryness of mouth. 93,101 Although occasional urinary symptoms have been reported, there are no data to prove a true causal relationship. 102 Some patients using ipratropium report a bitter, metallic taste. An unexpected small increase in cardiovascular events in COPD patients regularly treated with ipratropium bromide has been reported. 103,104 In a large, long-term clinical trial in COPD patients, tiotropium added to other standard therapies had no effect on cardiovascular risk. 74 Although there were some initial concerns regarding the safety of tiotropium delivery via the Respimat® 105 inhaler, the findings of a large trial observed no difference in mortality or exacerbation rates when comparing tiotropium in a dry-powder inhaler and the Respimat® inhaler. 106

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methylxanthines

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Controversy remains about the exact effects of xanthine derivatives.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Theophylline, the most commonly used methylxanthine, is metabolized by cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidases. Clearance of the drug declines with age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is evidence for a modest bronchodilator effect compared with placebo in stable COPD. 107

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Addition of theophylline to salmeterol produces a greater improvement in FEV1 and breathlessness than salmeterol alone. 108,109

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is limited and contradictory evidence regarding the effect of low-dose theophylline on exacerbation rates. 110,111

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adverse effects. Toxicity is dose-related, which is a particular problem with xanthine derivatives because their therapeutic ratio is small and most of the benefit occurs only when near-toxic doses are given. 107,112

Combination bronchodilator therapy

COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Combining bronchodilators with different mechanisms and durations of action may increase the degree of bronchodilation with a lower risk of side-effects compared to increasing the dose of a single bronchodilator. 113 Combinations of SABAs and SAMAs are superior compared to either medication alone in improving FEV1 and symptoms. 114 Treatment with formoterol and tiotropium in separate inhalers has a bigger impact on FEV1 than either component alone. 115 There are numerous combinations of a LABA and LAMA in a single inhaler available. These combinations improve lung function compared to placebo 113 ; this improvement is consistently greater than long acting bronchodilator monotherapy effects although the magnitude of improvement is less than the fully additive effect predicted by the individual component responses. 116 In studies where patient reported outcomes (PROs) are the primary endpoint or in pooled analyses, combination bronchodilators have a greater impact on PROs compared to monotherapies. 117-120 In one clinical trial, combination LABA/LAMA treatment had the greatest improvement in quality of life compare to placebo or its individual bronchodilator components in patients with a greater baseline symptom burden. 121 These clinical trials deal with group mean data, but symptom responses to LABA/LAMA combinations are best evaluated on an individual patient basis. A lower dose, twice daily regimen for a LABA/LAMA has also been shown to improve symptoms and health status in COPD patients 122 ( see Table ). These findings have

<!-- PAGE=? -->
16

<!-- PAGE=? -->
been shown in people across different ethnic groups (Asian as well as European). 123

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most studies with LABA/LAMA combinations have been performed in patients with a low rate of exacerbations. One study in patients with a history of exacerbations indicated that a combination of long-acting bronchodilators is more effective than long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy for preventing exacerbations. 124 Another large study found that combining a LABA with a LAMA did not reduce exacerbation rate as much as expected compared with a LAMA alone. 125 Another study in patients with a history of exacerbations confirmed that a combination LABA/LAMA decreased exacerbations to a greater extent than an ICS/LABA combination. 126 However, another study in a population with high exacerbat ion risk (≥ 2 exacerbations and/ or 1 hospitalization in the previous year) reported that ICS/LABA decreased exacerbations to a greater extent than an LABA/LAMA combination at higher blood eosinophil concentrations. 127 A large observational pharmaco-epidemiological study found similar effectiveness of LABA/LAMA and ICS/LABA but a significantly higher risk of pneumonia in those treated with ICS/LABA. 128

To date, exacerbations (e.g., exacerbation rate, patients with at least one exacerbation, time-to-first exacerbation) represent the main clinically relevant end-point used for efficacy assessment of drugs with anti-inflammatory effects ( see Table ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preliminary general considerations . In vitro evidence suggests that COPD-associated inflammation has limited responsiveness to corticosteroids. Moreover, some drugs including beta2-agonists, theophylline or macrolides may partially facilitate corticosteroid sensitivity in COPD. 129,130 The clinical relevance of this effect has not yet been fully established.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In vivo data suggest that the dose-response relationships and long-term (> 3 years) safety of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with COPD are unclear and require further investigation. 109 Because the effects of ICS in COPD can be modulated by the concomitant use of long-acting bronchodilators, these two therapeutic options are discussed separately.

Efficacy of ICS (alone). Most studies have found that regular treatment with ICS alone does not modify the long-term decline of FEV1 nor mortality in patients with COPD. 131 Studies and meta-analyses assessing the effect of regular treatment with ICS alone on mortality in patients with COPD have not provided conclusive evidence of benefit. 131 In the TORCH trial, a trend toward higher mortality was observed for patients treated with fluticasone propionate alone compared to those receiving placebo or salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate combination. 132  However, an increase in mortality was not observed in COPD patients treated with fluticasone furoate in the Survival in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Heightened Cardiovascular Risk (SUMMIT) trial. 133  However, in moderate COPD, fluticasone furoate alone or in combination with vilanterol was associated with slower decline in FEV1 compared with placebo or vilanterol alone by on average 9 ml/year. 134

ICS in combination with long-acting bronchodilator therapy. In patients with moderate to very severe COPD and exacerbations, an ICS combined with a LABA is more effective than either component alone in improving lung function, health status and reducing exacerbations. 135,136 Clinical trials powered on all-cause mortality as the primary outcome failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect of combination therapy on survival. 132,133

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most studies that found a beneficial effect of LABA/ICS fixed dose combination (FDC) over LABA alone on exacerbation rate, recruited patients with a history of at least one exacerbation in the previous year. 135 A pragmatic RCT conducted in a primary healthcare setting in the United Kingdom compared a LABA/ICS combination with usual care. Findings showed an 8.4% reduction in moderate-to-severe exacerbations (primary outcome) and a significant improvement in CAT™ score, with no difference in the rate of healthcare contacts or pneumonias. However, basing recommendations on these results is difficult because of the heterogeneity of treatments reported in the usual care group, the higher rate of treatment changes in the group receiving the LABA/ICS combination of interest, and the medical practice patterns unique to the UK region where the study was conducted. 137

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood eosinophil count. A number of recent studies have shown that blood eosinophil counts predict the magnitude of  the  effect  of  ICS  (added  on  top  of  regular  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment)  in  preventing  future exacerbations. 127,138-142 There  is  a  continuous  relationship  between  blood  eosinophil  counts  and  ICS  effects;  no and/or  small  effects  are  observed  at  lower  eosinophil  counts,  with  incrementally  increasing  effects  observed  at higher eosinophil counts. Data modelling indicates that ICS containing regimens have little or no effect at a blood eosinophil count < 100 cells/µL, 138 therefore this threshold can be used to identify patients with a low likelihood of treatment  benefit  with  ICS.  The  threshold  of  a  blood  eosinophil  count  >  300  cells/µL  identifies  the  top  of  the continuous  relationship  between  eosinophils  and  ICS,  and  can  be  used  to  identify  patients  with  the  greatest likelihood of treatment benefit with ICS. These thresholds of < 100 cells/µL and > 300 cells/µL should be regarded as estimates, rather than precise cut-off values, that can predict different probabilities of treatment benefit. All in all, therefore, blood eosinophil counts can help clinicians estimate the likelihood of a beneficial preventive response to the addition of ICS to regular bronchodilator treatment, and thus can be used as a biomarker in conjunction with clinical assessment when making decisions regarding ICS use. Sources of evidence include: 1) Post-hoc analyses comparing ICS/LABA versus LABA 138,139,141 ; 2) Pre-specified analyses comparing  triple  therapy  versus  LAMA/LABA  or  LAMA 127,140,142 and,  3)  other  analyses  comparing  ICS/LABA  versus LABA/LAMA 143  or studying ICS withdrawal. 144-146 COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The treatment effect of ICS containing regimens (ICS/LAMA/LABA and ICS/LABA vs LABA/LAMA) is higher in patients with high exacerbation risk (≥ 2 exa cerbations and / or 1 hospitalization in the previous year). 126,127,140 Thus, the use of blood eosinophil counts to predict ICS effects should always be combined with clinical assessment of exacerbation risk (as indicated by the previous history of exacerbations).  Other factors (smoking status, ethnicity, geographical location) could influence the relationship between ICS effect and blood eosinophil count, but remains to be further explored. The mechanism for an increased ICS effect in COPD patients with higher blood eosinophil counts remains unclear.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The repeatability of blood eosinophil counts in a large primary care population appears reasonable, 147 although greater variability is observed at higher thresholds. 148 Better reproducibility is observed at the lower thresholds (e.g., 100 cells/µL). 149

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cohort studies have produced differing results with regard to the ability of blood eosinophils to predict future exacerbation outcomes, with either no relationship 150 or a positive relationship reported. 151,152 Differences between studies are likely to be related to different previous exacerbation histories and ICS use.

Results from RCTs have yielded varied results regarding the risk of decreased bone density and fractures with ICS treatment, which may be due to differences in study designs and/or differences between ICS compounds. 72,154,158-160 Results of observational studies suggest that ICS treatment could also be associated with increased risk of diabetes/poor control of diabetes, 161 cataracts, 162 and mycobacterial infection 163 including tuberculosis. 164,165 In the absence of RCT data on these issues, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions. 166 An increased risk of tuberculosis has been found in both observational studies and a meta-analysis of RCTs. 124,125

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adverse effects. There is high quality evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that ICS use is associated with higher prevalence of oral candidiasis, hoarse voice, skin bruising and pneumonia. 131 This excess risk has been confirmed in ICS studies using fluticasone furoate, even at low doses. 154 Patients at higher risk of pneumonia include those who currently smoke, are aged ≥ 55 years, have a history of prior exacerbations or pneumonia, a body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m 2 , a poor MRC dyspnea grade and/or severe airflow limitation. 155,156 Independent of ICS use, there is evidence that a blood eosinophil count < 2% increases the risk of developing pneumonia. 157 In studies of patients with moderate COPD, ICS by itself or in combination with a LABA did not increase the risk of pneumonia. 133,156 COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE #despite appropriate FIGURE 3.1

Withdrawal of ICS. Results from withdrawal studies provide equivocal results regarding consequences of withdrawal on lung function, symptoms and exacerbations. 167-171 Some studies, but not all, have shown an increase in exacerbations and/or symptoms following ICS withdrawal, while others have not. There has been evidence for a modest decrease in FEV1 (approximately 40 mL) with ICS withdrawal, 171 which could be associated with increased baseline circulating eosinophil level. 144 A recent study examining ICS withdrawal on a background of dual bronchodilator therapy demonstrated that both FEV1 loss and an increase in exacerbation frequency associated with ICS withdrawal was greatest among patients with a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/µl at baseline. 146 Differences between studies may relate to differences in methodology, including the use of background long-acting bronchodilator medication(s) which may minimize any effect of ICS withdrawal.

Triple inhaled therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The step up in inhaled treatment to LABA plus LAMA plus ICS (triple therapy) can occur by various approaches. 172 This may improve lung function, patient reported outcomes and prevent exacerbations. 173-176 Adding a LAMA to existing LABA/ICS improves lung function and patient reported outcomes, in particular exacerbation risk. 174,177-180  A doubleblind, parallel group, RCT reported that treatment with single inhaler triple therapy had greater clinical benefits compared to tiotropium in patients with symptomatic COPD, FEV1 < 50%, and a history of exacerbations, 142 and double-blind RCTs have reported benefits of single-inhaler triple therapy compared with LABA/LAMA combination therapy. 127,140

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The search for a mortality benefit with inhaled respiratory medications in patients with COPD has been elusive. Prior large, prospective and randomized trials with mortality as the primary endpoint failed to show a statistically significant survival benefit with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate or vilanterol/fluticasone furoate compared to the mono-components and placebo. 132,133 Recently, trials utilizing triple combinations of LABA/LAMA/ICS in comparison to LAMA, LABA/LAMA or LABA/ICS have reported reduced mortality with triple therapy. ,181 Unlike previous trials, the recent studies target patient populations that are enriched increased respiratory symptoms and a prior history of frequent and/or severe exacerbations with the majority receiving background treatment with triple or LABA/ICS based therapy before study enrollment. The largest of these trials (n=10,355) compared single inhaler triple therapy versus ICS/LABA or LABA/LAMA dual therapy 127 ; there was a statistically significant 42.1% reduction in the risk of ontreatment all-cause mortality and a 28.6% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality including off-treatment data, comparing triple therapy with LABA/LAMA. 183 Independently adjudicated findings reported reduced cardiovascular and respiratory deaths, and deaths associated with COPD. A post-hoc pooled analysis of triple therapy clinical trials conducted in severe COPD patients with a history of exacerbations showed a trend for lower mortality with use of triple inhaled therapy compared to non-ICS based treatments, but the differences were not statistically significant. 181 By contrast, smaller studies that have examined triple inhaled therapy for shorter durations in patients less severely obstructed without prior frequent or severe exacerbations have failed to show any mortality benefit. 182 It should be noted that none of the recent studies reporting a reduction in mortality with triple inhaled therapy had survival as the primary endpoint. 127,140,142 These effects are most likely to be seen in patients with COPD who are severely symptomatic, have moderate to very severe airflow obstruction and a history of frequent and/or severe exacerbations. Additionally, if de-escalating ICS is considered after respiratory stability is achieved in this patient group, it should be done with caution. Oral glucocorticoids COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oral glucocorticoids have numerous side effects, including steroid myopathy 184 which can contribute to muscle weakness, decreased functionality, and respiratory failure in subjects with very severe COPD. Systemic glucocorticoids for treating acute exacerbations in hospitalized patients, or during emergency department visits, have been shown to reduce the rate of treatment failure, the rate of relapse and improve lung function and breathlessness. 185 Conversely, prospective studies on the long-term effects of oral glucocorticoids in stable COPD are limited. 186,187 Therefore, while oral glucocorticoids play a role in the acute management of exacerbations, they have no role in the chronic daily treatment in COPD because of a lack of benefit balanced against a high rate of systemic complications.

Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors

Efficacy. The principal action of PDE4 inhibitors is to reduce inflammation by inhibiting the breakdown of intracellular cyclic AMP. 188 Roflumilast is a once daily oral medication with no direct bronchodilator activity. Roflumilast reduces moderate and severe exacerbations treated with systemic corticosteroids in patients with chronic bronchitis, severe to very severe COPD, and a history of exacerbations. 189 The effects on lung function are

<!-- PAGE=? -->
21

<!-- PAGE=? -->
also seen when roflumilast is added to long-acting bronchodilators, 190 and in patients who are not controlled on fixed-dose LABA/ICS combinations. 191 The beneficial effects of roflumilast have been reported to be greater in patients with a prior history of hospitalization for an acute exacerbation. 192,193 There has been no study directly comparing roflumilast with an inhaled corticosteroid.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Adverse effects. PDE4 inhibitors have more adverse effects than inhaled medications for COPD. 194 The most frequent are diarrhea, nausea, reduced appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain, sleep disturbance, and headache. Roflumilast should also be used with caution in patients with depression.

Antibiotics

More  recently  four  large  phase  3  studies  have  investigated  the  efficacy  of  the  anti-IL-5  monoclonal  antibody mepolizumab 208 and  the  anti-IL-5  receptorα antibody  benralizumab 209 in  patients  with  severe  COPD,  recurrent exacerbations and peripheral blood evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high intensity inhaled therapy. The studies showed a 15-20% reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations but the effect was not always statistically significant and it was variable between studies and doses.  There was no effect on FEV1 or quality of life scores and no consistent relationship between the response to treatment and the peripheral blood eosinophil count. A post-hoc analysis  of  the  mepolizumab  trial  showed  greater  benefit  and  more  clear  evidence  of  a  blood  eosinophil  related treatment effect against oral corticosteroid treated exacerbations raising the possibility that this treatment might find  a  role  in  a  highly  selected  subgroup  of  patients  with  eosinophilic  COPD  and  frequent  requirement  for  oral corticosteroids. Further studies are required to investigate this possibility. COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

ventilation. 249 Another study showed significant increases in FEV1 and 6-minute walk distance in subjects selected for the absence of interlobar collateral ventilation compared to the control group at 6 months. 27 Adverse effects in the endobronchial valve treatment group in both studies included pneumothorax, valve removal or valve replacement. 27 Greater benefit was shown in patents with heterogeneous compared to those with homogenous emphysema. 27  An RCT of endobronchial valve placement compared with usual care conducted only in homogenous emphysematous patients without interlobar collateral ventilation reported improvements in FEV1, 6-minute walk distance and health status at 6 months with targeted lobe reduction in 97% of subjects as measured by volumetric CT (mean reduction 1,195 ml). 250 A large multicenter, prospective, RCT of endobronchial valve treatment in patients with heterogeneous emphysema distribution and little to no collateral ventilation, demonstrated significant clinically meaningful benefits over current standard care in lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life out to at least 12-months post-procedure. 251 Pneumothorax was seen in 26.6% of subjects treated with the endobronchial valve usually within the first 72 hours of the procedure (76%). 250-252 Another large multicenter prospective RCT using a different type of endobronchial  valve  in  patients  selected  for  targeted  lobe  treatment  based  on  fissure  integrity  assessed  by  high resolution  chest CT showed a significant between-group increase in mean FEV1 from baseline (0.101L) and a 25.7% between-group difference in FEV1 responder rates (improvement ≥15%). These results persisted at 12 months. The endobronchial valve treated group also had significant reductions in hyperinflation and dyspnea. Improved health status  and  quality  of  life  was  also  observed.  Consistent  with  prior  studies,  pneumothorax  occurred  in  25.5%  of endobronchial valve treated patients; the majority occurred in the first three days following the procedure during the period of average hospitalization. Early-onset pneumothorax in the endobronchial valve treatment group likely results  from  lung  conformation  changes  due  to  acute  volume  reduction  in  the  emphysematous  targeted  lobe  by valve therapy that triggers rapid ipsilateral non-targeted lobe expansion, a recognized indicator of successful target lobe occlusion in patients with intact fissures or absence  of collateral ventilation. 253 The occurrence of pneumothorax highlights the need for physicians performing this procedure to have expertise in the management of procedural  complications. 253 After  the  post-procedural  period  however,  patients  treated  with  the  endobronchial valve compared to usual care tend to have a lower number of exacerbations and episodes of respiratory failure. A comparison of treatment benefits and complications associated with endobronchial valve placement compared to LVRS show comparable benefits with endobronchial valve treatment but with fewer complications. 251 Endobronchial valve therapy is now clinically available and approved for treatment in many countries in the treatment of patients who have intact fissures or lack of collateral ventilation. 251,254,255 Other  bronchoscopic  lung  volume  reduction  techniques  do  not  depend  upon  the  presence  of  intact  fissures  or absence of collateral ventilation. In a prospective RCT, targeted thermal vapour ablation of more diseased segments resulted  in  clinically  meaningful  and  statistically  significant  improvements  in  lung  function  and  health  status  at  6 months.  COPD  exacerbation  was  the  most  common  serious  adverse  event.  Durability  of  these  changes  was subsequently reported at 12 months follow-up. 256,257 This therapy has limited clinical availability. COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

Two multicenter trials have examined nitinol coils implanted into the lung compared to usual care on changes in 6minute walk distance, lung function and health status in patients with advanced homogenous and heterogeneous emphysema.

Additional data are needed to define the optimal bronchoscopic lung volume technique to produce bronchoscopic lung  volume  reduction  in  patients  who  lack  fissure  integrity,  or  exhibit  collateral  ventilation,  and  to  refine  the procedure to reduce complications and improve longer term clinical outcomes. 259

MANAGEMENT OF STABLE COPD

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERALL KEY POINTS:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The management strategy for stable COPD should be predominantly based on the individualized assessment of symptoms and future risk of exacerbations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All individuals who smoke should be strongly encouraged and supported to quit.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The main treatment goals are reduction of symptoms and future risk of exacerbations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management strategies include pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPD  patients  should  have  an  assessment  of  the  severity  of  their  airflow  obstruction,  symptoms,  history  of exacerbations,  exposure  to  risk  factors  and  comorbidities  ( Figure )  to  guide  management.  The  assessment  is summarized in Chapter 2 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
We propose a tailored approach to initiate treatment based on the level of symptoms and risk for exacerbations. Treatment can be escalated/de-escalated based on the presence of the predominant symptoms of breathlessness and exercise limitation, and the continued occurrence of exacerbations whilst on maintenance therapy. The basis for these  recommendations,  which  propose  an  organized  approach  to  treatment,  was  partly  derived  from  evidence generated from randomized controlled trials. However, as these recommendations are intended to support clinician decision-making, they also incorporate expert advice based on clinical experience. It is crucial for people with COPD to understand the nature of the disease, risk factors for its progression, and the role  that  they  and  their  healthcare  workers  must  play  in  order  to  achieve  optimal  management  and  health outcomes. Following the assessment, initial management should address reducing exposure to risk factors including smoking cessation.    Vaccination  should  be  offered,  and  patients  should  receive  general  advice  on  healthy  living,  including diet,  and  that  physical  exercise  is  safe  and  encouraged  for  people  with  COPD.  Initial  pharmacotherapy  should  be based  on  the  patient's  GOLD  group  ( Figure ).    Patients  should  be  offered  guidance  on  self-management  of breathlessness,  energy  conservation  and  stress  management,  and  they  should  be  given  a  written  action  plan. Comorbidities should also be managed ( Figure ). COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients should be reviewed after a suitable interval and their current level of symptoms (using either the CAT or mMRC scores) and exacerbation frequency assessed.  The effect of treatment and possible adverse effects should be evaluated, and comorbidities reassessed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhaler  technique;  adherence  to  prescribed  therapy  (both  pharmacological  and  non-pharmacological);  smoking status and continued exposure to risk factors should be checked. Physical activity should be encouraged and referral for pulmonary rehabilitation considered.  The need for oxygen therapy, ventilatory support, lung volume reduction and palliative approaches should be reviewed.  The action plan should be updated.  Spirometry should be repeated at least annually.

The Figure above suggests escalation and de-escalation strategies based on available efficacy as well as safety data. The response to treatment escalation should always be reviewed, and de-escalation should be considered if there is a lack of clinical benefit and/or side effects occur. De-escalation may also be considered in COPD patients receiving treatment who return with resolution of some symptoms that subsequently may require less therapy. Patients, in whom treatment modification is considered, in particular de-escalation, should be undertaken under close medical supervision. We are fully aware that treatment escalation has not been systematically tested; trials of de-escalation are also limited and only include ICS.

Initial pharmacological management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rescue short-acting bronchodilators should be prescribed to all patients for immediate symptom relief.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Group A

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All Group A patients should be offered bronchodilator treatment based on its effect on breathlessness. This can be either a short- or a long-acting bronchodilator.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
This should be continued if benefit is documented.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
33

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Group B

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial therapy should consist of a long acting bronchodilator. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are superior to short-acting bronchodilators taken as needed i.e., pro re nata (prn) and are therefore recommended. 260,261

<!-- PAGE=? -->
There is no evidence to recommend one class of long-acting bronchodilators over another for initial relief of symptoms in this group of patients. In the individual patient, the choice should depend on the patient's perception of symptom relief.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with severe breathlessness initial therapy with two bronchodilators may be considered. 121

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Group B patients are likely to have comorbidities that may add to their symptomatology and impact their prognosis, and these possibilities should be investigated. 262,263

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Group C

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial therapy should consist of a single long acting bronchodilator. In two head-to-head comparisons 99,264 the tested LAMA was superior to the LABA regarding exacerbation prevention (for details see Chapter 3 ) therefore we recommend starting therapy with a LAMA in this group.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ICS may cause side effects such as pneumonia, 155,264 so should be used as initial therapy only after the possible clinical benefits versus risks have been considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Group D ► In general, therapy can be started with a LAMA as it has effects on both breathlessness and exacerbations (see Chapter 3 ). ► For patients with more severe symptoms (order of magnitude of CAT™ ≥ 20), especially driven by greater dyspnea and / or exercise limitation, LAMA/LABA may be chosen as initial treatment based on studies with patient reported outcomes as the primary endpoint where LABA/LAMA combinations showed superior results compared to the single substances (see Chapter 3 ). An advantage of LABA/LAMA over LAMA for exacerbation prevention has not been consistently demonstrated, so the decision to use LABA/LAMA as initial treatment should be guided by the level of symptoms. ► In some patients, initial therapy with LABA/ICS may be the first choice; this treatment has the greatest likelihood of reducing exacerbations in patients with blood eosinophil counts ≥ 300 cells/µL. LABA/ICS may also be first choice in COPD patients with a history of asthma. COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

Follow-up pharmacological management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The follow-up pharmacological treatment algorithm can be applied to any patient who is already taking maintenance treatment(s) irrespective of the GOLD group allocated at treatment initiation. The need to treat primarily dyspnea/exercise limitation or prevent exacerbations further should be evaluated. If a change in treatment is considered necessary then select the corresponding algorithm for dyspnea or exacerbations; the exacerbation algorithm should also be used for patients who require a change in treatment for both dyspnea and exacerbations. Identify which box corresponds to the patient's the current treatment.

Follow up pharmacological management should be guided by the principles of first review and assess , then adjust if needed:

 Adjust pharmacological treatment, including escalation or de-escalation. Switching inhaler device or molecules within the same class (e.g. using a different long acting bronchodilator) may be considered as appropriate. Any change in treatment requires a subsequent review of the clinical response, including side effects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dyspnea

<!-- PAGE=? -->
► For patients with persistent breathlessness or exercise limitation on long acting bronchodilator monotherapy, 265 the use of two bronchodilators is recommended.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 If the addition of a second long acting bronchodilator does not improve symptoms, we suggest the treatment could be stepped down again to monotherapy. Switching inhaler device or molecules can also be considered. ► For patients with persistent breathlessness or exercise limitation on LABA/ICS treatment, LAMA can be added to escalate to triple therapy.  Alternatively, switching from LABA/ICS to LABA/LAMA should be considered if the original indication for ICS was inappropriate (e.g., an ICS was used to treat symptoms in the absence of a history of exacerbations), or there has been a lack of response to ICS treatment, or if ICS side effects warrant discontinuation. ► At all stages, dyspnea due to other causes (not COPD) should be investigated and treated appropriately. Inhaler technique and adherence should be considered as causes of inadequate treatment response. Exacerbations ► For patients with persistent exacerbations on long acting bronchodilator monotherapy, escalation to either LABA/LAMA or LABA/ICS is recommended. LABA/ICS may be preferred for patients with a history or findings suggestive of asthma. Blood eosinophil counts may identify patients with a greater likelihood of a beneficial response to ICS. For patients with one exacerbation per year, a peripheral blood level ≥ 300 eosinophils/µL identifies patients more likely to respond to LABA/ICS treatment. 138,139 For patients with ≥ 2 moderate exacerbations per year or at least one severe exacerbation requiring hospitalization in the prior year, LABA/ICS treatment can be considered at blood eosinophil counts ≥ 100 cells/µL, as ICS effects are more pronounced in patients with greater exacerbation frequency and/or severity. 127 COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who develop further exacerbations on LABA/LAMA therapy we suggest two alternative pathways. Blood eosinophil counts < 100 cells/µL can be used to predict a low likelihood of a beneficial ICS response:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Escalation to LABA/LAMA/ICS. A beneficial response after the addition of ICS may be observed at blood eosinophil counts ≥ 100 cells /µL , with a greater magnitude of response more likely with higher eosinophil counts.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Add roflumilast or azithromycin (see below) if blood eosinophils < 100 cells/µL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients who develop further exacerbations on LABA/ICS therapy, we recommend escalation to triple therapy by adding a LAMA. 127,179 Alternatively, treatment can be switched to LABA/LAMA if there has been a lack of response

<!-- PAGE=? -->
to ICS treatment, or if ICS side effects warrant discontinuation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If patients treated with LABA/LAMA/ICS who still have exacerbations the following options may be considered:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Add roflumilast. This may be considered in patients with an FEV1 < 50% predicted and chronic bronchitis, 191 particularly if they have experienced at least one hospitalization for an exacerbation in the previous year. 192,266

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Add a macrolide. The best available evidence exists for the use of azithromycin, especially in those who are not current smokers. 193,202 Consideration to the development of resistant organisms should be factored into decision-making.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
 Stopping ICS. This can be considered if there are adverse effects (such as pneumonia) or a reported lack of efficacy. However, a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells /µL identifies patients with the greatest likelihood of experiencing more exacerbations after ICS withdrawal and who subsequently should be followed closely for relapse of exacerbations . 145,146

TREATMENT OF STABLE COPD: NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Non-pharmacological  treatment  is  complementary  to  pharmacological  treatment  and  should  form  part  of  the comprehensive management of COPD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
After receiving a diagnosis of COPD a patient should be given further information about the condition. Physicians should emphasize the importance of a smoke free environment, prescribe vaccinations, empower adherence to prescribed medication, ensure proper inhaler technique, promote physical activity and refer patients (GOLD B GOLD D) to pulmonary rehabilitation.

Education and self-management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Self-management education and coaching by healthcare professionals should be a major component of the 'Chronic Care Model' within the context of the healthcare delivery system.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The aim of self-management interventions is to motivate, engage and coach patients to positively adapt their health behavior(s)  and  develop  skills  to  better  manage  their  COPD  on  a  day-to-day  basis. 267 Physicians  and  healthcare providers need to go beyond pure education/advice-giving (didactic) approaches to help patients learn and adopt sustainable self-management skills. The basis of enabling patients to become active partners in their ongoing care is to  build  knowledge  and  skills.  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  patient  education  alone  does  not  itself  change behavior  or  even  motivate  patients,  and  it  has  had  no  impact  on  improving  exercise  performance  or  lung function, 268,269 but it can play a role in improving skills, ability to cope with illness, and health status. 217

MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Routine follow-up of COPD patients is essential. Lung function may worsen over time, even with the best available care. Symptoms, exacerbations and objective measures of airflow limitation should be monitored to determine when to modify management and to identify any complications and/or comorbidities that may develop. Based on current literature, comprehensive self-management or routine monitoring has not shown long-term benefits in terms of health status over usual care alone for COPD patients in general practice. 270

MANAGEMENT OF EXACERBATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OVERALL KEY POINTS:

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An exacerbation of COPD is defined as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
As the symptoms are not specific to COPD relevant differential diagnoses should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exacerbations of COPD can be precipitated by several factors. The most common causes are respiratory tract infections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The goal for treatment of COPD exacerbations is to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and to prevent subsequent events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Short-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, with or without short-acting anticholinergics, are recommended as the initial bronchodilators to treat an acute exacerbation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators should be initiated as soon as possible before hospital discharge.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic corticosteroids can improve lung function (FEV1), oxygenation and shorten recovery time and hospitalization duration. Duration of therapy should not be more than 5-7 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotics, when indicated, can shorten recovery time, reduce the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and hospitalization duration. Duration of therapy should be 5-7 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methylxanthines are not recommended due to increased side effect profiles.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Non-invasive mechanical ventilation should be the first mode of ventilation used in COPD patients with acute respiratory failure who have no absolute contraindication because it improves gas exchange, reduces work of breathing and the need for intubation, decreases hospitalization duration and improves survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Following an exacerbation, appropriate measures for exacerbation prevention should be initiated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is defined as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that results in additional therapy. 271,272 Exacerbations of COPD are important events in the management of  COPD  because  they  negatively  impact  health  status,  rates  of  hospitalization  and  readmission,  and  disease progression.  COPD  exacerbations  are  complex  events  usually  associated  with  increased  airway  inflammation, increased mucus production and marked gas trapping. These changes contribute to increased dyspnea that is the key

<!-- PAGE=? -->
40

<!-- PAGE=? -->
symptom  of  an  exacerbation.  Other  symptoms  include  increased  sputum  purulence  and  volume,  together  with increased cough and wheeze. 273  As other comorbidities that may worsen respiratory symptoms are common in COPD patients,  clinical  assessment  to  rule  out  differential  diagnoses  should  be  considered  before  diagnosis  of  a  COPD exacerbation ( Table ).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Severe (patient requires hospitalization or visits the emergency room). Severe exacerbations may also be associated with acute respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is now recognized that many exacerbations are not reported to healthcare professionals for therapy and yet these events, although often shorter in duration, also have a significant impact on health status. 274,275 Thus COPD patients need  to  receive  education  about  the  importance  of  understanding  exacerbation  symptoms  and  when  to  seek professional healthcare.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exacerbations are mainly triggered by respiratory viral infections although bacterial infections and environmental factors  such  as  pollution  and  ambient  temperature  may  also  initiate  and/or  amplify  these  events. 276 Short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with increased hospitalizations for acute exacerbations and increased mortality of COPD. 277-279  The most common virus isolated is human rhinovirus (the cause of the common cold) and can be detected for up to a week after an exacerbation onset. 276,280 When associated with viral infections,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
41

<!-- PAGE=? -->
exacerbations are often more severe, last longer and precipitate more hospitalizations, as seen during winter.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exacerbations  can  be  associated  with  increased  sputum  production  and,  if  purulent,  there  are  studies  that demonstrated increased bacteria in the sputum 273,280,281 There is reasonable evidence to support the concept that eosinophils  are  increased  in  the  airways,  lung,  and  blood  in  a  significant  proportion  of  patients  with  COPD. Furthermore,  eosinophil numbers  increase  together  with neutrophils and  other inflammatory  cells during exacerbations in a proportion of subjects with COPD exacerbations. 282-284 The presence of sputum eosinophilia has been  related  to  susceptibility  to  viral  infection. 281 It  has  been  suggested  that  exacerbations  associated  with  an increase in sputum or blood eosinophils may be more responsive to systemic steroids 285 although more prospective trials are needed to test this hypothesis. 285

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During a COPD exacerbation, symptoms usually last between 7 to 10 days, but some events may last longer. At 8 weeks,  20%  of  patients  have  not  recovered  to  their  pre-exacerbation  state. 286 It  is  well  established  that  COPD exacerbations  contribute  to  disease  progression. 287 Disease  progression  is  even  more  likely  if  recovery  from exacerbations  is  slow. 288 Exacerbations  can  also  cluster  in  time  and  once  a  COPD  patient  experiences  an exacerbation, they will show increased susceptibility to another event 289,290 (see Chapter 2 of full report).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vitamin D has an immune-modulating role and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of exacerbations. As with all chronic diseases vitamin D levels are lower in COPD than in health. Studies have shown that supplementation in subjects  with  severe  deficiency  results  in  a  50%  reduction  in  episodes  and  hospital  admission. 216 Therefore  it  is recommended  that  all  patients  hospitalized  for  exacerbations  should  be  assessed  and  investigated  for  severe deficiency (<10 ng/ml or <25 nM) followed by supplementation if required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some COPD patients are particularly susceptible to frequent exacerbations (defined as two or more exacerbations per year), and these patients have been shown to have worse health status and morbidity than patients with less frequent  exacerbations. 272 Patients  at  high  risk  of  frequent  exacerbations  can  be  recognized  across  all  disease severity  groups.  The  exact  reason  for  an  individual's  increased  susceptibility  to  exacerbation  symptoms  remains largely  unknown.  However,  the  perception  of  breathlessness  is  greater  in  frequent  exacerbators  than  infrequent exacerbators, 291 suggesting that a perception of breathing difficulty may contribute to precipitating the respiratory symptoms of  an  exacerbation  rather  than  solely  physiological,  or  causative  factors.  The  strongest  predictor  of  a patient's future exacerbation frequency remains the number of exacerbations they have had in the prior year. 289 It is recognized  that  these  patients  form  a  moderately  stable  phenotype,  although  some  studies  have  shown  that  a significant proportion of patients change their exacerbation frequency especially with worsening FEV1. 292 Other  factors  that  have  been  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  acute  exacerbations  and/or  severity  of exacerbations include an increase in the ratio of the pulmonary artery to aorta cross sectional dimension (i.e., ratio > 1), 293 a  greater  percentage  of  emphysema  or  airway  wall  thickness 294 measured  by  chest  CT  imaging  and  the presence of chronic bronchitis. 21,295 COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE

TREATMENT OPTIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment setting

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The goals of treatment for COPD exacerbations are to minimize the negative impact of the current exacerbation and prevent the development of subsequent events. 296 Depending on the severity of an exacerbation and/or the severity of the underlying disease, an exacerbation can be managed in either the outpatient or inpatient setting. More than 80% of exacerbations are managed on an outpatient basis with pharmacological therapies including bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. 15,23,24

<!-- PAGE=? -->
42

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When patients with a COPD exacerbation come to the emergency department, they should be provided with supplemental oxygen and undergo assessment to determine whether the exacerbation is life-threatening and if increased work of breathing or impaired gas exchange requires consideration for non-invasive ventilation ( see Table ). If so, healthcare providers should consider admission to the respiratory or intensive care unit of the hospital. Otherwise, the patient may be managed in the emergency department or hospital ward unit. In addition to pharmacological therapy, hospital management of exacerbations includes respiratory support (oxygen therapy, ventilation). The management of severe, but not life-threatening, exacerbations is also outlined ( see Table ).

The clinical presentation of COPD exacerbation is heterogeneous, thus we recommend that in hospitalized patients the severity of the exacerbation should be based on the patient's clinical signs and recommend the following classification. 297

Acute respiratory failure - non-life-threatening: Respiratory rate: > 30 breaths per minute; using accessory respiratory muscles; no change in mental status; hypoxemia improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask 25-30% FiO2; hypercarbia i.e., PaCO2 increased compared with baseline or elevated 50-60 mmHg.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute respiratory failure - life-threatening: Respiratory rate: > 30 breaths per minute; using accessory respiratory muscles; acute changes in mental status; hypoxemia not improved with supplemental oxygen via Venturi mask or requiring FiO2 > 40%; hypercarbia i.e., PaCO2 increased compared with baseline or elevated > 60 mmHg or the presence of acidosis (pH ≤ 7.25).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term prognosis following hospitalization for COPD exacerbation is poor, with a five-year mortality rate of about 50%. 298 Factors  independently  associated  with  poor  outcome  include  older  age,  lower  BMI,  comorbidities  (e.g., cardiovascular  disease  or  lung  cancer),  previous  hospitalizations  for  COPD  exacerbations,  clinical  severity  of  the index  exacerbation  and  need  for  long-term  oxygen  therapy  at  discharge. 299-301 Patients  characterized  by  a  higher prevalence and severity of respiratory symptoms, poorer quality of life, worse lung function, lower exercise capacity, lower lung density and thickened bronchial walls on CT-scan are also at increased risk for a higher mortality following an acute COPD exacerbation. 302 Mortality risk may be heightened during spells of cold weather. 303

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A recent updated Cochrane review concluded that the use of COPD exacerbation action plans with a single short educational  component,  in  conjunction  with  ongoing  support,  reduced  in-hospital  healthcare  utilization.  Such educational interventions were also found to increase the treatment of COPD exacerbations with corticosteroids and antibiotics. 304

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory support

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Oxygen therapy. This is a key component of hospital treatment of an exacerbation. Supplemental oxygen should be titrated to improve the patient's hypoxemia with a target saturation of 88-92%. 305 Once oxygen is started, blood gases should be checked frequently to ensure satisfactory oxygenation without carbon dioxide retention and/or worsening acidosis. A recent study demonstrated that venous blood gas to assess bicarbonate levels and pH is accurate when compared with arterial blood gas assessment. 306 Additional data are needed to clarify the utility of venous blood gas sampling to make clinical decisions in scenarios of acute respiratory failure; most patients included

had a pH > 7.30 on presentation, PCO2 levels were dissimilar when measured by venous compared to arterial blood samples and the severity of airflow limitation was not reported. 306 Venturi masks (high-flow devices) offer more accurate and controlled delivery of oxygen than do nasal prongs. 307

<!-- PAGE=? -->
High-flow oxygen therapy by nasal cannula. High-flow oxygen (HFO) involves nasal delivery of heated and humidified oxygen via special devices (e.g., Vapotherm®, Comfort Flo®, or Optiflow®) at rates up to 8 L/min in infants and up to 60 L/min in adults. 308 In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFO may be an alternative to standard oxygen therapy or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. In observational studies, HFO has been associated with decreased respiratory rate and effort, decreased work of breathing, improved gas exchange, improved lung volume, dynamic compliance, transpulmonary pressures and homogeneity. All these physiologic benefits might positively improve oxygenation and clinical outcome in ARF patients. 309 Studies to date were performed in COPD patients with very severe underlying disease that required supplemental oxygen; a randomized cross-over trial demonstrated that HFO improved oxygenation and ventilation, and decreased hypercarbia. 310,311 A systematic review of RCTs in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure suggests that HFO tends to reduce intubation rate, but did not meet statistical significance compared with conventional oxygen therapy or NIV, and had no effect on mortality. 312 Several randomized controlled trials have also studied the use of HFO therapy to reduced hypercapnia and improved health-related quality of life in patients with stable hypercapnic COPD. 313-315 There is a need for well-designed, randomized, multicenter trials to study the effects of HFO in both acute and chronic hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure in COPD patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ventilatory Support. Some patients need immediate admission to the respiratory care or intensive care unit (ICU) ( see Table ). Admission of patients with severe exacerbations to intermediate or special respiratory care units may be appropriate if adequate personnel skills and equipment exist to identify and manage acute respiratory failure. Ventilatory support in an exacerbation can be provided by either noninvasive (nasal or facial mask) or invasive (orotracheal tube or tracheostomy) ventilation. Respiratory stimulants are not recommended for acute respiratory failure. 316 COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE (pH < 7.25) despite

Noninvasive mechanical ventilation. The use of noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) is preferred over invasive ventilation (intubation and positive pressure ventilation) as the initial mode of ventilation to treat acute respiratory failure in patients hospitalized for acute exacerbations of COPD. NIV has been studied in RCTs showing a success rate of 80-85%. 225,317-320 NIV has been shown to improve oxygenation and acute respiratory acidosis i.e., NIV increases pH and decreases PaCO2. NIV also decreases respiratory rate, work of breathing and the severity of breathlessness but also decreases complications such as ventilator associated pneumonia, and length of hospital stay. More importantly, mortality and intubation rates are reduced by this intervention. 318,321-323 Once patients improve and can tolerate at least 4 hours of unassisted breathing, NIV can be directly discontinued without any need for a 'weaning' period. 324 The indications for NIV 320 are summarized in the Table .

Hospital discharge and follow-up The cause, severity, impact, treatment and time course of exacerbations varies from patient to patient and facilities in the community, and healthcare systems, differ from country to country. Accordingly, there are no standards that can be applied to the timing and nature of discharge. When features related to re-hospitalization and mortality have been studied, defects in perceived optimal management have been identified including spirometric assessment and arterial blood gas analysis. 326 Mortality relates to patient age, the presence of acidotic respiratory failure, the need for ventilatory support and comorbidities including anxiety and depression ( see Table ). 327 COPYRIGHT MATERIAL - DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE
