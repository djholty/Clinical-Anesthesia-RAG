Th e most common cause of acute spinal cord injury is trauma. However,  various  disease  processes,  including  tumors  and congenital  and  degenerative  diseases  of  the  spinal  cord  and vertebral column, can also cause cord injury.

ACUTE SPINAL CORD INJURY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mobility of the cervical spine makes it vulnerable to injury, especially hyperextension injury, during impact accidents. It is estimated that cervical spine injury occurs in 1.5% to 3.0% of all major trauma victims. About 4% to 5% of patients with traumatic head injury have a concurrent injury to the spine, typically occurring in the upper cervical spine (i.e., C1 to C3). Trauma can also injure the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord segments.

Th e  clinical  manifestations  of  acute  spinal  cord  injury depend on both the extent and the site of injury. Acute spinal

cord  injury  initially  produces fl accid  paralysis,  with  loss  of sensation  below  the  level  of  injury. Th e  extent  of  injury  is commonly described in terms of the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classi fi cation system (Table 11-1), which characterizes the injury in terms of both motor and sensory impairment (Table 11-2 and Figure 11-1). A score of A indicates a "complete" injury in which all motor and sensory function is lost below the level of the lesion, including function at the lower sacral segments of S4 and S5, which is determined by assessing rectal tone and sensation. Scores of B through D are assigned to "incomplete" lesions in which some degree of spinal cord integrity is maintained below the level of injury. A score of E indicates normal spinal cord function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  extent  of  physiologic  e ff ects  from  spinal  cord  injury depends on the level of injury, with the most severe physiologic derangements occurring with injury to the cervical cord and  lesser  perturbations  occurring  with  more  caudal  cord injuries.  Reductions  in  blood  pressure  are  common,  especially with cervical cord injury, and are in fl uenced by (1) loss of sympathetic nervous system activity and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, and (2) bradycardia resulting from loss of the T1-T4 sympathetic innervation to the heart. Hypotension can also occur with thoracic and lumbar cord injuries, although typically it is less severe than with cervical injuries. Th ese hemodynamic perturbations are collectively known as spinal shock and typically last 1 to 3 weeks. With cervical and upper thoracic cord injury, the major cause of morbidity and mortality is alveolar hypoventilation combined with an inability to clear bronchial secretions. Respiratory muscles are not a ff ected  with  lumbar  and  low  thoracic  injuries,  so  minimal respiratory  impairment can be expected with these injuries. Aspiration  of  gastric  contents,  pneumonia,  and  pulmonary embolism are constant threats during spinal shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cervical spine radiographs are obtained for a large percentage of patients who come for treatment of various forms of trauma caused by fear that occult cervical spine injuries will be missed. However, the probability of cervical spine injury is minimal in patients who meet the following fi ve criteria: (1) no midline cervical spine tenderness, (2) no focal neurologic

de fi cits, (3) normal sensorium, (4) no intoxication, and (5) no painful distracting injury. Patients who meet these criteria do not require routine imaging studies to rule out occult cervical spine injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An  estimated  two  thirds  of  trauma  patients  have  multiple injuries that can interfere with cervical spine evaluation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

Evaluation  ideally  includes  computed  tomography  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging,  but  imaging  may  not  be  practical in some cases because of the risk of transporting patients in unstable  condition.  For  this  reason,  standard  radiographic views of the cervical spine, o ft en taken with a portable x-ray machine, are frequently relied upon to evaluate for the presence  of  cervical  spine  injury  and  associated  instability.  For cervical spine imaging to be useful, the entire cervical spine (including the body of the fi rst thoracic vertebra) must be visible. Images are analyzed for alignment of the vertebrae (lateral view) and presence of fractures (all views), and disk and so ft tissue spaces are evaluated. Th e sensitivity of plain radiographs for  detecting cervical spine injury is less than 100%, and so the likelihood of cervical spine injury must be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical signs and symptoms and risk factors.  If  there  is  any  doubt,  it  is  prudent  to  treat  all  acute cervical spine injuries as potentially unstable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  a  cervical  fracture  or  dislocation  entails immediate  immobilization  to  limit  neck fl exion  and  extension. So ft neck collars have little e ff ect in limiting neck fl exion or  neck  extension.  Hard  neck  collars  limit  neck fl exion and extension  by  only  about  25%.  Immobilization  and  traction provided by halo-thoracic devices are most e ff ective  in  preventing cervical spine movement. During direct laryngoscopy, manual in-line stabilization (in which an assistant's hands are placed  on  each  side  of  the  patient's  face  with  the fi ngertips resting on the mastoid process and application of downward pressure against a fi rm table surface to hold the head immobile in a neutral position) is recommended to help minimize

cervical spine fl exion and extension. Cervical spine movement during direct laryngoscopy is likely to be concentrated in the occipito-atlanto-axial area, which suggests an increased risk of spinal cord injury at this level in vulnerable patients, even with the use of in-line stabilization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Not only can movement of the neck in the presence of cervical  spine  injury  cause  mechanical  deformation  of  the  spinal cord, but there is an even greater risk that neck motion that elongates the cord will compromise the blood supply to the spinal cord by narrowing the longitudinal blood vessels. In  fact,  maintenance  of  perfusion  pressure  may  be  of  more importance  than  positioning  for  prevention  of  spinal  cord injury in the presence of cervical spine injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  acute  spinal  cord  injury  o ft en  require  special precautions during airway management. When direct laryngoscopy  is  performed,  neck  movement  must  be  minimized and hypotension avoided so that spinal cord perfusion pressure can be maintained. However, fear of possible spinal cord compression must not prevent necessary airway interventions. Extensive clinical experience supports the use of direct laryngoscopy for orotracheal intubation provided that (1) maneuvers are taken to stabilize the head during the procedure and thus to avoid hyperextension of the neck, and (2) prior evaluation of the airway did not suggest the likelihood of any associated technical di ffi culties.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Awake fi beroptic  laryngoscopy  under  topical  anesthesia  is  an  alternative  to  direct  laryngoscopy  if  the  patient  is cooperative and airway trauma-with associated blood, secretions,  and  anatomic  deformities-does  not  preclude  visualization with the fi berscope. It is important to remember that coughing  during  topical  anesthetization  of  the  airway  and fi beroptic intubation may result in cervical spine movement. It is reasonable to have an assistant maintain manual in-line stabilization of the cervical spine during all airway manipulations.  Alternative  methods  to  secure  the  airway  include rapid-sequence or non-rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia with intravenous anesthetics and a muscle relaxant. However, induction of general anesthesia should precede tracheal intubation only in those patients in whom the clinician anticipates e ff ective  ventilation  of  the  lungs  by  mask  should initial  attempts  at  endotracheal  intubation  fail.  Intubation under general anesthesia can be performed using a standard laryngoscope,  a  videolaryngoscope,  a fi beroptic  bronchoscope, or any other airway device depending on the clinician's experience and the patient's anatomic requirements. When the cervical spine is unstable or there is a strong suspicion of cervical spine injury, it is important to proceed carefully because neck  hyperextension  could  further  damage  the  spinal  cord. However, there is no evidence of increased neurologic morbidity  a ft er  elective  or  emergency  orotracheal  intubation  of anesthetized or awake patients who have an unstable cervical spine if appropriate steps are taken to minimize neck movement. Awake tracheostomy is reserved for the most challenging airway conditions, in which neck injury, combined with facial fractures or other severe anomalies of airway anatomy, makes securing the airway by nonsurgical means di ffi cult or unsafe. Airway management in the presence of cervical spine injury  should  be  dictated  by  common  sense,  not  dogmatic approaches. Certainly, clinical experience supports the safety of a variety of airway management techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  absence  of  compensatory  sympathetic  nervous  system responses in patients with cervical or high thoracic spinal  cord  injury  makes  these  patients  particularly  vulnerable to dramatic decreases in blood pressure following changes in body position, blood loss, or positive pressure ventilation. To minimize these  e ff ects,  liberal  intravenous  infusion  of  crystalloid  solutions  may  be  necessary  to fi ll  the  intravascular space,  which  has  been  compromised  by  vasodilation.  Acute blood loss should be treated promptly. Electrocardiographic abnormalities are common during the acute phase of spinal cord injury,  especially  with  cervical  cord  injuries.  Breathing is  best  managed by mechanical ventilation, since abdominal and  intercostal  muscle  weakness  or  paralysis  is  exacerbated by general anesthesia and increases the likelihood of respiratory failure with ensuing hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Body temperature should be monitored and manipulated, because patients tend to become poikilothermic in dermatomes below the level of the spinal cord lesion. Maintenance of anesthesia is targeted at ensuring physiologic stability and facilitating tolerance of the endotracheal tube. Volatile and intravenous anesthetics are both satisfactory. Nitrous oxide should be used with great caution, if at all, given concerns for co-existing trauma and air entrainment in closed spaces, as can occur with basilar

skull fracture or rib fracture. Nitrous oxide could contribute to expansion of pneumocephalus or pneumothorax. Arterial hypoxemia  is  common  following  spinal  cord  injury,  which emphasizes the need for continuous pulse oximetry and oxygen supplementation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Muscle relaxant use should be based on the operative site and the level of spinal cord injury. If muscle relaxants are necessary,  the  sympathomimetic  e ff ects  of  pancuronium  makes this  drug  an  attractive  choice,  but  other  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants can be used safely. Succinylcholine does not provoke  excessive  release  of  potassium  during  the fi rst  few hours  a ft er  spinal  cord  injury. Th e  bene fi ts  of  succinylcholine, which include rapid onset of action and short duration of paralysis must, as always, be weighed against potential side e ff ects. Use of a nondepolarizing relaxant, with mask ventilation while cricoid pressure is employed, is another alternative to airway management during anesthetic induction and before laryngoscopy. A nondepolarizing relaxant may also facilitate patient positioning.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC SPINAL CORD INJURY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sequelae of chronic spinal cord injury include impaired alveolar ventilation, cardiovascular instability manifested as autonomic hyperre fl exia, chronic pulmonary and genitourinary tract infections, anemia, and altered thermoregulation (Table 11-3). Injuries that occur more rostral along the spinal cord tend to have more signi fi cant systemic e ff ects. Chronic urinary tract infection re fl ects the inability to empty the bladder completely and predisposes to calculus formation. As a result, renal failure may occur and is a common cause of death in patients with chronic spinal cord injury. Prolonged immobility leads to osteoporosis, skeletal muscle atrophy, and decubitus ulcers. Immobility can also predispose patients to deep venous thrombosis, so prophylactic measures such as use of compression stockings, low-dose anticoagulant therapy, and insertion of inferior vena cava fi lters may be indicated. Pathologic fractures can occur when these patients are moved. Pressure points should be well protected and padded to minimize the likelihood of trauma to the skin and the development of decubitus ulcers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depression  and  chronic  pain  are  common  problems  following spinal cord injury. Nerve root pain is localized at or near the level of injury. Visceral pain is produced by distention of the bladder or bowel. Phantom body pain can occur in areas of complete sensory loss. As a result of depression and/ or pain, these patients are o ft en treated with antidepressants and analgesics, including opioids, that require attention when anesthetic management is planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  weeks  a ft er  acute  spinal  cord  injury,  spinal  cord re fl exes  gradually  return,  and  patients  enter  a  more  chronic stage characterized by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system  and  involuntary  skeletal  muscle  spasms.  Baclofen, which  potentiates  the  inhibitory  e ff ects  of γ -aminobutyric acid,  is  useful  for  treating  spasticity.  Abrupt  cessation  of baclofen therapy, as may  occur  with  hospitalization  for an  unrelated  problem,  may  result  in  dramatic  withdrawal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
reactions, including seizures. Diazepam and other benzodiazepines also facilitate the inhibitory e ff ects of γ -aminobutyric acid  and  may  have  utility  in  the  management  of  a  patient receiving  baclofen.  Spasticity  refractory  to  pharmacologic suppression may require surgical treatment via dorsal rhizotomy or myelotomy, but usually implantation of a spinal cord stimulator or subarachnoid baclofen pump will be undertaken before rhizotomy is considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal cord injury at or above the fift h cervical vertebra may result in apnea caused by denervation of the diaphragm (C3 to C5 innervation). When function of the diaphragm is intact, the tidal volume is likely to remain adequate, but the ability to cough and clear secretions from the airway is o ft en impaired because of a decreased expiratory reserve volume resulting from denervation of intercostal and abdominal muscles. Indeed, acute spinal cord injury at the cervical level is accompanied by marked decreases in vital capacity. Arterial hypoxemia is a consistent early fi nding  following  cervical  spinal  cord  injury.  Tracheobronchial suctioning has been associated with bradycardia and even cardiac arrest in these patients, so it is important to optimize arterial oxygenation before suctioning the airway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
relaxants is useful to facilitate tracheal intubation and prevent re fl ex skeletal muscle spasms in response to surgical stimulation. Nondepolarizing muscle relaxants are the primary choice in this circumstance, since succinylcholine is likely to provoke hyperkalemia,  particularly  during  the  initial  6  months  a ft er spinal cord injury. Indeed, it seems reasonable to avoid the use of succinylcholine in patients with a spinal cord injury of longer than 24 hours' duration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  anesthesiologist  must  be  aware  of  the  potential  for altered hemodynamics, especially with cervical and high thoracic cord lesions. Th ese can manifest as wide alterations in both blood pressure and heart rate. In chronically immobile patients, the index of suspicion for pulmonary thromboembolism, which can manifest as alterations in hemodynamics and  oxygenation,  must  be  high.  If  intercostal  muscle  function is impaired, patients may be at high risk of postoperative hypoventilation and may have an impaired cough and a corresponding accumulation of secretions. Baclofen and benzodiazepines should be continued throughout the perioperative period to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AUTONOMIC HYPERREFLEXIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Autonomic hyperre fl exia appears following spinal shock and in association with return of spinal cord re fl exes. Th is  re fl ex response can be initiated by cutaneous or visceral stimulation below the level of spinal cord injury. Surgery and distention of a hollow viscus such as the bladder or rectum are common stimuli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stimulation below the level of spinal cord injury initiates a ff erent  impulses  that  enter  the  spinal  cord  (Figure  11-2). Because of re fl exes entirely within the spinal cord itself, these impulses  elicit  an  increase  in  sympathetic  nervous  system activity along the splanchnic out fl ow tract. In neurologically intact individuals, this out fl ow would be modulated by inhibitory impulses from higher centers in the central nervous system, but in the presence of a spinal cord lesion, this out fl ow is isolated from inhibitory impulses from above, so generalized vasoconstriction occurs below the level of the spinal cord injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertension and re fl ex bradycardia are the hallmarks of autonomic hyperre fl exia.  Stimulation  of  the  carotid  sinus  is the  cause  of  the  bradycardia.  Re fl ex  cutaneous vasodilation occurs above the level of the spinal cord injury. Nasal stu ffi ness re fl ects this vasodilation. Patients may complain of headache and blurred vision, which indicate severe hypertension. Th ese increases in blood pressure can result in cerebral, retinal, or subarachnoid hemorrhage as well as increased operative blood loss. Loss of consciousness and seizures may also occur, and cardiac  dysrhythmias  are  o ft en  present.  Pulmonary  edema re fl ects  acute  le ft ventricular  failure  resulting  from  dramatically increased a ft erload.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of autonomic hyperre fl exia depends on the level of spinal cord injury. Approximately 85% of patients with lesions above T6 exhibit this re fl ex. It is unlikely to be associated with spinal cord lesions below T10 (Figure 11-3). Since the greater, lesser, and least splanchnic nerves typically receive

FIGURE 11-2 Sequence of events associated with clinical manifestations of autonomic hyperreflexia. Because the efferent impulses from the brain that produce compensatory vasodilation (in response to increased baroreceptor activity) cannot reach the neurologically isolated portion of the spinal cord, unmodulated vasoconstriction develops below the level of the spinal cord injury, resulting in systemic hypertension.

innervation from T5 to T9, T10 and T11, and T12, respectively,  loss  of  input  from  higher  centers  to  these  nerves  and to the sympathetic chain will place larger regions of the body at risk of exaggerated autonomic re fl exes. Spinal cord lesions above T5 and T6 will completely isolate the splanchnic nerves from higher centers of control, whereas spinal cord lesions at lumbar levels of the cord will leave the peripheral sympathetic nervous system intact.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of patients at risk should begin with e ff orts to prevent the development of autonomic hyperre fl exia. Patients who have no history of this re fl ex are still at risk of its occurrence  during  surgery,  simply  because  of  the  intense  stimuli that surgery can produce. Before surgical or other stimulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
260

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is initiated in locations that lack sensory innervation, general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia should be instituted. Epidural anesthesia has been described for the treatment of autonomic hyperre fl exia provoked by uterine contractions during labor. However, epidural anesthesia may be less e ff ective than spinal anesthesia in preventing autonomic hyperre fl exia because of its relative sparing of the sacral segments and lesser block density. Blocking a ff erent pathways with topical local anesthetics applied  to  the  urethra  for  a  cystoscopic  procedure  does not prevent autonomic hyperre fl exia, because this form of anesthesia does not block the bladder muscle proprioceptors that are stimulated by bladder distention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless of the anesthesia technique selected, vasodilator drugs having a short half-life (e.g., sodium nitroprusside) should be readily available to treat sudden-onset severe hypertension. Persistence of hypertension requires continuous infusion of vasodilators, perhaps supplemented with longer-acting drugs such as hydralazine. It is important to note that autonomic hyperre fl exia may fi rst manifest postoperatively when the e ff ects of the anesthetic drugs begin to wane.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SPINAL CORD TUMORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal cord tumors can be divided into two broad categories. Intramedullary tumors are located within the spinal cord and account  for  approximately  10%  of  tumors  a ff ecting  the  spinal column. Gliomas and ependymomas account for the vast majority  of  intramedullary  tumors. Extramedullary tumors can  be  either  intradural  or  extradural.  Neuro fi bromas  and meningiomas account for most of the intradural tumors. Metastatic lesions, usually from lung, breast, or prostate cancer or myeloma, are the most common extradural lesions. Other mass lesions of the spinal cord, including abscesses and hematomas, share many of the clinical signs and symptoms of tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal cord tumors typically present with symptoms of cord compression. Pain is a common fi nding and is usually aggravated by coughing or straining. Motor symptoms and sphincter disturbances may occur. Sometimes spinal tenderness may be present. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms and imaging of the spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging is the technique of choice. Treatment and prognosis depend on the nature of the lesion,  and  treatment  may  include  corticosteroids,  radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgical decompression or excision.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia involves ensuring adequate spinal cord oxygenation and perfusion. Th is is achieved by maintaining Pa o 2 at su ffi cient levels and by avoiding hypotension and anemia. Speci fi cs of management will depend on the level of the lesion and the extent of neurologic impairment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tumors involving the cervical spinal cord may in fl uence the approach used to secure the airway. Signi fi cant motion of the cervical spine could lead to further cord compromise via compression and decreased cord perfusion. With any form of disease that places the cervical spine at risk of new injury, airway management should be similar to that discussed for the management of acute spinal cord injury. Th is  may include in-line stabilization during laryngoscopy with either a standard laryngoscope or videolaryngoscope or awake fi beroptic intubation. If the approach to patient management is uncertain, it is useful, before administering sedatives or narcotics, to have the patient placed in position for airway management (e.g., on the operating room table) and then to move carefully through the anticipated variations  of  head  and  neck  movements  before  actual  airway manipulation or induction of anesthesia is carried out. Elicitation or exacerbation of symptoms upon movement should tip the clinician toward fi beroptic laryngoscopy (with the head held in neutral position) or other options that are less likely to cause movement with its potential for harm to the spinal cord. Use of a light wand or videolaryngoscope may facilitate intubation of the trachea without signi fi cant neck extension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Safe resection of a tumor may require the use of intraoperative electrophysiologic monitoring of neurologic function. Electromyography, somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring,  and  motor-evoked  potential  monitoring  have  a  variety of anesthetic implications. Th e preferred approach may vary from institution to institution.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Succinylcholine  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients with spinal cord tumors given the risk of associated hyperkalemia. Neuromuscular monitoring with train-of-four stimulation should be performed on a neurologically intact extremity. Upper  motor  neuron  impairment  may  lead  to  upregulation of acetylcholine receptors, which makes an a ff ected extremity more resistant to nondepolarizing blockade. If there are signi fi -cant concerns regarding the possibility of altered responsiveness to  neuromuscular blockade because of tumor-induced spinal cord dysfunction, then train-of-four monitoring on the facial nerve may be a reasonable option. One should be careful to monitor evoked muscle twitches, not direct muscle stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INTERVERTEBRAL DISK DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Low back pain ranks second only to upper respiratory tract disease as the most common reason for o ffi ce visits to physicians. An estimated 70% of adults experience low back pain at some time in their lives. Among chronic conditions, low back pain is the most common cause of limitation of activity in patients younger than 45 years of age. Primary or metastatic cancer is the most common systemic disease a ff ecting vertebral bodies, but it accounts for fewer than 1% of all episodes of low back pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One of the most common causes of back pain is intervertebral disk disease. Th e intervertebral disk is composed of a compressible nucleus pulposus surrounded by a fi brocartilaginous annulus fi brosis. Th e disk acts as a shock absorber between vertebral bodies. Trauma or degenerative processes lead to changes in the intervertebral disk. Nerve root or spinal cord compression  results  when  the  nucleus  pulposus  protrudes  through the annulus fi brosis. With compression of a single nerve root, patients usually complain of pain in a single dermatomal distribution or localized muscle weakness. Spinal cord compression can lead to complex sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms

at and below the level of the insult. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging con fi rms the diagnosis and the location of intervertebral disk herniation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cervical Disk Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lateral protrusion of a cervical disk usually occurs at the C5-6 or C6-7 intervertebral spaces. Protrusion can be secondary to trauma or can occur spontaneously. Symptoms are commonly aggravated by coughing. Th e  same symptoms can be due to osteophytes  that  compress  nerve  roots  in  the  intervertebral foramina.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Initial treatment of cervical disk protrusion is typically conservative and includes rest, pain control, and possibly epidural administration of steroids. Surgical decompression is necessary if symptoms do not abate with conservative treatment or if there is signi fi cant motor involvement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  primary  initial  concern  in  the  perioperative  care  of patients  with  cervical  spine  disease  is  airway  management. Th e clinician should base the approach to airway management on the medical history, physical examination fi ndings, review of radiologic studies, and discussion with the surgeon. Direct laryngoscopy can be considered if the patient shows no signi fi -cant exacerbation of neurologic symptoms with neck movement (especially  neck  extension),  spinal  instability,  or  other airway abnormalities. Th e  use  of  a  videolaryngoscope  or  an assistant to manually maintain neck neutrality can be considered. If there is any signi fi cant concern that laryngoscopy may induce spinal cord compromise, awake fi beroptic intubation followed  by  a  brief  neurologic  examination  a ft er  successful tube placement should be considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  cervical  spine  procedures  performed  via  an  anterior approach, retraction of the airway structures to attain access to  the  cervical  spine  may  result  in  injury  to  the  ipsilateral recurrent  laryngeal  nerve.  Many  cases  of  nerve  injury  are asymptomatic, but injury may manifest as hoarseness, stridor, or, less frequently, frank airway compromise postoperatively. Injury may be due either to direct compression of or traction on  the  recurrent  laryngeal  nerve,  or  compression  of  nerve fi bers within the airway. Such compression of nerve fi bers may be caused either (1) by the endotracheal tube itself, since it is rigidly held in place by an in fl ated cu ff and also fi xed at the mouth; or (2) directly by the in fl ated cu ff .  Because of this it is common practice following airway retraction to let air out of the endotracheal tube cu ff and then rein fl ate the cu ff to the point at which no air leak is noted.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lumbar Disk Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  common  sites  for  lumbar  disk  protrusion  are  the L4-5 and L5-S1 intervertebral spaces. Disk protrusion at both sites produces low back pain, which radiates down the posterior and lateral aspect of the thighs and calves (sciatica). Th e exact  pattern  and  distribution  of  symptoms  depend  on  the spinal level and nerve roots a ff ected. A history of trauma, o ft en viewed as trivial by the patient, is commonly associated with the  sudden  onset  of  back  pain  and  signals  disk  protrusion. Back pain is aggravated by coughing or stretching of the sciatic nerve as, for example, by straight-leg raising. Th ese mechanical  signs  help  distinguish  disk  protrusion  from  peripheral nerve  disorders.  For  example,  diabetes  mellitus-associated peripheral neuropathy may share the symptoms, but not the signs, of a ruptured lumbar disk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of acute lumbar disk protrusion has historically included bed rest, analgesics, and centrally acting "muscle relaxants." Patients with acute low back pain who continue ordinary activities within the limits permitted by the pain have a more rapid recovery than those who stay on bed rest or perform backmobilizing exercises. When neurologic symptoms persist despite conservative  medical  management,  surgical  laminectomy  or microdiskectomy can be considered to decompress the a ff ected nerve roots. Epidural steroids (e.g., triamcinolone, methylprednisolone) are an alternative to surgery in select patients. Th ese drugs act by decreasing in fl ammation and edema around the nerve roots. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is a consideration in patients treated with oral steroids and may have implications  for  anesthetic  management.  Although epidural steroid injections may provide short-term alleviation of symptoms caused by sciatica, this treatment o ff ers no signi fi -cant functional bene fi t nor does it decrease the need for surgery.

CONGENITAL ANOMALIES AND DEGENERATIVE DISEASES OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spina bi fi da occulta is a common form of congenital vertebral column disease. Spondylosis and spondylolisthesis are forms of degenerative vertebral column diseases. It is not uncommon for multiple types of degenerative changes to occur concomitantly,  which  leads  to  more  rapid  progression  of  neurologic symptoms and the need for surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spina bi fi da occulta (incomplete formation of a single lamina in the lumbosacral spine without other abnormalities) is a congenital defect that is present in an estimated 20% of individuals. It usually produces no symptoms and is o ft en discovered as an incidental fi nding on radiographic examination during evaluation of some other unrelated disease process. Because there are no associated abnormalities, an increased risk with spinal anesthesia is not expected, and large numbers of these patients have undergone spinal anesthesia safely. Th ere is a variant of spina bi fi da occulta known as occult spinal dysraphism in which the bony defect may involve more than one lamina. A signi fi -cant  number  of  these  defects  are  associated  with  a  tethered spinal cord-that is, the spinal cord ends below the L2-3 interspace-and this may be responsible for progressive neurologic symptoms. Up to 50% of individuals with a tethered spinal cord have cutaneous manifestations overlying the anomaly, including tu ft s of hair, hyperpigmented areas, cutaneous lipomas, and skin dimples. Performance of spinal anesthesia in patients with a tethered spinal cord may increase the risk of cord injury.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spondylosis is  a  common  acquired  disorder  that  leads  to osteophyte formation and degenerative disk disease. Th e term spondylosis is used synonymously with spinal stenosis. Th ere is narrowing of the spinal canal and compression of the spinal cord by transverse osteophytes or nerve root compression by bony spurs in the intervertebral foramina. Spinal cord dysfunction can also re fl ect ischemia of the spinal cord caused by bony compression of the spinal arteries. Symptoms typically develop insidiously a ft er age 50. With cervical spondylosis, neck pain and radicular pain in the arms and shoulders are accompanied by sensory loss and skeletal muscle wasting. Later, sensory and motor signs may appear in the legs producing an unsteady gait. Lumbar spondylosis usually leads to radicular pain and muscle wasting  in  the  lower  extremities.  Sphincter  disturbances  are uncommon regardless of the location of spondylosis. Radiographs of the spine o ft en demonstrate osteoarthritic changes, but these changes correlate poorly with neurologic symptoms. Surgery may be necessary to arrest progression of the symptoms, especially if there is evidence of motor loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spondylolisthesis refers to anterior subluxation of one vertebral  body  on  another. Th is  most  commonly  occurs  at  the lumbosacral junction. Radicular symptoms usually involve the nerve root inferior to the pedicle of the anteriorly subluxed vertebra.  Treatment  includes  analgesics,  antiin fl ammatory medications, and physical therapy if low back pain is the only symptom. Surgery is reserved for patients who have myelopathy, radiculopathy, or neurogenic claudication.

Syringomyelia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Syringomyelia, also known as syrinx, is a disorder in which there is  cystic  cavitation  of  the  spinal  cord. Th e  condition  is  o ft en congenital, but it can also occur following spinal cord trauma or  in  association  with  various  neoplastic  conditions  such  as gliomas. Rostral extension into the brainstem is called syringobulbia. Two main forms of syringomyelia occur depending on whether there is communication of the cystic regions with the  subarachnoid  space  or  central  canal.  In  communicating syringomyelia, either there is only dilation of the central canal of the cord, known as hydromyelia, or there is communication between the abnormal cystic lesions in the spinal cord proper and the cerebrospinal fl uid spaces. Communicating syringomyelia is usually associated with either a history of basilar arachnoiditis or Chiari's malformation. In contrast, the presence of cysts that have no connection to the cerebrospinal fl uid spaces is called noncommunicating syringomyelia and is o ft en associated with a history of trauma, neoplasms, or arachnoiditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs  and  symptoms  of  congenital  syringomyelia  usually begin  during  the  third  or  fourth  decade  of  life.  Early  complaints  are  those  of  sensory  impairment  involving  pain  and temperature sensation in the upper extremities. Th is  re fl ects destruction of pain and temperature neuronal pathways that cross within the spinal cord near the central canal. As cavitation of the spinal cord progresses, destruction of lower motor neurons ensues, with the development of skeletal muscle weakness and wasting and loss of re fl exes. Th oracic scoliosis may result from weakness of paravertebral muscles. Syringobulbia is  characterized by paralysis of the palate, tongue, and vocal cords, and loss of sensation over the face. Magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred procedure to diagnose syringomyelia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is no known treatment that is e ff ective in arresting the  progressive  degeneration  of  the  spinal  cord  or  medulla. Surgical procedures designed to restore normal cerebrospinal fl uid fl ow have not been predictably e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with syringomyelia or syringobulbia should consider the neurologic de fi cits associated with this disease. Th oracic scoliosis can contribute to ventilation/perfusion mismatching. Lower motor neuron disease with skeletal muscle wasting suggests the possibility that hyperkalemia can develop a ft er administration of succinylcholine. Exaggerated responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants  can  be  observed. Th ermal regulation may be impaired. Th e selection of drugs for induction and maintenance of anesthesia is not in fl uenced by this disease. With syringobulbia, any decrease in or absence of protective airway re fl exes may in fl uence the timing of endotracheal tube removal postoperatively.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disease involving  (1)  the  lower  motor  neurons  in  the  anterior  horn gray matter of the spinal cord, and (2) the corticospinal tracts, that is, the primary descending upper motor neurons. Th erefore, this disease process produces both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. It most commonly a ff ects men 40 to 60 years of age. When the degenerative process is limited to the motor cortex of the brain, the disease is called primary lateral sclerosis; limitation to the brainstem nuclei is known as pseudobulbar  palsy. Werdnig-Ho ff mann  disease  resembles  ALS except that it occurs during the fi rst 3 years of life. Although the cause of ALS is unknown, occasionally a genetic pattern is present. A viral etiology is also under consideration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and symptoms of ALS re fl ect upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction. Electromyographically, dysfunction sometimes resembles that of myasthenia gravis. Frequent initial manifestations include skeletal muscle atrophy, weakness, and fasciculations, o ft en beginning in the intrinsic muscles of the hands. With time, atrophy and weakness involve most of the skeletal muscles, including the tongue, pharynx, larynx, and  chest.  Early  symptoms  of  bulbar  involvement  include fasciculations  of  the  tongue  plus  dysphagia,  which  leads  to pulmonary aspiration. Th e ocular muscles are spared. Autonomic  nervous  system  dysfunction  can  be  manifested  as orthostatic hypotension and resting tachycardia. An inability to control emotional responses is characteristic. Complaints of cramping and aching sensations, particularly in the legs, are common. Plasma creatine kinase concentrations are normal, which distinguishes this disease from chronic polymyositis.

Carcinoma of the lung has been associated with ALS. ALS has no known treatment, and death is likely within 6 years a ft er the onset of clinical symptoms, usually resulting from respiratory failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia in patients with ALS may be associated with exaggerated respiratory depression. ALS patients are also vulnerable to hyperkalemia following administration of succinylcholine  as  a  result  of  lower  motor  neuron  disease,  and these patients may show prolonged responses to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Bulbar involvement with dysfunction of pharyngeal muscles may predispose to pulmonary aspiration. Th ere  is  no  evidence  that  any  speci fi c  anesthetic  drug or  combination of drugs is ideal  in  these  patients.  Regional anesthesia is usually avoided because of fear of exacerbating disease symptoms, but epidural anesthesia has been used successfully  in  patients  with  ALS  without  neurologic  exacerbation or impairment of pulmonary function.

Friedreich's Ataxia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by degeneration of the spinocerebellar and pyramidal tracts.  Cardiomyopathy is present in 10% to 50% of patients with  this  disease.  Kyphoscoliosis,  producing  a  progressive deterioration in pulmonary function, is seen in nearly 80% of a ff ected individuals. Ataxia is the typical presenting symptom. Dysarthria, nystagmus, skeletal muscle weakness and spasticity, and diabetes mellitus may be present. Friedreich's ataxia is usually fatal by early adulthood, most o ft en because of heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  Friedreich's ataxia is similar to that described for patients with ALS. If cardiomyopathy is present, the negative inotropic e ff ects of anesthetic drugs must be considered when selecting a technique. Although experience is limited, the response to muscle relaxants seems normal. Kyphoscoliosis may make epidural anesthesia  technically  di ffi cult.  Spinal  anesthesia  has  been  used successfully. Th e likelihood of postoperative ventilatory failure may be increased, especially in the presence of kyphoscoliosis.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  extent  of  physiologic  e ff ects  from  spinal  cord  injury depends on the level of injury, with the most severe physiologic derangements occurring with injury to the   cervical cord. Hypotension is a result of (1) loss of sympathetic nervous  system  activity  and  a  decrease  in  systemic  vascular resistance  and  (2)  bradycardia  resulting  from  loss  of  the T1-T4 sympathetic innervation to the heart. Th ese hemodynamic changes are collectively known as spinal shock and typically last 1 to 3 weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Major goals in caring for patients who have spinal cord disease  or  are  undergoing  surgical  procedures  involving  the spinal  cord  or  vertebral  column  are  maintenance  of  adequate oxygen delivery, optimization of operative conditions, and facilitation of a rapid, smooth emergence from anesthesia to allow immediate assessment of neurologic function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Succinylcholine  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients with  spinal  cord  injury  because  of  the  potential  risk  of hyperkalemia in the setting of diseases that cause an upregulation  of  acetylcholine  receptors  at  the  neuromuscular junction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In acute spinal cord injury, care must be taken during airway manipulation to avoid excessive neck movement. Succinylcholine can be used without signi fi cant risk of hyperkalemia in the fi rst few hours following spinal cord injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Sequelae  of  chronic  spinal  cord  injury  include  impaired alveolar ventilation, cardiovascular instability manifested  as  autonomic  hyperre fl exia,  chronic  pulmonary and  genitourinary  tract  infections,  anemia,  and  altered thermoregulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Patients with cervical and thoracic spinal cord injuries are at risk of developing autonomic hyperre fl exia in response to various stimuli, including surgery, bowel distention, and bladder  distention.  Autonomic  hyperre fl exia  can  be  prevented  by  either  general  or  spinal  anesthesia,  since  both methods are e ff ective in blocking the a ff erent limb of the pathway.  Use  of  topical  anesthesia  for  cystoscopic  procedures  does  not  prevent  autonomic  hyperre fl exia,  and epidural  anesthesia  is  not  reliably  e ff ective  in  preventing autonomic hyperre fl exia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Spinal cord tumors can be divided into two broad categories. Intramedullary tumors  are  located  within  the  spinal cord and account for approximately 10% of tumors a ff ecting the spinal column. Gliomas and ependymomas account for  the  vast  majority  of  intramedullary  tumors. Extramedullary tumors  can  be  either  intradural  or  extradural. Neuro fi bromas and meningiomas account for most of the intradural  tumors.  Metastatic  lesions,  usually  from  lung, breast, or prostate cancer or myeloma, are the most common causes of extradural lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Low back pain ranks second only to upper respiratory tract disease as the most common reason for o ffi ce visits to physicians.  An  estimated  70%  of  adults  experience  low  back pain at some time in their lives.
