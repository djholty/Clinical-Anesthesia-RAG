STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e principal function of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is to provide the body with a supply of water, nutrients, and electrolytes. Each division of the GI tract-esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines-is adapted for speci fi c  functions, such  as  passage,  storage,  digestion,  and  absorption  of  food. Impairment of any part of the GI tract may have signi fi cant e ff ects on a patient coming for surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ESOPHAGEAL DISEASES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysphagia is the classic symptom of all disorders of the esophagus. To evaluate dysphagia, a barium contrast study is recommended, followed by esophagoscopy, which permits direct viewing of esophageal abnormalities as well as collection  of biopsy and cytology specimens.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diffuse Esophageal Spasm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Di ff use esophageal spasm typically occurs in elderly patients and is  most  likely  due  to  autonomic  nervous  system dysfunction. Pain produced by esophageal spasm may mimic angina pectoris and frequently responds favorably to treatment with nitroglycerin, which further confuses the clinical picture. Nifedipine and isosorbide,  which  decrease  lower  esophageal  sphincter  (LES) pressure, may also relieve pain produced by esophageal spasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Achalasia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Achalasia  is  classi fi ed  as  a  neuromuscular  disorder  of  the esophagus.  It  is  de fi ned  as  dysfunction  of  both  the  esophageal muscles and the LES. Th e incidence of achalasia is 6 per 100,000 persons per year. Th e current theory of the etiology of achalasia is that the primary pathologic process is destruction of the nerves to the LES followed by degeneration of the function of the esophageal body. Th e result is hypertension of the LES, failure of the LES to relax when swallowing, reduced peristalsis, and esophageal dilation. Symptoms consist of the triad of dysphagia, weight loss, and regurgitation. Long-term disease is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer. Aspiration is common with resultant pneumonia, lung abscess, and/ or bronchiectasis. Th e diagnosis can be made by esophagram, which  reveals  the  classic  "bird's  beak"  appearance.  However, manometry is the de fi nitive test for the diagnosis of achalasia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  treatments  for  achalasia  are  palliative,  because  they  can relieve the obstruction caused by the LES but cannot correct the decreased motility of the esophagus. Medications, including nitrates, nitroglycerin, and calcium channel blockers, can be  used  to  attempt  to  relax  the  LES.  Endoscopic  interventions include dilations and/or injections of botulinum toxin. Surgical  esophagomyotomy  o ff ers  better  results  than  endoscopic  dilation.  Surgery  now  is  typically  a  modi fi ed  laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Esophagectomy can be considered in very advanced disease and would eliminate the risk of cancer as  well  as  mitigate  symptoms.  Patients  with  achalasia  are  at increased risk of perioperative aspiration and must be treated using full-stomach precautions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophagectomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophagectomy can be a curative or palliative option for malignant esophageal lesions (10% to 50% cure rate). It may also be  considered  when  benign  conditions,  such  as  obstructive lesions, are not responsive to conservative management. Th ere are  several  surgical  approaches  to  esophagectomy, including transthoracic,  transhiatal,  and  minimally  invasive  (laparoscopic, thoracoscopic, or robotically assisted) techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e morbidity and mortality of esophagectomy is quite high, with  rates  of  10%  to  15%  reported.  Most  major  postoperative  complications  are  respiratory  complications,  and  these contribute to poor outcomes. Acute lung injury and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may occur up to 10% to 20% of esophagectomies. Th e mortality approaches 50% if ARDS occurs. Th e  cause  of  ARDS  in  the  setting  of  esophagectomy is not completely understood, but it is thought that in fl ammatory mediators and gut-related endotoxins may be triggers.  Other  contributing  factors  may  include  the  use  of prolonged one-lung ventilation resulting in ischemia-reperfusion injury of the lung. A history of smoking, low body mass index, long duration of surgery, cardiopulmonary instability, and the occurrence of a postoperative anastomotic leak may also increase the risk of ARDS. Other common postoperative complications  include  anastomotic  leaks  (11%  to  21%  incidence), dumping syndrome, and esophageal stricture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHETIC IMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may be malnourished (protein-calorie malnutrition) before esophagectomy and for many months a ft erward. However, over the past decade regular surveillance of patients with Barrett's  esophagus  has  lead  to  the  diagnosis  of  esophageal cancer in very early stages. Such patients typically arrive for surgery  in  good  nutritional  balance.  Some  patients  coming for esophagectomy have had chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before the procedure, so pancytopenia, dehydration, and lung injury can be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  early  postoperative  period  patients  may  need  to return to the operating room, and they may have any of the conditions noted earlier, including acute lung injury. Patients with anastomotic leak may have sepsis and/or shock. Th ere is a very signi fi cant risk of aspiration in all patients who have had an esophagectomy. Th is risk persists for life.

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Currently, gastroesophageal re fl ux disease (GERD) is described as  re fl ux  of  gastric  contents  into  the  esophagus  associated with  symptoms.  Natural  antire fl ux  mechanisms  consist  of  the LES,  the  crural  diaphragm,  and  the  anatomic  location  of  the

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 14 DISEASES OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
289

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TABLE 14-1 ■ Effect of drugs on lower esophageal sphincter tone

<!-- PAGE=? -->
gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragmatic hiatus. Th e LES opens with swallowing and closes a ft erward to prevent gastric acid in the stomach from re fl uxing into the esophagus. At rest, the LES typically exerts a pressure high enough to prevent re fl ux. With inappropriate relaxation or weakness of the LES, gastric acid reenters the esophagus, causing irritation (Table 14-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e primary defect causing GERD seems to be a decrease in the resting tone of the LES (average of 13 mm Hg in patients with GERD vs. 29 mm Hg in patients without GERD). Chronic peptic  esophagitis  is  caused  by  re fl ux  of  acidic  gastric fl uid into the esophagus, producing retrosternal discomfort ("heartburn"). Re fl ux into the pharynx, larynx, and tracheobronchial tree can result in chronic cough, bronchoconstriction, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia. Morning hoarseness may also be noted. Recurrent pulmonary aspiration can also result in aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary fi brosis, or asthma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INCIDENCE OF ASPIRATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Re fl ux esophagitis is a common clinical problem. More than one third of healthy adults experience symptoms of heartburn at  least  once  a  month.  In  terms  of  anesthetic  management, GERD represents an aspiration risk.  Factors  that  contribute to  the  likelihood  of  intraoperative  aspiration  include  urgent or emergent surgery, a di ffi cult airway, inadequate anesthetic depth, use of the lithotomy position, autonomic neuropathy, insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,  pregnancy,  increased intraabdominal pressure, depressed consciousness, severe illness, and obesity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
By extrapolation from early studies in rhesus monkeys subjected to direct instillation of gastric contents into the lungs, it is believed that patients are at risk of aspiration pneumonitis if there is at least 0.4 mL/kg of gastric volume and the pH of the gastric contents is less than 2.5.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition to being at increased risk of aspiration, patients with GERD  may  develop  other  complications  that can a ff ect  anesthetic  management. Th ese  include  (1) mucosal complications, such as esophagitis or esophageal stricture (the stricture causes esophageal dilation and compounds the risk for aspiration); and (2) extraesophageal or respiratory complications, such  as  laryngitis,  bronchitis,  bronchospasm,  recurrent  pneumonia,  and  progressive  pulmonary fi brosis.  Up  to 50% of patients with asthma have either endoscopic evidence of  esophagitis  or  an  increased  esophageal  acid  exposure  on 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  decision  to  include  anticholinergic  drugs  in  preoperative medication must be balanced against the known ability of these drugs to decrease LES tone. Th eoretically, anticholinergic drugs, by decreasing LES pressure, can increase the likelihood of silent regurgitation and the possibility of pulmonary aspiration. However, occurrence of this potential adverse e ff ect has not been documented. Succinylcholine increases LES pressure and intragastric pressure, but the barrier pressure (LES pressure minus intragastric pressure) is unchanged.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Depending on the planned surgery and anesthetic, medications to treat GERD may be given preoperatively. Cimetidine and  ranitidine  decrease  gastric  acid  secretion  and  increase gastric  pH.  Cimetidine's  e ff ect  begins  in  1  to  1.5  hours  and lasts for 3 hours. Ranitidine is four to six times more potent than  cimetidine  and  has  fewer  side  e ff ects.  Famotidine  and nizatidine can also be given intravenously and are similar in e ff ect to ranitidine but have a longer duration of action. Proton pump inhibitors are generally given orally the night before surgery and again on the morning of surgery. Very recent evidence indicates that proton pump inhibitors inhibit the antiplatelet e ff ects of clopidogrel and possibly aspirin. Th is may be of particular concern in patients with coronary or other vascular stents. Th ere may be an increased risk of stent thrombosis or occlusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sodium  citrate  is  an  oral  nonparticulate  antacid  that increases gastric pH. It should be given with a gastrokinetic agent such as metoclopramide, and its use should be restricted to those who are diabetic, severely clinically obese, or pregnant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cricoid  pressure  compresses  the  lumen  of  the  pharynx between the cricoid cartilage and the cervical vertebrae. It is usually applied by an assistant under the direction of the anesthesia provider and maintained until successful endotracheal intubation is veri fi ed. Th e force applied should be su ffi cient to prevent aspiration but not so great as to cause airway obstruction or esophageal rupture in the event of vomiting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endotracheal intubation is essential for protecting the airway from aspiration in anesthetized patients with GERD. Th e endotracheal  tube  is  superior  to  all  other  airway  devices  in reducing aspiration risk.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hiatal Hernia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A hiatal  hernia is  a  herniation  of  part  of  the  stomach  into the thoracic cavity through the esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm.  A sliding  hiatal  hernia is  one  in  which  the  gastroesophageal junction and fundus of the stomach slide upward.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
290

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th is  type of hernia is seen in approximately 30% of patients undergoing upper GI tract radiographic examination. Many of these patients are asymptomatic, that is, have no clinical symptoms of re fl ux. Th is hernia may result from weakening of the anchors  of  the  gastroesophageal  junction  to  the  diaphragm, from  longitudinal  contraction  of  the  esophagus,  or  from increased intraabdominal pressure. A paraesophageal hernia is one in which the esophagogastric junction remains in its normal location and a pouch of stomach is herniated next to the gastroesophageal junction through the esophageal hiatus. Hiatal hernias are only infrequently repaired. Most patients with hiatal  hernias  do  not  have  symptoms  of  re fl ux  esophagitis, which emphasizes the importance of the integrity of the LES.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Esophageal Diverticula

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diverticula are outpouchings of the wall of the esophagus. Th e most common sites are pharyngoesophageal (Zenker's diverticulum),  (midesophageal),  and  epiphrenic  (supradiaphragmatic diverticulum).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Zenker's  diverticulum appears  in  a  natural  zone  of  weakness in the posterior hypopharyngeal wall (Killian's triangle) and can cause signi fi cant bad breath from food particles consumed up to several  days  previously. Th is  food  can  also  be regurgitated. If such a diverticulum becomes large and fi lled with food, it can compress the esophagus and cause dysphagia or aspiration pneumonia. Nasogastric tube and echocardiography probe insertion should be performed with utmost care in these patients to prevent perforation of the diverticulum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A midesophageal diverticulum may be caused by traction from old adhesions or in fl amed lymph nodes or by propulsion associated  with  esophageal  motility  abnormalities.  An  epiphrenic diverticulum may be associated with achalasia. Small or medium-sized Zenker's diverticula and midesophageal and epiphrenic diverticula are usually asymptomatic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptomatic Zenker's diverticulum is treated by cricopharyngeal myotomy with or without diverticulectomy. Large symptomatic esophageal diverticula are removed surgically.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mucosal Tear (Mallory-Weiss Syndrome)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A mucosal tear is usually caused by vomiting, retching, or vigorous coughing. Th e tear typically involves the gastric mucosa near  the  squamocolumnar  mucosal  junction.  Patients  have upper  GI  tract  bleeding.  In  most  patients,  bleeding  ceases spontaneously, but continued bleeding may require vasopressin therapy or angiographic embolization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Burning epigastric pain exacerbated by fasting and improved with meal consumption is the symptom complex associated with peptic  ulcer  disease. Th e  lifetime  prevalence  of  peptic ulcer  disease  in  the  United  States  is  approximately  12%  in men and 10% in women. Interestingly, an estimated 15,000 deaths per year occur as a consequence of complicated peptic ulcer disease. Bleeding, peritonitis, dehydration, perforation, and sepsis, especially in elderly debilitated and malnourished patients, are risk factors for death caused by peptic ulcer disease. Such patients pose signi fi cant anesthetic challenges.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Protective Function of the Gastric Lining

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mucus-bicarbonate layer serves as a physicochemical barrier to multiple chemicals, including hydrogen ions. Gastroduodenal surface epithelial cells secrete mucus. Th e mucous gel impedes di ff usion of ions and molecules such as pepsin. Bicarbonate, secreted by surface epithelial cells of the gastroduodenal mucosa into the mucous gel, forms a pH gradient ranging from 1 to 2 at the gastric luminal surface and reaching 6 to 7 along the epithelial cell surface. Bicarbonate secretion is stimulated by calcium, prostaglandins, cholinergic input, and luminal acidi fi cation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prostaglandins play  a  central  role  in  gastric  epithelial  cell defenses and repair. Th ese metabolites of arachidonic acid are formed by cyclooxygenase. Cyclooxygenase-1 present in the stomach, platelets, kidneys, and endothelial cells regulates the release of mucosal bicarbonate and mucus and inhibits parietal cell secretion. Th ese functions are important in maintaining mucosal blood fl ow and epithelial cell structure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surface epithelial cells provide the next line of defense by several  mechanisms,  including  mucus  production,  epithelial cell ionic transporters that maintain intracellular pH and bicarbonate  production,  and  intracellular  tight  junctions.  If the  preepithelial  barrier  is  breached,  gastric  epithelial  cells bordering the site of injury can migrate to the area and restore the damaged region.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Causes of Injury

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen are the two principal gastric  secretory  products  capable  of  inducing  mucosal  injury. Acid secretion occurs under basal and stimulated conditions. Basal acid production occurs in a circadian pattern, with the highest levels occurring during the night and the lowest levels during the morning hours. Cholinergic input via the vagus nerve and histaminergic input from local gastric sources are the principal contributors to basal acid secretion. Stimulated gastric acid secretion occurs primarily in three phases based on the site at which the signal originates (cephalic, gastric, or intestinal). Th e sight, smell, and taste of food are the components  of  the  cephalic  phase  of  gastric  acid  secretion,  which stimulates  gastric  secretion  via  the  vagus  nerve. Th e  gastric phase is activated once food enters the stomach. Distention of the stomach wall also leads to gastrin release and acid production. Th e last phase of gastric acid secretion is initiated as food enters  the  intestine  and  is  mediated  by  luminal  distention. Th is fact explains why blocking one receptor type (histamine 2,  or  H 2 )  decreases  acid  secretion  stimulated  by  agents  that activate di ff erent parts of the pathway (gastrin, acetylcholine).

HELICOBACTER PYLORI

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many  lines  of  evidence  have  established  that Helicobacter pylori is a factor in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration. H. pylori infection is virtually always associated with chronic active gastritis, but only 10% to 15% of infected individuals develop actual peptic ulceration. Ironically, the earliest stages of H. pylori infection are accompanied by a marked decrease in gastric acid secretion. Th en it induces increased acid secretion  through both direct and indirect actions of the organism  and  proin fl ammatory  cytokines  (interleukin-1  [IL-1] and  IL-8  and  tumor  necrosis  factor)  on  G,  D,  and  parietal cells. H. pylori also decreases duodenal mucosal bicarbonate production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
BLEEDING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemorrhage is the leading cause of death associated with peptic  ulcer  disease,  and  the  incidence  of  this  complication  has not changed since the introduction of H 2 -receptor antagonists. Th e  lifetime  risk  of  hemorrhage  in  patients  with  duodenal ulcer who have not had surgery and do not receive continuing maintenance drug therapy is approximately 35%. Th e current risk of mortality from bleeding is 10% to 20%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERFORATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  lifetime  risk  of  perforation  in  patients  with  duodenal ulceration who do not receive therapy is approximately 10%. Perforation  is  usually  accompanied  by  sudden  and  severe epigastric pain caused by the spillage of highly acidic gastric secretions  into  the  peritoneum. Th e  mortality  of  emergent ulcer operations is correlated with the presence of preoperative shock, signi fi cant co-existing medical illnesses, and perforation longer than 48 hours before surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
OBSTRUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastric  outlet  obstruction  can  occur  acutely  or  chronically. Hence, patients with gastric outlet obstruction should be considered to have a full stomach when they come for surgery. Acute obstruction is caused by edema and in fl ammation in the pyloric channel and the fi rst portion of the duodenum. Pyloric obstruction is suggested by recurrent vomiting, dehydration, and  hypochloremic  alkalosis  resulting  from  loss  of  acidic gastric secretions. Treatment consists of nasogastric suction, rehydration, and intravenous administration of antisecretory drugs.  In  most  instances,  acute  obstruction  resolves  within 72 hours with these supportive measures. However, repeated episodes  of  ulceration  and  healing  can  lead  to  pyloric  scarring and a subsequent fi xed stenosis and chronic gastric outlet obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastric Ulcer

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Benign gastric ulcers are a form of peptic ulcer disease occurring with one third the frequency of benign duodenal ulcers (Table 14-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stress Gastritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Major trauma accompanied by shock, sepsis, respiratory failure, hemorrhage, massive transfusion, or multiorgan injury is o ft en associated with the development of acute  stress  gastritis. Acute stress gastritis is particularly prevalent a ft er thermal injury  involving  more  than  35%  of  body  surface  area,  central nervous system injury, or intracranial hypertension. Th e major complication of stress gastritis  is  gastric  hemorrhage. Th e  incidence  of  gastric  bleeding  is  signi fi cantly  associated with coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, an international normalized ratio of more than 1.5, and a partial thromboplastin time of more than twice the normal value.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANTACIDS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antacids are rarely, if ever, used by clinicians as the primary therapeutic  agents  for  gastritis.  However,  patients  o ft en  use them  for  symptomatic  relief  of  dyspepsia. Th e  most  commonly  used  antacids  are  mixtures  of  aluminum  hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. Many of the frequently used antacids (e.g., Maalox, Mylanta) contain a combination of both aluminum and magnesium hydroxide to avoid the side e ff ects of constipation or diarrhea. Neither magnesium- nor aluminum-containing preparations should be used in patients with chronic renal failure. Th e former can cause hypermagnesemia and the latter can cause neurotoxicity. Other potent antacids include  calcium  carbonate  (Tums)  and  sodium  bicarbonate. Long-term use of calcium carbonate can lead to milk-alkali syndrome (hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia) with possible  development  of  renal  stones  and  progression  to  renal insu ffi ciency.  Sodium  bicarbonate  use  may  induce  systemic alkalosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
H2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Four H2 -receptor antagonists-cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine-are currently available, and their structures  share  homology  with  histamine.  All  will  signi fi cantly inhibit basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Th is class

<!-- PAGE=? -->
292

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of drugs is e ff ective for the treatment of active ulcer disease (4 to 6 weeks of treatment) and as an adjuvant (with antibiotics) for the management of H. pylori infection. Cimetidine was the fi rst H 2 -receptor antagonist used for the treatment of acid peptic disorders, with healing rates approaching 80% at 1 month. Ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine are more potent H2-receptor  antagonists  than  cimetidine.  Cimetidine  and ranitidine, but not famotidine and nizatidine, bind to hepatic cytochrome P-450. Th erefore, careful monitoring of treatment with drugs such as warfarin, phenytoin, and theophylline that use cytochrome P-450 for metabolism is indicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Omeprazole,  esomeprazole,  lansoprazole,  rabeprazole,  and pantoprazole  are  substituted  benzimidazole  derivatives  that covalently bind and irreversibly inhibit hydrogen-potassiumadenosine  triphosphatase  (H + ,K + -ATPase). Th ese are the most  potent  acid-inhibitory  drugs  available.  Proton  pump inhibitors  inhibit  all  phases  of  gastric  acid  secretion.  Onset of action is rapid, with a maximum e ff ect achieved between 2 and 6 hours and a duration of gastric acid inhibition lasting up to 72 hours. As with any agent that leads to signi fi cant hypochlorhydria, proton pump inhibitors may interfere with absorption  of  drugs  such  as  ketoconazole,  ampicillin,  iron, and digoxin. Hepatic cytochrome P-450 may also be inhibited by some proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole). Patients  receiving  clopidogrel  as  maintenance  therapy  a ft er placement of coronary or other vascular stents should avoid proton pump inhibitors because of the decreased antiplatelet e ff ect of clopidogrel when used in conjunction with a proton pump inhibitor.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PROSTAGLANDIN ANALOGUES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  of  their  central  role  in  maintaining  mucosal  integrity  and  repair,  prostaglandin  analogues  were  developed  for the  treatment  of  peptic  ulcer  disease.  At  present,  the  prostaglandin  E 1 derivative  misoprostol  is  the  only  drug  in  this class  approved  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration for clinical use in the prevention of gastroduodenal mucosal injury induced by nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs. Prostaglandin analogues enhance mucosal bicarbonate secretion, stimulate mucosal blood fl ow, and decrease mucosal cell turnover. Th e most common side e ff ect is diarrhea. Other toxicities include uterine contractions and uterine bleeding. Th erefore, misoprostol is contraindicated in women who may be pregnant, and women of child-bearing age must be made aware of this potential drug e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CYTOPROTECTIVE AGENTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sucralfate  is  a  complex  sucrose  salt  in  which  the  hydroxyl groups  have  been  substituted  by  aluminum  hydroxide  and sulfate. It can act by several mechanisms. In the gastric environment, aluminum hydroxide dissociates, leaving the polar sulfate anion, which can then bind to positively charged tissue proteins found within the ulcer bed. Th is process provides a  physicochemical barrier impeding further tissue injury by acid and pepsin. Sucralfate may also induce a trophic e ff ect by binding growth factors such as endothelial growth factor, enhance prostaglandin synthesis, stimulate mucus and bicarbonate  secretion,  and  enhance  mucosal  defense  and  repair. Toxicity from sucralfate is rare, and constipation is the most common side e ff ect. Sucralfate should be avoided in patients with chronic renal insu ffi ciency to prevent aluminum-induced neurotoxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colloidal  bismuth  subcitrate  and  bismuth  subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) are the most widely used bismuth-containing antacids or antiulcer drugs. Th e  mechanism by which these agents induce ulcer healing is unclear. Potential mechanisms include ulcer coating, prevention of further pepsin and hydrochloric acid-induced damage, binding of pepsin, and stimulation  of  prostaglandins,  bicarbonate,  and  mucus  secretion. Long-term use of high dosages, especially of colloidal bismuth subcitrate, may lead to neurotoxicity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MISCELLANEOUS DRUGS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticholinergic  drugs,  designed  to  inhibit  activation  of  the muscarinic receptor in parietal cells, have limited success in ulcer healing because of their relatively weak acid-inhibiting e ff ect and signi fi cant side e ff ects (dry eyes, dry mouth, urinary retention).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT OF HELICOBACTER PYLORI INFECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e National Institutes of Health, American Digestive Health Foundation, and European Maastricht and Asia Paci fi c consensus conferences recommend that H. pylori be eradicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease. Eradication of this organism is associated with a dramatic decrease in ulcer recurrence. No single agent is e ff ective in eradicating this organism. Combination therapy for 14 days provides the greatest e ffi cacy. Th e antibiotics  used  with  the  greatest  frequency  are  amoxicillin, metronidazole, tetracycline, clarithromycin, and bismuth compounds.  Treatment  protocols  combine  a  proton  pump inhibitor with two antibiotics, clarithromycin and either metronidazole or amoxicillin. Th e most feared complication with amoxicillin is pseudomembranous colitis, but this occurs in fewer than 1% to 2% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SURGICAL TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Operative intervention is reserved for the treatment of complicated ulcer disease. Th e  most  common  complications requiring surgery are hemorrhage, perforation, and obstruction as well as failure of a recurrent ulcer to respond to medical therapy and/or the inability to exclude malignant disease. Th e fi rst goal of any surgical treatment should be removal of the ulcer diathesis so that ulcer healing is achieved and recurrence is minimized. Th e second goal is treatment of co-existing anatomic complications, such as pyloric stenosis or perforation. Th e third major goal should be preventing undesirable longterm side e ff ects from the surgery.

ulcer disease. Surgical treatment now, however, is o ft en directed exclusively at correcting the immediate problem (e.g., closure of a duodenal perforation) without gastric denervation. Division of  both  vagal  trunks  at  the  esophageal  hiatus  (truncal  vagotomy) denervates the acid-producing fundic mucosa as well as the remainder of the vagally supplied viscera. Because denervation results in impairment of gastric emptying, truncal vagotomy must be combined with a procedure to eliminate pyloric sphincter  function,  usually  a  pyloroplasty.  Truncal  vagotomy can  also  be  combined  with  resection  of  the  gastric  antrum, which results in even further reduction in acid secretion, presumably by removing the antral source of gastrin. Restoration of GI continuity is achieved by gastroduodenostomy. Proximal gastric vagotomy (or parietal cell vagotomy) di ff ers from truncal vagotomy in that only the nerve fi bers to the acid-secreting fundic mucosa are divided. Vagotomy also diminishes parietal cell responsiveness to gastrin and histamine. Basal acid secretion is reduced by approximately 80% in the period immediately a ft er surgery.

ZOLLINGER-ELLISON SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In 1955 Zollinger and Ellison described two patients with gastroduodenal  and  intestinal  ulceration  together  with  gastrin hypersecretion and a non-beta islet cell tumor of the pancreas (gastrinoma). Th e incidence of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome varies from 0.1% to 1% of individuals with peptic ulcer disease. Men are a ff ected more o ft en than women, and in the majority of cases the disorder is identi fi ed when the patient is between the ages of 30 and 50.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gastrin  stimulates  acid  secretion  through  gastrin  receptors on parietal cells and through induction of histamine release. It also exerts a trophic e ff ect on gastric epithelial cells. Longstanding hypergastrinemia leads to markedly increased gastric acid secretion by both parietal cell stimulation and increased parietal cell mass. Th is increased gastric acid output leads to peptic ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis, and diarrhea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abdominal pain and peptic ulceration are seen in up to 90% of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; diarrhea is seen in 50%, with 10% having diarrhea as their only symptom. Gastroesophageal re fl ux is  seen  in  about  half  of  patients.  Initial presentation and ulcer location in the duodenal bulb may be indistinguishable from those in ordinary peptic ulcer disease. Ulcers  in  unusual  locations  (second  part  of  the  duodenum and beyond), ulcers refractory  to  standard  medical  therapy, and ulcer recurrence a ft er acid-reducing surgery or ulcers presenting  with  complications  (bleeding,  obstruction,  and  perforation) create suspicion of a gastrinoma. Gastrinomas can develop in the presence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I) syndrome, a disorder involving primarily three organ

<!-- PAGE=? -->
sites: the parathyroid glands (80% to 90%), pancreas (40% to 80%), and pituitary gland (30% to 60%). In view of the stimulatory e ff ect of calcium on gastric secretion, the hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia seen in MEN I patients may have a direct e ff ect on ulcer disease. Resolution of hypercalcemia by parathyroidectomy reduces gastrin and gastric acid output in gastrinoma patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e fi rst  step  in  the  evaluation  of  a  patient  with  suspected Zollinger-Ellison  syndrome  is  obtaining  a  fasting  gastrin level (Table 14-3). Gastric acid induces feedback inhibition of gastrin  release.  Such  feedback  is  absent  in  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Up to 50% of patients with gastrinomas have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  duodenal  ulcers  as  part  of  Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are treated initially with proton pump inhibitors at doses higher than those used to treat GERD and peptic ulcer disease, and then these drugs are continued at dosages guided by gastric acid measurements. Curative surgical resection of a gastrinoma is indicated in the absence of evidence of MEN I syndrome and metastatic disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  for  gastrinoma  excision  must consider  the  presence  of  gastric  hypersecretion  as  well  as the  likely  presence  of  large  gastric fl uid  volumes.  Esophageal re fl ux is common in these patients despite the ability of gastrin to increase LES tone. Depletion of intravascular fl uid volume and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis) may accompany profuse watery diarrhea. Th e associated endocrine abnormalities (MEN I syndrome) can also in fl uence the management of anesthesia. Antacid prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors and H 2 -receptor antagonists is maintained up to the time of surgery. A preoperative coagulation screen and liver function tests may be recommended, since alterations in fat absorption can in fl uence production of  clotting  factors.  Intravenous  administration  of  ranitidine is  useful  for  preventing  gastric  acid  hypersecretion  during surgery.

POSTGASTRECTOMY SYNDROMES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of syndromes have been described following gastric operations performed for peptic ulcer disease or gastric neoplasm. Th e overall occurrence of severe postoperative symptoms is low, perhaps 1% to 3% of cases, but the disturbances can be rather disabling. Th e two most common postgastrectomy syndromes are dumping and alkaline re fl ux gastritis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dumping

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dumping syndrome consists of a series of vasomotor and GI signs and symptoms. Th ere are two phases of dumping: early and  late.  Dumping  is  caused  by  the  entry  of  hyperosmolar gastric contents into the proximal small bowel, which results in a shi ft of fl uid into the gut lumen, plasma volume contraction, and acute intestinal distention. Release of vasoactive GI hormones  may  also  play  a  role.  Early  dumping  symptoms occur 15 to 30 minutes a ft er a meal and include nausea, diarrhea,  epigastric  discomfort,  diaphoresis,  crampy  abdominal pain, tachycardia, palpitations, and, in extreme cases, dizziness or even syncope. Late dumping symptoms follow a meal by  1  to  3  hours  and  can  include  vasomotor  symptoms  that are thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia, which occurs as a result of excessive insulin release. Dietary modi fi cationsconsumption of  frequent  small  meals,  intake  of  few  simple sugars, and a reduction in the amount of fl uid ingested with a  meal-can  be  very  helpful.  Octreotide  therapy  has  been reported  to  improve  dumping  symptoms  in  diet-refractory cases. Th e drug is administered subcutaneously before a meal. Somatostatin analogues have bene fi cial e ff ects on the vasomotor  symptoms of dumping that are postulated to occur as a result of the pressor e ff ects of these compounds on splanchnic blood vessels. In addition, somatostatin analogues inhibit the release of vasoactive peptides from the gut, decrease peak plasma insulin levels, and slow intestinal transit. Acarbose, an α -glucosidase inhibitor that delays the digestion of ingested carbohydrates, is o ft en bene fi cial in late dumping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkaline Reflux Gastritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alkaline re fl ux gastritis is identi fi ed by the occurrence of the clinical triad of (1) postprandial epigastric pain o ft en associated with nausea and vomiting, (2) evidence of re fl ux of bile into the stomach, and (3) associated histologic evidence of gastritis. Th ere is no pharmacologic treatment for alkaline re fl ux gastritis. Th e only proven treatment is operative diversion of intestinal contents from contact with the gastric mucosa. Th e most common surgical procedure for this purpose is a Rouxen-Y gastrojejunostomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with irritable  bowel  syndrome (spastic  or  mucous colitis) o ft en complain of generalized abdominal discomfort. Commonly, the frequency of stools is increased, and the stool is covered with mucus. Many patients have associated symptoms of  vasomotor  instability,  including  tachycardia,  hyperventilation, fatigue, diaphoresis, and headaches. Air trapped in the splenic fl exure may produce pain in the le ft shoulder that radiates down the le ft arm ( splenic fl exure syndrome ). Despite the frequent occurrence of irritable bowel syndrome, there is no known speci fi c etiologic agent or structural or biochemical defect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In fl ammatory bowel diseases are the most common chronic in fl ammatory disorders a ft er rheumatoid arthritis. Th e diagnosis  of  ulcerative  colitis  and  Crohn's  disease,  and  the  differentiation between these disorders, is based on nonspeci fi c clinical  and  histologic  patterns  that  are  o ft en  obscured  by intercurrent infection, iatrogenic events, medication, or surgery. Th e  incidence  of  in fl ammatory  bowel  disease  in  the United States is approximately 18 per 100,000 people.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ulcerative Colitis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ulcerative  colitis  is  a  mucosal  disease  involving  the  rectum and extending proximally to involve all or part of the colon. Approximately 40% to 50% of patients have disease limited to the rectum and rectosigmoid, 30% to 40% have disease extending beyond the sigmoid but not involving the entire colon, and 20% have a total colitis. Proximal spread occurs in continuity without areas of spared mucosa. In more severe disease, the mucosa is  hemorrhagic,  edematous,  and  ulcerated.  In  longstanding disease, in fl ammatory polyps (pseudopolyps) may be present. A ft er many years of disease, the mucosa may appear atrophic  and  featureless,  and  the  entire  colon  narrows  and shortens. Th e  major symptoms of ulcerative colitis are diarrhea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus, passage of mucus, and crampy abdominal pain. Symptoms in moderate to severe disease may also include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss. Active disease can be associated with an increase in levels of acute  phase  reactants,  platelet  count,  and  erythrocyte  sedimentation rate, and a decrease in hematocrit. In severely ill patients, the serum albumin level is low and leukocytosis may be present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Catastrophic illness is an initial presentation in only 15% of patients with ulcerative colitis. In 1% of patients, a severe episode  may  be  accompanied  by  massive  hemorrhage,  which usually stops with treatment of the underlying disease. However, if the patient requires 6 to 8 units of blood within 24 to 48 hours, colectomy is frequently performed. Toxic megacolon is de fi ned as a dilated transverse colon with loss of haustrations. It occurs in approximately 5% of episodes and can be triggered by  electrolyte  abnormalities  or  narcotics.  About  half  of  the time, toxic megacolon will resolve with medical therapy, but urgent colectomy may be required in those who do not experience improvement with conservative treatment. Perforation

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of the colon is the most dangerous complication of ulcerative colitis, and the physical signs of peritonitis may not be obvious, especially if the patient is receiving glucocorticoids. Th e mortality  rate  associated  with  this  complication  is  approximately 15%. Some patients can develop toxic colitis and such severe ulcerations that the bowel may perforate without dilating. Obstructions caused by benign stricture formation occur in 10% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Crohn's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although Crohn's disease usually presents as acute or chronic bowel in fl ammation, the in fl ammatory  process typically evolves  into  one  of  two  patterns  of  disease,  a  penetratingfi stulous pattern or an obstructing pattern, each with di ff erent treatments and prognoses.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  common  site  of  in fl ammation  is  the  terminal ileum. Th erefore, the usual presentation of ileocolitis is a history of recurrent episodes of right lower quadrant pain and diarrhea.  Sometimes  the  initial  presentation  mimics  that of  acute  appendicitis  with  pronounced  right  lower  quadrant  pain,  a  palpable  mass,  fever,  and  leukocytosis.  A  spiking fever suggests intraabdominal abscess formation. Weight loss, typically 10% to 20% of body weight, is common and is a  consequence  of  diarrhea,  anorexia,  and  fear  of  eating.  An in fl ammatory mass may be palpated in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Local extension of the mass can cause obstruction of the right ureter or in fl ammation of the bladder, manifested as dysuria and fever. Bowel obstruction may take several forms. In the early stages, bowel wall edema and spasm produce intermittent obstruction and increasing postprandial pain.  Over  several  years,  persistent  in fl ammation  gradually progresses to fi brostenotic narrowing and stricture. Diarrhea decreases and is replaced by chronic bowel obstruction. Severe in fl ammation of the ileocecal region may lead to localized wall thinning, with microperforation and formation of fi stulas to the adjacent bowel, the skin, the urinary bladder, or an abscess cavity in the mesentery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extensive in fl ammatory disease is associated with a loss of digestive and absorptive surfaces, which results in malabsorption  and  steatorrhea.  Nutritional  de fi ciencies  can  also  result from poor intake and enteric losses of protein and other nutrients,  causing hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, coagulopathy, and hyperoxaluria with nephrolithiasis. Vertebral fractures are caused by a combination of vitamin D de fi ciency, hypocalcemia, and prolonged glucocorticoid use. Pellagra from niacin de fi ciency can occur in extensive small bowel disease, and malabsorption of vitamin B 12 can lead to a megaloblastic anemia and neurologic symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diarrhea is a sign of active disease caused by bacterial overgrowth in obstructed areas, fi stulization, bile acid malabsorption resulting from a diseased or resected terminal ileum, and intestinal in fl ammation with decreased water absorption and increased secretion of electrolytes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with colitis have low-grade fever, malaise, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, and sometimes hematochezia. Gross bleeding is not as common as in ulcerative colitis and appears in about half of patients with Crohn's disease involving only the colon. Only 1% to 2% bleed massively. Pain is caused by passage of fecal material through narrowed and in fl amed segments of large bowel. Toxic megacolon is rare but may be seen with  severe  in fl ammation.  Stricture  formation  can  produce symptoms of bowel obstruction. Colonic disease may fi stulize into the stomach or duodenum, causing feculent vomitus, or into the proximal or middle small bowel, causing malabsorption by "short-circuiting" bacterial overgrowth.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Symptoms and signs of upper GI tract disease include nausea,  vomiting,  and  epigastric  pain.  Patients  usually  have  an H. pylori -negative gastritis. Th e  second  portion  of  the  duodenum is more commonly involved than the duodenal bulb. Patients with advanced gastroduodenal Crohn's disease may develop chronic gastric outlet obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Up to one third of patients  with  Crohn's  disease  have  at least one extraintestinal manifestation of the disease. Patients with perianal Crohn's disease are at higher risk of developing extraintestinal manifestations (Table 14-4).

Crohn's disease include resection of the diseased segment and strictureplasty.  A  diverting  colostomy  may  help  heal  severe perianal disease or a rectovaginal fi stula,  but  disease  almost always recurs a ft er takedown of the colostomy. O ft en, patients require  a  total  proctocolectomy  and  ileostomy.  Resection  of one half to two thirds of the small bowel represents the upper limit of resection, because removal of more than two thirds of the small intestine results in short bowel syndrome and the need for total parenteral nutrition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nearly  half  of  patients  with  extensive  chronic  ulcerative colitis undergo surgery within the fi rst 10 years of their illness. Th e indications for surgery are listed in Table 14-5. Th e complication rate is approximately 20% in elective, 30% in urgent, and 40% in emergent proctocolectomy. Th e complications are primarily hemorrhage, sepsis, and neural injury. Although singlestage  total  proctocolectomy  with  ileostomy  has  traditionally been the operation of choice, newer operations maintain continence while surgically removing the involved rectal mucosa.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MEDICAL TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sulfasalazine  is  the  mainstay  of  therapy  for  mild  to  moderate  in fl ammatory bowel disease. It was originally developed to  deliver  both  antibacterial  (sulfapyridine)  and  antiin fl ammatory  (5-acetylsalicylic acid) therapy into  the  connective  tissues  of  joints  and  the  colonic  mucosa.  It  is  e ff ective in  inducing remission in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. Up to 30% of patients experience allergic reactions or signi fi cant side e ff ects such as headache, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting that are attributable to the sulfapyridine moiety. Hypersensitivity reactions can include rash, fever, hepatitis, agranulocytosis,  hypersensitivity  pneumonitis,  pancreatitis,  worsening of colitis, and impairment of folate absorption. Newer sulfafree  aminosalicylate  preparations  deliver  increased  amounts of  the  pharmacologically  active  ingredients  of  sulfasalazine (5-acetylsalicylic acid, mesalamine) to the site of active bowel disease while limiting systemic toxicity. Th e most commonly used  of  these  newer  drugs  are  Asacol  and  Pentasa,  both  of which contain mesalamine. Asacol is an enteric-coated form of mesalamine, but it has a slightly di ff erent release pattern, with 5-acetylsalicylic acid liberated at a pH higher than 7.0.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority  of  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  ulcerative  colitis  bene fi t  from  oral  or  parenteral  glucocorticoids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prednisone is usually started at dosages of 40 to 60 mg/day for active ulcerative colitis that is unresponsive to sulfa therapy.  Parenteral  glucocorticoids  or  corticotropin  is  occasionally preferred for glucocorticoid-naive patients despite a risk of adrenal hemorrhage. Topically applied glucocorticoids are also bene fi cial for distal colitis and may serve as an adjunct in those who have rectal involvement. Th ese glucocorticoids are absorbed from the rectum in signi fi cant amounts and can lead to adrenal suppression a ft er prolonged administration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucocorticoids are also e ff ective for treatment of moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Controlled ileal-release budesonide is  nearly  equipotent  to  prednisone  in  treating  ileocolonic Crohn's disease and has fewer glucocorticoid side e ff ects. Steroids play no role in maintenance therapy in either ulcerative colitis  or  Crohn's  disease.  Once  clinical  remission  has  been induced, corticosteroids should be tapered and discontinued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antibiotics have no role in the treatment of active or quiescent ulcerative colitis. However, "pouchitis," which occurs in approximately one third of ulcerative colitis patients a ft er colectomy, usually responds to treatment with metronidazole or cipro fl oxacin. Th ese two antibiotics should be used as fi rst-line drugs in perianal and fi stulous Crohn's disease and as secondline  therapy  in  active  Crohn's  disease  a ft er  5-acetylsalicylic acid agents become ine ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-Mp) are purine analogues commonly used in the management of glucocorticoiddependent  in fl ammatory  bowel  syndromes.  Azothioprine  is readily  absorbed  and  then  converted  to  6-Mp,  which  is  then metabolized to an active end product. E ffi cacy is typically seen within 3 to 4 weeks. Pancreatitis occurs in 3% to 4% of patients, generally within the fi rst few weeks of therapy, and is completely reversible  when  the  drug  is  discontinued.  Other  side  e ff ects include nausea, fever, rash, and hepatitis. Bone marrow suppression (particularly leukopenia) is dose related and o ft en delayed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which results in impaired DNA synthesis. Additional antiin fl ammatory properties may be related to a decrease in IL-1 production. Potential toxicities include leukopenia, hypersensitivity reactions, hepatic fi brosis, and pneumonitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cyclosporine  alters  the  immune  response  by  acting  as  a potent inhibitor of T cell-mediated responses. Although cyclosporine  acts  primarily  via  inhibition  of  IL-2  production  by helper T cells, it also decreases recruitment of cytotoxic T cells and blocks other cytokines, interferonγ ,  and tumor necrosis factor.  It  has  a  more  rapid  onset  of  action  than  6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Renal function should be monitored frequently. Hypertension, gingival hyperplasia, hypertrichosis, paresthesias, tremors, headaches, and electrolyte abnormalities are common side e ff ects of cyclosporine. Creatinine elevation requires a dosage reduction or discontinuation of the drug.

CARCINOID TUMORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of clinically signi fi cant carcinoid tumors is 7 to 13  cases  per  million  people  per  year.  Carcinoid  tumors  can occur in almost any GI tissue. However, most (70%) originate from one of three sites: a bronchus, the jejunoileum, or the colon-rectum. Th ese tumors typically secrete GI peptides and/ or vasoactive substances (Table 14-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid Tumors without Carcinoid Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid  tumors  (Table  14-7)  are  o ft en  found  incidentally during surgery for suspected appendicitis. Symptoms are o ft en vague, and so the diagnosis is usually delayed by about 2 years from the onset of the symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid Tumors with Systemic Symptoms due to Secreted Products

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid tumors can contain GI peptides, including gastrin, insulin, somatostatin, motilin, neurotensin, tachykinins (substance  K,  substance  P ,  neuropeptide  K),  glucagon,  gastrinreleasing  peptide,  vasoactive  intestinal  peptide,  pancreatic peptide, other biologically active peptides (corticotropin, calcitonin, growth hormone), prostaglandins, and bioactive amines (serotonin). Th ese substances may or may not be released in su ffi cient amounts to cause symptoms. Foregut carcinoids are more likely to produce various peptides than midgut carcinoids.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carcinoid syndrome occurs in approximately 20% of patients with carcinoid tumors as a result of the large amounts of serotonin and vasoactive substances reaching the systemic circulation. Th e two most common signs are fl ushing and diarrhea.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  characteristic fl ush  is  of  sudden  onset.  Physically  it appears as a deep red blush, especially in the neck and face, o ft en  associated  with  a  feeling  of  warmth  and  occasionally associated  with  pruritus,  tearing,  diarrhea,  or  facial  edema. Flushes may be precipitated by stress, alcohol, exercise, certain  foods,  and  drugs  such  as  catecholamines,  pentagastrin, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Cardiac tumors may have cardiac  manifestations  resulting  from fi brosis  involving  the endocardium, primarily on the right side of the heart. Le ft -sided  lesions  can  occur  with  pulmonary  involvement  or  via a right-to-le ft intracardiac shunt (atrial septal defect, ventricular  septal  defect,  patent  foramen  ovale).  Pulmonic  stenosis and tricuspid regurgitation are the typical valvular lesions. Th e carcinoid  triad  is  (1)  cardiac  involvement,  (2) fl ushing,  and (3) diarrhea. Other clinical manifestations include wheezing or asthma-like symptoms and pellagra-like skin lesions. Retroperitoneal fi brosis can cause ureteral obstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  most  of  patients  with  carcinoid  syndrome,  serotonin is  overproduced and is responsible for the diarrhea through its  e ff ects on gut motility and intestinal secretion. Serotonin receptor antagonists (especially 5-hydroxytryptamine 3, [5-HT3]  antagonists)  relieve  the  diarrhea  in  most  patients. Serotonin does not appear to be involved in the fl ushing. In patients with gastric carcinoid tumors, the red, patchy pruritic fl ush is likely due to histamine release and can be prevented by H1- and H2-receptor blockers. Both histamine and serotonin may be responsible for bronchoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  potentially  life-threatening  complication  of  carcinoid syndrome is development of a carcinoid crisis. Clinically, this manifests as intense fl ushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cardiovascular signs, including tachycardia, hypertension, or hypotension. If not adequately treated, it can be fatal. Th e crises  may occur spontaneously or may be provoked by stress, chemotherapy, or biopsy. Anesthetic drugs that can precipitate a carcinoid crisis are noted in Table 14-8.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome relies on measurement of  urinary  or  plasma  serotonin  concentrations  or  measurement of serotonin metabolites in the urine. Th e measurement

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of  5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid  (5-HIAA)  is  performed  most frequently. False-positive test results may occur if the patient is eating serotonin-rich foods.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapy  for  carcinoid  tumors  includes  avoiding  conditions that precipitate fl ushing, treating heart failure and/or wheezing, providing dietary supplementation with nicotinamide, and controlling diarrhea. If the patient continues to have symptoms, serotonin receptor antagonists or somatostatin analogues are useful. Many of these drugs have very short half-lives and must be given as continuous infusions. Th e 5-HT1 and 5-HT 2 receptor  antagonists  methysergide,  cyproheptadine,  and  ketanserin have all been used to control diarrhea but usually do not decrease fl ushing. Th e use of methysergide is limited because it can cause or exacerbate retroperitoneal fi brosis. Th e 5-HT3 receptor  antagonists  ondansetron,  tropisetron,  and  alosetron can  control  diarrhea  and  nausea  in  the  majority  of  patients and even occasionally ameliorate the fl ushing. A combination of  H 1 -  and  H 2 -receptor  antagonists  (i.e.,  diphenhydramine and cimetidine or ranitidine) may be useful in controlling the fl ushing in patients with foregut carcinoid tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synthetic  analogues  of  somatostatin,  such  as  octreotide, control  symptoms in more than 80% of patients. Lanreotide is now the most widely used drug to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. It is given in a sustained release form by subcutaneous injection and can last up to 2 weeks. Somatostatin analogues are e ff ective in relieving symptoms and decreasing  urinary  5-HIAA levels.  In  patients  with  carcinoid  crises, somatostatin analogues are e ff ective in treating the condition as well as preventing its development during known precipitating  events  such  as  surgery,  anesthesia,  chemotherapy,  and stress. Octreotide should be administered 24 to 48 hours before surgery and then continued throughout the procedure. Shortterm side e ff ects occur in 40% to 60% of patients receiving subcutaneous somatostatin analogues. Th ese  include  pain  at  the injection  site,  abdominal  discomfort,  and  nausea.  Important long-term side e ff ects include gallstone formation, steatorrhea, and glucose intolerance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is the only potentially curative therapy for nonmetastatic carcinoid tumors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring is necessary during the intraoperative management of patients with carcinoid syndrome because of the potential for rapid changes in hemodynamic variables. Administration of octreotide preoperatively and  before  manipulation  of  the  tumor  will  attenuate  most adverse  hemodynamic responses.  General  anesthesia  is  typically used for this surgery, and any combination of drugs is suitable for the anesthetic. However, increased levels of serotonin have been associated with delayed awakening. Ondansetron, a serotonin antagonist, is a useful and logical antiemetic choice.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of epidural analgesia in patients who have been adequately treated with octreotide is a safe technique provided the local anesthetic is administered in a gradual manner accompanied by careful hemodynamic monitoring.

ACUTE PANCREATITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  pancreatitis  is  an  acute  in fl ammatory disorder of  the pancreas. Th e  incidence  of  acute  pancreatitis  has  increased 10-fold since the 1960s, which perhaps re fl ects increased alcohol abuse and/or improved diagnostic techniques.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  pancreas  contains  numerous  digestive  enzymes  (proteases). Autodigestion of the pancreas is prevented by packaging of the proteases in precursor form, synthesis of protease inhibitors, and the low intrapancreatic concentration of calcium,  which  decreases  trypsin  activity.  Loss  of  any  of  these protective mechanisms leads to enzyme activation, autodigestion, and acute pancreatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gallstones  and  alcohol  abuse  are  the  causative  factors  in 60% to 80% of patients with acute pancreatitis. Gallstones are believed  to  cause  pancreatitis  by  transiently  obstructing  the ampulla of Vater, which leads to pancreatic ductal hypertension. Acute pancreatitis is common in patients with acquired immunode fi ciency  syndrome  and  those  with  hyperparathyroidism and its associated hypercalcemia. Trauma-induced acute pancreatitis is generally associated with blunt trauma rather than penetrating injury. Th is blunt trauma may compress the pancreas against the spine. Postoperative pancreatitis occurs a ft er abdominal and noncardiac or cardiac thoracic surgery, especially procedures that require cardiopulmonary bypass. Clinical pancreatitis develops in 1% to 2% of patients following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Excruciating, unrelenting midepigastric abdominal pain that radiates to the back occurs in almost every patient with acute pancreatitis.  Sitting  and  leaning  forward  may  decrease  the pain. Nausea and vomiting can occur at the peak of the pain. Abdominal distention with ileus o ft en develops. Dyspnea may re fl ect the presence of pleural e ff usions or ascites. Low-grade fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are fairly common. Shock

<!-- PAGE=? -->
may occur as a result of (1) hypovolemia from the exudation of blood and plasma into the retroperitoneal space, (2) release of kinins that cause vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, and (3) systemic e ff ects of pancreatic enzymes released into the general circulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obtundation and psychosis may re fl ect alcohol withdrawal. Development of tetany may occur as a result of hypocalcemia (calcium binds to free fatty acids and forms soaps).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hallmark  of  acute  pancreatitis  is  an  increase  in  serum amylase concentration. Serum lipase concentration is also elevated.  Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the best noninvasive  test  for  documenting  the  morphologic  changes associated with acute pancreatitis. ERCP can be useful for both evaluating and treating certain forms of pancreatitis, such as traumatic pancreatitis (localization of injury) and severe gallstone pancreatitis (papillotomy, stone removal, and drainage).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  di ff erential  diagnosis  of  acute  pancreatitis  includes  a perforated  duodenal  ulcer,  acute  cholecystitis,  mesenteric ischemia, and bowel obstruction. Acute myocardial infarction may cause severe abdominal pain, but serum amylase concentration  is  not  increased.  Patients  with  pneumonia  may  also have signi fi cant epigastric pain and fever.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important to identify patients with acute pancreatitis who are at signi fi cant risk of dying from the disease. Multifactor scoring systems have been devised to help identify these high-risk  patients.  One  such  system  is  the  Ranson  criteria. Th ese criteria are (1) age older than 55 years, (2) white blood cell  count  of  more  than  16,000  cells/mm 3 ,  (3)  blood  urea nitrogen concentration of more than 16 mmol/L, (4) aspartate transaminase level of more than 250 units/L, (5) arterial Pa o 2 of less than 60 mm Hg, (6) fl uid de fi cit of more than 6 L, (7) blood glucose level of more than 200 mg/dL in a person without a history of diabetes mellitus, (8) lactate dehydrogenase level of more than 350 IU/L, (9) corrected calcium concentration of less than 8 mg/dL, (10) a decrease in hematocrit of more than 10, and (11) metabolic acidosis with a base de fi -cit  of  more than 4 mmol/L. It is noteworthy that the serum amylase concentration is not one of the criteria.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  Ranson  scoring  system,  mortality  is  related  to  the number of criteria met. Patients ful fi lling zero to two criteria have a mortality of less than 5%. Patients meeting three or four criteria have a 20% mortality; those ful fi lling fi ve or six criteria have a 40% mortality. Th e presence of seven or eight criteria is associated with 100% mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nearly 25% of patients who develop acute pancreatitis experience signi fi cant complications. Shock can develop early in the course of severe acute pancreatitis and is a major risk factor  for  death.  Sequestration of large volumes of fl uid in the peripancreatic  space,  hemorrhage,  and  systemic  vasodilation  contribute  to  hypotension.  Arterial  hypoxemia is  o ft en present early in the course of the disease. ARDS is seen in 20% of patients. Renal failure occurs in 25% of patients and is associated with a poor prognosis. GI hemorrhage and coagulation defects  from  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  may occur. Infection of necrotic pancreatic material or abscess formation is a serious complication associated with a mortality rate of more than 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aggressive  intravenous fl uid  administration  is  necessary  to treat  the  signi fi cant  hypovolemia that occurs in all patients, even those with mild pancreatitis. Colloid replacement may be necessary if there is signi fi cant bleeding or albumin loss. Traditionally, oral intake is stopped to rest the pancreas and prevent aggravation of the accompanying ileus. Th ere are data to  suggest  that  feeding  patients  via  a  postpyloric  route  such as a nasojejunal tube or feeding jejunostomy may be helpful, especially in patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated as a result of ARDS or renal failure. Parenteral feeding is indicated if patients do not tolerate enteral feeding. Nasogastric suction may be needed to treat persistent vomiting or ileus. Opioids are typically administered to manage the severe pain.  Endoscopic  removal  of  obstructing  gallstones  is  indicated within the fi rst 24 to 72 hours of the onset of symptoms to decrease the risk of cholangitis. Drainage of intraabdominal collections of fl uids or necrotic material can be done without surgery.  Interventions  via  ERCP  include  drainage  through tubes of various sizes that can be changed (upsized) if needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CHRONIC PANCREATITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of chronic pancreatitis is di ffi cult to determine, since  the  disease  may  be  asymptomatic  or  abdominal  pain may be attributed to other causes. Th e  persistent  in fl ammation characteristic of chronic pancreatitis leads to irreversible damage to the pancreas. Th ere  is  loss  of  both  exocrine  and endocrine function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  pancreatitis  is  most  o ft en  due  to  chronic  alcohol abuse. Alcohol may have a direct toxic e ff ect on the pancreas. Diets high in protein seem to predispose alcoholic patients to the  development  of  chronic  pancreatitis. Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis is seen in up to 25% of adults in the United States with  chronic  pancreatitis.  It  is  suggested  that  a  signi fi cant number  of  "idiopathic"  cases  are  related  to  genetic  defects. Chronic  pancreatitis  also  occurs  in  association  with  cystic fi brosis and hyperparathyroidism (hypercalcemia).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic pancreatitis is o ft en characterized by epigastric pain that radiates to the back and is frequently postprandial. However, 10% to 30% of patients have painless chronic pancreatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE 300

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Steatorrhea is present when at least 90% of pancreatic exocrine function is last. Diabetes mellitus is the end result of loss of endocrine function. Pancreatic calci fi cations develop in most patients with alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis may be based on a history of chronic alcohol abuse and demonstration of pancreatic calcifi cations. Patients who have chronic pancreatitis are o ft en thin and even emaciated. Th is is due to the maldigestion of proteins and fats seen when the amount of pancreatic enzymes entering the  duodenum is reduced to 10% to 20% of normal. Serum amylase  concentrations  are  usually  normal.  An  abdominal radiograph  may  reveal  pancreatic  calci fi cations.  Ultrasonography is useful for documenting the presence of an enlarged pancreas or identifying a pseudocyst. Computed tomography in patients with chronic pancreatitis demonstrates dilated pancreatic ducts and changes in the size of the pancreas. ERCP is the most sensitive imaging test for detecting early changes in the pancreatic ducts caused by chronic pancreatitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  of  chronic  pancreatitis  includes  management  of pain, malabsorption, and diabetes mellitus. Opioids are o ft en required  for  adequate  pain  control,  and  in  some  patients, celiac plexus blockade may be considered. An internal surgical drainage procedure (pancreaticojejunostomy) or endoscopic placement of stents and/or extraction of stones may be helpful in patients whose pain is resistant to medical management. Enzyme  supplements  are  administered  to  facilitate  fat  and protein absorption. Insulin is administered as needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MALABSORPTION AND MALDIGESTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malabsorption of nutrients usually involves impaired absorption  of  fat  (steatorrhea),  although  other  substances  (iron, calcium,  bile  salts,  speci fi c  amino  acids,  saccharides)  may be selectively poorly absorbed in the absence of steatorrhea. Steatorrhea  is  most  frequently  caused  by  small  bowel,  liver, or  biliary  tract  disease  or  pancreatic  exocrine  insu ffi ciency. Patients with small bowel disease may develop hypoalbuminemia as a result of leakage of protein through diseased intestinal mucosa. De fi ciencies of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, K), hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia may be present in patients with liver and biliary tract disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gluten-Sensitive Enteropathy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gluten-sensitive  enteropathy (previously  termed celiac  disease in  children and nontropical sprue in  adults) is a disease of  the  small  intestine  resulting  in  malabsorption  (steatorrhea), weight loss, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Treatment is removal of gluten-containing foods, such as wheat, rye, and barley, from the diet.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extensive Small Bowel Resection

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Extensive small bowel resection for mesenteric ischemia, volvulus, or Crohn's disease may result in malabsorption if the remaining small intestinal surface area for absorption of nutrients is decreased below a critical level. Clinical manifestations of the resulting short bowel syndrome include diarrhea, steatorrhea, trace element de fi ciencies, and electrolyte imbalances, especially  hyponatremia  and  hypokalemia.  Total  parenteral nutrition  may  be  needed  if  frequent  small  feedings  are  not e ff ective in maintaining nutritional balance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GASTROINTESTINAL BLEEDING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GI bleeding (Table 14-9) most o ft en originates in the upper GI tract (from peptic ulcer disease). Bleeding in the lower GI tract from diverticulosis or tumor accounts for 10% to 20% of all cases of GI bleeding and primarily a ff ects older patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Upper Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  acute  upper  GI  tract  bleeding  may  experience hypotension and tachycardia if blood loss exceeds 25% of total blood volume. Patients with orthostatic hypotension characterized by a positional decrease in systolic blood pressure of 10 to 20 mm Hg and a corresponding increase in heart rate generally have a hematocrit of less than 30%. Th e hematocrit may be  normal early in the course of acute hemorrhage because of insu ffi cient time for equilibration of plasma volume. A ft er fl uid resuscitation, anemia becomes more overt. Melena indicates  that  bleeding  has  occurred  at  a  site  above  the  cecum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood urea nitrogen levels are typically more than 40 mg/dL because of the absorbed nitrogen load from the blood in the small intestine. Elderly individuals, those with esophageal variceal bleeding, those with malignancy, and those who develop bleeding during hospitalization for other medical conditions have an acute mortality rate of more than 30%. Multiple organ system failure, rather than hemorrhage, is the usual cause of death in these patients. Upper endoscopy a ft er hemodynamic stabilization is the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure of choice in patients with acute upper GI tract bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with bleeding peptic ulcers, endoscopic coagulation (thermotherapy, or injection with epinephrine or a sclerosing material) is indicated when active bleeding is visible. Even  patients  receiving  anticoagulants  can  be  safely  treated with  endoscopic  coagulation  of  a  peptic  ulcer.  Perforation occurs  in  approximately  0.5%  of  patients  undergoing  endoscopic coagulation. In patients with bleeding esophageal varices, endoscopic ligation of the bleeding varices is as e ff ective as sclerotherapy. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may  be  used  in  patients  with  esophageal  variceal  bleeding resistant to control by endoscopic coagulation or sclerotherapy. However, insertion of such a shunt can lead to worsening encephalopathy.  Mechanical  tamponade  of  bleeding  varices can  be  accomplished  with  a  Sengstaken-Blakemore  tube  or a  Minnesota tube. Th ese  devices  have  balloons  to  mechanically tamponade the bleeding varices. Such devices are rarely used now that endoscopic therapy for bleeding varices is so successful.  Surgical  treatment  of  nonvariceal  upper  GI  tract bleeding may be undertaken to oversew an ulcer or to perform gastrectomy for di ff use hemorrhagic gastritis in patients who continue to bleed despite optimal supportive therapy and in whom endoscopic coagulation is unsuccessful.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lower Gastrointestinal Tract Bleeding

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lower  GI  tract  (colonic)  bleeding  usually  occurs  in  older patients and typically presents as abrupt passage of bright red blood and clots via the rectum. Causes include diverticulosis, tumors, ischemic colitis, and certain forms of infectious colitis. Sigmoidoscopy to exclude anorectal lesions is indicated as soon as patients are in hemodynamically stable condition. Colonoscopy  can  be  performed  a ft er  the  bowel  has  been  cleansed.  If bleeding is persistent and brisk, angiography and embolic therapy may be attempted. Up to 15% of patients with lower GI tract bleeding require surgical intervention to control it.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occult Gastrointestinal Bleeding

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occult GI bleeding may present as unexplained iron de fi ciency anemia or as intermittently positive results on tests for occult blood in the stool. Peptic ulcer disease and colonic neoplasm are the most common causes of occult GI bleeding. Th e site of occult bleeding is determined by upper GI tract endoscopy and colonoscopy. Occasionally other tests such as a radioactive tagged red blood cell scan or angiography are needed to de fi ne the bleeding site.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIVERTICULOSIS AND DIVERTICULITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Colonic  diverticula  are  herniations  of  the  mucosa  and  submucosa  through  the  muscularis  propria  layer. Th ese  occur most o ft en in individuals who consume lowfi ber diets. Diverticulitis  is  in fl ammation of  one  or  more  diverticula,  mostly in the sigmoid or descending colon. Mild diverticulitis typically manifests with fever and lower abdominal pain and tenderness.  Nausea,  vomiting,  constipation,  diarrhea,  dysuria, tachycardia,  and  leukocytosis  may  be  noted.  Right  colon diverticulitis is  o ft en  indistinguishable  from  appendicitis. Severe diverticulitis is characterized by the development of a diverticular  abscess  that  may  rupture  and  produce  purulent peritonitis. Fistula formation can occur and most commonly is  a  connection between the sigmoid colon and the bladder. Abdominal computed tomography is the most useful study for evaluation of suspected diverticulitis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment  for  mild  distress  in  patients  tolerating  oral hydration  should  include  7  to  10  days  of  oral  broad-spectrum  antimicrobial  therapy  (including  coverage  for  anaerobic  organisms). Patients with diverticulitis severe enough to require  hospitalization  are  treated  with  intravenous fl uids, bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and parenteral analgesics.  If,  despite  adequate  supportive  therapy,  the  patient's condition does not improve within 48 hours, complications of diverticulitis likely exist. Further therapy is necessary and may include surgery. Surgical treatment of acute diverticulitis consists of resection of the diseased segment of colon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
APPENDICITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Incidence and Epidemiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e peak incidence of acute appendicitis is in the second and third decades of life. It is relatively rare at the extremes of age, but perforation and increased mortality are more common in infants and the elderly. Among infants younger than 2 years of age there is a 70% to 80% incidence of perforation and generalized peritonitis. In the elderly, pain and tenderness are o ft en blunted, and thus the diagnosis is frequently delayed, so there is  a  30%  incidence  of  perforation  in  patients  older  than  70 years. Th e mortality rate has decreased steadily in Europe and the United States from 8.1 per 100,000 people in 1941 to fewer than 1 per 100,000 in 1970 and subsequently. Interestingly, the overall incidence of appendicitis is much lower in underdeveloped countries and in lower socioeconomic groups.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Luminal  obstruction  can  be  identi fi ed  in  only  30%  to  40% of cases, and ulceration of the mucosa is the initial event in the  majority  of  cases.  Obstruction,  if  present,  is  most  commonly caused by a fecalith. Enlarged lymphoid follicles associated with viral infections (e.g., measles), inspissated barium, worms (e.g., pinworms, ascaris), and tumors (e.g., carcinoid) may also obstruct the lumen. Luminal bacteria multiply and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
302

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
invade the appendiceal wall. Venous engorgement and subsequent arterial compromise result from high intraluminal pressures.  Perforation  and/or  gangrene  may  eventually  occur.  If the appendiceal in fl ammatory process evolves slowly, adjacent organs such as the terminal ileum, cecum, and omentum may wall o ff the appendiceal area so that a localized abscess develops.  Rapid  progression  of  appendicitis  and  vascular  impairment causes perforation into the peritoneal cavity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History  and  symptoms  are  important  diagnostic  features  of appendicitis. Th e  initial  symptom  is  almost  invariably  mild crampy abdominal pain resulting from appendiceal contractions  or  distention  of  the  appendiceal  lumen.  It  is  initially poorly localized in the periumbilical or epigastric region and accompanied by the urge to defecate or pass fl atus, neither of which relieves the pain. As in fl ammation spreads to the parietal  peritoneal  surfaces,  the  pain  becomes  steady  and  more severe, aggravated by motion or cough, and by then is usually located in the right lower quadrant. Anorexia is very common. Nausea and vomiting occur in 50% to 60% of cases. Urinary frequency and dysuria can occur if the appendix lies adjacent to the bladder. Body temperature is usually normal or slightly elevated. A temperature of more than 38.3° C suggests perforation. Early perforation is rare, but the perforation rate may approach 80% a ft er 48 hours. Moderate leukocytosis of 10,000 to 18,000 cells/mm 3  is frequent, but the absence of leukocytosis does not rule out acute appendicitis. Leukocytosis of more than  20,000  cells/mm 3   suggests  perforation.  Appendicitis occurs in about 1 in every 1000 pregnancies and is the most common extrauterine condition requiring abdominal surgery during pregnancy. Th e di ff erential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is presented in Table 14-10.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appendectomy should be performed as soon as the patient can  be  prepared. Th e  only  circumstance  in  which  operation  is not indicated  is  the  presence  of  a  palpable  mass 3 to 5 days a ft er the onset of symptoms. Such patients have a periappendiceal abscess. Surgery at this time is frequently associated  with  complications,  so  medical  therapy  is  typically used instead. Th is includes broad-spectrum antibiotics, fl uids, and rest. Resolution of the mass and symptoms o ft en

<!-- PAGE=? -->
occurs within a week. Appendectomy can be done safely a few months later.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERITONITIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peritonitis  is  an  in fl ammation of the peritoneum. It may be localized or di ff use, acute or chronic, and infectious or aseptic. Acute peritonitis is most o ft en infectious and is usually related to a perforated viscus ( secondary peritonitis ). When no bacterial source is identi fi ed, infectious peritonitis is called primary or spontaneous.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathogenesis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infectious agents gain access to the peritoneal cavity through a  perforated  viscus,  a  penetrating  wound  of  the  abdominal wall,  or  external  introduction  of  a  foreign  object  that  is  or becomes infected, such as a peritoneal dialysis catheter. In the absence of immune compromise, host defenses are capable of eradicating  small  contaminations. Th e  conditions  that  most commonly result in the introduction of bacteria into the peritoneum are noted in Table 14-11. Bacterial peritonitis can also occur in the apparent absence of an intraperitoneal source of bacteria (primary or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis). Th is condition typically occurs in the setting of ascites and cirrhosis, especially in patients with ascites with a low protein concentration (<1 g/L). It is postulated that spontaneous bacterial peritonitis actually develops due to translocation of bacteria from the intestinal lumen to regional lymph nodes with subsequent bacteremia and infection of the ascitic fl uid.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aseptic  peritonitis may  be  due  to  irritation  of  the  peritoneum  by  the  presence  of  normal  physiologic fl uids  (e.g., gastric  juice,  bile,  pancreatic  enzymes,  blood,  urine)  in  an abnormal location (the peritoneum) or the presence of sterile foreign bodies, such as surgical sponges or instruments or starch from surgical gloves, in the peritoneal cavity. It can also be a complication of certain systemic diseases such as lupus erythematosus, porphyria, or familial Mediterranean fever.

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cardinal manifestations of peritonitis are acute abdominal pain and tenderness, usually with fever. Generalized peritonitis is associated with widespread in fl ammation and di ff use abdominal tenderness, including rebound tenderness. Rigidity of the abdominal wall is common. Bowel sounds are usually absent.  Tachycardia,  hypotension,  and  signs  of  dehydration are common as are leukocytosis and acidosis. If ascites is present, diagnostic paracentesis with cell counts, measurement of protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and culture is essential for diagnosis. In the elderly and immunosuppressed, signs of peritoneal irritation may be muted and therefore more diffi cult to detect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment and Prognosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of peritonitis  consists  of  hydration,  correction  of electrolyte abnormalities, administration of antibiotics, and, if needed, surgical correction of the underlying problem. Mortality rates are less than 10% for uncomplicated peritonitis in otherwise  healthy  persons.  Mortality  rates  of  40%  or  more have been reported in the elderly, those with underlying illnesses,  and  those  in  whom  peritonitis  has  been  present  for longer than 48 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACUTE COLONIC PSEUDO-OBSTRUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  colonic  pseudo-obstruction is  a  form  of  colonic  ileus characterized by massive dilation of the colon in the absence of  mechanical  obstruction. Th e  disorder  is  characterized  by loss of e ff ective colonic peristalsis and subsequent distention of the colon. Th is syndrome generally develops in seriously ill patients hospitalized for signi fi cant medical problems. Typically  such  patients  have  electrolyte  disorders,  are  immobile, or have received narcotic or anticholinergic medications. Th e disorder can also be observed in surgical patients a ft er a variety of non-GI operations. If le ft untreated, the massive colonic dilation can result in ischemia of the right colon and cecum, and perforation. One current hypothesis as to the etiology of colonic  pseudo-obstruction  invokes  an  imbalance  in  neural input to the colon distal to the splenic fl exure. It suggests an excess of sympathetic stimulation and a paucity of parasympathetic  input,  therefore  resulting  in  spastic  contraction  of the distal colon and functional obstruction. Plain radiographs of  the  abdomen reveal dilation of the proximal colon and a decompressed distal colon with some air in the rectosigmoid region. For patients in whom the cecal diameter is less than 12 cm (the risk of perforation is much greater if the cecal diameter  exceeds  12  cm),  an  initial  trial  of  conservative  therapy is  indicated that includes correction of electrolyte disorders, avoidance of narcotic  and  anticholinergic  agents,  hydration, mobilization, tap water enemas, and nasogastric suction. Th e 70% of cases that will resolve with conservative therapy do so within 2 days, which suggests that a 48-hour trial of conservative management is warranted in patients in stable condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
However, patients for whom conservative therapy fails should be  considered  for  active  intervention. Th is  could  include intravenous administration of neostigmine. Intravenous neostigmine at a dose of 2 to 2.5 mg given over 3 to 5 minutes results in immediate colonic decompression in 80% to 90% of patients.  Because  symptomatic  bradycardia  is  a  serious  side e ff ect of neostigmine administration, all patients being treated with  this  drug  require  cardiac  monitoring.  Decompressive colonoscopy  or  placement  of  a  cecostomy  are  other  active interventions that may be needed.
