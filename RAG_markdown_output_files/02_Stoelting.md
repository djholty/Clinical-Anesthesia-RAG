Th e prevalence of valvular heart disease in the United States is  currently around 2.5% and is expected to increase signi fi -cantly  with  the  aging  of  the  population. Th is  form  of  heart disease  continues  to  be  an  important  cause  of  perioperative morbidity and mortality. In the past 25 years there have been major advances in understanding the natural history of valvular heart disease and in improving cardiac function in patients with valvular disorders. Th e development of better noninvasive  methods  of  monitoring  ventricular  function,  improved prosthetic heart valves, and better techniques for valve reconstruction as well as the formulation of guidelines for selecting the  proper  timing  for  surgical  intervention  have  resulted  in better outcomes in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Valvular  heart  disease  places  a  hemodynamic  burden  on the  le ft and/or  right  ventricle  that  is  initially  tolerated  as  a result of various compensations of the cardiovascular system. However, hemodynamic overload eventually leads to cardiac muscle dysfunction, congestive heart failure (CHF), or even sudden  death.  Management  of  patients  with  valvular  heart disease  during  the  perioperative  period  requires  an  understanding of the hemodynamic alterations that accompany valvular dysfunction. Th e  most frequently encountered cardiac valve lesions produce pressure overload (mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis) or volume overload (mitral regurgitation, aortic regurgitation) on the le ft atrium or le ft ventricle. Anesthetic management during the perioperative period is based on the likely e ff ects of drug-induced changes in cardiac rhythm and rate,  preload,  a ft erload,  myocardial  contractility,  systemic blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulmonary vascular resistance relative to the pathophysiology of the speci fi c valvular lesion.

PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative evaluation of patients with valvular heart disease includes assessment of (1) the severity of the cardiac disease, (2) the degree of impaired myocardial contractility, and (3) the presence of associated major organ system disease. Recognition  of  compensatory  mechanisms  for  maintaining  cardiac

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
output such as increased sympathetic nervous system activity and cardiac hypertrophy as well as consideration of current drug therapy are important. Th e presence of a prosthetic heart valve  introduces  special  considerations  in  the  preoperative evaluation, especially if noncardiac surgery is planned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
History and Physical Examination

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Questions designed to de fi ne exercise tolerance are necessary to  evaluate  cardiac  reserve  in  the  presence  of  valvular  heart disease  and  to  provide  a  functional  classi fi cation  according to  the  criteria  established  by  the  New  Y ork  Heart  Association (Table 2-1). When myocardial contractility is impaired, patients complain of dyspnea, orthopnea, and easy fatigability. A compensatory increase in sympathetic nervous system activity  may  manifest  as  anxiety,  diaphoresis,  and  resting tachycardia. CHF is a frequent companion of chronic valvular heart disease, and its presence is detected by noting basilar chest rales, jugular venous distention, and a third heart sound. Typically, elective surgery is deferred until CHF can be treated and myocardial contractility optimized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disease of a cardiac valve rarely occurs without an accompanying  murmur,  re fl ecting turbulent  blood fl ow  across the valve. Th e  character, location, intensity, and direction of radiation of a heart murmur provide clues to the location and severity of the valvular lesion. During systole, the aortic and pulmonic valves are open, and the mitral and tricuspid valves are  closed. Th erefore,  a  heart  murmur  that  occurs  during systole is due to stenosis of the aortic or pulmonic valves or incompetence of the mitral or tricuspid valves. During diastole, the aortic and pulmonic valves are closed, and the mitral and  tricuspid  valves  are  open. Th erefore,  a  diastolic  heart murmur is due to stenosis of the mitral or tricuspid valves or incompetence of the aortic or pulmonic valves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  dysrhythmias  are  seen  with  all  types  of  valvular heart  disease.  Atrial fi brillation  is  common,  especially  with mitral  valve  disease  associated  with  le ft atrial  enlargement. Atrial fi brillation may be paroxysmal or chronic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angina pectoris  may  occur  in  patients  with  valvular  heart disease even in the absence of coronary artery disease. It usually re fl ects increased myocardial oxygen demand due to ventricular hypertrophy. Th e demands of this thickened muscle mass may exceed the ability  of  even  normal  coronary  arteries  to  deliver adequate amounts of oxygen. Valvular heart disease and ischemic heart disease frequently co-exist. Fi ft y percent of patients with aortic stenosis who are older than 50 years of age have associated ischemic heart disease. Th e presence of coronary artery disease in patients with mitral or aortic valve disease worsens the longterm prognosis, and mitral regurgitation due to ischemic heart disease is associated with an increased mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug Therapy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Modern drug therapy for valvular heart disease  may  include β -blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digitalis for heart rate control; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and vasodilators  to  control  blood  pressure  and  a ft erload;  and  diuretics, inotropes, and vasodilators as needed to control heart failure. Antidysrhythmic therapy may also be necessary. Certain cardiac lesions such as aortic and mitral stenosis require a slow heart rate to prolong the duration of diastole and improve le ft ventricular fi lling  and coronary blood fl ow. Th e  regurgitant valvular lesions such as aortic and mitral regurgitation require a ft erload reduction and a somewhat faster heart rate to shorten the time for  regurgitation.  Atrial fi brillation  requires  a  controlled  ventricular response so that activation of the sympathetic nervous system, as during tracheal intubation or in response to surgical stimulation, does not cause su ffi cient tachycardia to signi fi -cantly decrease diastolic fi lling time and stroke volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory Data

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  o ft en  exhibits  characteristic changes due to valvular heart disease. Broad and notched P waves (P mitrale) suggest the presence of le ft atrial  enlargement typical of mitral valve disease. Le ft and right ventricular  hypertrophy can be diagnosed by the presence of le ft or right  axis  deviation  and  high  voltage.  Other  common  ECG fi ndings include dysrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and evidence of active ischemia or previous myocardial infarction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e size and shape of the heart and great vessels and pulmonary vascular markings can be evaluated by chest radiography. On  a  posteroanterior  chest  radiograph  cardiomegaly  can  be established if the heart size exceeds 50% of the internal width of the thoracic cage. Abnormalities of the pulmonary artery, le ft atrium, and le ft ventricle can be noted along the le ft heart border, and right atrial and right ventricular enlargement along the right heart border. Enlargement of the le ft atrium can result in elevation of the le ft mainstem bronchus. Valvular calci fi cations may be identi fi ed. Vascular markings in the peripheral lung fi elds are sparse in the presence of signi fi cant pulmonary hypertension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography  with  color fl ow  Doppler  imaging  is essential for noninvasive evaluation of valvular heart disease (Table 2-2). It is particularly useful in evaluating the signi fi -cance of cardiac murmurs such as systolic ejection murmurs when aortic stenosis is suspected and in detecting the presence of mitral stenosis. It permits determination of cardiac anatomy and  function,  presence  of  hypertrophy,  cavity  dimensions, valve  area,  transvalvular  pressure  gradients,  and  the  magnitude of valvular regurgitation.

Cardiac catheterization can provide information about the presence and severity of valvular stenosis and/or regurgitation, coronary  artery  disease,  and  intracardiac  shunting  and  can help  resolve  discrepancies  between  clinical  and  echocardiographic fi ndings. Transvalvular pressure gradients determined at the time of cardiac catheterization indicate the severity of the valvular heart disease. Mitral and aortic stenosis are considered to be severe when transvalvular pressure gradients are more than 10 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg, respectively. However, when  CHF  accompanies  aortic  stenosis,  transvalvular  pressure gradients may be smaller because of the inability of the dysfunctional le ft ventricular muscle to generate a large gradient. In patients with mitral stenosis or mitral regurgitation, measurement  of  pulmonary  artery  pressure  and  right  ventricular fi lling  pressure  may  provide  evidence  of  pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Presence of Prosthetic Heart Valves

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prosthetic  heart  valves  may  be  mechanical  or  bioprosthetic. Mechanical valves are composed primarily of metal or carbon alloys and are classi fi ed according to their structure, such as caged-ball,  single  tilting-disk,  or  bilea fl et  tilting-disk  valves. Bioprostheses  may  be  heterogra ft s,  composed  of  porcine  or bovine  tissues  mounted  on  metal  supports,  or  homogra ft s, which are preserved human aortic valves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prosthetic  valves  di ff er  from  one  another  with  regard to  durability,  thrombogenicity,  and  hemodynamic  pro fi le. Mechanical valves are very durable, lasting at least 20 to 30 years, whereas bioprosthetic valves last about 10 to 15 years. Mechanical valves are highly thrombogenic and require longterm anticoagulation. Because bioprosthetic valves have a low thrombogenic  potential,  long-term  anticoagulation  o ft en  is not necessary. Mechanical valves are preferred in patients who are young, have a life expectancy of more than 10 to 15 years, or require long-term anticoagulation therapy for another reason,  such  as  atrial fi brillation.  Bioprosthetic  valves  are  preferred  in  elderly  patients  and  in  those  who  cannot  tolerate anticoagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ASSESSMENT OF PROSTHETIC HEART VALVE FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prosthetic heart valve dysfunction is suggested by a change in the intensity or quality of prosthetic valve clicks, the appearance of a new murmur, or a change in the characteristics of an

<!-- PAGE=? -->
existing murmur. Transthoracic echocardiography can be used to assess sewing ring stability and lea fl et motion of bioprosthetic valves, but mechanical valves may be di ffi cult to evaluate with this method because of echo reverberations from the metal. Transesophageal echocardiography may provide higherresolution images, especially of a prosthetic valve in the mitral position.  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  can  be  used  if  prosthetic valve regurgitation or a paravalvular leak is suspected but  not  adequately  visualized  by  echocardiography.  Cardiac catheterization  permits  measurement  of  transvalvular  pressure gradients and e ff ective valve area of bioprosthetic valves.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROSTHETIC HEART VALVES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prosthetic  heart  valves  can  be  associated  with  signi fi cant complications whose presence should be considered during the preoperative evaluation (Table 2-3). Because of the risk of  thromboembolism,  patients  with  mechanical  prosthetic heart  valves  require  long-term  anticoagulant  therapy.  Subclinical intravascular hemolysis, evidenced by an increased serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration, decreased serum  haptoglobin  concentration,  and  reticulocytosis,  is noted in many patients with normally functioning mechanical  heart  valves. Th e  incidence  of  pigmented  gallstones  is increased in patients with prosthetic heart valves, presumably as a result of chronic low-grade intravascular hemolysis. Severe hemolytic anemia is uncommon, and its presence usually indicates valvular dysfunction or endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary to decrease the perioperative risk of infective endocarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANTICOAGULATION IN PATIENTS WITH PROSTHETIC HEART VALVES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients may need to discontinue anticoagulation before surgery. However, this temporary discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy puts patients with mechanical heart valves or atrial fi brillation at risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism due to a rebound hypercoagulable state and to the prothrombotic e ff ects of surgery. Th e risk of thromboembolism is estimated to be about 5% to 8%. Anticoagulation may be continued in patients  with  prosthetic  heart  valves  who  are  scheduled  for minor surgery in which blood loss is expected to be minimal. When major surgery is planned, however, warfarin is typically discontinued 3 to 5 days preoperatively. Intravenous unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin is administered a ft er discontinuation of warfarin and

<!-- PAGE=? -->
34

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
continued until the day before or the day of surgery. Th e heparin can be restarted postoperatively when the risk of bleeding has lessened and can be continued until e ff ective anticoagulation is again achieved with oral therapy. When possible, elective surgery should be avoided in the fi rst month a ft er an acute episode of arterial or venous thromboembolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticoagulant therapy is particularly important in parturients  with  prosthetic  heart  valves,  because  the  incidence  of arterial  embolization  is  greatly  increased  during  pregnancy. However,  warfarin  administration  during  the fi rst  trimester can be associated with fetal defects and fetal death. Th erefore, warfarin is discontinued during pregnancy and subcutaneous standard  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin  is  administered until delivery. Low-dose aspirin therapy is safe for the mother and fetus  and  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  heparin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prevention of Bacterial Endocarditis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  American  Heart  Association  (AHA)  has  made  recommendations  for  prevention  of  infective  endocarditis  for  the past half-century. Th e most recent Guidelines for the Prevention of Infective Endocarditis (2007) represent a radical departure  from  prior  recommendations  and  dramatically  reduce the indications for antibiotic prophylaxis. Th ese guidelines are based  on  the  best  available  evidence  regarding  this  medical problem. Current scienti fi c data suggest that infective endocarditis is more likely to result from frequent exposure to bacteremia associated with daily activities than from bacteremia associated with dental, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary tract procedures. For example, maintenance of good oral health and oral hygiene reduces bacteremia associated with normal daily activities (chewing, teeth brushing, fl ossing, use of toothpicks, etc.)  and  is  more  important  than  prophylactic  antibiotics  in reducing  the  risk  of  endocarditis.  Endocarditis  prophylaxis may prevent an exceedingly small number of cases of endocarditis, if any, in at-risk patients. It also appears that the risk of antibiotic-associated adverse events exceeds the bene fi ts of endocarditis prophylaxis overall and that the common use of antibiotic prophylaxis promotes the emergence of antibioticresistant organisms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Experts feel that infective endocarditis prophylaxis should be administered not to individuals with a high cumulative lifetime risk of contracting endocarditis but rather to individuals at highest risk of adverse outcomes if they develop endocarditis. It appears that only a very small group of patients with heart disease are likely to have the most severe forms and complications of endocarditis. Th e conditions associated with this high risk  are  listed  in  Table  2-4. Th e  new  AHA guidelines target endocarditis prophylaxis only to patients with these conditions. Th e  recommendations regarding which antibiotic to use for endocarditis  prophylaxis  are  not  dissimilar  from  previous recommendations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In summary, the major changes in the updated AHA guidelines for infective endocarditis prophylaxis are these: (1) Antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis is recommended

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MITRAL STENOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most common cause of mitral stenosis is rheumatic heart disease. Th e incidence of rheumatic fever in developed countries is very low, but the disease continues to be common in developing countries. Mitral stenosis primarily a ff ects females. Di ff use thickening of the mitral lea fl ets and subvalvular apparatus,  commissural  fusion,  and  calci fi cation  of  the  annulus and lea fl ets are typically present. Th is  process occurs slowly, and  many  patients  do  not  become  symptomatic  for  20  to 30  years  a ft er  the  initial  episode  of  rheumatic  fever.  Over time, the mitral valve becomes stenotic, and CHF, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular failure may develop.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Much less common causes of mitral stenosis include carcinoid  syndrome,  le ft atrial  myxoma,  severe  mitral  annular calci fi cation, endocarditis, cor triatriatum, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, congenital mitral stenosis, and iatrogenic mitral stenosis a ft er mitral valve repair. Patients with  mitral  stenosis  typically  exhibit  dyspnea  on  exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea as a result of high le ft atrial pressure. Le ft ventricular contractility is usually

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 2 VALVULAR HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
normal. Rheumatic heart disease presents as isolated  mitral stenosis in about 40% of patients. If aortic and/or mitral regurgitation accompany mitral stenosis, there is o ft en evidence of le ft ventricular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e normal mitral valve ori fi ce area is 4 to 6 cm 2 . Mitral stenosis is characterized by mechanical obstruction to le ft ventricular diastolic fi lling secondary to a progressive decrease in the size of the mitral valve ori fi ce. Th is valvular obstruction produces an increase in le ft atrial volume and pressure. With mild mitral stenosis, le ft ventricular fi lling and stroke volume are maintained at rest by an increase in le ft atrial  pressure. However, stroke volume will decrease during stress-induced tachycardia or when e ff ective atrial contraction is lost, as with atrial fi brillation.  Symptoms  usually  develop  when  mitral valve area is less than 1.5 cm 2 . As the disease progresses the pulmonary venous pressure is increased in association with the increase in le ft atrial pressure. Th e result is transudation of fl uid into the pulmonary interstitial space, decreased pulmonary compliance, and increased work of breathing, which leads to progressive dyspnea on exertion. Overt pulmonary edema is likely when the pulmonary venous pressure exceeds plasma oncotic pressure. If the increase in le ft atrial pressure is gradual, there is an increase in lymphatic drainage from the lungs  and  thickening  of  the  capillary  basement  membrane that  enables  patients  to  tolerate  an  increased  pulmonary venous pressure without development of pulmonary edema. Over  time  changes  in  the  pulmonary  vasculature  result  in pulmonary  hypertension,  and  eventually  right-sided  heart failure  may  occur.  Le ft ventricular  function  is  usually  preserved.  Episodes  of  pulmonary  edema  typically  occur  with atrial fi brillation, sepsis, pain, and pregnancy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography is used to assess the anatomy of the mitral valve, including the degree of lea fl et thickening, calci fi cation, changes  in  mobility,  and  extent  of  involvement  of  the  subvalvular apparatus. Th e severity of mitral stenosis is assessed by  calculation  of  mitral  valve  area  and  measurement  of  the transvalvular pressure gradient. Echocardiography also allows evaluation of cardiac chamber dimensions, pulmonary hypertension, le ft and right ventricular function, and other valvular disease, and examination of the le ft atrial  appendage for the presence or absence of thrombus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with mitral stenosis usually become symptomatic when the size of the mitral valve ori fi ce has decreased at least 50%. When the mitral valve area is less than 1 cm 2 , a mean atrial  pressure  of  about  25  mm Hg is necessary to maintain adequate  le ft ventricular fi lling  and  resting  cardiac  output. Pulmonary hypertension is likely if the le ft atrial  pressure is above 25 mm Hg over the long term. When the mitral transvalvular pressure gradient is higher than 10 mm Hg (normal value is <5 mm Hg), it is likely that mitral stenosis is severe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When mitral stenosis is severe, any additional stress such as fever or sepsis may precipitate pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinically,  mitral  stenosis  is  recognized  by  the  characteristic  opening  snap  that  occurs  early  in  diastole  and  by  a rumbling diastolic heart murmur best heard at the apex or in the le ft axilla. Vibrations set in motion by the opening of the mobile but stenosed valve cause the opening snap. Calci fi cation  of  the  valve  and  greatly  reduced  lea fl et  mobility  result in disappearance of the opening snap. Le ft atrial enlargement is  o ft en visible on chest radiographs as straightening of the le ft heart border and elevation of the le ft mainstem bronchus. Th e  "double  density"  of  an  enlarged  le ft atrium,  mitral  calci fi cation, and evidence of pulmonary edema or pulmonary vascular congestion may also be seen. Broad notched P waves on the ECG suggest le ft atrial enlargement. Atrial fi brillation is  present  in  about  one  third  of  patients  with  severe  mitral stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stasis  of  blood  in  the  distended  le ft atrium  predisposes patients with mitral stenosis to a higher risk of systemic thromboembolism. Venous thrombosis is also more likely because of the decreased physical activity of these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  symptoms  of  mild  mitral  stenosis  develop,  diuretics can decrease the le ft atrial pressure and relieve symptoms. If atrial fi brillation  occurs,  heart  rate  control  may  be  achieved with digoxin, β -blockers, calcium channel blockers, or a combination  of  these  medications.  Control  of  the  heart  rate  is critical because tachycardia impairs le ft ventricular fi lling and increases  le ft atrial  pressure.  Anticoagulation  is  required  in patients with mitral stenosis and atrial fi brillation, because the risk of embolic stroke in such patients is about 7% to 15% per year.  Warfarin is  administered to a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 to 3.0. Surgical correction of mitral stenosis is indicated when symptoms worsen and pulmonary hypertension develops.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral stenosis can sometimes be corrected by percutaneous balloon valvotomy. If heavy valvular calci fi cation or valve deformity is present, surgical commissurotomy, valve reconstruction, or valve replacement is performed. In patients with concomitant severe tricuspid regurgitation (due to pulmonary hypertension),  tricuspid  valvuloplasty  or  ring  annuloplasty can be performed together with the mitral valve surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with mitral stenosis includes prevention and treatment of events that can decrease cardiac output or produce pulmonary edema (Table 2-5). Th e development of atrial fi brillation with a rapid ventricular response signi fi cantly decreases cardiac output and can produce pulmonary edema. Treatment consists of cardioversion or intravenous administration of amiodarone, β -blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin. Excessive perioperative fl uid administration, placement in Trendelenburg's position, or

Hypoxemia and hypercarbia that may exacerbate pulmonary hypertension and evoke right ventricular failure autotransfusion via uterine contraction increases central blood volume and can precipitate CHF. In patients with severe mitral stenosis, a sudden decrease in systemic vascular resistance may not be tolerated, because the normal response to hypotensionthat is, a re fl ex increase in heart rate-itself decreases cardiac output. If necessary, systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance can be maintained with vasoconstrictor drugs such as phenylephrine. Use of vasopressin may also be considered since it has minimal e ff ect on pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary  hypertension  and  right  ventricular  failure  may be  precipitated  by  numerous  factors,  including  hypercarbia, hypoxemia, lung hyperin fl ation, and an increase in lung water. Right  ventricular  failure  may  require  support  with  inotropic and pulmonary vasodilating drugs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE MEDICATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative medication can be used to decrease anxiety and its associated tachycardia, but it must be appreciated that patients with mitral stenosis may be more susceptible than normal patients to the ventilatory-depressant e ff ects of these drugs. Preoperative administration of anticholinergics is not recommended, because the resultant tachycardia will be poorly tolerated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drugs used for heart rate control should be continued until the  time  of  surgery.  Diuretic-induced  hypokalemia  can  be detected and treated preoperatively. Orthostatic hypotension may be evidence of diuretic-induced hypovolemia. It may be acceptable to continue anticoagulant therapy for minor surgery, but major surgery associated with signi fi cant blood loss requires discontinuation of anticoagulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neuroaxial  anesthesia  is  an  acceptable  technique  in  the absence  of  anticoagulation.  Other  regional  techniques  such as  peripheral  nerve  blocks  may  also  be  used  safely. Th e American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) evidence-based guidelines on regional anesthesia in the patient receiving anticoagulation or thrombolytic therapy (third edition) should be followed as needed. Use of neuroaxial anesthesia requires measures to avoid hypotension, maintain adequate preload, and avoid tachycardia. Compared with spinal anesthesia, epidural anesthesia may allow better control of the level of sympathectomy and reduction in blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  of  general  anesthesia  can  be  achieved  using  any intravenous induction drug with the exception of ketamine, which should be avoided because of its propensity to increase the  heart  rate.  Tracheal  intubation  and  muscle  relaxation should be accomplished by administration of neuromuscular blockers  that  do  not  induce  either  tachycardia  or  hypotension from histamine release. Short-acting β -blockers may be necessary to treat  episodes  of  tachycardia  during  induction. Cardioversion to treat new-onset atrial fi brillation with hemodynamic instability may be needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia is best accomplished using drugs with  minimal  e ff ects  on  heart  rate,  myocardial  contractility,  and  systemic  and  pulmonary  vascular  resistance.  O ft en a  nitrous/narcotic  anesthetic  or  a  balanced  anesthetic  that includes  a  low  concentration  of  a  volatile  anesthetic  can achieve this goal. Nitrous oxide can evoke some pulmonary vasoconstriction and increase pulmonary vascular resistance if pulmonary hypertension is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic  reversal  of  the  e ff ects  of  nondepolarizing muscle relaxants should be accomplished slowly to help ameliorate any drug-induced tachycardia caused by the anticholinergic drug in the mixture. Light anesthesia and/or surgical stimulation can result in sympathetic stimulation producing tachycardia and systemic and pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vasodilator therapy may be necessary if pulmonary hypertension is severe. Intraoperative fl uid replacement must be carefully titrated, because these patients are very susceptible to volume overload and development of pulmonary edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Use of invasive monitoring depends on the complexity of the operative procedure and the magnitude of physiologic impairment caused by the mitral stenosis. Monitoring of asymptomatic patients without evidence of pulmonary congestion need be no di ff erent from monitoring of patients without valvular heart  disease.  On  the  other  hand,  transesophageal  echocardiography can be useful in patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis  undergoing  major  surgery,  especially  if  signi fi cant blood loss is expected. Continuous monitoring of intraarterial pressure,  pulmonary artery pressure, and le ft atrial  pressure (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) should be considered. Such monitoring helps con fi rm the adequacy of cardiac function,  intravascular fl uid  volume,  ventilation,  and  oxygenation. Patients with signi fi cant pulmonary hypertension are at greater risk of pulmonary artery rupture from manipulation of a pulmonary artery catheter, so measurement of pulmonary artery  occlusion  pressure  should  be  done  infrequently  and very carefully.

POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with mitral stenosis, the risk of pulmonary edema and right heart failure continues into the postoperative period, so  cardiovascular  monitoring  should  continue  as  well.  Pain and hypoventilation with subsequent respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia may be responsible for increasing heart rate and pulmonary vascular resistance. Decreased pulmonary compliance and increased work of breathing may necessitate a period

of mechanical ventilation, particularly a ft er major thoracic or abdominal surgery. Relief of postoperative pain with neuroaxial opioids can be very useful in selected patients. Anticoagulation therapy should be restarted as soon as the risk of perioperative bleeding has diminished.

MITRAL REGURGITATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral regurgitation due to rheumatic fever is usually associated with some degree of mitral stenosis. Isolated mitral regurgitation can be associated with ischemic heart disease or result from papillary muscle dysfunction, mitral annular dilation, or rupture of chordae tendineae. Other causes of mitral regurgitation  include  endocarditis,  mitral  valve  prolapse,  trauma, congenital  heart  disease  (such  as  an  endocardial  cushion defect), le ft ventricular hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, myxomatous degeneration, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and carcinoid syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e basic hemodynamic derangement in mitral regurgitation is  a  decrease  in  forward  le ft ventricular  stroke  volume  and cardiac  output.  A  portion  of  every  stroke  volume  is  regurgitated  through  the  incompetent  mitral  valve  back  into  the le ft atrium,  which  results  in  le ft atrial  volume  overload  and pulmonary  congestion.  Patients  with  a  regurgitant  fraction of more than 0.6 are considered to have severe mitral regurgitation. Th e  fraction  of  le ft ventricular  stroke  volume  that regurgitates into the le ft atrium depends on (1) the size of the mitral valve ori fi ce; (2) heart rate, which determines the duration of ventricular ejection; and (3) pressure gradients across the  mitral  valve.  Such  gradients  are  related  to  le ft ventricle compliance and impedance to le ft ventricular ejection into the aorta. Pharmacologic interventions that increase or decrease systemic vascular resistance have a major impact on the regurgitant fraction in patients with mitral regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with isolated mitral regurgitation are less dependent on properly timed le ft atrial contraction for le ft ventricular fi lling  than  are  patients  with  co-existing  mitral  or  aortic stenosis. Patients with rheumatic fever-induced mitral regurgitation are most likely to exhibit marked le ft atrial  enlargement and atrial fi brillation.  Myocardial  ischemia  as  a  result of  mitral  regurgitation is  uncommon, because the increased le ft ventricular wall tension is quickly dissipated as the stroke volume is rapidly ejected into the aorta and le ft atrium. When mitral regurgitation develops gradually, the volume overload produced by mitral regurgitation transforms the le ft ventricle into a larger, more compliant chamber that is able to deliver a larger stroke volume. Th is  occurs through a dissolution of collagen weave, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, rearrangement  of  myocardial fi bers,  and  addition  of  new  sarcomeres  with  the  development  of  ventricular  hypertrophy. Development of ventricular hypertrophy and increased compliance of the le ft atrium  permit the accommodation of the regurgitant  volume  without  a  major  increase  in  le ft atrial pressure. Th is allows patients to maintain cardiac output and remain free of pulmonary congestion, and to be asymptomatic for many years. Th e combination of mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis results in volume and pressure overload of the le ft atrium and a markedly increased le ft atrial pressure. Atrial fi brillation, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hypertension develop much earlier in these patients than in those with isolated mitral regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  there  has  been  no  time  for  development  of  le ft atrial or le ft ventricular compensation, acute mitral regurgitation presents as pulmonary edema and/or cardiogenic shock.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral  regurgitation  is  recognized  clinically  by  the  presence of a holosystolic apical murmur with radiation to the axilla. Cardiomegaly can also be detected on physical examination. Severe  mitral  regurgitation  can  produce  le ft atrial  and  le ft ventricular hypertrophy detectable on ECG and chest radiograph. Echocardiography con fi rms the presence, severity, and o ft en the cause of the mitral regurgitation. Le ft atrial size and pressure, le ft ventricular wall thickness, cavitary dimensions, ventricular  function,  and  pulmonary  artery  pressure  can  be measured. In addition, the le ft atrial appendage can be evaluated for the presence of thrombus. Many methods exist to determine the severity of mitral regurgitation. Th ese include color fl ow and pulsed wave Doppler echocardiographic examination of the mitral valve with calculation of regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction and measurement of the area of the regurgitant jet. Th e presence of a V wave in a pulmonary artery occlusion pressure waveform re fl ects  regurgitant fl ow through the mitral valve, and the size of this V wave correlates with the magnitude of the mitral regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If the severity of mitral regurgitation is in doubt or mitral valve  surgery  is  planned,  cardiac  catheterization,  including coronary angiography, is necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unlike stenotic valve lesions, regurgitant cardiac valve lesions o ft en progress insidiously, causing le ft ventricular damage and remodeling  before  symptoms  have  developed.  Early  surgery may be warranted to prevent le ft ventricular muscle dysfunction from becoming severe or irreversible. Survival may be prolonged if surgery is performed before the ejection fraction is less than 60% or before the le ft ventricle is unable to contract to an end-systolic dimension of 45 mm (normal <40 mm). Patients with an ejection fraction of less than 30% or a le ft ventricular end-systolic dimension of more than 55 mm do not experience improvement with mitral valve surgery. Symptomatic patients should undergo mitral valve surgery even if the ejection fraction is normal. Mitral valve repair, if possible, is preferred to mitral valve replacement because it restores valve competence, maintains the functional aspects of the mitral valve apparatus, and avoids insertion of a prosthesis. Th e mitral valve apparatus is very important in supporting le ft ventricular function. Th e

Prevent increases in systemic vascular resistance Minimize drug-induced myocardial depression Monitor the magnitude of regurgitant flow with a pulmonary artery catheter (size of the V wave) and/or echocardiography absence of the subvalvular apparatus causes distortion of le ft ventricular contractile geometry and impairment of le ft ventricular ejection. In patients in whom the valve and its apparatus cannot be preserved, valve replacement is done, but there is a postoperative decline in le ft ventricular ejection fraction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although vasodilators are useful in the medical management of acute mitral regurgitation, there is no apparent bene fi t to long-term use of these drugs in asymptomatic patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. For symptomatic patients, angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors  or β -blockers  (particularly carvedilol) and biventricular pacing have all been shown to decrease functional mitral regurgitation and improve symptoms and exercise tolerance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with mitral regurgitation includes prevention and treatment of events that may further decrease cardiac output (Table 2-6). Th e goal is to improve forward le ft ventricular stroke volume and decrease the regurgitant fraction. Maintenance of a normal to slightly increased heart rate is recommended. Bradycardia may result in severe le ft ventricular volume overload. Increases in  systemic  vascular  resistance  can  also  cause  decompensation of the le ft ventricle. A ft erload reduction with a vasodilator drug such as nitroprusside with or without an inotropic drug will improve le ft ventricular function. In most patients, cardiac output can be maintained or improved with modest increases in heart rate and modest decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Th e decrease in systemic vascular resistance caused by regional anesthesia may be bene fi cial in some patients. Preoperative sedation and anticholinergics are usually well tolerated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia can be achieved with an intravenous induction  drug.  Dosing  should  be  adjusted  to  prevent  an increase in systemic vascular resistance or a decrease in heart rate, because both of these hemodynamic changes reduce cardiac output. Selection of a muscle relaxant should follow the same principles. Pancuronium produces a modest increase in heart  rate,  which  can  contribute  to  maintenance  of  forward le ft ventricular stroke volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volatile  anesthetics  can  be  administered  to  attenuate  the undesirable increases in systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance that can accompany surgical stimulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e increase in heart rate and decrease in systemic vascular resistance plus the minimal negative inotropic e ff ects associated with iso fl urane, des fl urane, and sevo fl urane make them all  acceptable  choices  for  maintenance  of  anesthesia.  When myocardial  function  is  severely  compromised,  use  of  an opioid-based anesthetic is another option because of the minimal myocardial depression that opioids produce. However, potent narcotics can produce signi fi cant bradycardia, and this would  be  very  deleterious  in  the  presence  of  severe  mitral regurgitation.  Mechanical  ventilation  should  be  adjusted to  maintain  near-normal  values  on  acid-base  and  respiratory  parameters. Th e  pattern  of  ventilation  must  provide su ffi cient  time  between breaths for adequate venous return. Maintenance  of  intravascular fl uid  volume  is  very  important for maintaining le ft ventricular volume and cardiac output.  Neuraxial  techniques will result  in  a ft erload reduction, decreasing the regurgitant volume. Other regional techniques are also considered safe for these patients. ASRA guidelines for  regional  anesthesia  in  patients  receiving  anticoagulation therapy should be followed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthesia for surgery in patients with asymptomatic mitral regurgitation  does  not  require  invasive  monitoring.  However, in the presence of severe mitral regurgitation, the use of invasive monitoring is helpful for detecting the adequacy of cardiac output and the hemodynamic response to anesthetic and vasodilating drugs and for facilitating intravenous fl uid replacement. Mitral regurgitation produces a V wave on the pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure  waveform.  Changes in V wave amplitude can assist in estimating the magnitude and direction of changes in the degree of mitral regurgitation. However, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure may be a poor measure  of  le ft ventricular  end-diastolic  volume  in  patients with chronic mitral regurgitation. With acute mitral regurgitation, the le ft atrium is less compliant, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure does correlate with le ft atrial and le ft ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Transesophageal echocardiography is another useful technique for monitoring mitral valve and le ft ventricular function during major surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mitral  valve  prolapse  (MVP)  is  de fi ned  as  the  prolapse  of one or both mitral lea fl ets into the le ft atrium during systole with or without mitral regurgitation. It is associated with the auscultatory fi ndings of a midsystolic click and a late systolic murmur. MVP is the most common form of valvular heart disease, a ff ecting 1% to 2.5% of the U.S. population. It is more common in young women. MVP can be associated with Marfan's syndrome, rheumatic carditis, myocarditis, thyrotoxicosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although it is usually a benign condition, MVP can have devastating complications such as cerebral embolic events, infective endocarditis, severe mitral  regurgitation  requiring  surgery,  dysrhythmias,  and sudden death. Patients with MVP and abnormal mitral valve

<!-- PAGE=? -->
morphology appear to be the subset of patients at risk for these complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  de fi nitive  diagnosis  of  MVP  is  based  on  echocardiographic fi ndings.  It  has  been  de fi ned  as  valve  prolapse  of 2 mm or more above the mitral annulus. MVP can occur with or without lea fl et thickening and with or without mitral regurgitation. Patients with redundant and thickened lea fl ets have a primary (anatomic) form of MVP. Th is form of MVP typically occurs in patients with connective tissue diseases or in elderly men. Patients with mild bowing and normal-appearing leaflets have a normal variant (functional) form of MVP , and their risk of adverse events is probably no di ff erent from that of the general population.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  MVP  may  experience  anxiety,  orthostatic symptoms,  palpitations,  dyspnea,  fatigue  and  atypical  chest pain.  Cardiac dysrhythmias, both supraventricular and ventricular,  may  occur  and  respond  well  to β -blocker  therapy. Cardiac conduction abnormalities are not uncommon.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with  MVP  follows  the  same  principles  outlined  earlier  for patients with mitral regurgitation. Management is in fl uenced primarily by the degree of mitral regurgitation. Interestingly, the degree of MVP can be a ff ected by le ft ventricular dimensions  and  is  more  dynamic  than  mitral  valvular  disease. A larger  ventricle  will  o ft en  have  less  prolapse  (and  regurgitation) than a smaller ventricle. So events that a ff ect how much  the  le ft ventricle fi lls  or  empties  with  each  cardiac cycle will a ff ect the amount of mitral regurgitation. Perioperative events that enhance le ft ventricular emptying include (1) increased sympathetic activity that increases myocardial contractility, (2) decreased systemic vascular resistance, and (3) assumption of the upright posture. Hypovolemia reduces le ft ventricular fi lling. Events  that decrease le ft ventricular emptying and increase le ft ventricular volume may decrease the degree of MVP. Th ese include hypertension or vasoconstriction, drug-induced myocardial depression, and volume resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  symptoms,  the fi nding  of  a  systolic  click and  murmur  does  not  warrant  a  preoperative  cardiologic consultation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative  evaluation  of  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of MVP  should  focus  on  distinguishing  patients  with  purely functional disease from those with signi fi cant mitral regurgitation. Functional MVP is most o ft en present in women younger than 45 years of age. Some patients may be taking β -blockers to control dysrhythmias, and these drugs should be continued throughout the perioperative period. Patients with a history of transient neurologic events who are in sinus rhythm with no atrial thrombi are likely to be taking daily aspirin therapy (81 to 325 mg/day), whereas patients with atrial fi brillation and/or le ft atrial thrombis and/or previous stroke are likely to be taking warfarin. Although the ECG frequently shows premature ventricular contractions, repolarization abnormalities, and QT interval prolongation, there is no evidence that these fi ndings predict or are associated with adverse intraoperative events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Older men with an anatomic form of MVP can have symptoms  of  mild  to  moderate  CHF,  including  exercise  intolerance,  orthopnea,  and  dyspnea  on  exertion. Th ese  patients may be taking diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.  Physical  examination  o ft en  reveals  a  midsystolic to holosystolic murmur, an S 3 gallop, and signs of pulmonary congestion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SELECTION OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients with MVP have normal le ft ventricular function and tolerate all forms of general and regional anesthesia. Volatile  anesthetic-induced  myocardial  depression  can  be useful for o ff setting the vasodilation that could decrease le ft ventricular volume and increase mitral prolapse and/or regurgitation. Th ere is no contraindication to the use of regional anesthesia  in  patients  with  MVP . Th e  decrease  in  systemic vascular resistance should be anticipated, and administration of fl uids should o ff set any changes in le ft ventricular volume that could a ff ect the degree of prolapse and regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When an intravenous induction drug is selected, the need to avoid a signi fi cant or prolonged decrease in systemic vascular resistance must be considered. Etomidate causes minimal myocardial  depression  and  minimal  alterations  in  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity,  so  it  is  an  attractive  choice for induction of anesthesia in the presence of hemodynamically  signi fi cant  MVP.  Ketamine,  because  of  its  ability  to stimulate  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  and  enhance  le ft ventricular emptying, may cause an increase in prolapse and regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia must minimize sympathetic nervous system activation resulting from painful intraoperative stimuli. Volatile anesthetics combined with nitrous oxide and/ or opioids are useful for attenuating sympathetic nervous system activity,  but  their  doses  must  be  titrated  to  minimize  a signi fi cant decrease in systemic vascular resistance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  hemodynamically  signi fi cant  MVP  may not  tolerate  the  dose-dependent  myocardial  depression  of volatile anesthetics. However, low concentrations (about 0.5 minimum alveolar concentration) of iso fl urane, des fl urane, and  sevo fl urane  can  decrease  the  regurgitant  fraction.  In patients with severe mitral regurgitation, vasodilators such as  nitroprusside  or  nitroglycerin  may  be  carefully  titrated to maximize forward le ft ventricular fl ow and decrease le ft ventricular  end-diastolic  volume  and  le ft atrial  pressure. Th ere are no clinical data to support the use of one muscle

relaxant over another in the presence of isolated MVP, but drug-induced  hemodynamic  alterations  such  as  vagolysis or histamine release deserve consideration when selecting a speci fi c drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unexpected  ventricular  dysrhythmias  can  occur  during anesthesia,  especially  during  operations  performed  with  the patient in the head-up or sitting position. Presumably, in these positions, there is an increase in le ft ventricular emptying and accentuation of valve prolapse. Lidocaine and β -blockers can treat these dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of proper fl uid balance blunts the decrease in venous  return  caused  by  positive  pressure  ventilation.  Proper fl uid balance also helps prevent an increase in the degree of prolapse. If vasopressors are needed, an α -agonist such as phenylephrine is acceptable. Use of an anesthetic technique that includes controlled hypotension would be unwise, because the change in systemic vascular resistance would enhance the degree of MVP .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Routine monitoring is all that is necessary in the majority of patients with MVP. An intraarterial catheter and pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography are needed only in patients with signi fi cant mitral regurgitation and le ft ventricular dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AORTIC STENOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic  stenosis  is  a  common  valvular  lesion  in  the  United States, and its incidence is increasing as the U.S. population grows older. Two factors are associated with development of aortic  stenosis. Th e fi rst  is  degeneration  and  calci fi cation  of the  aortic  lea fl ets  and  subsequent stenosis. Th is  is  a  process of aging. Th e second factor is the presence of a bicuspid rather that a tricuspid aortic valve. Aortic stenosis develops earlier in  life  (30  to  50  years  of  age)  in  individuals  with  a bicuspid aortic valve than in those with a tricuspid aortic valve (60 to 80 years of age). Other causes include rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis. Aortic stenosis is associated with risk factors similar to those of ischemic heart disease, such as systemic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Obstruction  to  ejection  of  blood  into  the  aorta  caused  by  a decrease in the aortic valve area necessitates an increase in le ft ventricular pressure to maintain stroke volume. Th e normal aortic valve area is 2.5 to 3.5 cm 2 . Transvalvular pressure gradients higher than 50 mm Hg and an aortic valve area of less than 0.8 cm 2  are characteristic of severe aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is almost always associated with some degree of aortic regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Angina pectoris may occur in patients with aortic stenosis despite the absence of coronary disease. Th is is due to an increase in myocardial oxygen requirements because of concentric le ft ventricular hypertrophy and the increase in myocardial  work  necessary  to  o ff set  the  a ft erload  produced  by the  stenotic  valve.  In  addition,  myocardial  oxygen  delivery is  decreased  because  of  the  compression  of  subendocardial blood vessels by the increased le ft ventricular pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Since the initial study by Goldman and colleagues in 1977 showing  that  patients  with  aortic  stenosis  had  an  increased risk  of  perioperative  cardiac  complications,  many  studies have  demonstrated  that  patients  with  aortic  stenosis  have an  increased  risk  of  perioperative  mortality  and  of  nonfatal myocardial infarction regardless of the presence or absence of risk factors for coronary artery disease. Th e perioperative risk attributable to aortic stenosis is independent of the risk attributable to coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e origin of syncope in patients with aortic stenosis is controversial but may re fl ect an exercise-induced decrease in  systemic  vascular  resistance  that  remains  uncompensated because cardiac output is limited by the stenotic valve. CHF  can  be  due  to  systolic  and/or  diastolic  dysfunction (Figure 2-1).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FIGURE 2-1 Pathophysiology of aortic stenosis. Left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction results in an increased LV systolic pressure, increased LV ejection time (LVET), increased LV diastolic pressure, and decreased aortic (Ao) pressure. Increased LV systolic pressure with LV volume overload increases LV mass, which may lead to LV dysfunction and failure. Increased LV systolic pressure, LV mass, and LVET increase myocardial O2 consumption. Increased LVET results in a decrease of diastolic time (myocardial perfusion time). Increased LV diastolic pressure and decreased Ao diastolic pressure decrease coronary perfusion pressure. Decreased diastolic time and coronary perfusion pressure decrease myocardial O2 supply. Increased myocardial O2 consumption and decreased myocardial O2 supply produce myocardial ischemia, which causes LV function to deteriorate further. ↑ , Increased; ↓ , decreased.

Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  classic  clinical  symptoms  of critical aortic  stenosis  are angina pectoris, syncope, and dyspnea on exertion, a manifestation  of  CHF. Th e  onset  of  these  symptoms  has  been shown to correlate with an average time to death of 5, 3, and 2 years, respectively. About 75% of symptomatic patients will die within 3 years if they do not have a valve replacement. On physical examination, auscultation reveals a characteristic systolic murmur heard best in the aortic area. Th is murmur may radiate to the neck and mimic a carotid bruit. Because patients with aortic stenosis frequently have concomitant carotid artery disease, this fi nding deserves special attention. Because many patients with aortic stenosis are asymptomatic, it is important to  listen  for  the  systolic  murmur  of  aortic  stenosis  in  older patients scheduled for surgery. Chest radiography may show a prominent ascending aorta due to poststenotic aortic dilation. Th e ECG may demonstrate le ft ventricular hypertrophy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Echocardiography with Doppler examination of the aortic valve provides a more accurate assessment of the severity of aortic stenosis than does clinical evaluation, and patients can be followed echocardiographically to assess the progression of their disease. Findings include identi fi cation of a trilea fl et versus a bilea fl et aortic valve, thickening and calci fi cation of the aortic valve, decreased mobility of the aortic valve leaflets, le ft ventricular hypertrophy, and le ft ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Aortic valve area and transvalvular pressure  gradients  can  be  measured.  Cardiac  catheterization  (and  coronary  angiography)  may  be  necessary  when the  severity  of  aortic  stenosis  cannot  be  determined  by echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Exercise  stress  testing  may  be  an  additional  strategy  to evaluate asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis to identify those with poor exercise tolerance and/or an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise. Patients with exercise-induced  symptoms  might  bene fi t  from  aortic  valve replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis, it appears to be safe to continue medical management and to delay valve replacement  surgery  until  symptoms  develop.  However, there is a small risk of sudden death or rapid progression of symptoms and then sudden death. Mortality approaches 75% within  3  years  a ft er  development  of  critical  aortic  stenosis unless the aortic valve is replaced. Even though most patients with aortic stenosis are elderly, the risks of valve replacement surgery are acceptable unless there are also serious comorbid diseases that can worsen outcome. Aortic valve replacement relieves the symptoms of aortic stenosis dramatically, and the ejection fraction usually increases. Coronary revascularization is o ft en done at the time of aortic valve replacement in patients with both aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous aortic balloon valvotomy has been shown to be bene fi cial in adolescents and young adults with congenital or  rheumatic  aortic  stenosis.  However,  adults  with  acquired aortic stenosis experience only temporary relief of symptoms with this procedure. Balloon valvotomy may occasionally be useful for palliation of aortic stenosis in patients who are not candidates for aortic valve replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  aortic  stenosis  coming  for  noncardiac  surgery are at high risk of major perioperative cardiac complications, and the risk of these complications increases with the complexity of the surgery. Hence, it is important to ascertain the severity of the aortic stenosis preoperatively. Management of anesthesia in patients with aortic stenosis includes the prevention of hypotension and any hemodynamic change that will decrease cardiac output (Table 2-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal  sinus  rhythm  must  be  maintained,  because the  le ft ventricle  is  dependent  on  a  properly  timed  atrial contraction  to  produce  an  optimal  le ft ventricular  enddiastolic  volume.  Loss  of  atrial  contraction,  as  during junctional  rhythm  or  atrial fi brillation,  may  produce  a dramatic  decrease  in  stroke  volume  and  blood  pressure. Th e  heart  rate  is  important  because  it  determines  the time  available  for  ventricular fi lling,  for  ejection  of  the stroke  volume,  and  for  coronary  perfusion.  A  sustained increase  in  heart  rate  decreases  the  time  for  le ft ventricular fi lling  and  ejection  and  reduces  cardiac  output. A decrease in heart rate can cause overdistention of the le ft ventricle.  Hypotension  reduces  coronary  blood fl ow  and results  in  myocardial  ischemia  and  further  deterioration in le ft ventricular function and cardiac output. Aggressive treatment  of  hypotension  is  mandatory  to  prevent  cardiogenic  shock  and/or  cardiac  arrest.  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is not e ff ective in patients with aortic stenosis because it is di ffi cult, if not impossible, to create an adequate stroke  volume  across  a  stenotic  aortic  valve  with  cardiac compression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia is o ft en selected in preference to epidural or spinal anesthesia because the sympathetic blockade produced by regional anesthesia can lead to signi fi cant hypotension.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia can be accomplished with an intravenous induction drug that does not decrease systemic vascular resistance. An opioid induction agent may be useful if le ft ventricular function is compromised. Other good choices

<!-- PAGE=? -->
42

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
include benzodiazepines and etomidate. Ketamine may induce tachycardia and should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maintenance of anesthesia can be accomplished with a combination  of  nitrous  oxide  and  volatile  anesthetic  and  opioids or with opioids alone. Th e primary goal is to maintain systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. Drugs that depress  sinus  node  automaticity  can  produce  junctional rhythm and loss of properly timed atrial contraction, which can  cause  a  signi fi cant  reduction  in  cardiac  output.  If  le ft ventricular function is impaired, it is prudent to avoid any drugs  that  can  cause  additional  depression  of  myocardial contractility.  A  decrease  in  systemic  vascular  resistance is  also  very  undesirable.  Maintenance  of  anesthesia  with nitrous  oxide  plus  opioids  or  with  opioids  alone  in  high doses  is  recommended  for  patients  with  marked  le ft ventricular  dysfunction.  Neuromuscular  blocking  drugs  with minimal hemodynamic e ff ects  are  best.  Intravascular fl uid volume should be maintained at normal levels, since these patients are preload dependent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension should be treated aggressively with α -agonists such  as  phenylephrine  that  do  not  cause  tachycardia  and therefore  maintain  diastolic fi lling  time. Th e  onset  of  junctional rhythm or bradycardia requires prompt treatment with glycopyrrolate, atropine, or ephedrine. Persistent tachycardia can be treated with β -blockers such as esmolol. Supraventricular tachycardia should be promptly terminated by cardioversion.  Lidocaine,  amiodarone,  and  a  de fi brillator  should  be immediately available, since these patients have a propensity to develop ventricular dysrhythmias.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intraoperative  monitoring  of  patients  with  aortic  stenosis must include ECG leads that reliably detect cardiac rhythm and le ft ventricular  myocardial  ischemia. Th e  complexity  of the surgery and the severity of the aortic stenosis in fl uence the decision to use an intraarterial catheter, a central venous catheter,  a  pulmonary  artery  catheter,  or  transesophageal  echocardiography. Such monitoring techniques help to determine whether intraoperative hypotension is due to hypovolemia or heart failure. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure may overestimate le ft ventricular end-diastolic volume because of the decreased compliance of the hypertrophied le ft ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AORTIC REGURGITATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic regurgitation results from failure of aortic lea fl et coaptation caused by disease of the aortic lea fl ets or of the aortic root.  Common  causes  of  lea fl et  abnormalities  are  infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, bicuspid aortic valve, and the use  of  anorexigenic  drugs.  Abnormalities  of  the  aortic  root causing  aortic  regurgitation  include  idiopathic  aortic  root dilation,  hypertension-induced  aortoannular  ectasia,  aortic dissection, syphilitic  aortitis,  Marfan's  syndrome,  EhlersDanlos syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. Acute aortic regurgitation is usually the result of endocarditis or aortic dissection.

Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e basic hemodynamic derangement in aortic regurgitation is  a  decrease  in  cardiac  output  because of regurgitation of a part of the ejected stroke volume from the aorta back into the le ft ventricle during diastole. Th is results in a combined pressure and volume overload on the le ft ventricle. Th e magnitude of the regurgitant volume depends on (1) the time available for the regurgitant fl ow to occur, which is determined by the heart rate; and (2) the pressure gradient across the aortic valve, which is dependent on the systemic vascular resistance. Th e magnitude  of  aortic  regurgitation  is  decreased  by  tachycardia  and  peripheral  vasodilation.  With  aortic  regurgitation, the entire stroke volume is ejected into the aorta. Because the pulse pressure is proportional to the stroke volume and aortic  elastance,  the  increased  stroke  volume  increases  systolic pressure,  and  systolic  hypertension  increases  a ft erload. Th e le ft ventricle  compensates  by  developing  hypertrophy  and enlarging to accommodate the volume overload. Because of the  increased  oxygen  requirements  necessitated  by  le ft ventricular hypertrophy and the decrease in aortic diastolic pressure, which reduces coronary blood fl ow, angina pectoris may occur in the absence of coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  le ft ventricle can usually tolerate the chronic volume overload. However, if le ft ventricular failure occurs, le ft ventricular end-diastolic volume increases dramatically and pulmonary edema develops. A helpful indicator of le ft ventricular function in the presence of aortic regurgitation is the echocardiographically  determined  end-systolic  volume  and  ejection fraction,  both  of  which  remain normal until le ft ventricular function becomes impaired. Indeed, surgery is recommended before the ejection fraction decreases to less than 55% and le ft ventricular end-systolic volume increases to more than 55 mL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compared  to  patients  with  chronic  aortic  regurgitation, patients with acute aortic regurgitation experience severe volume overload in a ventricle that has not had time to compensate. Th is typically results in coronary ischemia, rapid deterioration in le ft ventricular function, and heart failure (Figure 2-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic  regurgitation  is  recognized  clinically  by  its  characteristic  diastolic  murmur,  heard  best  along  the  right  sternal border,  and  peripheral  signs  of  a  hyperdynamic  circulation, including a widened pulse pressure, decreased diastolic blood pressure,  and  bounding  pulses.  In  addition  to  the  typical murmur of aortic regurgitation, there may be a low-pitched diastolic  rumble  (Austin-Flint  murmur)  that  results  from fl uttering of the mitral valve caused by the regurgitant jet. As with  mitral  regurgitation,  symptoms  of  aortic  regurgitation may not appear until le ft ventricular  dysfunction  is  present. Symptoms at this stage are manifestations of le ft ventricular failure (dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue) and coronary ischemia.

FIGURE 2-2 Pathophysiology of aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation results in an increased left ventricular (LV) volume, increased stroke volume, increased aortic (Ao) systolic pressure, and decreased effective stroke volume. Increased LV volume results in an increased LV mass, which may lead to LV dysfunction and failure. Increased LV stroke volume increases systolic pressure and prolongs LV ejection time (LVET). Increased LV systolic pressure results in a decrease in diastolic time. Decreased diastolic time (myocardial perfusion time), diastolic aortic pressure, and effective stroke volume reduce myocardial O2 supply. Increased myocardial O2 consumption and decreased myocardial O2 supply produce myocardial ischemia, which causes further deterioration in LV function. ↑ , Increased; ↓ , decreased; LVEDP , left ventricular end-diastolic pressure.

With chronic aortic regurgitation, evidence of le ft ventricular enlargement and le ft ventricular hypertrophy may be seen on the chest radiograph and ECG. Echocardiography will reveal any anatomic abnormalities of the aortic valve, including leaflet  perforation or prolapse, and will identify any abnormalities in the aortic root and aortic annulus. Le ft ventricular size, volume, and ejection fraction can be measured, and Doppler examination can be used to identify the presence and severity of aortic regurgitation. Many methods exist to quantify aortic regurgitation. Th ese include regurgitant jet width as a percentage of overall le ft ventricular out fl ow tract width, pressure half-time, and diastolic fl ow reversal in the descending aorta. Cardiac catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may be useful for grading aortic regurgitation if echocardiography is insu ffi cient.

Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical replacement of a diseased aortic valve is recommended before the onset of permanent le ft ventricular dysfunction, even if  patients are asymptomatic. Th e operative mortality for isolated aortic valve replacement is approximately 4%. It is higher if  there  is  concomitant  aortic  root  replacement  or  coronary artery bypass gra ft ing or if there are substantial comorbidities. Th e  mortality rate of asymptomatic patients  with normal le ft ventricular size and function is less than 0.2% per year. In contrast, symptomatic patients have a mortality rate greater than 10% per year. In acute aortic regurgitation, immediate surgical intervention is necessary, because the acute volume overload results in heart failure. Alternatives to aortic valve replacement with  a  prosthetic  valve  include  a  pulmonic  valve  autogra ft (Ross procedure) and aortic valve reconstruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical  treatment  of  aortic  regurgitation  is  designed  to decrease systolic hypertension and le ft ventricular wall stress and improve le ft ventricular function. Intravenous infusion of a vasodilator such as nitroprusside and an inotropic drug such as  dobutamine  may  be  useful  for  improving  le ft ventricular stroke  volume  and  reducing  regurgitant  volume.  Long-term therapy with nifedipine or hydralazine can be bene fi cial and may delay the need for surgery in asymptomatic patients with good le ft ventricular function.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for noncardiac surgery in patients with  aortic  regurgitation  is  designed  to  maintain  forward  le ft ventricular stroke volume (Table 2-8). Th e  heart  rate  must  be kept above 80 beats per minute because bradycardia, by increasing the duration of diastole and thereby the time for regurgitation, produces acute le ft ventricular volume overload. An abrupt increase in systemic vascular resistance can also precipitate le ft ventricular failure. Th e compensations for aortic regurgitation may be tenuous, and anesthetic-induced myocardial depression may upset this delicate balance. If le ft ventricular failure occurs, it is treated with a vasodilator to reduce a ft erload and an inotrope to increase contractility. Overall, modest increases in heart rate and modest decreases in systemic vascular resistance are reasonable hemodynamic goals during anesthesia. General anesthesia is the usual choice for patients with aortic regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction of anesthesia in the presence of aortic regurgitation can be achieved with an inhaled anesthetic or an intravenous induction drug. Ideally the induction drug should not decrease the heart rate or increase systemic vascular resistance.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  absence  of  severe  le ft ventricular  dysfunction,  maintenance of  anesthesia  is  o ft en  provided  with  nitrous  oxide  plus a  volatile  anesthetic  and/or  opioid. Th e  increase  in  heart  rate, decrease in systemic vascular resistance, and minimal myocardial depression associated with iso fl urane, des fl urane, and sevofl urane make these drugs excellent choices in patients with aortic regurgitation. In patients with severe le ft ventricular dysfunction, high-dose opioid anesthesia may be preferred. Bradycardia and myocardial depression from concomitant use of nitrous oxide or a benzodiazepine are risks of the high-dose narcotic technique. Neuromuscular  blockers  with  minimal  or  no  e ff ect  on  blood pressure and heart rate are typically used, although the modest increase in heart rate associated with pancuronium administration could be helpful in patients with aortic regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mechanical ventilation should be adjusted to maintain normal oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination and provide adequate time for venous return. Intravascular fl uid volume should be maintained at normal levels to provide for adequate preload. Bradycardia and junctional rhythm require prompt treatment with intravenous atropine.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery in patients with asymptomatic aortic regurgitation may not require invasive monitoring. Standard monitors should be adequate  to  detect  rhythm  disturbances  or  myocardial  ischemia. In the presence of severe aortic regurgitation, monitoring with a pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography is helpful for detecting myocardial depression, for facilitating intravascular volume replacement, and for measuring the response to administration of a vasodilating drug.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRICUSPID REGURGITATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricuspid regurgitation is usually functional, caused by tricuspid annular dilation secondary to right ventricle enlargement or  pulmonary  hypertension.  Other  causes  include  infective endocarditis (typically associated with intravenous drug abuse and unsterile injection), carcinoid syndrome, rheumatic heart disease, tricuspid valve prolapse, and Ebstein's anomaly. Tricuspid valve disease is o ft en associated with mitral or aortic valve disease. Mild tricuspid regurgitation can be a normal fi nding at any age and is very commonly seen in highly trained athletes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathophysiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e basic hemodynamic consequence of tricuspid regurgitation is right atrial volume overload. Th e high compliance of the right atrium and vena cava result in only a minimal increase in right atrial pressure even in the presence of a large regurgitant volume. Even surgical removal of the tricuspid valve can be well tolerated. Signs of tricuspid regurgitation include jugular venous distention, hepatomegaly, ascites, and peripheral edema. Th e treatment of functional tricuspid regurgitation is aimed at the cause of the lesion,  that  is,  at  improving  lung  function,  relieving  le ft -sided heart  failure,  or  reducing  pulmonary  hypertension.  Surgical intervention for isolated tricuspid valve disease is rarely done but would be considered if other cardiac surgery is planned. A tricuspid annuloplasty or valvuloplasty may be performed. Tricuspid valve replacement is rarely performed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with tricuspid regurgitation includes maintenance of intravascular fl uid volume and central venous pressure in the high-normal range to facilitate adequate  right  ventricular  preload  and  le ft ventricular fi lling. Positive pressure ventilation and vasodilating drugs may be particularly deleterious if they signi fi cantly reduce venous return. Events known to increase pulmonary artery pressure, such as hypoxemia and hypercarbia, must also be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A speci fi c anesthetic drug combination or technique cannot be  recommended  for  management  of  patients  with  tricuspid regurgitation.  Agents  that  produce  some  pulmonary vasodilation  and  those  that  maintain  venous  return  are  best.  Nitrous oxide  can  be  a  weak  pulmonary  artery  vasoconstrictor  and could increase the degree of tricuspid regurgitation, so it is best avoided. Intraoperative monitoring should include measurement of  right  atrial  pressure  to  guide  intravenous fl uid replacement and to detect changes in the amount of tricuspid regurgitation in response to administration of anesthetic drugs. With high right atrial pressures, the possibility of right-to-le ft intracardiac shunting through a patent foramen ovale must be considered. Taking meticulous  care  to  avoid  infusion  of  air  through  intravenous fl uid systems can reduce the risk of a systemic air embolism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TRICUSPID STENOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Tricuspid stenosis is rare in the adult population. Th e most common cause in adults is rheumatic heart disease with co-existing tricuspid regurgitation and o ft en mitral or aortic valve disease. Carcinoid syndrome and endomyocardial fi brosis are even rarer causes of tricuspid stenosis. Tricuspid stenosis increases right atrial pressure and increases the pressure gradient between the right  atrium  and  right  ventricle.  Right  atrial  dimensions  are increased, but the right ventricular dimensions are determined by the degree of volume overload from concomitant tricuspid regurgitation. Evaluation by echocardiography and color fl ow Doppler imaging helps estimate the severity of the stenosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONIC VALVE REGURGITATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonic valve regurgitation results from pulmonary hypertension with annular dilatation of the pulmonic valve. Other causes include connective tissue diseases, carcinoid syndrome, infective  endocarditis,  and  rheumatic  heart  disease.  Pulmonary regurgitation is rarely symptomatic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PULMONIC STENOSIS

Pulmonic  stenosis  is  usually congenital  (either as part of  a  complex  congenital  cardiac  lesion  or  as  an  isolated

An acquired form can be due to rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome,  infective  endocarditis,  or  previous  surgery  or other  interventions.  Signi fi cant  obstruction  can  cause  syncope, angina, right ventricular hypertrophy, and right ventricular failure. Surgical valvotomy can be used to relieve the obstruction.  Echocardiography  is  essential  for  evaluation and management.

NEW FRONTIERS IN THE TREATMENT OF VALVULAR HEART DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic valve replacement in patients with critical aortic stenosis can be lifesaving. Aortic valve replacement has traditionally been accomplished via open heart surgery and the use of cardiopulmonary  bypass.  Patients  who  are  deemed  to  be  at very high risk or even inoperable because of age and multiple comorbid conditions have been treated medically or by balloon  aortic  valvotomy. Th is  treatment  might  provide  shortterm relief of symptoms but does not alter the natural history of  severe  aortic  stenosis. Th e  need  for  alternative  treatment options for this population of patients with valvular heart disease is now being addressed. During the last decade several di ff erent  procedures  have  been  developed  to  treat  valvular heart  disease  without  open  heart  surgery  and  cardiopulmonary bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transcatheter  aortic  valve  implantation  (TAVI)  is  a  procedure that can be performed percutaneously via the femoral  artery  (retrograde  and  less  invasive)  or  via  puncture  of the  apex  of  the  le ft ventricle  (antegrade  and  more  invasive) (Figure 2-3). An article by Leon and colleagues with a link to a video animation of this procedure is listed in the Resources section at the end of the chapter. Th e approach is chosen with consideration of iliac artery size; the presence of aortic or iliac disease, pathologic changes in the le ft ventricular apex, or pericardial disease; and any history of le ft thoracotomy or mediastinal or chest radiation. General anesthesia may be used for the transfemoral approach and is essential for the transapical approach. Transesophageal echocardiography is used initially to  determine  the  aortic  valve  pathologic  features,  annulus size, and le ft ventricular function, and to detect the presence of mitral regurgitation and aortic atheromas. A ft er implantation of the valve, echocardiography is used to assess prosthesis  position; to determine the degree of aortic regurgitation, if any; and to detect the presence of perivalvular leaks, aortic dissection,  mitral  regurgitation,  le ft ventricular  dysfunction, or new regional wall motion abnormalities. Further research is needed to develop less traumatic devices with features providing cerebral protection to reduce the frequency of neurologic complications, which is currently rather high.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compared  with  medical  therapy  or  balloon  valvotomy, transcatheter  aortic  valve  implantation  is  associated  with  a lower 30-day and 1-year mortality from all causes, a greater improvement in cardiac symptoms, and a reduced need for repeat  hospitalizations  for  cardiac  reasons.  Major  complications  of  transcutaneous  aortic  valve  replacement  include

<!-- PAGE=? -->
stroke, cognitive dysfunction, aortic dissection, bleeding, femoral or iliac artery injury, and perivalvular leaks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Percutaneous balloon valvotomy has been used for quite some time to correct mitral stenosis. For mitral regurgitation, however,  the  recommendation  in  symptomatic  patients  and those with evidence of le ft ventricular  dysfunction  is  mitral valve repair (ring annuloplasty) or mitral valve replacement via open heart surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. Medical management only improves symptoms; it does not a ff ect the progression of the disease. Clinical trials of devices that can perform percutaneous repair of the mitral valve are underway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Transcatheter  pulmonic  valve  placement  has  been  used in  selected  patients  with  pulmonary  insu ffi ciency  and  right ventricular  out fl ow  tract  problems.  Successful  percutaneous placement of this valve is associated with a reduction in right  ventricular  out fl ow  tract  obstruction,  improved  right ventricular pressure and/or volume unloading, and improved overall right ventricular function, biventricular function, and functional capacity. Th e procedure has been performed under general  anesthesia  with  minimal  hemodynamic  instability. Transesophageal  echocardiography  has  been  found  helpful during this procedure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Additional randomized clinical trials are needed to compare all of these new treatments for valvular heart disease with traditional methodologies and to measure the long-term outcomes in terms of both longevity and quality of life.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e most frequently encountered cardiac valve lesions produce pressure overload (mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis) or volume  overload  (mitral  regurgitation,  aortic  regurgitation) on the le ft atrium or le ft ventricle.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Angina pectoris may occur in patients with valvular heart disease even in the absence of coronary artery disease. It usually re fl ects increased myocardial oxygen demand due  to  ventricular  hypertrophy. Th e  demands  of  this thickened  muscle  mass  may  exceed  the  ability  of  even normal coronary arteries to deliver adequate amounts of oxygen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Certain  cardiac  lesions  such  as  aortic  and  mitral  stenosis  require  a  slow  heart  rate  to  prolong  the  duration  of diastole and improve le ft ventricular fi lling and coronary blood fl ow. Th e  regurgitant valvular lesions such as aortic  and  mitral  regurgitation  require  a ft erload  reduction and  somewhat  faster  heart  rate  to  shorten  the  time  for regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Prosthetic  valves  di ff er  from  one  another  with  regard  to durability,  thrombogenicity,  and  hemodynamic  pro fi le. Mechanical valves are very durable, lasting  at  least  20  to 30  years,  whereas  bioprosthetic  valves  last  about  10  to 15 years. Mechanical valves are highly thrombogenic and require  long-term  anticoagulation.  Because  bioprosthetic valves have a low thrombogenic potential, long-term anticoagulation is not necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ In 2007, major changes were made in the AHA Guidelines for  Prevention  of  Infective  Endocarditis.  Antibiotic  prophylaxis is now recommended only for those patients who are at highest risk of adverse outcomes if they were to develop infective endocarditis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Management  of  anesthesia  for  noncardiac  surgery  in patients with mitral stenosis includes prevention and treatment of events that can decrease cardiac output or produce pulmonary  edema. Th e  development  of  atrial fi brillation with  a  rapid  ventricular  response  signi fi cantly  decreases cardiac output and can produce pulmonary edema. Excessive perioperative fl uid administration, placement in Trendelenburg's  position,  or  autotransfusion  via  uterine contraction  increases  central  blood  volume  and  can  precipitate CHF. A sudden decrease in systemic vascular resistance may not be tolerated because the normal response to hypotension-that is, a re fl ex increase in heart rate-itself decreases cardiac output.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e basic hemodynamic derangement in mitral regurgitation is a decrease in forward le ft ventricular stroke volume and  cardiac  output.  A  portion  of  every  stroke  volume  is regurgitated  through  the  incompetent  mitral  valve  back into the le ft atrium, which results in le ft atrial volume overload and pulmonary congestion. Patients with a regurgitant fraction of more than 0.6 have severe mitral regurgitation. Pharmacologic interventions that increase or decrease systemic vascular resistance have a major impact on the regurgitant fraction in patients with mitral regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ MVP is de fi ned as the prolapse of one or both mitral lea fl ets into the le ft atrium during systole with or without mitral regurgitation; it is associated with the auscultatory fi ndings of a midsystolic click and a late systolic murmur. MVP is the most common form of valvular heart disease, a ff ecting 1% to 2.5% of the U.S. population. It is usually a benign condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Management of anesthesia in patients with aortic stenosis includes the prevention of hypotension and any hemodynamic  change  that  will  decrease  cardiac  output.  Normal sinus rhythm must be maintained, because the le ft ventricle is dependent on a properly timed atrial contraction to produce an optimal le ft ventricular end-diastolic volume. Loss of atrial contraction may produce a dramatic decrease in stroke volume and blood pressure. Th e heart rate is important because it determines the time available for ventricular fi lling, for ejection of the stroke volume, and for coronary perfusion. A sustained increase in heart rate decreases the time for le ft ventricular fi lling and ejection and reduces cardiac output. Hypotension reduces coronary blood fl ow and results  in  myocardial  ischemia  and  further  deterioration in le ft ventricular function and cardiac output. Aggressive treatment of hypotension is mandatory to prevent cardiogenic shock and/or cardiac arrest.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e basic hemodynamic derangement in aortic regurgitation is a decrease in cardiac output because of regurgitation of a part of the ejected stroke volume from the aorta back into the le ft ventricle during diastole. Th is results in a combined pressure and volume overload on the le ft ventricle. Th e magnitude of the regurgitant volume depends on (1)  the  time  available  for  the  regurgitant fl ow  to  occur, which is  determined  by  the  heart  rate;  and  (2)  the  pressure gradient across the aortic valve, which is dependent on  systemic  vascular  resistance. Th e  magnitude  of  aortic regurgitation  is  decreased  by  tachycardia  and  peripheral vasodilation.
