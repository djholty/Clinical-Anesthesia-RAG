PUBLIC HEALTH AND AGING TRENDS

Th e median age of the world's population is increasing because of a decline in fertility and an increase in the average life span during the past century. Worldwide, the average life span is expected to extend another 10 years by 2050 (Table 28-1). Th e growing number of older adults increases demands on public health systems and on social services. In developed countries, the health care cost per capita for the elderly is three to fi ve times greater than the cost for younger persons. Chronic diseases,  which  a ff ect  older  adults  disproportionately,  contribute  to  disability  and  diminish  quality  of  life.  Increased

Th e overall health of older Americans is improving. Still, many are disabled and have chronic conditions. Th e proportion of older Americans with a disability has decreased signi fi cantly in recent decades, but still 14 million people aged 65 and older reported some level of disability in the census of  2000  (Figure  28-2).  Currently  individuals  older  than  65 years of age comprise only 17% of the population but undergo almost one third of the 25 million surgical procedures performed  annually.  In  addition,  they  consume  approximately one half  of  the  $140  billion  annual  U.S.  federal  health  care budget. Th e aging of the U.S. population will result in a signi fi cant growth in the demand for surgical services. Based on the assumption that age-speci fi c per capita use of surgical services will remain constant, the amount of work in all surgical fi elds is predicted to increase. Th ese increases will vary widely by specialty.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For anesthesiologists, it is a great responsibility to develop strategies to address this increased demand while maintaining quality of care for our senior patients. Elderly individuals can develop the same illnesses as the rest of the population,  but  their  diminished  physiologic  reserve,  the long-term persistence of disease, and the cumulative e ff ect of comorbid conditions warrant separate and focused discussion of  anesthetic  management in this age group. Th is chapter  describes  age-related  biologic  alterations  and  discusses a few prevalent age-speci fi c conditions a ff ecting the elderly.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A sound understanding of age-related physiologic changes is  an  essential fi rst  step  in  providing  high-quality  care  to elderly  citizens.  Emphasis  should  be  placed  on  careful  preanesthesia screening and evaluation, so that comorbid conditions are identi fi ed and thoughtfully considered in relation to the planned anesthetic management.

PHYSIOLOGY OF AGING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nervous System Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is a continual loss of neuronal substance with advancing age that is accompanied by a similarly reduced cerebral blood fl ow and diminished production of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine. However, this reduction in neuronal density is not directly proportional to the general level of mental functioning. Th is  can be explained by the considerable redundancy of the neuronal network in younger individuals. Gray matter is more a ff ected by atrophy than white matter, and there is a compensatory increase in  cerebrospinal fl uid  volume. Th ere  is  great  individual variability in the degree to which these changes are manifested  in  the  elderly.  In  general,  nervous  system  function tends  to  decline  with  age,  which  leads  to  impairments  in cognition and motor, sensory, and other behaviors. Much needs  to  be  learned  regarding  the  cellular  and  molecular mechanisms  responsible  for  the  selective  vulnerability  of brain cells  and  regions  to  age-dependent  dysfunction  and neurodegeneration,  such  as  occur  in  parkinsonism  and

<!-- PAGE=? -->

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Alzheimer's  disease.  Most  pathologic  processes  involving the central nervous system are progressively more prevalent with increasing age. Examples are cerebral atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease, depression, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and delirium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e autonomic nervous system is no exception in the overall decline of neural function. With advancing age, parasympathetic  out fl ow  diminishes,  whereas  sympathetic  activity increases. However, most elderly patients manifest a reduced responsiveness to β -adrenergic stimulation. Changes in sympathetic  and  parasympathetic  responsiveness  are  re fl ected in  compromised  thermoregulation,  decreased  baroreceptor sensitivity and dehydration. Hypothermia, heat stroke, orthostatic hypotension, and syncope are common problems in the elderly  and  can  be  worsened  by  co-existing  diabetes-related autonomic dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is very important to note that most geriatric patients have a reduced requirement for anesthetic agents. Minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) is reduced. In addition, clearance of various pharmaceutical compounds can be compromised by reduced renal and hepatic function. Th e incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction is greatly increased in patients of advanced age, independent of the type of anesthetic technique employed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiovascular System Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
"Seventy  is  the  new fift y"  is  a  common  aphorism  today.  In fact,  a  large  number of elderly individuals report strenuous and frequent athletic  activity  and  look  much  younger  than their  stated  age.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  broad  range  of  cardiovascular capacity in the older population, so individualized  preoperative  cardiac  functional  assessment  cannot  be overemphasized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether aging is associated with a signi fi cant  decrease in cardiac output and stroke volume at rest is controversial. However, exercise tolerance (maximal attainable heart rate, stroke  volume, and cardiac output) is typically reduced in older  adults.  Progressive  loss  of  vascular  elasticity  o ft en leads  to  compensatory  le ft ventricular  hypertrophy  and hypertension.  Chronic  elevation  of  blood  pressure  results in decreased  baroreceptor  sensitivity. Th e  incidence  of coronary arteriosclerosis and valvular heart disease is also higher with advancing age. In more severe cases of cardiac dysfunction, the presence of various forms of dysrhythmia and congestive heart failure may compound the problem of prescribing an appropriate anesthetic regimen. In the assessment  of  cardiac  risk,  patient  self-report  of  daily  physical activities  and  exercise  tolerance  may  be  the  most  valuable source of information for the clinician. Stress tests are frequently used to di ff erentiate cardiac and noncardiac causes of  limited  exercise  tolerance  or  atypical  chest  pain.  When multiple risk factors are identi fi ed, stress echocardiography or  cardiac  catheterization  may  be  indicated  to  provide  a precise  quantitative  measurement  of  the  degree  of  cardiac compromise.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Respiratory System Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Gradual tissue degeneration is the main cause of respiratory system  aging.  Protective  re fl exes,  especially  coughing  and swallowing,  are  diminished  with  increasing  age. Th e  result can be chronic pulmonary in fl ammation and loss of alveolar surface area from repeated "microaspirations" and contamination of the lower respiratory tract with enteral organisms. In addition,  exposure to environmental toxins may be a major contributing factor in smokers and various subgroups of agricultural and industrial workers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In general, physiologic responsiveness to hypercapnia and hypoxemia is diminished in the elderly. Not only is the respiratory drive reduced, but the work of breathing is increased due to  a  reduction  in  chest  wall  elasticity  and  turbulent  air fl ow that  can  be  seen  in  narrowed  air  passages.  Progressive  mismatch  between  increasing  respiratory  work  and  weakened respiratory muscles results in an increased incidence of shortness  of  breath  during  regular  daily  activities  and,  in  severe cases, at rest. As a result of these changes, forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 second decline progressively in the elderly. Intraparenchymal elastic forces in some pulmonary  segments  may  become  insu ffi cient  to  maintain patent  distal  airways.  Consequently,  air  trapping  can  occur, and closing capacity and residual volume increase. Residual volume as a proportion of total lung capacity is 20% at 20 years of age and 40% at age 70.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Maldistribution  of  ventilation  and,  less  o ft en,  perfusion  leads  to  decreased  e ffi ciency  of  oxygenation  and  carbon dioxide removal. Th e  two most frequently seen forms of ventilation/perfusion mismatch are dead space (regional excess  of  ventilation  compared  with  perfusion)  and  pulmonary venous admixture (pulmonary perfusion in excess of ventilation). Dead space manifests primarily as reduced ventilatory  e ffi ciency,  since  increased  minute  ventilation is  necessary  to  achieve  the  same  alveolar  ventilation  and maintain the same arterial carbon dioxide level. Pulmonary venous  admixture  a ff ects  arterial  oxygen  tension.  Deoxygenated  blood  from  the  pulmonary  artery  passes  through inadequately  ventilated  areas  of  the  lung,  and  this  lowers pulmonary  venous,  and  ultimately  systemic,  oxygen  tension.  Mean  arterial  oxygen  tension  on  room  air  decreases from 95 mm Hg at age 20 to less than 70 mm Hg at age 80.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hepatic, Gastrointestinal, and Renal Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parenchymal atrophy, vascular sclerosis, and diminished function are o ft en described when age-related changes in various viscera are discussed. Hepatic synthetic and metabolic capacity, renal blood fl ow and clearance, and gastrointestinal motility and sphincter function are frequently compromised in the elderly. Th ese changes develop gradually and can persist at a subclinical level for long periods before the appearance of clinically observable signs such as abnormal laboratory test values and reduction in functional reserve. Hepatic tissue mass can be signi fi cantly reduced in old age, but baseline function

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is relatively well preserved. Renal tissue atrophy results in an approximately 50% reduction in the number of functioning nephrons by age 80, with a corresponding 1% to 1.5% decline per year in glomerular fi ltration  rate  compared  with  that  of young adults. Creatinine clearance also declines with age, but the serum creatinine level frequently remains within normal limits  because  of  the  lesser  skeletal  muscle  mass  and  lower creatinine production. Maintenance of adequate urine output (>0.5 mL/kg/hr) is crucial in preventing postoperative renal dysfunction, because postsurgical acute renal failure carries a very high mortality in the elderly. It can be a great challenge for the anesthesiologist to detect reduced organ function that may seem inconsequential preoperatively but will pose a signi fi cant risk during the stressful perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Various  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  alterations,  such  as  increased  volume  of  distribution  for  lipidsoluble drugs, reduced plasma volume, reduced plasma protein binding, slower hepatic conjugation, and diminished renal elimination, will in fl uence the anesthetic planning and decision-making process for elderly patients (Table 28-2).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endocrine Function Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Like all other parenchymal organs, the endocrine glands tend to  atrophy  in  the  elderly,  and  reduced  hormone  production frequently  leads  to  impaired  endocrine  function,  such  as impaired  glucose  homeostasis.  De fi ciencies  of  compounds like  insulin,  thyroxine,  growth  hormone, renin, aldosterone, and  testosterone  are  o ft en  present.  Diabetes,  hypothyroidism,  impotence,  and  osteoporosis  are  common,  along  with chronic  electrolyte  abnormalities.  Of  note,  basal  metabolic rate declines approximately 1% per year a ft er age 30.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hematologic, Oncologic, and Immune Function Changes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the bone marrow and lymph nodes of elderly individuals, various cellular elements are produced at a lower rate than in healthy young adults. Anemia can be especially worrisome if this diminished oxygen-carrying capacity is present in combination with coronary artery disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Compromised cellular immunity (leukopenia, lymphopenia) results in increased vulnerability to a variety of infectious diseases, ranging from simple community-acquired infections to less common entities such as tuberculosis and herpes zoster.

of cancer. Th e incidence of cancer is less than 2% before age 20 and more than 25% a ft er age 65. Th e prevalence of autoantibodies  and  autoimmune  disorders  is  also  higher  with advanced age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
GERIATRIC SYNDROMES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Correlation between biologic and chronologic age is not always strong, but it is important to recognize that the unavoidable physiologic decline seen with advancing age always leads to similar pathologic conditions. In the geriatric population, the increased prevalence of these syndromes makes it essential for the anesthesiologist to be familiar with them.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoporosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aging of the musculoskeletal system can be a change that is easily observable at the preoperative encounter with the patient. Loss of skeletal muscle (lean body mass) and increased percentage of body fat are typical changes associated with aging. Osteoporosis is  characterized  by  microarchitectural  deterioration of bone and decreased bone density, with consequent increased bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Osteoporosis is  o ft en asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. Some patients  may  note  a  loss  of  height  or  a  gradually  increasing kyphosis secondary to vertebral compression fractures. Prevention is a key aspect of management (Figure 28-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  United  States,  approximately  10  million  people have osteoporosis. Another 14 to 18 million have osteopenia. Approximately 1.5 million fractures per year are attributed to osteoporosis,  and  more  than  37,000  people  die  of  fracturerelated  complications.  Among  women  who  sustain  a  hip

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
fracture, 50% spend time in a nursing home while recovering, and 14% of all patients with hip fractures are still in nursing homes 1 year later. Whites, especially of northern European descent, and Asians are at increased risk of osteoporosis. Th e peak incidence is in people aged 70 years and older. Besides demographic characteristics, estrogen de fi ciency, male hypogonadism, smoking, increased alcohol consumption, calcium de fi ciency, cancer, immobilization, and long-term corticosteroid therapy are well-documented risk factors for osteoporosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Plain radiography is not as accurate as bone mineral density testing in evaluating for the presence of osteoporosis, but in symptomatic patients, radiographs can be useful to identify osteopenia and fractures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regular weight-bearing exercise and adequate calcium and vitamin  D  intake  are  key  elements  of  prevention.  Hormone replacement therapy is considered an e ff ective treatment for postmenopausal  women.  Parenteral  or  intranasal  calcitonin is typically reserved for the treatment of cancer-related bone resorption.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoarthritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Osteoarthritis  is  the  most  common  joint  disease,  a ff ecting more than 20 million individuals in the United States alone. More than half of the population older than 65 years displays radiographic signs of osteoarthritis, although it is o ft en asymptomatic. Prevalence increases with age. Middle-aged men and women are a ff ected equally, but prevalence is greater in elderly women. Risk factors include obesity, joint trauma, infection, and metabolic and neuromuscular disorders.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pathologic fi ndings  suggest  that  articular  cartilage  is  the primary  site  of  the  abnormality,  but  reactive  changes  also a ff ect periarticular tissues and surrounding bone. Th e weightbearing joints such as the knees, hips, cervical and lumbosacral  spine,  and  feet  are  most  a ff ected.  Pain  and  dysfunction of the a ff ected joints are major causes of long-term inactivity, disability and morbidity. No speci fi c laboratory abnormalities are associated with osteoarthritis. Th e  diagnosis is based on clinical assessment and positive radiographic fi ndings for the a ff ected joints (Figure 28-4).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonpharmacologic  interventions  are  the  cornerstones  of therapy for osteoarthritis and include patient education, weight loss, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and a reduction in joint  stress.  Acetaminophen  and  nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory  drugs  can  be  administered  to  improve  mobility.  Muscle relaxants are considered selectively for patients with evidence of muscle spasm. Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections, narcotics, and arthroplasty are reserved for patients with severe pain.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased mobility and discomfort are concerns for all caregivers,  but  cervical  spinal  mobility  and  stability  carry  special implications  for  the  anesthesiologist  if  laryngoscopy  and  tracheal intubation are planned. Cervical osteoarthritis may interfere with visualization of the glottic opening. Cervical fl exion and extension radiographs may be helpful in deciding which technique o ff ers the safest approach for endotracheal intubation without causing neck injury or compromising the spinal cord.

Parkinson's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parkinson's disease deserves special mention because there are many perioperative concerns pertaining to the optimal management of a ff ected patients. Parkinson's disease is a disorder of the extrapyramidal system and is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Although the cause of Parkinson's disease is largely unknown, it has long been hypothesized that neurodegeneration is induced by genetic, environmental, or infectious factors. Age is the single most consistent risk factor, and it has been estimated that Parkinson's disease a ff ects about 3% of the population older than 65 years of age. More than 50% of individuals older than 85 years of age have symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Parkinson's disease is characterized by progressive depletion of selected neuronal populations, including dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia (Figure 28-5). Patients demonstrate clinical signs when approximately 80% of dopaminergic activity is lost. Imbalance between the inhibitory action of dopamine and the excitatory action of acetylcholine leads to the classic triad of rigidity, resting tremor, and bradykinesis. Th ese clinical features are not exclusive to Parkinson's disease and may be exhibited by other syndromes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  is  no  speci fi c  test  to  con fi rm  the  diagnosis  of Parkinson's disease. Th e diagnosis is made on clinical grounds. Th e  goal  of  treatment  is  to  allow  the  patient  to    pursue  normal daily activities. Th e mainstay of treatment is drug therapy using  l-dopa  or  dopamine  receptor  agonists.  Some  promising  developments  have  occurred  in  surgical  treatment  of Parkinson's  disease  in  recent  years,  especially  subthalamic deep brain stimulation and fetal mesencephalic tissue implantation. Th ese modalities have been shown to improve outcome in certain patient populations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When  anesthesia  care  is  needed,  aspiration  prophylaxis and  monitoring  of  perioperative  respiratory  function  are

Chapter 28 GERIATRIC DISORDERS

paramount. Th e  usual  drug  or  drugs  used  to  treat  the  parkinsonian symptoms should be administered as close to the regular schedule as possible. Drugs that precipitate or exacerbate  Parkinson's  disease,  including  phenothiazines,  butyrophenones  (droperidol),  and  metoclopramide,  should  be avoided.  If  drug-induced  extrapyramidal  signs  develop  or sedation is required, diphenhydramine can be e ff ective. Concomitant autonomic nervous system dysfunction is common in these patients, so monitoring of hemodynamic parameters is required.

Dementia

Intellectual decline is one of the early hallmarks of dementia. Major di ff erences are seen in the elderly in their level of intellectual  function  compared  with  their  own  baseline  in  early adulthood. In any patient with a slowly progressive dementia,

sudden changes in cognitive, behavioral, or health status may occur.  Mental  status  is  o ft en  a  barometer  of  health  in  these patients, and abrupt changes necessitate a search for any additional problem that may be occurring (Table 28-3). Numerous population-based studies report decreased longevity in elderly individuals  who  experience  cognitive  decline.  Diminishing cognitive performance over any time interval is predictive of an early death. Perhaps the most important challenge in treating dementia is identifying cases of reversible dementia such as  chronic  drug  intoxication,  vitamin  de fi ciencies,  subdural hematoma,  major  depression,  normal-pressure  hydrocephalus, and hypothyroidism.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unfortunately, most causes of dementia, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other common  multi-infarct  states,  are  incurable. Th is  does  not mean, however, that symptoms cannot be treated and ameliorated. Pharmacotherapy for dementia is tailored to control the behavioral problems and sleep disorders that may be present and to prevent further intellectual decline and neurodegeneration. Th ose treatments include vitamin E, nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory  drugs,  estrogen  replacement  therapy,  and centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For the anesthesiologist, the challenges in caring for elderly patients  with  declining  mental  capacity  are  many.  Perioperative interactions with patient and family should take into account  the  patient's  compromised  ability  to  process  general  and medical information and capability to provide true informed consent. Establishment and documentation of baseline cognitive and neurologic function may become signi fi cant if  postoperative  alterations  in  mental  function  are  encountered. If acute deterioration is suspected, a neurologic consultation is advised.

A hundred years ago, the age of 50 was considered a contraindication to many types of surgical procedures. With advances in  health care, improved anesthetic and surgical techniques, and  longer  life  expectancies,  a  greater  number  of  geriatric patients are considered for and do undergo major or high-risk

surgery at advanced ages. Th e decision to operate should not be based on age alone. Th e elderly are a nonhomogenous population and cannot be categorized as a single surgical group. Th ere  is  o ft en  a  disparity  between  chronologic  and  biologic age.  Normal age-related changes do not increase the risk of perioperative complications and death. However, the elderly are o ft en a ff ected by a number of illnesses, and all have impairment in functional reserve that may become evident in times of  stress. Biologic  age -that is, the sum of physiologic aging processes, comorbid conditions, functional status, and genetic factors-is most important in determining an elderly patient's potential to undergo surgery and the perioperative risks associated  with  it.  It  is  important  that  the  anesthesiologist  have knowledge of the physiology of aging and the ability to identify potential problems, develop a safe anesthetic strategy, and prevent complications that can arise during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical Mortality and Morbidity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  has  been  estimated  that  the  elderly  require  surgery  four times  more  o ft en  than  the  rest  of  the  population. Th ese patients  will  o ft en  have  an  American  Society  of  Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status score of 3 or higher. In fact, in  several  large  prospective  observational  studies,  including the Veterans A ff airs  National Surgical Quality Improvement Project, patients over the age of 70 had an ASA score of 3 or higher about two thirds of the time. Although the elderly do not  have  a  monopoly  on  certain  disease  processes  such  as chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and renal failure, these diseases are present in geriatric patients at a much greater frequency than in younger age groups. In the previously mentioned studies, among patients older than age 70 the incidence of diabetes was 22%; of ischemic heart disease, 20%; of malnutrition, 17%; of  renal  impairment,  16%;  of  cerebrovascular  disease,  14%; and of lung disease, 8%. Th e existence of these illnesses and others, such as cancer, increases the likelihood that this population will require major surgical interventions. As the elderly population  increases,  the  practicing  anesthesiologist  will  be required to care for an ever greater number of elderly patients, and it is likely that these patients will have at least one, and frequently two or more, signi fi cant disease process. Th is will clearly impact anesthetic management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Functional  reserve  is  the  ability  of  an  organism  to  maintain  a  steady  state  in  the  presence  of  physiologic  stress.  Agerelated  physiologic  alterations  negatively  impact  the  elderly patient's  ability  to  cope  with  stress  such  as  surgery  or  injury. Th e  elderly  have  a  diminished  functional  reserve,  and  when facing a stressor, they lack the ability to preserve homeostasis. Lesser injuries can bring about greater degrees of shock, respiratory failure, thermoregulatory dysfunction, and so on, than are observed in younger patients. Th is reduction in functional reserve coupled with the existence of other diseases has negative  consequences  on  perioperative  outcome,  both  morbidity and mortality. Seemingly minor issues can create big problems when  caring  for  someone  with  several  compromised  organ systems and diminished reserve. Attention to detail is rarely as important as when taking care of patients at the extremes of age.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  majority of complications occur in the postoperative period,  rather  than  the  intraoperative  period,  and  can  start even in the postanesthesia care unit. Perioperative complications, including myocardial infarction, dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest,  reintubation,  wound-related  problems,  acute  renal impairment, stroke, prolonged mechanical ventilation, sepsis, and unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, increase linearly with each increasing decade of life. In patients 80 years of age or older, complications occur at rates at least two to three times those in patients younger than age 60. Th irty-day mortality rates increase exponentially for each decade over age 60. Nonsurvivors are more likely to be older than 80 years, to be male, to have a low albumin level, to exhibit impaired ability to accomplish the activities of daily living, to have an impaired functional status, to have an ASA score of 3 or higher, and to undergo emergency surgery. Indeed, the odds ratio for 30-day mortality triples with each increase in the ASA score above 2. In all studies, ASA scores of 3 or higher and emergency surgery are the most consistent predictors of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Little evidence has been gathered about events during the fi rst  year  a ft er  a  major  surgical  intervention,  but  what  has been noted is that independence and quality of life are o ft en reduced. Mortality rates during that fi rst year are higher in the elderly who have had surgery than in those who have not had surgery.

Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In keeping with the ASA 2008 practice advisory on preanesthetic testing, it is important to remember that, for the elderly, performing undirected or routine testing results in no improvement  in  quality  of  care.  Any  testing  performed  should  be directed by the type of surgical procedure, known co-existing conditions  and  symptoms,  or fi ndings on history taking and physical examination. For the elderly undergoing general anesthesia,  it  is  prudent  to  obtain  an  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  if a  relatively  recent  one  is  not  available.  Obtaining  a  baseline hemoglobin  level  and  hematocrit  value  is  also  reasonable. Th e  most  important aspect of the preanesthetic evaluation is a thorough history taking and physical examination with close attention to functional status. Th e best predictor of postoperative  functional  status  is  preoperative  functional  status.  Accurate  assessment  of  functional  status  and  overall  health  status in the elderly can be challenging and time consuming. Many elderly patients underreport potentially important symptoms, especially those that they consider to be a normal part of aging. Th e presence of mild dementia or cognitive de fi cits along with hearing or visual impairments can make precise history taking extremely di ffi cult. Assessment of true functional capacity and health status may require the presence of a spouse, other family member, caregiver, or close friend. Determining the ability to perform activities of daily living and calculating the metabolic

<!-- PAGE=? -->
equivalents (METs) when assessing exercise capacity are usually adequate for evaluation of functional capacity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  assessing  functional  status,  the  preoperative  evaluation  should  include  organ-focused  assessment  with emphasis on the cardiac, pulmonary, renal, and hepatic systems and nutritional status, as well as assessment for the presence and therapeutic control of diabetes mellitus. Th e major clinical predictors of increased cardiovascular risk are an unstable coronary syndrome, decompensated congestive heart failure, signi fi cant or unstable dysrhythmias, and severe or critical valvular disease, especially aortic stenosis. In the presence of any of these indicators, consideration should be given to referral to a cardiologist. Cardiac testing should generally be reserved for those patients anticipating an intermediate- or high-risk surgery who cannot achieve 4 METs of activity and who have three or more additional risk factors for signi fi cant coronary artery disease. In general, the presence of adequate functional capacity, a normal or unchanged ECG, stable symptoms, and cardiac testing within the last 2 years or cardiac intervention within the last 5 years with stable symptoms suggests that no further testing is required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Evaluation  of  the  pulmonary  system  should  include  a thorough  history  taking  and  physical  examination  and  perhaps chest radiography. In patients with known lung disease, consideration can be given to pulmonary function testing if it has not been performed recently. Referral to an internist or pulmonologist may be indicated if the patient has signs and symptoms  of  decompensated  lung  function  or  has  severe disease  that  has  not  been  previously  evaluated  or  optimally treated. Th e  most  common complications following surgery are related to the respiratory system. Th e  incidence of postoperative hypoxia is 20% to 60% in the elderly. Diminished laryngeal re fl exes, declining respiratory drive, reduced respiratory muscle strength, increased ventilation/perfusion mismatch and drug-induced hypoventilation can all contribute to hypoxia. Th e risk of postoperative pneumonia is also signi fi -cant, and when it occurs, postoperative pneumonia is associated with a 20% or higher 30-day mortality. Risk factors for postoperative pneumonia include inability to carry out activities of daily living at baseline, weight loss of 10% or more in the previous 6 months, history of stroke, impaired sensorium, ingestion of two or more alcoholic drinks daily, long-term steroid use, smoking, and underlying lung disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute renal failure contributes to one in fi ve postoperative deaths.  Considering  the  high  rate  of  preexisting  renal  dysfunction in the elderly population, it is probably prudent to obtain serum electrolyte levels and creatinine concentration before surgical procedures that carry a risk of acute renal failure, such as those involving cardiopulmonary bypass or aortic aneurysm repair or surgeries in which large fl uid shi ft s or signi fi cant blood losses are anticipated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the presence of known hepatic disease or before surgery that requires manipulation of the liver, it may be reasonable to perform baseline liver function tests. Prothrombin time or international  normalized  ratio  and  albumin  level  are  better indicators of synthetic liver function than serum transaminase levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diabetes  mellitus  is  an  independent  predictor  of  a  longterm decrease in quality of life following surgery. Poor glucose control (levels > 200 mg/dL) is associated with an increased risk of aspiration, poor wound healing, infection, cardiac and cerebrovascular  events,  and  autonomic  dysfunction  causing hypotension and urinary retention. Whenever possible, time should be invested in ensuring adequate glucose control for several  weeks  before  surgery.  Serum  glucose  concentrations that range steadily between 120 and 180 mg/dL are probably adequate for surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Malnutrition  is  an  independent  predictor  of  30-day  and 1-year postoperative mortality, as well as morbidity and loss of independence in the postoperative period. Th e elderly have rates of malnutrition of 15% to 26%. Th ese rates may be even higher in certain subsets such as patients from lower socioeconomic classes, those with signi fi cant chronic disease, those with depression, and those who live alone without social support (shut-ins). Albumin concentration is a simple screening tool. A serum albumin level of less than 3 g/dL in conjunction with hypocholesterolemia and low body mass index is indicative of malnutrition and/or vitamin de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in the Elderly

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is no evidence that that any speci fi c inhaled or injected anesthetic  agent  is  preferable  for  induction  and/or  maintenance of  anesthesia  in  elderly  patients.  Some  drugs  may  be better for use in the elderly, however, because of certain pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. One result of the physiologic changes of aging is altered pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Changes in body composition can a ff ect  the  distribution,  metabolism,  and  clearance  of  drugs. In general, the plasma concentration and the volume of distribution (V d ) of a drug are inversely related. Compared with younger patients, the elderly tend to have decreased total body water, which results in a smaller V d for hydrophilic drugs and, therefore,  a  higher  plasma  concentration  for  a  given  dose. Conversely, the elderly have a higher ratio of adipose tissue to lean muscle than the young and generally have increased body fat  overall. Th e  V d of  lipophilic  drugs  increases;  this  results in  accumulation  and  prolongation  of  drug  e ff ects,  which may become even more pronounced in the face of impaired hepatic  metabolism  or  renal  elimination.  Circulating  levels of important drug-binding proteins, such as albumin and α 1 -acid  glycoprotein,  decrease  with  age.  Qualitative  changes  in these proteins can occur and alter their ability to bind certain drugs, which results in an increased circulating free fraction of drug and therefore an increased drug e ff ect. Propofol, for example,  is  extensively  protein  bound,  and  even  modestly decreased albumin levels result in a higher free drug fraction and  e ff ect. Th e  result  is  that  smaller  initial  and  subsequent doses of   protein-bound drugs may be required.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elderly patients with cardiac disease may have decreased cardiac output at baseline. Th is creates a prolonged circulation time to drug e ff ect for anesthetics administered intravenously,

<!-- PAGE=? -->
650

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
but can result in a more rapid uptake of volatile anesthetics. Repeated intravenous dosing at short intervals or administration of high concentrations of volatile anesthetics can lead to cardiovascular collapse in a patient with an already tenuous cardiac status. Altered pharmacologic e ff ects of muscle relaxants in geriatric patients are explained by altered pharmacokinetics in the elderly. Th ere is a delayed onset of action caused by decreased muscle blood fl ow and cardiac output. Relaxants with hepatic and renal metabolism and elimination may have signi fi cantly  prolonged  e ff ects,  but  relaxants  eliminated  by other means do not. Elderly patients are frequently taking several  prescription  medications,  which  increases  the  potential for undesirable drug interactions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e e ff ect of a drug depends not only on the concentration of the drug at its site of action, but also on the number and adequacy of function of receptors at the target tissue. Th e sensitivity to drugs in the geriatric population may be increased or decreased or the desired a ff ect may be altered. Th e MAC of volatile anesthetics decreases with age, about 4% per decade for each decade a ft er 40 years of age (Figure 28-6). Age-related changes  occur  in  the  number  and  subunit  composition  of γ -aminobutyric  acid  type  A  receptors,  which  may  explain some  of  the  increased  sensitivity  to  both  intravenous  and inhaled anesthetics. Th e  elderly  can  be  very  sensitive  to  the undesired cardiovascular and respiratory-depressant e ff ects of benzodiazepines. Time for recovery of psychomotor function is  also  slower  for  benzodiazepines  than  for  shorter-acting drugs like propofol. Occasionally, geriatric patients may have an altered or paradoxical response to benzodiazepines that is characterized by restlessness, agitation, and hyperactivity. Th is can be reversed with a small dose of fl umazenil without reversing the amnesic and anxiolytic e ff ects of the benzodiazepine. Th e elderly show exaggerated respiratory and cardiovascular depression in response to most narcotics, and dose requirements decrease by approximately 50% between the ages of 20 and 80. In general it is wise to remember that the elderly will require smaller doses of anesthetic drugs and that the risk of undesirable e ff ects is  increased. It is  smart to "start low and go slow" when administering medications, particularly drugs with the potential for adverse cardiovascular e ff ects.

Anesthetic Plan

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Choosing  an  anesthetic  plan  for  an  elderly  patient  requires consideration of many details. Several retrospective and prospective studies have failed to show a di ff erence in outcome or a clear bene fi t for general anesthesia versus regional or neuraxial anesthesia. Th ese studies failed to identify any meaningful di ff erence in mortality and morbidity except for a clearly reduced incidence of deep vein thrombosis with regional anesthesia. Th ere is some evidence that use of regional anesthesia may decrease intraoperative blood loss in certain subsets of

FIGURE 28-6 Nomogram for minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) as a function of age. The MACs for desflurane (Des), sevoflurane (Sev), and isoflurane (Iso) can be determined by placing a ruler on the dot at left and drawing a line through the age of the patient. The point at which this line crosses each MAC nomogram line yields the MAC value for the given drug for that age. As an example, the dotted line shows how to determine MAC for a 75-year-old patient. An approximation of the value for MAC-awake (the alveolar concentration of anesthetic at which a patient responds to verbal commands, e.g., "open your eyes") can be determined by dividing the MAC by 3.

surgical patients. Th e choice of anesthetic technique must ultimately be based on patient preference, the anesthesiologist's experience or comfort with the technique, the patient's ASA physical status, and the planned surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e standard ASA-recommended monitoring should be implemented. Age alone is not an indication for invasive monitoring  such  as  transesophageal  echocardiography  or pulmonary artery catheterization. Th e  decision  to  use  these monitoring methods should be based, as always, on the potential bene fi ts and risks, the potential for excessive blood loss or large fl uid shi ft s, the patient's ASA physical status and concurrent illnesses, and the planned surgery.

Th e  elderly  have  decreased  skin  elasticity  and  reduced skin and so ft tissue perfusion, which increases the risk of skin breakdown or ulcerations. Th e presence of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis  also  poses  a  risk  of  injury.  Bony  prominences must be protected and padded.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Elderly patients are o ft en dehydrated because of a diminished sensation of thirst, reduced renal capacity to conserve water and sodium, and frequent use of diuretics. Because of decreased le ft ventricular compliance and limited β -adrenergic receptor  responsiveness,  these  patients  are  more  prone  to develop hypotension when hypovolemic and congestive heart failure when hypervolemic. A thorough assessment of intravascular volume status is essential before induction of anesthesia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Measures to conserve body heat and decrease the risk of hypothermia should be implemented. Prolonged elimination of anesthetic agents and slower postoperative awakening can occur as a result of intraoperative heat loss. Elderly patients can  respond  to  hypothermia  by  shivering  during  the  early postoperative  period.  Shivering  results  in  increased  oxygen demand, which is a special concern in patients with coronary disease or in those with compromised cardiovascular reserve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  same basic principles that guide acute pain management in the general population apply to the geriatric group. However, optimal analgesia for elderly individuals can be challenging to achieve. Th e elderly may experience the most potential harm as well as the greatest potential bene fi t from control of postoperative pain. Because of concomitant ischemic heart disease and diminished pulmonary capacity, elderly patients are more vulnerable to the physiologic consequences of inadequate analgesia and to the side e ff ects of various analgesics. Th e belief that pain perception diminishes with age is a misconception.  Cultural  constraints  and  fear  of  addiction  may prevent elderly patients from reporting pain. Dementia, delirium, or hearing and visual impairment can make it di ffi cult to assess pain. Indeed, inadequate analgesia can contribute to postoperative  delirium.  Easy-to-understand  pain  scales  and simple dosing schedules are most e ff ective.

POSTOPERATIVE DELIRIUM AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION

postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction are separate entities, they appear to have an association and are both linked to poor outcomes and higher mortality. Th e key characteristics of delirium include a decline in mental status; a reduced awareness of the environment; a disturbance in attention; cognitive dysfunction, which may include disorientation and memory impairment; mixed psychomotor impairments; and possibly hallucinations (Table 28-4). Postoperative delirium has a greater association with older age and occurs most commonly 1 to 3 days a ft er surgery. Patients who experience  postoperative  delirium  tend  to  be  lucid  initially a ft er surgery but later begin to exhibit fl uctuating mental status followed by the other characteristics of this disorder.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Almost any acute illness or exacerbation of a chronic illness can precipitate delirium in the geriatric population (Table 28-5). Delirium is estimated to a ff ect 10% to 30% of elderly patients hospitalized for medical illness. Postoperative delirium has an incidence of 10% to 15% but can be much higher in  certain  high-risk  groups.  Risk  factors  for  postoperative delirium include age older than 70 years, preexisting dementia, preoperative use of narcotics or benzodiazepines, alcohol abuse,  previous  episodes  of  postoperative  delirium,  visual

impairment, severe illness, certain types of injuries (such as hip  fractures),  and  elevated  blood  urea  nitrogen  level.  Precipitating  factors  have  been  identi fi ed  and  include  the  use of  physical  restraints,  malnutrition,  introduction  of  three  or more new medications within a 24- to 48-hour period, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, and electrolyte or fl uid derangements.  Speci fi c  perioperative  factors  include  greater intraoperative blood loss, transfusion of blood products, inadequate analgesia, and a postoperative hematocrit of less than 30%. Interestingly, the incidence of postoperative delirium is the same regardless of whether regional or general anesthesia is used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mechanism of postoperative delirium remains elusive, but  it  has  been  hypothesized  that  the  stress  of  surgery  and the associated in fl ammatory response resulting in leukocyte migration into the central nervous system may play an active role  in  the  pathophysiology of postoperative delirium. Most patients  with  postoperative  delirium  experience  complete recovery,  but  this  disorder  is  far  from  benign.  Hospitalized patients  with  delirium  demonstrate  up  to  a  10-fold  higher risk of developing other medical complications and have longer hospital stays, increased medical costs, increased need for long-term care, and a higher 1-year mortality rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  delirium  prevention  focuses  on  interventions that consistently orient the patient, stimulate cognition, enhance nutritional and fl uid intake, and promote exercise, as  well  as  the  use  of  nonpharmacologic  sleep  aids  to  prevent sleep disturbances and deprivation. Once postoperative delirium  occurs,  therapy  should  include  identi fi cation  and treatment of underlying medical disorders such as dehydration, infection, hypoxemia, and alcohol or drug withdrawal. Optimization of the environment and attempts at orientation as well as adequate analgesia are also important. Pharmacologic treatment may be necessary for extreme agitation that compromises the patient's safety or the ability of caregivers to perform necessary functions. Haloperidol is the preferred treatment and can be given orally, intravenously, or intramuscularly.  Other  drugs  such  as  chlorpromazine  and  benzodiazepines have been used with mixed results. Quetiapine has been used successfully for both prevention and treatment of ICU delirium. Monitoring for oversedation is essential when using any of these drugs. In cases of severe agitation physical restraints should be considered only as a last resort when other strategies have failed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is characterized by persistent  deterioration  of  cognitive  performance  a ft er  surgery. Most cases of  postoperative  cognitive  dysfunction  are  identi fi ed by conducting preoperative testing and comparing the results of this testing with the results of postoperative neuropsychologic testing at hospital discharge and 3 months later. Most  cognitive  impairment  is  mild  and  resolves  during  the fi rst  3  months  a ft er  surgery.  However,  at  times  postoperative cognitive dysfunction can be quite severe and negatively impact quality of life, overall functional capacity, and 1-year mortality. Some patients cannot return to employment or lose their independence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  cognitive  dysfunction  has  been  associated with cardiac surgery and is well described in this setting, but little is known about the prevalence or scope of this problem in connection with noncardiac surgery. Even less is understood about the pathophysiology of this disorder and whether or not anesthesia can be implicated as a contributor to the problem Th e diagnosis of postoperative cognitive dysfunction requires neuropsychologic testing before and a ft er  surgery and anesthesia.  Many  issues  contribute  to  the  di ffi culties  in  de fi ning and diagnosing postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Not the least are the lack of standardization in testing, including the timing of testing and patient exclusion or inclusion criteria, and agreement on the amount of change considered clinically signi fi cant. Frequently when postoperative cognitive dysfunction is studied, patients who may be at high risk, such as those with underlying cerebrovascular disease, are excluded. Subject attrition may also adversely a ff ect follow-up testing. Patients are usually elderly with multiple co-existing illnesses and may die  during  the  study  period. Th ose  with  cognitive  decline might fail to follow up, since they have less insight and may be less likely to seek care for problems. In fact, it is conceivable that the most severely a ff ected may be the least likely to come for follow-up testing. Studies testing speci fi cally for decline in memory and executive function found an equal distribution of impairment in memory, executive function, and combined memory-executive function at hospital discharge. In contrast, at 3 months more patients continued to exhibit mild memory impairment. In the majority of patients with either memory or executive decline the impairment was categorized as mild. Th ose with combined dysfunction seemed to be more severely a ff ected. Interestingly, those with memory decline alone were much less likely to drop out of the study, whereas those with isolated  executive  function  impairments  were  three  times more likely to drop out before follow-up testing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e only consistent risk factor that has been identi fi ed for postoperative cognitive dysfunction is advanced age. Rates of postoperative cognitive dysfunction are at least twice as high in the elderly (>60 years) than in middle-aged or younger age groups, both at hospital discharge and at 3 months. Other risk factors for postoperative cognitive dysfunction include lower educational  level,  history  of  cerebrovascular  accident,  and poorer ability to perform the activities of daily living at baseline. Th ere is also evidence that longer time under anesthesia may be associated with a greater likelihood of development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Preexisting dementia, especially when mild, may be overlooked before surgery, but appears to be associated with higher rates of cognitive decline a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whether  general  anesthesia  causes  postoperative  cognitive dysfunction or simply unmasks a preexisting problem in unclear. Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain how general anesthesia might lead to postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Th ese include direct neurotoxicity via altered calcium  homeostasis,  increased β -amyloid  peptide  production with enhancement of endogenous neurodegeneration, neuroin fl ammatory assault triggered by surgically induced systemic

To  date  there  are  no  data  to  support  the  hypothesis  that volatile anesthetics administered at clinically relevant doses for clinically  relevant  durations  cause  neurotoxicity  in  humans. Further research is needed to ascertain the true incidence and severity of postoperative cognitive dysfunction and its association with anesthetic exposure if such an association exists. Until such research has been accomplished, there is no scienti fi c basis for recommending changes in current anesthetic practices or avoidance of speci fi c anesthetic agents. Th e goals of anesthesia are patient comfort and safety and the creation of optimal conditions for surgical procedures. Th e well-established bene fi ts of general anesthesia should not be relinquished without substantial clinical evidence.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ETHICAL CHALLENGES IN GERIATRIC ANESTHESIA AND PALLIATIVE CARE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ethical  principles  are  identical  for  all  adult  patient  populations.  Common  challenges  include  those  involving  patient autonomy, surrogate decision making, and do-not-resuscitate status in the hospital and in the operating room. Th e ultimate decision regarding which medical therapy is to be employed rests  with  the  patient. Th e  legal  doctrine  embodying  this principle is informed consent. Essential criteria for informed consent  include  provision  of  su ffi cient  information,  patient competence,  and  voluntary  decision  making  (Table  28-6). Patients with possible dementia should be referred for competency evaluations to assess mental function and decisionmaking  capacity.  If  the  patient  is  too  compromised  to  give consent, a surrogate should be identi fi ed based on a living will or a durable power of attorney. Each state has a legal procedure for appointing a proxy decision maker if these documents are not available.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cause and prognosis of cardiac arrest and the success rate of resuscitation are markedly di ff erent when the arrest occurs in the operating room than when it occurs outside it. However, informed consent for (or informed refusal of) medical intervention is guided by the same moral principles during endof-life care, regardless of location. To ensure that institutional legal  guidelines  are  followed,  each  anesthesiologist  should refer to his or her institution's protocols and policies regarding do-not-resuscitate status in the operating room and postanesthesia care unit. For high-risk surgical procedures, detailed discussions of the patient's preferences are well advised.

Th is care requires a multidisciplinary approach to treat symptoms, control pain, and address the psychologic, social, and spiritual needs of the patient and his or her family. By training, anesthesiologists are invaluable experts on pharmacologic and procedural pain management. Th ese  modalities  are  key  elements of successful palliative care.

SUMMARY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aging  is  a  multifactorial,  all-encompassing  process.  It  produces a gradual decline in the functional reserve of most of the major organ systems, which results in a decreased capacity for adaptation. Aging is not a disease but carries an increased potential  for  the  development  of  various  age-related  pathologic conditions. Th erefore, there is no one "ideal anesthetic" for  the  elderly  patient.  A  sound  understanding  of  agingrelated physiologic changes and the altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses of these patients helps the anesthesiologist  to  design  and  implement  an  optimal  anesthetic  plan  for  each  elderly  patient.  Since  this  patient  subgroup is not only physiologically but also physically fragile, these patients require special attention throughout the perioperative period to prolong life and maintain good function and quality of living, including incorporation of their wishes regarding end-of-life issues.
