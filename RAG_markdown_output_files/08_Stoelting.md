DISEASES OF THE THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL AORTA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diseases  of  the  aorta  are  most  o ft en  aneurysmal.  Occlusive disease is more likely to occur in peripheral arteries. Th e aorta and its major branches are a ff ected by two abnormalities that may be present simultaneously or occur at di ff erent stages of the same disease process (Table 8-1). An aneurysm is  a  dilation of all three layers of an artery. Th e most common de fi -nition is a 50% increase in diameter compared with normal. Arterial diameter depends on age, gender, and body habitus. Aneurysms  may  occasionally  produce  symptoms  because of  compression  of  surrounding  structures,  but  rupture  with exsanguination is the most dreaded complication, since only approximately 25% of patients who experience rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm survive. Aneurysms of the aorta may involve the ascending or descending portions of the thoracic aorta or the abdominal aorta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dissection of an artery occurs when blood enters the medial layer. Th e  media  of  large  arteries  is  made  up  of  organized lamellar  units  that  decrease  in  number  with  distance  from the heart. Th e initiating event of an aortic dissection is a tear in the intima. Blood surges through the intimal tear into an extraluminal channel called the false lumen. Blood in the false lumen can reenter the true lumen anywhere along the course of the dissection. Th e origins of aortic branch arteries arising

from the area involved in the dissection may be compromised and the aortic valve rendered incompetent. Th is sequence of events occurs over minutes to hours. A delay in diagnosis or treatment can be fatal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANEURYSMS AND DISSECTION OF THE THORACIC AORTA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Incidence

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of descending thoracic aneurysms is 5.9 to 10.4 per 100,000 person-years, and rupture occurs at a rate of 3.5 per 100,000 person-years. Although it is commonly accepted that  the  threshold  for  repair  is  a  diameter  of  6  cm  or  larger, one must be aware of the possibility of synchronous aneurysms involving the ascending aorta or arch, which occur in approximately 10% of patients. Dissection of the aorta can originate anywhere along the length of the aorta, but the most common points of origin are in the thorax, in the ascending aorta just above the aortic valve and just distal to the origin of the le ft subclavian artery near the insertion of the ligamentum arteriosum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Etiology

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most frequently implicated factors in the development of aortic  aneurysmal  disease  are  hypertension,  atherosclerosis, older age, male sex, family history of aneurysmal disease, and smoking. Causes of aortic dissection are deceleration injuries resulting  from  blunt  trauma  and  use  of  crack  cocaine,  and iatrogenic dissection may occur secondary to aortic cannulation  including  cardiac  catheterization,  cross-clamping,  aortic  manipulation, or arterial incision for surgical procedures such  as  aortic  valve  replacement,  bypass  gra ft ing,  or  aneurysm operations.  Systemic  hypertension  is  a  factor  that  can be implicated in both genetic and nongenetic causes. Aortic dissection is more common in men, but there is also an association with pregnancy. Approximately half of all aortic dissections in women younger than 40 years of age occur during pregnancy, usually in the third trimester.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th oracic aortic aneurysms and dissections associated with known  genetic  syndromes  are  well  described. Th ese  inherited diseases of blood vessels include both conditions a ff ecting  large  arteries  such  as  the  aorta  and  those  involving  the microvasculature. Four major inherited disorders are known to a ff ect major arteries. Th ese are Marfan's syndrome, EhlersDanlos syndrome, bicuspid aortic  valve,  and  nonsyndromic familial aortic dissection. Although it was once believed that mutant  connective  tissue  proteins  corrupted  proteins  from the normal allele (dominant negative e ff ect)  in  combination with normal wear and tear, it is now known that matrix proteins, in addition to showing speci fi c mechanical properties, have important roles in the homeostasis of the smooth muscle cells that produce them. Matrix proteins play a key metabolic function because of their ability to sequester and store bioactive  molecules,  and  participate  in  their  precisely  controlled activation  and  release.  In  the  inherited  disorders  associated with  aortic  dissection,  loss  of  this  function  (biochemical rather than mechanical) is thought to alter smooth muscle cell homeostasis. Th e end result is a change in matrix metabolism that causes structural weakness in the aorta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Marfan's syndrome is one of the most prevalent hereditary connective  tissue  disorders.  Its  inheritance  pattern  is  autosomal dominant. Marfan's syndrome is caused by mutations in  the fi brillin-1  gene.  Fibrillin  is  an  important  connective

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 8 VASCULAR DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
tissue protein in the capsule of the ocular lens, arteries, lung, skin, and dura mater. Fibrillin mutations can result in disease manifestations in each of these tissues. Because fi brillin is an integral  part  of  elastin,  the  recognition  of  the  mutations  in fi brillin led to the assumption that the clinical manifestations of Marfan's syndrome in the aorta were secondary to an inherent weakness of the aortic wall exacerbated by aging. However, histologic studies of the aortas of Marfan's syndrome patients also demonstrate abnormalities in matrix metabolism that can result in matrix destruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although the genetics of thoracic aortic aneurysm disease in patients with Marfan's syndrome are well documented, less is known about familial patterns of aneurysm occurrence not associated with any particular collagen or vascular disease. Up to 19% of people with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection do not have syndromes traditionally considered to predispose them to aortic disease. However, these individuals o ft en have several relatives with thoracic aortic aneurysm disease, which suggests a strong genetic predisposition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Bicuspid  aortic  valve is  the  most  common  congenital anomaly  resulting  in  aortic  dilation/dissection.  It  occurs  in 1% of the general population. Histologic studies show elastin degradation in the aorta just above the aortic valve. Echocardiography shows that aortic root dilation is common even in younger  patients  with  bicuspid  aortic  valve.  Bicuspid  aortic valve clusters in families and is found in approximately 9% of fi rst-degree relatives of a ff ected individuals.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome represents  a  group  of  connective tissue disorders associated with skin fragility, easy bruisability, and osteoarthritis. Th ere are several forms of the syndrome, but an increased risk of premature death occurs only in EhlersDanlos syndrome type IV. Th is vascular form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is caused by mutations in the type III procollagen gene. Type III collagen is abundant in the intestine and arterial  walls. Th e alteration in type III collagen associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV accounts for the most common clinical presentation of these patients, which is arterial dissection or intestinal rupture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nonsyndromic  familial  aortic  dissection  and  aneurysm is found  in  approximately  20%  of  patients  referred  for  repair of thoracic aneurysm or dissection. A ff ected families do not meet the clinical criteria for Marfan's syndrome and do not have biochemical abnormalities in type III collagen. In most of these families, the inheritance pattern appears to be dominant with variable penetrance. At least three chromosomal regions have so far been mapped in families with nonsyndromic thoracic aortic aneurysm disease. Th e speci fi c biochemical abnormalities  predisposing  to  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm  disease remain to be identi fi ed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Classification

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic aneurysms can be classi fi ed morphologically as either fusiform or saccular. In fusiform aneurysm there is a uniform dilation involving the entire circumference of the aortic wall, whereas a saccular  aneurysm  is  an  eccentric  dilation  of  the aorta that communicates with the main lumen by a variably sized  neck.  Aneurysms  can  also  be  classi fi ed  based  on  the pathologic features of the aortic wall (e.g., atherosclerosis or cystic medial necrosis).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Arteriosclerosis is the primary lesion associated with aneurysms in the infrarenal  abdominal  aorta,  thoracoabdominal aorta, and descending thoracic aorta. Aneurysms a ff ecting the ascending aorta are primarily the result of lesions that cause degeneration of the aortic media, a pathologic process termed cystic medial necrosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aneurysms  of  the  thoracoabdominal  aorta  may  also  be classi fi ed according to their anatomic location. Two classi fi cations  widely  used  for  aortic  dissection  are  the DeBakey and Stanford  classi fi cations (Figure  8-1). Th e  DeBakey  classi fi cation includes types I to III. In type I, the intimal tear originates in the ascending aorta and the dissection involves the ascending aorta, arch, and variable lengths of the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. In DeBakey type II, the dissection is con fi ned to the ascending aorta. In type III, the dissection is con fi ned to the descending thoracic aorta (type IIIa) or extends into the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries (type IIIb). Th e  Stanford  classi fi cation  describes  thoracic  aneurysms  as type A or B. Type A includes all cases in which the ascending aorta is involved by the dissection, with or without involvement of the arch or descending aorta. Type B includes all cases in which the ascending aorta is not involved.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signs and Symptoms

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Many  patients  with  thoracic  aortic  aneurysms  are  asymptomatic  at  the  time  of  presentation,  and  the  aneurysm  is detected during testing for other disorders. Symptoms resulting from thoracic aneurysm typically re fl ect impingement of the aneurysm on adjacent structures. Hoarseness results from stretching of the le ft recurrent laryngeal nerve. Stridor is due to compression of the trachea. Dysphagia is due to compression of the esophagus. Dyspnea results from compression of the lungs. Plethora and edema result from compression of the superior vena cava. Patients with ascending aortic aneurysms associated with dilation of the aortic valve annulus may have signs of aortic regurgitation and congestive heart failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute, severe, sharp pain in the anterior chest, the neck, or between the shoulder blades is the typical presenting symptom of thoracic aortic dissection. Th e pain may migrate as the dissection advances along the aorta. Patients with aortic dissection o ft en appear as if they are in shock (vasoconstricted), yet the systemic blood pressure may be quite elevated. Patients who have severe hypotension or even shock at presentation have a worse prognosis. Hypotension at presentation is more common  with  proximal  dissections.  Other  symptoms  and signs of acute aortic dissection, such as diminution or absence of peripheral pulses, re fl ect occlusion of branches of the aorta and  may  be  followed  by  inadequate  treatment  because  of falsely  low  blood  pressure  measurements.  Neurologic  complications  of  aortic  dissection  may  include  stroke  caused  by occlusion of a carotid artery, ischemic peripheral neuropathy

FIGURE 8-1 The two most widely used classifications of aortic dissection. The DeBakey classification includes three types: in type I, the intimal tear usually originates in the proximal ascending aorta and the dissection involves the ascending aorta and variable lengths of the aortic arch and descending thoracic and abdominal aorta; in type II, the dissection is confined to the ascending aorta; in type III, the dissection is confined to the descending thoracic aorta (type IIIa) or extends into the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries (type IIIb). The Stanford classification has two types: type A includes all cases in which the ascending aorta is involved by the dissection, with or without involvement of the arch or the descending aorta; type B includes cases in which the ascending aorta is not involved.

associated with ischemia of an arm or a leg, and paraparesis or paraplegia caused by impairment of the blood supply to the spinal cord. Myocardial infarction may re fl ect occlusion of a coronary artery. Gastrointestinal ischemia may occur. Renal artery obstruction is manifested by an increase in serum creatinine concentration. Retrograde dissection into the sinus of Valsalva with rupture into the pericardial space leading to cardiac tamponade is a major cause of death. Approximately 90% of patients with acute dissection of the ascending aorta who are not treated surgically die within 3 months.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Widening  of  the  mediastinum  on  chest  radiograph  may  be diagnostic  of  a  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm.  However,  enlargement of the ascending aorta may be con fi ned to the retrosternal area, so the aortic silhouette can appear normal. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to diagnose thoracic aortic disease, but in acute aortic  dissection,  the  diagnosis  is  most  rapidly  and  safely  made using echocardiography with color Doppler imaging. Although transthoracic echocardiography is the mainstay in evaluation of the heart, including evaluation for complications of dissection like aortic insu ffi ciency, pericardial e ff usions, and impaired regional le ft ventricular function, it is of somewhat limited value in assessment of the distal ascending, transverse, and descending  aorta.  Transesophageal  echocardiography,  on  the  other hand,  plays  an  essential  role  in  diagnosing  aortic  dissection because it is both highly sensitive and speci fi c (98% and 95%, respectively), has the advantage of using portable equipment, and can be performed as a single study, especially in patients in unstable condition. Angiography of the aorta may be required for patients undergoing elective surgery on the thoracic aorta so that the complete extent of the dissection and the location of all compromised aortic branches can be de fi ned.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because myocardial ischemia or infarction, respiratory failure, renal failure, and stroke are the principal causes of morbidity and mortality associated  with  surgery  of  the  thoracic  aorta, preoperative  assessment  of  the  function  of  the  corresponding organ systems is needed. Assessment for the presence of myocardial ischemia, previous myocardial infarction, valvular dysfunction, and heart failure is important in performing risk strati fi cation and in planning maneuvers for risk reduction. A preoperative percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass gra ft ing may be indicated in some patients with ischemic heart disease. Adjustment of drugs for manipulation of preload and a ft erload may be very advantageous in those with heart failure or signi fi cant aortic regurgitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cigarette smoking and the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease  are  important  predictors  of  respiratory failure a ft er thoracic aorta surgery. Spirometric tests of lung function and arterial blood gas analysis may better de fi ne this risk. Reversible airway obstruction and pulmonary infection should be treated with bronchodilators, antibiotics, and chest physiotherapy. Smoking cessation is very desirable.

Th e presence of preoperative renal dysfunction is the single most important predictor of the development of acute renal failure a ft er surgery on the thoracic aorta. Preoperative hydration  and  avoidance  of  hypovolemia,  hypotension,  low  cardiac output, and nephrotoxic drugs during the perioperative period are important to decrease the likelihood of postoperative renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Duplex  imaging  of  the  carotid  arteries  or  angiography of  the  brachiocephalic and intracranial arteries may be performed preoperatively in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Patients with severe stenosis of one or both common or internal carotid arteries could be considered for carotid endarterectomy before elective surgery on the thoracic aorta.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Indications for Surgery

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th oracic aortic aneurysm repair is an elective procedure considered when aneurysm size exceeds a diameter of 5 cm. Th is size limit may be raised somewhat for patients with a signi fi -cant family history, a previous diagnosis of any of the hereditable diseases that a ff ect blood vessels, or an aneurysm growth rate of 10 mm or more per year. A number of important technical advances have decreased the risk of surgery on the thoracic aorta. Th ese advances include the use of adjuncts such as distal aortic perfusion, profound hypothermia with circulatory arrest, monitoring of evoked potentials in the brain and spinal  cord,  and  cerebrospinal fl uid  drainage,  as  well  as  the rapid increase in endovascular procedures for aortic repairs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascending and aortic arch dissection requires emergent or urgent surgery. Descending thoracic aortic dissection is generally associated with better survival than a dissection involving the ascending aorta and is rarely treated with urgent surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TYPE A DISSECTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection is a consortium of 21 large referral centers around the world. Data of this  registry  have  shown  that  the  in-hospital  mortality  rate of patients with ascending aortic dissection is approximately 27% in those who undergo timely and successful surgery. Th is is in contrast to an in-hospital mortality rate of 56% in those treated medically. Other independent predictors of in-hospital death include older age, visceral ischemia, hypotension, renal failure, cardiac tamponade, coma, and pulse de fi cits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Long-term survival rate (i.e., survival at 1 to 3 years a ft er hospital  discharge)  is  90%  to  96%  in  the  surgically  treated group and 69% to 89% in those treated medically who survive the initial hospitalization. Th us, aggressive medical treatment and imaging surveillance of patients who, for various reasons, are unable to undergo surgery appears prudent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ascending Aorta

<!-- PAGE=? -->
All  patients  with  acute  dissection  involving  the  ascending  aorta  should  be  considered  candidates  for  surgery. Th e most  commonly  performed  procedures  are  replacement  of the  ascending  aorta  and  aortic  valve  with  a  composite  gra ft

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(a Dacron gra ft containing a prosthetic valve) or replacement of the ascending aorta and resuspension of the aortic valve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic Arch

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In patients with acute aortic arch dissection, resection of the aortic arch (i.e., the segment of aorta that extends from the origin of the innominate artery to the origin of the le ft subclavian artery) is indicated. Surgery on the aortic arch requires cardiopulmonary bypass, profound hypothermia, and a period of circulatory arrest. With current techniques, a period of circulatory arrest of 30 to 40 minutes at a body temperature of 15° to 18° C can be tolerated by most patients. Focal and di ff use neurologic de fi cits  are  the  major  complications  associated  with  replacement of the aortic arch. Th ese occur in 3% to 18% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TYPE B DISSECTION: DESCENDING THORACIC AORTA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For patients with degenerative or chronic aneurysms, elective resection  is  advisable  if  the  aneurysm  exceeds  5  to  6  cm  in diameter or if symptoms are present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with an acute but uncomplicated type B aortic dissection who have normal hemodynamics, no periaortic hematoma, and no branch vessel involvement at presentation can be treated with medical therapy. Such therapy consists of (1) intraarterial monitoring of systemic blood pressure and urinary output and (2) administration of drugs to control blood pressure and the force of le ft ventricular contraction. Short-acting β -blockers like esmolol and nitroprusside are commonly used for this purpose. Th is patient population has an in-hospital mortality rate of 10%. Long-term survival rate with medical therapy only is approximately 60% to 80% at 4 to 5 years and 40% to 50% at 10 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is indicated for patients with type B aortic dissection  who  have  signs  of  impending  rupture  (persistent  pain, hypotension,  le ft -sided  hemothorax);  ischemia  of  the  legs, abdominal viscera, or spinal cord; and/or renal failure. Surgical treatment of distal aortic dissection is associated with a 29% in-hospital mortality rate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
UNIQUE RISKS OF SURGERY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical resection of thoracic aortic aneurysms can be associated  with  a  number  of  serious,  even  life-threatening  complications. Th ere is the risk of spinal cord ischemia (anterior spinal artery syndrome) with resulting paraparesis or paraplegia. Cross-clamping and unclamping the aorta introduces the potential  for  adverse  hemodynamic responses such as myocardial ischemia and heart failure. Hypothermia, an important neuroprotective maneuver, can be responsible for the development of coagulopathy. Renal insu ffi ciency or renal failure occurs in up to 30% of patients. Approximately 6% of patients will require hemodialysis. Pulmonary complications are common;  the  incidence  of  respiratory  failure  approaches  50%. Cardiac complications are the leading cause of mortality.

Manifestations  of  anterior  spinal  artery  syndrome  include fl accid paralysis of the lower extremities and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Sensation and proprioception are spared.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Spinal Cord Blood Supply. Th e spinal cord is supplied by one anterior spinal artery and two posterior spinal arteries (see Figure 8-2). Th e anterior spinal artery begins at the fusion of branches of both vertebral arteries and relies on reinforcement of its blood supply by six to eight radicular arteries, the largest and most important of which is the great radicular artery of Adamkiewicz. Multiple levels of the spinal cord do not receive feeding radicular branches, which leaves watershed areas that are particularly susceptible to ischemic injury. Th ese areas are in jeopardy during aortic occlusion or hypotension. Damage can also result from surgical resection of the artery of Adamkiewicz (because the origin is unknown) or exclusion of the origin of the artery by the cross-clamp. In this situation, not only is the anterior spinal artery blood fl ow reduced directly, but the potential for collateral blood fl ow to the spinal cord is also reduced because aortic pressure distal to the cross-clamp is very low.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk Factors. Th e  risk  of  paraplegia  during  thoracic  aortic  surgery  is  determined  by  the  interaction  of  four  factors: (1) the decrease in spinal cord blood fl ow, (2) the rate of neuronal metabolism, (3) postischemia reperfusion, and (4) blow fl ow a ft er reperfusion. Th e duration of aortic cross-clamping is critical in determining the risk of paraplegia. A brief period of thoracic aortic cross-clamping (<30 minutes) is usually tolerated. If cross-clamp time is more than 30 minutes, the risk of  spinal  cord  ischemia  is  signi fi cant,  and  use  of  techniques for spinal cord protection is indicated. Th ese include partial circulatory assistance (le ft atrium-to-femoral artery bypass), reimplantation of critical intercostal arteries  when  possible,  cerebrospinal fl uid drainage, maintenance of proximal hypertension during cross-clamping, reduction of spinal cord metabolism by moderate hypothermia (30° to 32° C) including spinal cooling, avoidance of hyperglycemia, and the use of mannitol, corticosteroids, and/or calcium channel blockers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere is debate regarding the incidence of spinal cord ischemia a ft er endovascular repair. Although some studies report an incidence similar to that with open aortic surgery, others showed  a  lower  rate  with  endovascular  repair.  Nevertheless the incidence seems to be directly correlated with the severity of aortic disease. Th e theoretical reason is that although the respective vessel may be taken out of circulation, with endovascular repair as opposed to open repair, there is no dissection of other vessels that may represent important collateral fl ow, which ensures secularization of the spinal cord.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic Responses to Aortic Cross-Clamping

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th oracic aortic cross-clamping and unclamping are associated with severe hemodynamic and homeostatic disturbances in virtually all organ systems because of the decrease in blood fl ow  distal  to  the  aortic  clamp  and  the  substantial  increase in  blood fl ow above the level of aortic occlusion. Th ere  is  a substantial increase in systemic blood pressure and systemic vascular  resistance  with  no  signi fi cant  change  in  heart  rate. A  reduction  in  cardiac  output  usually  accompanies  these changes.  Systemic  hypertension  is  attributed  to  increased impedance  to  aortic  out fl ow  (increased  a ft erload).  In  addition, there is blood volume redistribution caused by collapse and constriction of the venous vasculature distal to the aortic cross-clamp. An increase in preload results. Evidence of this blood volume redistribution can be seen as an increase in fi lling  pressures  (central  venous  pressure,  pulmonary  capillary occlusion  pressure,  le ft ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure). Substantial di ff erences in the hemodynamic response to aortic cross-clamping can be seen at di ff erent levels of clamping: thoracic, supraceliac, and infrarenal. Changes in mean arterial pressure,  end-diastolic  and  end-systolic  le ft ventricular  area and ejection fraction, and wall motion abnormalities may be assessed by transesophageal echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheterization and are minimal during infrarenal aortic  cross-clamping  but  dramatic  during  intrathoracic  aortic cross-clamping. Some of these di ff erences result in part from di ff erent patterns of blood volume redistribution. Preload may not increase if the aorta is clamped distal to the celiac artery because the blood volume from the distal venous vasculature may be redistributed into the splanchnic circulation. For the increase in a ft erload and preload to be tolerated, an increase in myocardial  contractility  and  an  autoregulatory  increase  in coronary  blood fl ow  are  required.  If  coronary  blood fl ow and myocardial contractility cannot increase, le ft ventricular

<!-- PAGE=? -->
dysfunction is likely. Indeed, echocardiography o ft en indicates abnormal wall motion of the le ft ventricle during aortic crossclamping,  which  suggests  the  presence  of  myocardial  ischemia.  Hemodynamic responses to aortic cross-clamping are blunted in patients with aortoiliac occlusive disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pharmacologic interventions intended to o ff set the hemodynamic e ff ects of aortic cross-clamping, especially clamping of the thoracic aorta, are related to the e ff ects of the administered drug on arterial and/or venous capacitance. For example, vasodilators such as nitroprusside and nitroglycerin o ft en reduce the clamp-induced decrease in cardiac output and ejection fraction. Th e most plausible explanation for this e ff ect is a drug-induced decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a ft erload, and increased venous capacitance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It is important, however, to recognize that perfusion pressures distal to the aortic cross-clamp are decreased and are directly dependent on proximal aortic pressure, that is, the pressure  above  the  level  of  aortic  clamping.  Blood fl ow to tissues distal to aortic occlusion (kidneys, liver, spinal cord) occurs  through  collateral  vessels  or  through  a  shunt.  It decreases dramatically during aortic clamping. Blood fl ow to  vital  organs  distal  to  the  aortic  clamp  depends  on  perfusion pressure and not on cardiac output or intravascular volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinically, drugs and volume replacement must be adjusted to maintain distal aortic perfusion pressure even if that results in an increase in blood pressure proximal to the clamp. Strategies  for  myocardial  preservation  during  and  a ft er  aortic cross-clamping  include  decreasing  a ft erload  and  normalizing preload, coronary blood fl ow, and contractility. Modalities  such  as  placement  of  temporary  shunts,  reimplantation of  arteries  supplying  distal  tissues  (spinal  cord),  and  hypothermia may in fl uence the choice of drugs and end points of treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta just distal to the le ft subclavian artery is associated with severe decreases (approximately 90%) in spinal cord blood fl ow and renal blood fl ow, glomerular fi ltration rate, and urinary output. Infrarenal aortic cross-clamping is associated with a large increase in renal vascular resistance and a decrease (approximately 30%) in renal blood fl ow. Renal dysfunction results from renal hypoperfusion.  Renal  failure  following  aortic  surgery  is  almost  always due to acute tubular necrosis. Ischemia-reperfusion insults to the kidneys play a central role in the pathogenesis of this renal failure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta is associated not only with a decrease in distal aortic-anterior spinal artery pressure but also with an increase in cerebrospinal fl uid pressure. Presumably,  intracranial  hypertension  resulting  from  systemic hypertension  above  the  clamp  produces  redistribution  of blood volume and engorgement of the intracranial compartment  (intracranial  hypervolemia). Th is  results  in  a  redistribution of cerebrospinal fl uid into the spinal fl uid space and a decrease in the compliance of the spinal fl uid space. Cerebrospinal fl uid drainage may increase spinal cord blood fl ow and decrease the incidence of neurologic complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pulmonary damage associated with aortic cross-clamping and unclamping is re fl ected by an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (particularly with unclamping of the aorta), an increase in pulmonary capillary membrane permeability, and development of pulmonary edema. Th e mechanisms involved may include pulmonary hypervolemia and the e ff ects of various vasoactive mediators.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Aortic  cross-clamping  is  associated  with  formation  and release of hormonal factors (caused by activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system)  and  other  mediators  (prostaglandins,  oxygen-free radicals,  complement cascade). Th ese  mediators  may aggravate or blunt the harmful e ff ects of aortic cross-clamping and unclamping. Overall, injury to the spinal cord, lungs, kidneys, and abdominal viscera is principally due to ischemia and subsequent reperfusion injury caused by the aortic cross-clamp (local e ff ects) and/or the release of mediators from ischemic and reperfused tissues (distant e ff ects).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemodynamic Responses to Aortic Unclamping

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Unclamping of the thoracic aorta is associated with substantial decreases in systemic vascular resistance and systemic blood  pressure.  Cardiac  output  may  increase,  decrease,  or remain  unchanged.  Le ft ventricular  end-diastolic  pressure decreases,  and  myocardial  blood fl ow  increases.  Gradual release of the aortic clamp is recommended to allow time for volume replacement and to slow the washout of the vasoactive and cardiodepressant mediators from ischemic tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  principal  causes  of  unclamping  hypotension  include (1) central hypovolemia caused by pooling of blood in reperfused  tissues;  (2)  hypoxia-mediated  vasodilation,  which causes an increase in vascular capacitance in the tissues below the level of aortic clamping; and (3) accumulation of vasoactive  and  myocardial-depressant  metabolites  in  these  tissues. Vasodilation and hypotension may be further aggravated by the  transient  increase  in  carbon  dioxide  release  and  oxygen consumption in these tissues following unclamping. Correction of metabolic acidosis does not signi fi cantly in fl uence the degree of hypotension following aortic unclamping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  undergoing  thoracic aortic  aneurysm  resection  requires  consideration  of  monitoring  systemic  blood  pressure,  neurologic  function,  and intravascular volume and planning the pharmacologic interventions and hemodynamic management that will be needed to  control  hypertension  during  the  period  of  aortic  crossclamping.  Proper  monitoring  is  more  important  than  the selection of anesthetic drugs in these patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF BLOOD PRESSURE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  repair  of  a  thoracic  aortic  aneurysm  requires  aortic  cross-clamping just distal to the le ft subclavian artery or between the le ft subclavian artery and the le ft common carotid artery. Th erefore, blood pressure monitoring must be via an

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
artery in the right arm, since occlusion of the aorta can prevent measurement of blood pressure in the le ft arm. Monitoring blood pressure both above (right radial artery) and below (femoral artery) the aneurysm is less commonly done but may be useful. Th is approach permits assessment of cerebral, renal, and spinal cord perfusion pressure during cross-clamping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Blood fl ow to tissues below the aortic cross-clamp is dependent on perfusion pressure rather than on preload and cardiac output. Th erefore, during cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta, proximal aortic pressures should be maintained as high as the heart can safely withstand unless other modalities (such as temporary shunts or hypothermia) are implemented. Sympathomimetic or vasodilator drugs may be needed to adjust perfusion  pressure  above  and  below  the  level  of  the  aortic cross-clamp.  A  common  recommendation  is  to  maintain mean arterial pressure near 100 mm Hg above the cross-clamp and above 50 mm Hg in the areas distal to the cross-clamp.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e use of vasodilators to treat hypertension above the level of the aortic cross-clamp must be balanced against the likelihood of a decrease in perfusion pressure in the tissues below the  clamp.  Indeed,  nitroprusside  may  decrease  spinal  cord perfusion pressure, both by decreasing distal aortic pressure and by increasing cerebrospinal fl uid  pressure  as  a  result  of cerebral vasodilation (see Figure 8-2). It is prudent to limit the use of drugs that decrease proximal aortic pressure and cause cerebral vasodilation. Use of temporary shunts to bypass the occluded  thoracic  aorta  (proximal  aorta-to-femoral  artery or  le ft atrium-to-femoral artery shunts) may be considered when attempting to maintain renal and spinal cord perfusion. Partial cardiopulmonary bypass is another option to maintain distal aortic perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF NEUROLOGIC FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Somatosensory  evoked  potentials  and  electroencephalography  are  monitoring  methods  for  evaluating  central  nervous system  viability  during  the  period  of  aortic  cross-clamping. Unfortunately,  intraoperative  monitoring  of  somatosensory evoked  potentials  is  not  completely  reliable  for  detecting spinal cord ischemia during aortic surgery, because somatosensory  evoked  potential  monitoring  re fl ects  dorsal  column (sensory tract) function. Ischemic changes in anterior spinal cord function (motor tracts) are not detected. Monitoring of motor evoked potentials would indicate anterior spinal cord function but is impractical since it prohibits use of neuromuscular blocking drugs. Spinal cooling with epidural instillation of iced saline during cross-clamping in thoracic aneurysm surgery has been employed successfully for many years in some institutions across the United States on the basis that lowering the spinal cord temperature directly will improve the recovery of potentially poorly perfused tissues a ft er reimplantation of patent critical intercostal vessels by the surgeon. Nevertheless, spinal drainage has been used to decrease pressure around the spinal cord and avoid ischemia in a con fi ned space if the spinal cord dilates a ft er adequate perfusion is reestablished. Th e cerebrospinal fl uid pressure is also maintained at a value of less than 10 cm H 2 O in the days immediately a ft er surgery for the same reason, namely, that an increase in pressure in the spinal canal may decrease perfusion to the spinal cord and impair motor function. Another method that can be useful is atriofemoral bypass to maintain distal aortic perfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF CARDIAC FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During  operations  on  the  thoracic  aorta,  transesophageal echocardiography  can  provide  valuable  information  about the presence of atherosclerosis in the thoracic aorta, the competence of cardiac valves, ventricular function, the adequacy of  myocardial  perfusion,  and  the  intravascular  volume  status.  A  pulmonary  artery  catheter  provides  data  that  may complement the information obtained from transesophageal echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MONITORING OF INTRAVASCULAR VOLUME AND RENAL FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Optimization of systemic hemodynamics, including circulating blood volume, represents the most e ff ective measure for protecting the kidneys from the ischemic e ff ects produced by aortic cross-clamping. Use of diuretics such as mannitol before aortic clamping may also be useful. Mannitol improves renal cortical blood fl ow and glomerular fi ltration rate. Endothelial swelling is decreased, and an osmotic diuresis occurs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal protection is achieved by direct instillation of renal preservation fl uid (4° C lactated Ringer's solution with 25 g of  mannitol  per  liter  and  1  g  methylprednisolone  per  liter) and can be administered directly by the surgeon into the renal artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the future, speci fi c antagonists of hormonal and humoral factors that are formed and released from ischemic tissues during and a ft er the period of aortic cross-clamping may become available to prevent or ameliorate vital organ ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
INDUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Induction  of  anesthesia  and  tracheal  intubation  must  minimize undesirable increases in systemic blood pressure, which could exacerbate an aortic dissection or rupture an aneurysm. Use of a double-lumen endobronchial tube permits collapse of the le ft lung and facilitates surgical exposure during resection of a thoracic aneurysm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General anesthesia can be maintained with volatile anesthetics  and/or  opioids.  General  anesthesia  may  cause  some reduction in cerebral metabolic rate, which may be particularly desirable during this surgery. Th e  choice of neuromuscular blocking drug may be in fl uenced by the dependence of a particular drug on renal clearance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Posterolateral thoracotomy is among the most painful of surgical incisions because major muscles are transected and ribs are removed. In addition, chest tube insertion sites can be very painful.  Amelioration  of  pain  is  essential  to  ensure  patient comfort and to facilitate  coughing  and  maneuvers  designed to  prevent  atelectasis.  Pain  relief  is  commonly  provided  by

<!-- PAGE=? -->
neuroaxial opioids and/or local anesthetics. Intrathecal or epidural catheters providing intermittent or continuous infusion of analgesic medications can be adapted to provide an element of patient-controlled analgesia as well. Inclusion of local anesthetic drugs in these solutions may produce sensory and motor anesthesia and delay recognition of anterior spinal artery syndrome. Moreover, when a neurologic de fi cit is recognized, the epidural drug may be implicated as the cause of the paraplegia. If neuraxial analgesia is used in the period immediately a ft er surgery, opioids are preferred over local anesthetics to prevent masking of anterior spinal artery syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients recovering from thoracic aortic aneurysm resection are at risk of developing cardiac, pulmonary, and renal failure  during  the  immediately  postoperative  period.  In  the majority of clinical series, postoperative pulmonary complications are the most common, representing 25% to 45% of cases. Cerebrovascular accidents may result from air or thrombotic emboli  that  occur  during  surgical  resection  of  the  diseased aorta.  Patients  with  co-existing  cerebrovascular  disease  may be more vulnerable to the development of new central nervous system complications. Spinal cord injury may manifest during the  period  immediately  a ft er  surgery  as  paraparesis  or fl accid paralysis. Delayed appearance of paraplegia (12 hours to 21 days postoperatively) has been associated with postoperative  hypotension  in  patients  with  severe  atherosclerotic  disease in whom marginally adequate collateral circulation to the spinal cord is present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic hypertension is not uncommon and may jeopardize the integrity of the surgical repair and/or predispose to myocardial ischemia. Th e role of pain in the development of hypertension must be considered. Institution of antihypertensive therapy with drugs such as nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, and labetalol may be appropriate. Some patients bene fi t from concomitant administration of β -blockers to attenuate manifestations of a hyperdynamic circulation.

ANEURYSMS OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abdominal aortic aneurysms have traditionally been viewed as resulting from atherosclerosis. Th is atherosclerosis involves several  highly  interrelated  processes,  including  lipid  disturbances,  platelet  activation,  thrombosis,  endothelial  dysfunction, in fl ammation, oxidative stress, vascular smooth muscle cell  activation,  altered  matrix  metabolism,  remodeling,  and genetic factors. Atherosclerosis represents a response to vessel wall injury caused by processes such as infection, in fl ammation,  increased  protease  activity  within  the  arterial  wall, genetically  regulated  defects  in  collagen  and fi brillin,  and mechanical factors. Th e primary event in the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is proteolytic degradation of the  extracellular  matrix  proteins  elastin  and  collagen.  Various  proteolytic  enzymes,  including  matrix  metalloproteinases,  play  critical  roles  during  degradation  and  remodeling of  the  aortic  wall.  Oxidative  stress,  lymphocytic  and  monocytic in fi ltration with immunoglobulin deposition in the aortic wall, and biomechanical wall stress also contribute to the formation and rupture of aneurysms. A familial component has also been identi fi ed, because 12% to 19% of fi rst-degree relatives (usually men) of a patient with an abdominal aortic aneurysm will develop an aneurysm. Speci fi c genetic markers and biochemical changes that produce this pathologic condition remain to be elucidated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually detected as asymptomatic, pulsatile abdominal masses. Abdominal ultrasonography is a very sensitive test for the detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. CT is also very sensitive and is more accurate than ultrasonography in estimating aneurysm size.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Improvements  in  CT  technology,  such  as  the  advent  of helical CT and CT angiography, have increased the role of CT imaging in the evaluation and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Helical CT provides excellent three-dimensional anatomic detail  and  is  particularly  useful  for  evaluating  the feasibility of endovascular stent gra ft repair of the aneurysm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MRI is useful for accurate measurement of aneurysm size and evaluation of relevant vascular anatomy without the need for the use of ionizing radiation or contrast medium.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgery is usually recommended for abdominal aortic aneurysms larger than 5.5 cm in diameter. Th is recommendation is based on clinical studies indicating that the risk of rupture within a 5-year period is 25% to 41% for aneurysms larger than 5  cm.  Smaller  aneurysms  are  less  likely  to  rupture.  Patients with aneurysms of less than 5.0 cm in diameter should be followed  with  serial  ultrasonography. Th ese  recommendations are  only  guidelines.  Each  patient  must  be  evaluated  for  the presence of risk factors for accelerated aneurysm growth and rupture, such as tobacco use and family history. If the abdominal aortic aneurysm expands by more than 0.6 to 0.8 cm per year, repair is usually recommended. Surgical risk and overall health are also part of the evaluation to determine the timing of aneurysm repair. Endovascular aneurysm repair is an alternative to surgical repair.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Preoperative Evaluation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Co-existing  medical  conditions,  especially  coronary  artery disease,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  and  renal dysfunction,  are  important  to  identify  preoperatively  in  an attempt  to  minimize  postoperative  complications.  Myocardial  ischemia  or  infarction  is  responsible  for  most  postoperative deaths following elective abdominal aortic aneurysm resection. Other postoperative cardiac events include cardiac dysrhythmias and congestive heart failure. Preoperative evaluation of cardiac function might include exercise or pharmacologic  stress  testing  with  or  without  echocardiography  or radionuclide imaging. Severe reductions in vital capacity and forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second  and  abnormal  renal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Rupture of an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  classic  triad  (hypotension,  back  pain,  and  a  pulsatile abdominal  mass)  is  present  in  only  approximately  half  of patients  who  have  a  ruptured  abdominal  aortic  aneurysm. Renal  colic,  diverticulitis,  and  gastrointestinal  hemorrhage may be confused with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most abdominal aortic aneurysms rupture into the le ft retroperitoneum. Although hypovolemic shock may be present, exsanguination may be prevented by clotting and the tamponade e ff ect of the retroperitoneum. Euvolemic resuscitation may be deferred until the aortic rupture is surgically controlled in the operating room, because euvolemic resuscitation and the resultant increase in blood pressure without surgical control of bleeding may lead to loss of retroperitoneal tamponade, further bleeding, hypotension, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients in unstable condition who have a suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm require immediate operation and control of the proximal aorta without preoperative con fi rmatory testing or optimal volume resuscitation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia for resection of an abdominal aortic aneurysm requires consideration of commonly associated medical conditions in this patient group: ischemic heart disease,  hypertension,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction. Monitoring of intravascular volume and cardiac, pulmonary, and renal function is  essential  during  the  perioperative  period.  Systemic  blood pressure is monitored continuously by an intraarterial catheter.  Pulmonary  artery  catheterization  is  indicated  in  most patients, because it is not always possible to predict whether central venous pressure will parallel le ft ventricular fi lling pressure, particularly in patients with previous myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or congestive heart failure. If appropriate personnel and equipment are available, echocardiography can be  very  useful  for  evaluating  the  cardiac  response  to  aortic cross-clamping and unclamping, and assessing le ft ventricular fi lling  volume and regional and global myocardial function. Urine output is monitored continuously.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No single anesthetic drug or technique is ideal for all patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Combinations of volatile anesthetics and/or opioids are commonly used with or without nitrous oxide. Continuous epidural anesthesia combined with general anesthesia may o ff er advantages by decreasing overall anesthetic drug requirements, attenuating the increased systemic vascular resistance associated with aortic cross-clamping, and facilitating postoperative pain management. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that the combination  of  epidural  anesthesia  and  general  anesthesia  decreases postoperative cardiac or pulmonary morbidity compared with general  anesthesia  alone  in  high-risk  patients  who  undergo aortic surgery. Postoperative epidural analgesia may favorably in fl uence the  postoperative  course,  however.  Administration of anticoagulants during abdominal aortic surgery raises the controversial issue of placement of an epidural catheter and the remote risk of epidural hematoma formation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  undergoing  abdominal  aortic  aneurysm  repair usually experience signi fi cant fl uid and blood losses. Administration of a combination of balanced salt and colloid solutions (and  blood  if  needed)  guided  by  appropriate  monitoring  of cardiac and renal function facilitates maintenance of adequate intravascular  volume,  cardiac  output,  and  urine  formation. Balanced salt and/or colloid solutions should be infused during aortic cross-clamping to build up an intravascular volume reserve  and  thereby  minimize  unclamping  hypotension.  If urinary output is decreased despite adequate fl uid and blood replacement,  diuretic  therapy  with  mannitol  or  furosemide might be considered. Th e  e ffi cacy  of  low-dose  dopamine  in preserving renal function during abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery is unproven.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Infrarenal aortic cross-clamping and unclamping are signi fi cant  events  during  abdominal  aortic  surgery. Th e  anticipated consequences of abdominal aortic cross-clamping include  increased  systemic  vascular  resistance  (a ft erload) and decreased venous return (see the earlier section on the hemodynamic  responses  to  aortic  cross-clamping).  O ft en myocardial performance and circulatory parameters remain acceptable a ft er the aorta is clamped at an infrarenal level. An alteration in anesthetic depth or infusion of vasodilators may be necessary in some patients to maintain myocardial performance at acceptable levels.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension  may  occur  when  the  aortic  cross-clamp  is removed (see the earlier section on hemodynamic responses to  aortic  unclamping).  Prevention  of  unclamping  hypotension and maintenance of a stable cardiac output can o ft en be achieved  by  volume  loading  to  pulmonary  capillary  occlusion pressures higher than normal before the cross-clamp is removed. Likewise, gradual opening of the aortic cross-clamp may  minimize  the  decrease  in  systemic  blood  pressure  by allowing some pooled venous blood to return to the central circulation. Th e  washout  of  acid  metabolites  from  ischemic areas below the cross-clamp when the clamp is released plays a much less important role than central hypovolemia in producing unclamping hypotension, and sodium bicarbonate pretreatment does not reliably blunt unclamping hypotension. If hypotension persists for more than a few minutes a ft er removal of the cross-clamp, the presence of unrecognized bleeding or inadequate volume replacement must be considered. Echocardiography at this time may be particularly helpful in determining the adequacy of volume replacement and cardiac function.

patency  and  lower-extremity  blood fl ow  is  important.  Adequate pain control accomplished with either neuraxial opioids or patient-controlled analgesia is very important in facilitating early tracheal extubation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Systemic hypertension is common during the postoperative period and may be more likely in patients with preoperative hypertension. Overzealous intraoperative hydration and/ or  postoperative  hypothermia  with  compensatory  vasoconstriction may exacerbate postoperative hypertension. Postoperative hypertension should be treated either by eliminating the speci fi c cause if identi fi ed or by initiating antihypertensive therapy. Preoperative administration of clonidine may attenuate hypertension during the postoperative period.

ENDOVASCULAR AORTIC ANEURYSM REPAIR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endovascular placement of intraluminal stent gra ft s to treat patients  with  aneurysms  of  the  descending  thoracic  aorta may be particularly useful in the elderly and in those with co-existing medical conditions such as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal insu ffi ciency that would  signi fi cantly  increase  the  risks  associated  with  conventional  operative  treatment.  Endovascular  treatment  of aortic aneurysms is achieved by transluminal placement of one or more stent gra ft devices across the longitudinal extent of  the  lesion. Th e  prosthesis bridges the aneurysmal sac to exclude  it  from  high-pressure  aortic  blood fl ow,  thereby allowing  for  sac  thrombosis  around  the  stent  and  possible remodeling of the aortic wall. Endovascular repair o ff ers the bene fi t of aneurysm exclusion without causing the signi fi cant physiologic  changes  that  occur  during  cross-clamping  (see earlier discussion).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Currently,  endovascular  aneurysm  repair  of  the  intrathoracic aorta has been focused on the descending thoracic aorta, that is, the portion distal to the le ft subclavian artery. Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta poses several unique challenges compared with endovascular repair of the abdominal  aorta.  First,  the  hemodynamic  forces  are  signi fi cantly more severe and place greater mechanical demands on thoracic endogra ft s. Th e potential for device migration, kinking, and late  structural  failure  is  an  important  concern.  Second, greater fl exibility is  required of thoracic devices to conform to the natural curvature of the proximal descending aorta and to  lesions  with  tortuous  morphology. Th ird,  because  larger devices  are  necessary  to  accommodate  the  diameter  of  the thoracic  aorta,  arterial  access  is  more  problematic.  Fourth, as  with  conventional  open  thoracic  aneurysm  repair,  paraplegia remains a potential complication of the endovascular approach despite the absence of aortic cross-clamping. Fi ft h, visceral and renal ischemia still can occur if the celiac axis is occluded by the gra ft .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Over the past decade, many endovascular devices to repair abdominal aortic aneurysms have been developed (Figure 8-3). Endovascular repair involves gaining access to the lumen of the abdominal aorta, usually via small incisions over the femoral vessels. Although each device has unique features, all employ the same basic structural design. Th e endovascular devices are composed of a metal stent (made of nitinol, stainless steel, or Elgiloy) covered with fabric (polyester or polytetra fl uoroethylene). Th ere are two types of devices: unibody and modular. Th e unibody type comes in one piece and is easier to deploy, but requires contralateral occlusion and bypass gra ft ing. Th e modular devices  are  composed  of  more  than  one  piece  and the components are deployed through both groin areas. Since there is so much variability in patient anatomy, it is di ffi cult to fi nd a single gra ft that will be adequate to cover an aneurysm. Th at is the reason why most surgeons use multipart gra ft s that interlock and provide a better fi t.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e literature on thoracic stent gra ft ing consists mostly of reports of small- to medium-sized case series with short- to medium-term follow-up.  All  these  studies  show  a  common pattern of outcomes. Overall, successful device deployment is achieved in 85% to 100% of cases and perioperative mortality ranges from 0% to 14%, falling within or below elective surgery mortality rates of 5% to 20%. Outcomes have improved over time with accumulated technical expertise, technologic advances in the devices, and improved patient selection criteria. Current reported experience with thoracic stent gra ft ing demonstrates successful deployment in 87% of cases, 30-day mortality of 1.9% to 2.1% in elective cases, and paraplegia and endoleak rates of 4% to 9%. Survival at 1, 5, and 8 years is 82%, 49%, and 27%, respectively. Th erefore, mortality at 3 or 4 years is nearly identical in patients receiving stent gra ft s and in those undergoing open aneurysm repair. Other authors describe an approximately 98% rate of freedom from aneurysm rupture at 9 years in a cohort of 817 patients undergoing stenting, but a  high  rate  of  death  (47%  survival  at  8  years)  from  comorbid  medical  diseases,  especially  cardiovascular  events,  even though patients were evaluated preoperatively with stress testing and revascularization was performed if needed. Th ere are no randomized studies comparing endovascular repair with the  open  procedure.  Nevertheless,  the  overall  trend  is  that endovascular procedures are associated with lower perioperative mortality, and the endovascular approach o ff ers patients shorter hospital stay, quicker rehabilitation, and longer average  number  of  months  lived  resulting  from  the  decrease  in preoperative mortality. Even if the results of the open procedure are more durable, it is associated with major postoperative  complications;  therefore,  with  the  development  of  new types of gra ft s, the endovascular approach will most probably become the primary method of aortic aneurysmal repair when anatomic conditions are optimal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications associated with endogra ft s include endoleaks; vascular injury during gra ft deployment; inadequate fi xation and sealing of the gra ft to the wall, which may lead to migration of the gra ft ; stent frame fractures; and breakdown of gra ft material.  A ft er  the  gra ft has  been  deployed,  the  aneurysm eventually will thrombose and decrease in diameter.

Th ere  are  several  types  of  endoleaks.  Type  I  occurs  in approximately 0% to 10% of aortic aneurysms repairs, commonly at  the  proximal  or  distal  stent  attachment  site.  Some authors recommend subclassi fi cation of these endoleaks into type IA proximal and type IB distal. Type I endoleaks are serious and require expeditious intervention, since they represent a direct communication between the aneurysm sac and aortic blood fl ow. Treatment options include transcatheter coil or glue embolization, balloon angioplasty, placement of endovascular gra ft extensions, and open surgical repair. Type II endoleaks are the most common with an incidence of 10% to 25% and are described as collections of contrast outside the gra ft but within the  aneurysm  because  of fl ow from patent collateral  branch vessels, usually originating from inferior mesenteric and lumbar arteries. Management is controversial because spontaneous resolution occurs in 30% to 100% of cases, but if the aneurysm sac is expanding then these endoleaks must be repaired, either via a transarterial approach or by direct translumbar endoleak puncture. Type III endoleaks represent leakage into the aneurysm from tears in  the  gra ft fabric  or  stent  gra ft fractures.  Type  IV

endoleak is a diagnosis of exclusion, and these leaks are due to fl ow through the pores of the gra ft material.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Device migration is one of the most common causes of a need for secondary intervention, because if such migration is le ft unmanaged, it may lead to endoleaks, aneurysm expansion, and rupture.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Reinterventions are part of late complications and, although minor, are more common a ft er endovascular repair (9% of cases) than a ft er open repair (1.7%); however, repeat laparotomy and hospitalizations are more common a ft er open surgical repair (9.7% vs. 4.1%). Most practitioners do not consider the requirement for a secondary intervention to represent a failure. Nevertheless, patients must be aware that they will require life-long surveillance.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several other important aspects must be considered by the surgeon in evaluating for endovascular repair in addition to aneurysm diameter and rate of increase. For example, the socalled landing zones, represented by the proximal and distal seal zones, must be at least 2 cm in length to ensure adequate fi xation of the gra ft .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Although  endovascular  repair  does  not  require  a  period of  aortic  clamping,  the  possibility  of  spinal  cord  ischemia still exists because of exclusion of important intercostal arteries. Th ere is no role for epidural cooling, but spinal drainage may o ff er some bene fi ts in individuals at high risk. Th ese may include patients with prior aortic repair (usually infrarenal), those  with  aortic  dissections,  and  those  with  stable  aortic ruptures. In patients in unstable condition the drain may be placed postoperatively.

Several centers report occlusion of the le ft subclavian artery without  any  apparent  side  e ff ects.  However,  a  report  of  the Eurostar  registry  indicated  that  patients  who  had  occlusion of the le ft subclavian artery experienced a higher incidence of paraplegia, so some surgeons are now performing elective preaneurysm repair of the le ft subclavian artery.

Consideration of the risk of intraabdominal ischemia is an important aspect, especially when the celiac artery is occluded by the gra ft . Although this is not the optimal course, the superior  mesenteric  artery  may  provide  adequate  collateral fl ow, especially if the gastroduodenal artery is patent, but there is no exact method to determine if this will be adequate.

Bifurcated gra ft s are under development that will be used in the near future to achieve aneurysm exclusion with preservation of fl ow to important vessels such as the celiac and renal arteries when the aneurysms involves their origins.

Anesthetic Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General or regional anesthesia is acceptable for endovascular aneurysm repair. Monitoring consists of at least  intravascular blood pressure and urine output monitoring. Th e potential need for conversion to an open aneurysm repair must always be kept in mind. Large-bore intravenous access and availability of blood are still important concerns. Spinal drain placement is  a  consideration for thoracic aneurysm repair a ft er discussion with the surgeon (see earlier discussion). Maintenance of euvolemia and normotension are important.

Administration  of  heparin  and  veri fi cation  of  activated clotting  time  are  still  the  mainstay,  as  in  any  other  vascular procedure.

Postoperative Management

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative management depends on numerous physiologic and  procedural  variables.  Commonly,  patients  undergoing higher thoracic aortic repair will be cared for in an intensive care unit until all perioperative concerns have been resolved, including the possibility of ischemia, acidosis, ongoing respiratory  failure,  and  cardiac  problems.  Patients  undergoing lower abdominal aortic repair still  must  be  followed  closely with particular attention to the development or worsening of renal dysfunction, even if it is transitory because of intravenous dye administration.

CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE AND STROKE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cerebrovascular  accidents  (strokes)  are  characterized  by sudden neurologic de fi cits  resulting  from  ischemic  or  hemorrhagic events. Carotid artery disease is an important contributor  to  stroke  risk.  Anesthesiologists  frequently  manage anesthesia in patients with carotid diseases, both for carotid surgery and for other surgical procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Epidemiology and Risk Factors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the United States, approximately 3% of adults have experienced a stroke. It is the leading cause of disability and the third leading cause of death in the United States. Strokes are classi fi ed as either ischemic (most commonly thrombotic or embolic  in  origin)  or  hemorrhagic  (secondary  to  vascular malformation, trauma, or coagulopathy). Approximately 87% of  all  strokes  are  ischemic.  Transient  ischemic  attacks  are  a subset of self-limited ischemic strokes and present as a sudden,  focal  neurologic  de fi cit  that  resolves  within  24  hours. Transient  ischemic  attacks  o ft en  herald  an  impending  ischemic stroke, and individuals experiencing transient ischemic attacks have a 10 times greater risk of subsequent stroke than age- and sex-matched populations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Neurologic de fi cits following intracranial arterial occlusion are o ft en extensive, re fl ecting the large areas of brain supplied by the major arteries and their branches. Six months a ft er an ischemic stroke, fully one quarter of survivors over 65 years of age will be institutionalized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Major risk factors for stroke are listed in Table 8-2. Although anesthesiologists  may  play  a  role  in  educating  patients  with modi fi able health risk factors such as smoking or hypertension, the anesthetic management of patients who have already developed cerebrovascular disorders, including advanced carotid disease, is a common challenge for the specialty.

Cerebrovascular Anatomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e blood supply to the brain (20% of cardiac output) is brought through the neck via two pairs of blood vessels: the internal carotid arteries and the vertebral arteries, which join into the basilar artery (Figure 8-4). Th ese vessels join in the circle of Willis to form major intracranial blood vessels (anterior cerebral arteries, middle cerebral arteries, posterior cerebral arteries). Occlusion of a speci fi c major intracranial artery results in a constellation of predictable clinical neurologic de fi cits.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e major branches of the vertebral arteries are the arteries to the spinal cord and the posteroinferior cerebellar arteries that supply the inferior cerebellum and lateral medulla. Th e two  vertebral  arteries  then  unite  to  form  the  basilar  artery. Occlusion of the vertebral arteries or basilar artery results in signs  and  symptoms that depend on the level of the infarction. Th e basilar artery terminates by dividing into two posterior cerebral arteries, which supply the medial temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and parts of the thalamus.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnostic Tests

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Conventional  angiography  can  demonstrate  acute  vascular occlusion from a thrombus or embolus lodged in the vascular tree. Th e vasculature can also be visualized noninvasively by CT angiography and magnetic resonance angiography. In addition to identifying ischemic stroke, these modalities can also identify aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations that may be the precipitant for hemorrhagic stroke. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can provide indirect evidence of major vascular occlusion and o ff ers the advantage of real-time bedside monitoring in patients undergoing thrombolytic therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the evaluation of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, auscultation of the carotid arteries may identify a bruit. Carotid  ultrasonography  can  quantify  carotid  stenosis  and

may rarely identify a dissection. Carotid stenosis most commonly occurs at the bifurcation of the internal and external carotid  arteries  because  of  the  tendency  for  turbulent fl ow at  this  branch point. Even in the presence of known carotid stenosis,  workup  of  an  intracranial  embolic  event  includes evaluation for cardiac sources of emboli such as intraluminal thrombi (secondary to heart failure or atrial fi brillation), valvular vegetations, or paradoxical emboli in the setting of a patent foramen ovale.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of Stroke

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved intravenous  administration  of  recombinant  tissue  plasminogen activator within 3 hours of stroke onset, once the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is established and in the absence of contraindications. Th e American Heart Association has subsequently expanded that recommended window to 4.5 hours. In qualifying patients, the number needed to treat with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for one additional favorable outcome is approximately 10. Some stroke centers with access to interventional neuroradiology may o ff er intraarterial thrombolysis or endovascular clot removal, particularly in cases of persistent thrombus. As a treatment modality, low-frequency transcranial ultrasound-mediated thrombolysis has also been investigated in adjunctive treatment of middle cerebral artery occlusion.

Regardless  of  thrombolytic  e ff orts,  the  importance  of evaluating for and avoiding hypoxia is paramount, as are the control  of  glycemic  derangements,  hyperthermia,  hypotension, severe hypertension, and unstable arrhythmias. Speci fi c hemodynamic goals for patients with acute stroke undergoing thrombolysis or neuroradiologic procedures depend on a variety of patient-speci fi c factors, but the overarching need to preserve or restore perfusion of at-risk brain tissue is universal. Outside the acute setting, medical management of strokes in general overlaps with the medical management of carotid stenosis discussed in the next section.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid Endarterectomy

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical  treatment  of  symptomatic  carotid  artery  stenosis greatly  decreases  the  risk  of  stroke  compared  with  medical management in men with severe carotid stenosis (70% to 99% luminal stenosis)  and  modestly  reduces  stroke  risk  in  those with  50%  to  69%  luminal  narrowing.  Strokes  and  transient ischemic attacks caused by carotid stenosis occur as a result of atheroembolic phenomena or hemodynamically signi fi cant pressure drops across the stenosis in the absence of su ffi cient collateral cerebral blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  advisability  of  surgical  treatment  for  asymptomatic carotid  disease  varies  based  on  the  expected  periprocedural risk and associated patient comorbid conditions. Th e absolute risk reduction in stroke is small (approximately 1% per year for the fi rst few years) but is higher with longer-term followup. A suggested guideline has been to recommend surgery for asymptomatic carotid disease only for patients and at centers for  which  the  expected  periprocedural  complication  rates are 3% or less. In patients foregoing surgical treatment, optimal medical therapy includes smoking cessation, antiplatelet therapy,  aggressive  blood  pressure  control,  physical  activity, and both dietary and pharmacologic lipid-lowering strategies. Hypoglycemic  medications  for  diabetic  patients  as  well  as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are also bene fi cial.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  addition  to  undergoing  a  neurologic  evaluation,  patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy should be examined for signi fi cant  comorbid  conditions,  particularly  cardiovascular disease. Perioperative myocardial infarction is a major cause of morbidity and mortality following carotid endarterectomy, and predisposing coronary artery disease is highly prevalent among  patients  with  cerebrovascular  occlusive  disease. Th e reported  incidence  of  perioperative  myocardial  infarction in this population depends on the threshold and method of surveillance but was 2.3% among symptomatic patients who underwent endarterectomy in the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic  essential  hypertension  is  a  common fi nding  in patients with cerebrovascular disease. It is useful to establish the usual range of blood pressure for each patient preoperatively to  provide a guide for acceptable perfusion pressures during anesthesia and surgery. Intraoperative stability of chronically elevated  blood  pressure  may  be  critical  for  maintenance  of collateral blood fl ow through the stenotic cranial vasculature, especially  during  cross-clamping  of  the  carotid  artery. Th e e ff ect of a change in head position on cerebral function should also be ascertained. Extreme head rotation, fl exion, or extension  in  patients  with  co-existing  vertebral  or  carotid  artery disease could lead to angulation or compression of the artery. Recognition of this response preoperatively allows hazardous head positions to be avoided while patients are anesthetized.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  known  severe  coronary  artery  disease  and severe  carotid  occlusive  disease  present  a  clinical  dilemma. A staged surgical approach in which carotid endarterectomy is  performed fi rst  could  result  in  signi fi cant  morbidity  or mortality from cardiac causes. On the other hand, performing coronary revascularization fi rst is associated with a high incidence of stroke. Insu ffi cient evidence exists to make general guidelines, and the timing of surgical procedures should instead be individualized based on the severity and symptomatic pro fi le of each patient.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management for carotid endarterectomy mandates careful control of heart rate, blood pressure, pain, and stress responses  so  that  organ  perfusion  is  maintained  in  patients with  a  high  preoperative  risk  of  cardiac  and  cerebral  ischemic events. In addition, at the conclusion of surgery, the goal should be to awaken the patient su ffi ciently for a neurologic examination.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid endarterectomy can be performed under regional or general anesthesia. Regional anesthesia via cervical plexus blockade allows a patient to remain awake to facilitate neurologic  assessment during carotid artery cross-clamping. During establishment of the block, care should be taken to avoid vascular puncture that would obscure the surgical fi eld or that could unlodge microemboli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appropriate  sedation  during  surgical  preparation  and draping  allows  many  otherwise  anxious  patients  to  tolerate the  procedure  quite  well  when  a  regional  anesthetic  technique under regional blockade is used. If general anesthesia is  selected, the focus should be on maintenance of hemodynamic  stability  and  prompt  emergence  to  allow  immediate assessment of neurologic status in the operating room.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Appropriate blood pressure management is important during carotid endarterectomy and is made more crucial because of  the  abnormal  cerebral  autoregulation  present  in  many  of these patients. Elevated blood pressure during cross-  clamping may facilitate collateral blood fl ow but a ft er surgery may predispose  to  hematoma  formation.  Vasopressors  or  vasodilators  are  o ft en  needed  to  maintain  an  appropriate  perfusion pressure during the various stages of the procedure. Surgical manipulation of the carotid sinus may cause marked alterations in heart rate and blood pressure.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
It  is  generally  accepted  that  changes  in  regional  cerebral blood fl ow associated with changes in Pa co 2 are unpredictable in  these  patients. Th erefore,  maintenance  of  normocarbia  is generally recommended.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Monitoring  usually  includes  placement  of  an  intraarterial  catheter.  As  with  any  major  vascular  surgery,  patients with  poor  le ft ventricular  function  and/or  severe  coronary artery disease might require a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter or transesophageal echocardiography, but this is rarely necessary. Th e hemodynamic goals for cerebral and coronary perfusion are similar, and achievement of these goals will bene fi t both organ systems. If central venous cannulation is pursued, particular care must be taken during contralateral jugular venous access attempts to prevent inadvertent arterial or venous puncture, which could cause a hematoma that compromises collateral blood fl ow during carotid cross-clamping.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
When carotid endarterectomy is performed under general anesthesia, monitoring for cerebral ischemia, hypoperfusion, and cerebral emboli should be strongly considered. Th e principal reason to monitor cerebral function in these patients is to identify patients who would bene fi t  from use of a carotid artery shunt during carotid cross-clamping as well as to guide hemodynamic management in patients who require increased cerebral  perfusion  pressure. Th e  standard  electroencephalogram is a sensitive indicator of inadequate cerebral perfusion during carotid cross-clamping, and perioperative neurologic complications  correlate  with  intraoperative  electroencephalographic changes indicating cerebral ischemia. However, the utility of electroencephalographic monitoring during carotid endarterectomy  is  limited  by  several  factors:  (1)  electroencephalography  may  not  detect  subcortical  or  small  cortical infarcts, (2) false-negative results are not uncommon (patients with previous strokes or transient ischemic attacks have a high incidence of false-negative test results), and (3) the electroencephalogram can be a ff ected not only by cerebral ischemia but also by changes in temperature, blood pressure, and depth of anesthesia.  Somatosensory-evoked potential monitoring can detect speci fi c changes produced by decreased regional cerebral blood fl ow, but it can be di ffi cult to determine whether these changes are due to anesthesia, hypothermia, changes in blood pressure, or cerebral ischemia. Stump pressure (internal carotid artery back pressure) is a poor indicator of the adequacy of cerebral perfusion. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography allows continuous monitoring for blood fl ow velocity and the occurrence of microembolic events. It can be used to determine the need for shunt placement, to recognize shunt malfunction, and to manage postoperative hyperperfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  situations  in  which  general  anesthesia  is  chosen  and cerebral  perfusion  monitoring  is  unavailable,  an  alternative approach is to insert shunts in all patients, but placement of the shunt can itself predispose to an increased embolic load. Overall,  awake  neurologic  assessment  is  the  simplest,  most cost-e ff ective, and most reliable method of cerebral function monitoring during carotid endarterectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT AND COMPLICATIONS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  the  period  immediately  a ft er  carotid  endarterectomy, patients must be observed for cardiac, airway, and neurologic complications. Th ese  include  hypertension  or  hypotension, myocardial ischemia or infarction, development of signi fi cant so ft tissue edema or a hematoma in the neck, and the onset of neurologic signs and symptoms that signal a new stroke or acute thrombosis at the endarterectomy site.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypertension is frequently observed during the immediately postoperative period, o ft en in patients with co-existing essential hypertension. Th e increase in blood pressure o ft en reaches a  maximum  2  to  3  hours  a ft er  surgery  and  may  persist  for 24 hours. Hypertension should be treated to avoid the hazards of  cerebral  edema,  myocardial  ischemia,  and  hematoma  formation. Th e  incidence of new neurologic de fi cits  is  increased threefold in patients who are hypertensive postoperatively. Continuous  infusion  of  short-acting  drugs  such  as  nitroprusside, nitroglycerin, or clevidipine and the use of longer-acting drugs such as hydralazine or labetalol are options for blood pressure control. Th e mechanism of this postoperative hypertension may be related to altered activity of the carotid sinus or loss of carotid sinus function resulting from denervation during surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hypotension is also commonly observed during the period immediately a ft er surgery. Th is hypotension can be explained based on carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Th e carotid sinus, previously shielded by atheromatous plaque, is now able to perceive blood pressure oscillations more clearly and goes through a period of hyperresponsiveness to these stimuli. Hypotension resulting from carotid sinus hypersensitivity is usually treated with vasopressors such as phenylephrine. It typically resolves within 12 to 24 hours.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nerve dysfunction is possible a ft er carotid endarterectomy, but most injuries are transient. Patients should be examined for  evidence  of  hypoglossal,  recurrent  laryngeal,  or  superior  laryngeal  nerve  injury.  Such  injury  may  produce  di ffi -culty swallowing or protecting the airway and could result in aspiration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Carotid body denervation can also occur a ft er carotid artery surgery and impair the cardiac and ventilatory responses to hypoxemia. Th is  can  be  clinically  signi fi cant  a ft er  bilateral carotid endarterectomy or with administration of narcotics.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Endovascular Treatment of Carotid Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e technique of carotid artery stenting continues to evolve as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Th e major complication of carotid stenting is stroke as a result of microembolization of atherosclerotic material into the cerebral circulation during  the  procedure.  Embolic  protection  devices  for  use during carotid stenting have been developed, but the technology has so far failed to reduce endovascular stroke risk to that seen with the surgical approach. Nevertheless, endovascular approaches carry a lower risk of  myocardial  infarction,  and if embolic protection devices are improved, stenting may one day reemerge as a more widespread alternative to surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Data  comparing  surgical  and  endovascular  approaches comes  from  several  studies. Th e  Carotid  Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) demonstrated an increased risk of stroke and decreased risk of myocardial infarction in endovascular treatment compared with endarterectomy, but the investigators also found that periprocedural

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
stroke was more devastating to quality of life than myocardial infarction. Th e Stent-Supported Percutaneous Angioplasty of the Carotid Artery versus Endarterectomy (SPACE) trial also showed increased rates of ischemic stroke or death within 30 days  a ft er  an  endovascular  repair  compared  with  a  surgical procedure. As a result of this  evidence,  surgical  endarterectomy  for  symptomatic  carotid  stenosis  remains  the  recommended treatment for most patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIPHERAL ARTERIAL DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Peripheral arterial disease results in compromised blood fl ow to the extremities. Chronic impairment of blood fl ow to the extremities is most o ft en due to atherosclerosis, whereas arterial embolism is most likely to be responsible for acute arterial occlusion (Table 8-3). Vasculitis may also be responsible for compromised peripheral blood fl ow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chronic Arterial Insufficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  most  widely  accepted  de fi nition  of  peripheral  arterial insu ffi ciency is an ankle-brachial index of less than 0.9. Th e ankle-brachial index is calculated as the ratio of the systolic blood pressure at the ankle to the systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery. An ankle-brachial index of less than 0.9 correlates extremely well with angiogram-positive disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  characteristics  of  peripheral  atherosclerosis  resemble those of atherosclerosis seen in the aorta, coronary arteries, and extracranial cerebral arteries. Th e prevalence of peripheral atherosclerosis increases with age, exceeding 70% in individuals older than 75 years of age. Peripheral arterial disease has been estimated to reduce quality of life in approximately 2 million symptomatic Americans, and millions more without claudication are likely to experience peripheral arterial disease-associated impairment. Among patients who have claudication, 80% have femoropopliteal stenosis, 40% have tibioperoneal stenosis, and 30% have lesions in the aorta or iliac arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease. Consequently, patients with peripheral arterial disease have a three to fi ve times overall greater risk of cardiovascular ischemic events such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death than do those without this disease. Critical limb ischemia is associated with a  very  high  intermediate-term morbidity and mortality, due mostly to a high incidence of cardiovascular events in these patients. Associated cardiovascular ischemic events are much more frequent than actual ischemic limb events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RISK FACTORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Risk  factors  associated  with  the  development  of  peripheral atherosclerosis are similar to those related to ischemic heart disease: older age, family history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,  obesity,  and  dyslipidemia. Th e  risk  of  signi fi -cant peripheral arterial disease and claudication is doubled in smokers compared with nonsmokers, and continued cigarette smoking increases the risk of progression from stable claudication to severe limb ischemia and amputation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Intermittent claudication and rest pain are the principal symptoms of peripheral arterial disease. Intermittent claudication occurs when the metabolic requirements of exercising skeletal muscles  exceed  oxygen  delivery.  Rest  pain  occurs  when  the arterial blood supply does not meet even the minimal nutritional  requirements  of  the  a ff ected  extremity.  Even  minor trauma to an ischemic foot may produce a nonhealing skin lesion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Decreased  or  absent  arterial  pulses  are  the  most  reliable physical fi ndings associated  with  peripheral  arterial  disease. Bruits  auscultated  in  the  abdomen,  pelvis,  or  inguinal  area and decreased femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, or dorsalis pedis pulses may indicate the anatomic site of arterial stenosis.  Less  commonly,  reduced  lower  extremity  pulses  may  be the presenting sign of undiagnosed aortic coarctation. Signs of chronic leg ischemia include subcutaneous atrophy, hair loss, coolness,  pallor,  cyanosis,  and  dependent  redness.  Patients may report relief with hanging the a ff ected extremity over the edge of the bed, a move that increases hydrostatic pressure in the arterioles of the a ff ected limb.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Doppler ultrasonography and the resulting pulse volume waveform are used to identify arterial vessels with stenotic lesions. In the presence of severe ischemia, the arterial waveform may be entirely absent. Th e ankle-brachial index is a quantitative means  of  assessing  the  presence  and  severity  of  peripheral arterial  stenosis.  A  ratio  of  less  than  0.9  is  associated  with claudication, a ratio of less than 0.4 with rest pain, and a ratio of less than 0.25 with ischemic ulceration or impending gangrene.  Duplex  ultrasonography  can  identify  areas  of  plaque formation and calci fi cation as well as blood fl ow abnormalities caused by arterial stenoses. Transcutaneous oximetry can be used to assess the severity of skin ischemia in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Th e normal transcutaneous oxygen tension of a resting foot is approximately 60 mm Hg. It may be less than 40 mm Hg in patients with skin ischemia. Results of

noninvasive tests and clinical evaluation are usually su ffi cient for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease. MRI and contrast angiography are used to guide endovascular intervention or surgical bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Medical therapy for peripheral arterial disease includes exercise  programs  and  treatment  or  modi fi cation  of  risk  factors for  atherosclerosis.  Supervised  exercise  training  programs can  improve  the  walking  capacity  of  patients  with  peripheral arterial disease even though no change in ankle-brachial index can be demonstrated. Patients who stop smoking have a more favorable prognosis than those who continue to smoke. Aggressive  lipid-lowering  therapy  slows  the  progression  of peripheral atherosclerosis, and treatment of diabetes mellitus can slow microvascular disease progression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment of hypertension results in a reduction in stroke and cardiovascular morbidity. Although β -adrenergic antagonists are a mainstay for patients who have experienced myocardial infarction, their use solely as an antihypertensive agent has fallen out of favor. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, β -adrenergic antagonists have been theorized to evoke potentially  harmful  peripheral  cutaneous  vasoconstriction, but randomized trials enrolling patients with both coronary artery  disease  and  peripheral  arterial  disease  have  failed  to show  worsening  of  claudication  or  other  measures  of  arterial insu ffi ciency. In sum, patients with severe arterial insuffi ciency bene fi t from e ff ective blood pressure control because cardiovascular and stroke risk are reduced, but the presence of peripheral arterial insu ffi ciency does not in itself govern the choice of an antihypertensive agent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Revascularization procedures are indicated in patients with disabling claudication, ischemic rest pain, or impending limb loss. Th e prognosis of the limb is determined by the extent of arterial disease, the severity of limb ischemia, and the feasibility and rapidity of restoring arterial circulation. In patients with  chronic  arterial  occlusive  disease  and  continuous  progression of symptoms (i.e., development of new wounds, rest pain, or gangrene), the prognosis is very poor unless revascularization can be accomplished. In patients who experience acute occlusive events resulting from arterial embolism in an extremity with little underlying arterial disease, the long-term prognosis of the limb is related to the rapidity and completeness of revascularization before the onset of irreversible ischemic tissue or nerve damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Revascularization can be achieved by endovascular interventions or surgical reconstruction. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of iliac arteries has a high initial success rate that is further improved by selective stent placement. Femoral and  popliteal  artery  percutaneous  transluminal  angioplasty has lower success rates than iliac artery percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; however, stent placement has improved super fi cial femoral artery patency substantially.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Despite  improvement  in  long-term  outcome  a ft er  percutaneous  transluminal  angioplasty  and  stenting  of  peripheral vessels, restenosis remains a signi fi cant problem, particularly in  long  lesions,  small-diameter  vessels,  and  recurrently  stenotic lesions. Current therapies focus on the use of mechanical devices, stents, stent gra ft s, vascular irradiation, and drugs, although none of these approaches has yet become a de fi nitive treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e operative procedures used for vascular reconstruction depend on the location and severity of the peripheral arterial stenosis. Aortobifemoral bypass is a surgical procedure used to  treat  aortoiliac  disease.  Intraabdominal  aortoiliac  reconstructive surgery may not be feasible in patients with severe comorbid conditions. However, in these patients, axillobifemoral bypass can circumvent the abdominal aorta and achieve revascularization of both legs. Femorofemoral bypass can be performed in patients with unilateral iliac artery obstruction. Infrainguinal bypass procedures using saphenous vein gra ft s or  synthetic  gra ft s  include  femoropopliteal  and  tibioperoneal  reconstruction.  Amputation  is  frequently  necessary  for patients  with  advanced  limb  ischemia  in  whom  revascularization is not possible or has failed. Lumbar sympathectomy is occasionally used to treat critical limb ischemia in cases of persistent vasospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  for  surgical  revascularization  of the lower extremities incorporates principles similar to those described earlier for the management of patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. For example, the principal risk during reconstructive peripheral vascular surgery is myocardial ischemia. Th e  increased  incidence  of  perioperative myocardial infarction and cardiac death in patients with peripheral  arterial  disease  is  due  to  the  high  prevalence  of coronary artery disease in this patient population. Mortality following revascularization surgery is usually a result of myocardial  infarction  in  patients  with  preoperative  evidence  of ischemic heart disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because  patients  with  claudication  are  usually  unable  to perform  an  exercise  stress  test,  pharmacologic  stress  testing with or without echocardiography or nuclear imaging is helpful  to  determine  the  presence  and  severity  of  ischemic  heart disease  preoperatively  in  patients  with  multiple  cardiac  risk factors. Depending on the severity of coronary artery disease and claudication,  treatment  of  the  ischemic  heart  disease  by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass gra ft ing  may  be  considered  before  revascularization  surgery is  performed.  In  American  College  of  Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, unstable angina is considered an active cardiac condition requiring treatment or optimization before nonemergent surgery. However, in patients with anatomically signi fi cant but stable coronary artery disease, vascular  surgery  can  proceed,  and  mortality  and  morbidity outcomes are similar to those in patients who undergo coronary artery revascularization before elective vascular surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative  heart  rate  control  (usually  with  carefully titrated β -blockers) in vascular surgery patients at high risk reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia. Th e ACC/AHA guidelines  on  perioperative β -blocker  therapy  recommend

For  patients  with  low  cardiac risk who are undergoing vascular surgery, β -blockers may still be considered. Both acute withdrawal of β -blockers and initiation of high-dose β -blocker therapy on the day of surgery are associated with increased mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e choice of anesthetic technique must be individualized for  each  patient.  Regional  anesthesia  and  general  anesthesia each o ff er speci fi c advantages and disadvantages. Patient preference for general anesthesia, patient factors such as obesity or previous spine surgery, and use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs may increase the risks associated with use of a regional technique.  Regional  anesthesia  may  also  be  poorly  tolerated in  patients  with  severe  dementia  but  may  reduce  the  risk  of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia. Epidural  or  spinal  anesthesia  o ff ers  the  advantages  of  increased gra ft blood fl ow, postoperative analgesia, less activation of the coagulation system, and fewer postoperative respiratory complications. Intraoperative heparinization is not, in itself, a contraindication to epidural anesthesia, but risk of bleeding may increase when the patient is also taking other anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. If epidural catheter placement is attempted, it should occur at least 1 hour before intraoperative heparinization. In addition, before placement of the catheter is attempted, the surgical team should be consulted regarding the possible need to delay the procedure in the event of a bloody tap.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General  anesthesia  may  be  necessary  when  procedures are  expected  to  require  long  operative  hours  or  when  vein harvesting from the upper extremities is needed. Th ere is no strong evidence to suggest an advantage of one particular type of general anesthetic agent over another. Th e possible bene fi ts of using inhalation anesthetics in patients with high cardiac risk resulting from the cardiac preconditioning e ff ects of these agents are the subject of ongoing investigations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
During aortoiliac or aortofemoral surgery, infrarenal aortic  cross-clamping  is  associated  with  fewer  hemodynamic derangements  than  higher  aortic  cross-clamping.  Likewise, the  hemodynamic  changes  associated  with  unclamping  the abdominal aorta are less with infrarenal aortic cross-  clamping. Because  of  the  comparatively  benign  e ff ects  of  infrarenal clamping,  many  practitioners  place  a  central  venous  pressure catheter in lieu of a pulmonary artery catheter in these patients,  especially  in  the  absence  of  symptomatic  le ft ventricular  dysfunction.  Monitoring  of  le ft ventricular  function and intravascular volume may also be facilitated by the use of transesophageal echocardiography.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heparin is commonly administered before application of a  vascular  cross-clamp  to  decrease  the  risk  of  thromboembolic  complications.  However,  distal  embolization  may  still occur to any downstream vascular bed, including to the bowel or  kidneys.  Administration  of  heparin  does  not  obviate  the importance of surgical care when manipulating and clamping an atherosclerotic artery to minimize the likelihood of distal embolization.  Spinal  cord  damage  associated  with  surgical revascularization of the legs is extremely unlikely, and special monitoring for this complication is not generally pursued.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Postoperative  management  includes  provision  of  analgesia, treatment  of fl uid  and  electrolyte  derangements,  and  maintenance  of  oxygenation,  ventilation,  heart  rate,  and  blood pressure  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  myocardial  ischemia  or infarction.  As  with  the  choice  of  intraoperative  anesthetics, there is no strong evidence to recommend a particular postoperative medication regimen, as long as the goal of patient stability and comfort is achieved.

Subclavian Steal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Occlusion  of  the  subclavian  or  innominate  artery  proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery may result in reversal of fl ow  through  the  ipsilateral  vertebral  artery  into  the  distal subclavian  artery  (Figure  8-5). Th is  reversal  of fl ow  diverts blood from the brain to supply the arm (subclavian steal syndrome). Symptoms of central nervous system ischemia (syncope,  vertigo,  ataxia,  hemiplegia)  and/or  arm  ischemia  are

Th ere is o ft en an absent or diminished pulse in the ipsilateral arm, and systolic blood pressure is o ft en found to be 20 mm Hg lower in that arm. A bruit may be heard over the subclavian artery. Stenosis of the le ft subclavian artery is responsible for this syndrome in most patients. Subclavian endarterectomy may be curative.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Coronary-Subclavian Steal Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A rare complication of using the le ft internal mammary artery for  coronary  revascularization  is  coronary-subclavian  steal syndrome. Th is  syndrome  occurs  when  proximal  stenosis in the le ft subclavian artery produces reversal of blood fl ow through  the  patent  internal  mammary  artery  gra ft (Figure 8-6). Th is steal syndrome is characterized by angina pectoris and a 20-mm Hg or more decrease in systolic blood pressure in the ipsilateral arm. Angina pectoris associated with coronarysubclavian steal syndrome requires surgical bypass gra ft ing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute Arterial Occlusion

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute  arterial  occlusion  di ff ers  from  the  gradual  development of arterial occlusion caused by atherosclerosis and is frequently the result of cardiogenic embolism. Systemic emboli may arise from a le ft atrial  thrombus in the setting of atrial fi brillation or less commonly from an atrial myxoma. Le ft ventricular  thrombi may develop a ft er  myocardial infarction or in the setting of dilated cardiomyopathy. Other cardiac causes of systemic emboli are valvular heart disease, prosthetic heart valves,  infective  endocarditis,  and  paradoxical  emboli  from a  patent  foramen  ovale.  Noncardiac  causes  of  acute  arterial occlusion  include  atheroemboli  from  an  upstream  artery, plaque rupture, and hypercoagulability derangements. Aortic dissection and trauma can acutely occlude an artery by disrupting the integrity of the vessel lumen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acute arterial occlusion in an extremity presents with signs of limb ischemia: intense pain, paresthesias, and motor weakness distal to the site of arterial occlusion. Th ere is loss of a palpable peripheral pulse, cool skin, and sharply demarcated skin color changes  (pallor  or  cyanosis)  distal  to  the  arterial  occlusion. Large embolic fragments o ft en lodge at an arterial bifurcation such as the aortic bifurcation or the femoral artery bifurcation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Noninvasive tests can provide additional evidence of peripheral arterial occlusion and reveal the severity of the ischemia, but such testing should not delay de fi nitive treatment. Arteriography may be used to de fi ne the site of acute arterial occlusion and the appropriateness of revascularization surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Surgical embolectomy is used to treat acute systemic embolism, typically thromboembolism, to a large peripheral artery. Embolectomy is rarely feasible for atheromatous embolism, because the  atheromatous  material  usually  fragments  into  very  small pieces.  However,  if  the  primary  source  of  atheroembolism  is identi fi ed and amenable to surgical exposure, it may be resectable. Once the diagnosis of acute arterial embolism is con fi rmed, anticoagulation with heparin is initiated to prevent propagation of the thrombus. Intraarterial thrombolysis with urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator may restore vascular  patency  in  acutely  occluded  arteries  and  synthetic  bypass gra ft s. Th e clinical outcome is highly dependent on the rapidity of revascularization. Amputation is necessary in some patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  undergoing  surgical treatment of acute arterial occlusion resulting from a systemic embolism is similar to that in patients with chronic peripheral arterial disease.

Raynaud's Phenomenon

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Raynaud's  phenomenon  is  episodic  vasospastic  ischemia  of the digits. It a ff ects women more o ft en than men. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by digital blanching or cyanosis in association with cold exposure or sympathetic activation. Vasodilation with hyperemia is o ft en seen a ft er rewarming and reestablishment of blood fl ow. Th e disorder is categorized as

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 8 VASCULAR DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
either primary (also called Raynaud's disease ) or as secondary when it is associated with other diseases. Associated diseases include many immunologic disorders, most o ft en scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus (Table 8-4). Raynaud's disease is typically bilateral and occurs most frequently as a mild condition in many young adult women. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon tends to be unilateral and may be the fi rst symptom in patients who develop scleroderma, although the systemic disease may not become apparent until years later.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DIAGNOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e primary diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon is based on history  and  physical  examination fi ndings.  When  the  clinical diagnosis  of  Raynaud's  phenomenon  is  made,  it  may  lead  to workup for associated in fl ammatory diseases. Measurement of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and titers of antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulins, and cold agglutinins can be useful to de fi ne speci fi c secondary causes of Raynaud's phenomenon. Angiography is not necessary to diagnose this disorder but may be useful if digital ischemia is due to atherosclerosis or thrombosis and revascularization is being considered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes appears as part of the constellation  of  symptoms  seen  with  the  scleroderma  subtype  known as CREST syndrome. CREST is  an  acronym  for s ubcutaneous calcinosis, R aynaud's phenomenon, e sophageal dysmotility, s clerodactyly (scleroderma limited to the fi ngers), and t elangiectasia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary  and  secondary  Raynaud's  phenomena  are  usually managed  conservatively  by  protecting  the  hands  and  feet from exposure to cold. Pharmacologic intervention including calcium channel blockade or α -blockade may be helpful in some patients. In rare instances, surgical sympathectomy is considered  for  treatment  of  persistent,  severe  digital ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere  are  no  speci fi c  recommendations  as  to  the  choice  of drugs  to  produce  general  anesthesia  in  patients  with  Raynaud's  phenomenon.  Increasing  the  ambient  temperature  of the operating room and maintaining normothermia are basic considerations.  Noninvasive  blood  pressure  measurement techniques may be strongly considered to avoid any arterial compromise of potentially a ff ected extremities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional anesthesia is acceptable for peripheral operations in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon, but it may be prudent not to include epinephrine in the local anesthetic solution to avoid undesirable vasoconstriction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PERIPHERAL VENOUS DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Common peripheral venous diseases encountered in patients undergoing surgery include super fi cial thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, and chronic venous insu ffi ciency. Th e most important associated complication of deep vein thrombosis is pulmonary embolism, a leading cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e major factors predisposing to venous thrombosis, classically referred to as Virchow's triad, are routinely encountered in the perioperative period: (1) venous stasis (due to immobility), (2) hypercoagulability (due to in fl ammation and acute surgical  stress),  and  (3)  disruption  of  vascular  endothelium (due to perioperative trauma). Table 8-5 expands on Virchow's triad to include more recently appreciated risk factors such as the use of oral contraceptives.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Superficial Thrombophlebitis and Deep Vein Thrombosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombosis of deep or super fi cial peripheral veins is particularly common among surgical patients, occurring in approximately 50% of patients undergoing total hip replacement. Most of  these  thromboses  are  subclinical  and  resolve  completely when  mobility  is  restored.  Although  deep  and  super fi cial venous  thromboses  may  co-exist,  isolated  deep  thrombosis may  be  distinguished  from  super fi cial  venous  thrombosis based on history, physical examination fi ndings, and results of con fi rmatory ultrasonography.

Super fi cial thrombophlebitis is rarely associated with pulmonary embolism. Th e intense in fl ammation that accompanies super fi cial thrombophlebitis rapidly leads to total venous occlusion. Typically, the vein can be palpated as a cordlike structure surrounded by an area of erythema, warmth, and edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Deep vein thrombosis is more o ft en associated with generalized pain of the a ff ected extremity, tenderness, and unilateral  limb  swelling,  but  diagnosis  based  on  clinical  signs alone is  unreliable.  Doppler  ultrasonography  with  vein compression is highly sensitive for detecting proximal vein thrombosis (popliteal or femoral vein) but less sensitive for detecting calf vein thrombosis (Figure 8-7). Venography and impedance  plethysmography  are  also  potential  diagnostic modalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most postoperative venous thrombi arise in the lower legs, o ft en in the lowfl ow soleal sinuses and in large veins draining the  gastrocnemius  muscle.  However,  in  approximately  20% of  patients,  thrombi  originate  in  more  proximal  veins.  Le ft untreated, deep vein thromboses can extend into larger and more proximal veins, and such extension is  associated  with subsequent fatal pulmonary emboli.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREVENTION OF VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical Risk Factors

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Assessment of clinical risk factors identi fi es patients who can  bene fi t  from  prophylactic  measures  aimed  at  reducing the risk of development of deep vein thrombosis (Table 8-6). Patients at low risk require only minimal prophylactic measures, such as early postoperative ambulation and the use of compression stockings, which augment propulsion of blood from the ankles to the knees. Th e risk of deep vein thrombosis may be much higher in patients older than age 40 who are undergoing operations lasting longer than 1 hour, especially orthopedic surgery on the lower extremities, pelvic or abdominal surgery, and surgery that requires a prolonged convalescence period with bed rest or limited mobility. Th e presence of cancer also increases the risk of thrombotic complications.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Subcutaneous heparin in doses of 5000 units administered twice or three times daily reduces deep vein thrombosis risk, as does the use of intermittent external pneumatic compression devices (see Table 8-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  incidence  of  postoperative  deep  vein  thrombosis  and  pulmonary  embolism  in  patients  undergoing  total knee or total hip replacement can be substantially decreased (20% to 40%) by using epidural or spinal anesthesia techniques  instead  of  general  anesthesia.  Postoperative  epidural  analgesia  does  not  augment this bene fi t  but  may  allow earlier ambulation, which can reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Presumably,  the  bene fi cial  e ff ects  of  regional  anesthesia compared with general anesthesia are due to (1) vasodilation, which maximizes venous blood fl ow; and (2) the ability to provide excellent postoperative analgesia and early ambulation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT OF DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anticoagulation is the fi rst-line treatment for all patients with a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis. Th erapy is initiated with heparin  (unfractionated  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin) because this drug produces an immediate anticoagulant e ff ect. Heparin has a narrow therapeutic window, and the response of  individual  patients  can  vary  considerably.  Advantages  of low-molecular-weight  heparin  over  unfractionated  heparin include  a  longer  half-life,  a  more  predictable  dose  response without  the  need  for  serial  assessment  of  activated  partial thromboplastin time, and a lower risk of bleeding complications.  Disadvantages  include  increased  cost  and  the  lack  of availability of a rapid reversal agent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th erapy  with  warfarin,  an  oral  vitamin  K  antagonist,  is initiated during heparin treatment and adjusted to achieve a prothrombin time yielding an international normalized ratio between 2 and 3. Heparin is discontinued when warfarin has achieved  its  therapeutic  e ff ect.  Oral  anticoagulants  may  be continued for 3 to 6 months or longer. Inferior vena cava fi lters  may be inserted into patients who experience recurrent pulmonary embolism despite adequate anticoagulant therapy or in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombophilia workup should be considered for patients with deep vein thrombosis. Laboratory abnormalities associated with initial and recurrent venous thrombosis or embolism include the presence of factor V Leiden and congenital de fi ciencies of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, or plasminogen.  Congenital  resistance  to  activated  protein  C  and increased levels of antiphospholipid antibodies are also associated  with  venous  thromboembolism.  A  family  history  of unexplained venous thrombosis is o ft en present.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Complications of Anticoagulation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most obvious complication of anticoagulant therapy is bleeding. Frequent monitoring of activated partial thromboplastin time in patients receiving intravenous heparin is necessary due to the variability in dose response.

1 is a benign thrombocytopenia seen soon a ft er initiation of heparin therapy (within the fi rst few days) that resolves spontaneously  and  does  not  preclude  continued  treatment  with heparin. In HIT type 1, thrombocytopenia is mild, generally staying  above  100,000  platelets/mm 3 .  In  contrast,  HIT  type 2  is  an  immune-mediated  phenomenon occurring in 1% to 3% of patients receiving unfractionated heparin. HIT type 2 is caused by antibodies to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex and leads to severe thrombocytopenia and platelet activation that causes microvascular thrombosis. Identi fi cation of thrombosis in the setting of HIT type 2 necessitates treatment with a direct thrombin inhibitor such as argatroban or lepirudin to prevent further thrombosis. Th e diagnosis of HIT type 2 is based on the presence of heparin antibodies along with a positive result on a platelet serotonin-release assay. Such a diagnosis mandates avoidance of all future heparin exposure (Figure 8-8).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Takayasu's Arteritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Takayasu's arteritis is a rare, idiopathic, chronic, progressive occlusive  vasculitis  that  causes  narrowing,  thrombosis,  or aneurysms of the aorta and its primary branches. It has alternative names such as pulseless disease, occlusive thromboaortopathy, and aortic  arch  syndrome. Th e  disease  occurs  most o ft en in Asian women younger than age 40. Takayasu's arteritis is usually diagnosed based on contrast angiography, CT, or MRI of the aortic arch and its branches.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Clinical signs and symptoms of Takayasu's arteritis occur as a consequence of progressive obliteration of the lumen of the aorta and its main branches (Table 8-7). Decreased perfusion of the brain because of involvement of the carotid arteries may manifest as vertigo, visual disturbances, seizures, or a stroke with hemiparesis or hemiplegia. Hyperextension of the head may  decrease  carotid  blood fl ow  further  in  these  patients. Indeed, these patients o ft en hold their heads in fl exed ("drooping")  positions  to  prevent  syncope.  Involvement  of  the  subclavian arteries can lead to loss of arm pulses. Bruits are o ft en audible over a stenotic carotid or subclavian artery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 8 VASCULAR DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
177

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Vasculitis  of  the  pulmonary  arteries  occurs  in  approximately  50%  of  patients  and  can  manifest  as  pulmonary hypertension. Ventilation/perfusion abnormalities owing to  occlusion  of  small  pulmonary  arteries  may  contribute  to hypoxemia. Myocardial ischemia may re fl ect in fl ammation of the coronary arteries. Cardiac valves and the cardiac conduction  system  may also be involved. Renal artery stenosis can lead  to  both  decreased  renal  function  and  development  of renovascular hypertension. Ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis may accompany this syndrome.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Takayasu's  arteritis  is  treated  with  glucocorticoids.  Patients whose  arteritis  is  resistant  to  this  therapy  may  also  bene fi t from  methotrexate  or  azathioprine  therapy.  Anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs may be administered to select patients. Hypertension  may  respond  well  to  treatment  with  calcium channel  blockers  or  angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors. Life-threatening or incapacitating arterial occlusions are sometimes amenable to percutaneous or surgical intervention.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA AND MONITORING

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Takayasu's arteritis may be encountered incidentally in patients coming for surgery or obstetric care or in patients undergoing vascular surgery, such as carotid endarterectomy. Management of anesthesia must consider the drugs used to treat this syndrome as well as the multiple organ systems involved by this vasculitis. For example, long-term corticosteroid therapy likely results in suppression of adrenocortical function and suggests the need for supplemental corticosteroid administration during the perioperative period. During the preoperative evaluation, it  is  useful  to  establish  the  e ff ect of changes in head position on cerebral function. For instance, hyperextension of the head during direct laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation could compromise blood fl ow through the carotid or vertebral arteries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
No recommendations can be made regarding regional versus general anesthesia that are speci fi cally related to Takayasu's arteritis. Regardless of the technique or drugs selected to produce anesthesia, adequate arterial perfusion pressure must be maintained during  the  perioperative  period.  Decreases  in  systemic  blood pressure caused by either decreased cardiac output or reduced systemic vascular resistance must be recognized promptly and treated as needed. Excessive hyperventilation should be avoided because of its e ff ect on an already stenotic cerebral vasculature. In patients with signi fi cant compromise of carotid artery blood fl ow, intraoperative electroencephalographic monitoring may be useful for detecting cerebral ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with systemic vascular diseases should be assessed to  determine  whether  blood  pressure  measurements  can  be obtained noninvasively in the upper extremities given the narrowing of the subclavian and brachial arterial lumens. If necessary, intraarterial cannulation of arteries can be considered, but few data are available assessing the safety of arterial cannulation in the presence of this in fl ammatory process. Either femoral  or  radial  pressure  monitoring  can  be  considered depending on patient-speci fi c pathologic features.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Temporal arteritis is in fl ammation of the arteries of the head and neck, manifesting most o ft en as headache, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. Th is  diagnosis  is  suspected  in  any patient  older  than  age  50  complaining  of  a  unilateral  headache.  Super fi cial  branches  of  the  temporal  arteries  are  o ft en tender and enlarged. Arteritis of branches of the ophthalmic artery may lead to ischemic optic neuritis and unilateral blindness. Indeed, prompt initiation of treatment with corticosteroids is indicated in patients with visual symptoms to prevent blindness. Evidence of arteritis on a biopsy specimen of the temporal artery is present in approximately 90% of patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kawasaki's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Kawasaki's  disease  (mucocutaneous  lymph  node  syndrome) occurs primarily in children and manifests as fever, conjunctivitis, in fl ammation of the mucous membranes, swollen erythematous hands and feet, truncal rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Subsequently, a vasculitis develops that o ft en a ff ects the coronary arteries and other medium-sized muscular arteries, which may develop  focal  segmental  destruction.  Coronary  artery  aneurysms develop in approximately 20% to 25% of a ff ected children. Causes of Kawasaki's disease continue to be investigated. Once the diagnosis is established, urgent treatment with gamma globulin and aspirin is initiated and reduces substantially the proportion of patients developing coronary aneurysms. Management of anesthesia in these patients should consider the possibility of intraoperative myocardial ischemia. Peripheral nerve blockade to provide a sympathectomy to in fl amed peripheral arteries has been reported but has not been systematically evaluated.

Thromboangiitis Obliterans (Buerger's Disease)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th romboangiitis obliterans is an in fl ammatory vasculitis leading to occlusion of small and medium-sized arteries and veins in the extremities. Th e disease is most prevalent in men, and the onset is typically before age 45. Th e most important predisposing factor is tobacco use. Th e disorder has been identi fi ed as an autoimmune response triggered when nicotine is present. Th e traditional diagnosis of Buerger's disease is based on fi ve  criteria:  smoking  history,  onset  before  age  50,  infrapopliteal arterial occlusive disease, upper limb involvement or phlebitis migrans, and the absence of risk factors for atherosclerosis other than smoking. Th e diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans is con fi rmed by biopsy of active vascular lesions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Involvement of extremity arteries causes forearm, calf, or foot claudication. Severe ischemia of the hands and feet can cause rest pain, ulcerations, and skin necrosis. Raynaud's phenomenon is commonly associated with thromboangiitis obliterans, and cold exacerbates the symptoms. Periods of vasospasm may alternate  with  periods  of  quiescence.  Migratory  super fi cial vein thrombosis develops in approximately 40% of patients.

TREATMENT

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most e ff ective treatment for patients with thromboangiitis obliterans is smoking cessation. Surgical revascularization is not usually feasible because of the involvement of small distal blood vessels. Th ere is no proven e ff ective drug therapy, and the e ffi cacy of platelet inhibitors, anticoagulants, and thrombolytic therapy is not established. Recently, gene therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor was found to be helpful in healing  ischemic  ulcerations  and  relieving  rest  pain.  Cyclophosphamide therapy has been tried because of the autoimmune nature of the disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in the presence of thromboangiitis  obliterans  requires  avoidance  of  events  that  might  damage  already  ischemic  extremities.  Positioning  and  padding of  pressure  points  must  be  meticulous. Th e  operating  room ambient  temperature  should  be  warm,  and  inspired  gases should be warmed and humidi fi ed to maintain normal body temperature. When feasible, systemic blood pressure should be measured noninvasively rather than by intraarterial means. Co-existing pulmonary and cardiac disease are considerations in these cigarette smokers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regional or general anesthetic techniques can be used in these patients. If regional anesthesia is selected, it may be prudent to omit epinephrine from the local anesthetic solution to avoid any possibility of accentuating vasospasm.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wegener's Granulomatosis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wegener's granulomatosis is characterized by the formation of  necrotizing  granulomas  in  in fl amed  blood  vessels  in  the central nervous system, airways, lungs, cardiovascular system, and  kidneys  (Table  8-8).  Patients  may  have  sinusitis,  pneumonia, or renal failure at presentation. Th e laryngeal mucosa may be replaced by granulation tissue that leads to narrowing  of  the  glottic  opening  or  subglottic  stenosis.  Vasculitis may result in occlusion of pulmonary vessels. Th ere may be a  seemingly  random  interstitial  distribution  of  pulmonary granulomas  with  surrounding  infection  and  hemorrhage. Progressive renal failure is the most frequent cause of death in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. Tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) yield positive results in Wegener's granulomatosis as well as in several other vasculitides, including Churg-Strauss syndrome and microscopic polyangiitis.  Treatment  of  Wegener's  granulomatosis  with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids can produce dramatic remissions. Methotrexate and rituximab have also been used as initial treatment. Once remission is achieved, azathioprine or methotrexate maintenance therapy is usually continued to prevent relapse.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis requires an appreciation of the widespread organ system  involvement  in  this  disease. Th e  potential  depressant e ff ects of cyclophosphamide on the immune system and the  association  of  hemolytic  anemia  and  leukopenia  with

<!-- PAGE=? -->
administration of this drug should be considered. Cyclophosphamide may also decrease plasma cholinesterase activity, but prolonged  skeletal  muscle  paralysis  a ft er  administration  of succinylcholine has not been described.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Avoidance of trauma during direct laryngoscopy is important,  since  bleeding  from  granulomas  and  dislodgment  of friable  ulcerated  tissue  can  occur.  A  smaller  than  expected endotracheal tube may be required if the glottic opening or trachea  is  narrowed  by  granulomatous  changes.  Suctioning of the airway may be required to remove necrotic debris. Th e likely presence of pulmonary disease emphasizes the need for supplemental oxygen during the perioperative period. Arteritis that involves peripheral vessels may obviate placement of an indwelling arterial catheter to monitor blood pressure or limit the frequency of arterial punctures to obtain samples for blood gas analysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A  careful  neurologic  examination  should  be  performed before the decision is made to recommend regional anesthesia to  a  patient  with  Wegener's  granulomatosis. Th e  choice  and doses of neuromuscular blocking drugs may be in fl uenced by the magnitude of renal dysfunction, and myocardial-depressant e ff ects of anesthetics may be exaggerated in patients with associated  cardiac  disease.  Preoperative  electrocardiography may also detect conduction abnormalities.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Churg-Strauss Syndrome

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Churg-Strauss syndrome is a vasculitis of small and mediumsized vessels. It is associated with in fl ammation of the respiratory tract with symptoms of rhinitis and asthma as well as

eosinophilia. Cardiac, renal, neurologic, and gastrointestinal manifestations may also be prominent. Th is syndrome usually responds well to glucocorticoid therapy followed by maintenance immunosuppressant therapy.

Patients with severe disease may come for nasal polypectomy or placement of myringotomy tubes and may present an anesthetic challenge because of the presence of reactive airway disease.

Polyarteritis Nodosa

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polyarteritis  nodosa  is  an  ANCA-negative  vasculitis  that sometimes occurs in association with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or  hairy  cell  leukemia.  Males  more  frequently  contract  this disease  than  females.  Small  and  medium-sized  arteries  are involved,  with  in fl ammatory  changes  resulting  in  glomerulonephritis, myocardial ischemia, peripheral neuropathy, and  seizures. Th e  lung  vasculature  is  generally  not  a ff ected. Hypertension is common and presumably re fl ects renal disease. Renal failure is the most common cause of death. Human immunode fi ciency virus-associated vasculitis may present in a similar fashion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa depends on histologic evidence of vasculitis on biopsy specimens and demonstration of  characteristic  aneurysms  on  arteriography.  Treatment  is empirical and usually includes corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, removal of o ff ending drugs, and treatment of underlying diseases such as cancer.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  polyarteritis nodosa should take into consideration the likelihood of coexisting  renal  disease,  cardiac  disease,  and  systemic  hypertension. Supplemental corticosteroids may be appropriate in patients who have been receiving these drugs as treatment for this disease.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Cardiac  complications  are  the  leading  cause  of  perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality  in  patients  undergoing noncardiac  surgery.  Compared  with  the  general  surgical population, the incidence of these complications is higher in patients undergoing vascular surgery. Vascular surgery patients have a higher incidence of coronary artery disease and are at a particularly high risk of perioperative myocardial infarction. However, the risk of perioperative cardiac complications di ff ers based on the type of vascular surgery performed.  For  example,  peripheral  vascular  procedures actually carry a higher rate of cardiovascular complications than central vascular procedures such as aortic aneurysm repair. Th e recent trend toward endovascular management of aortic and peripheral vascular disease may change cardiovascular risk substantially.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease. Patients with peripheral arterial disease have a three to fi ve times greater risk of cardiovascular ischemic events such as myocardial infarction,  ischemic  stroke,  and  death  than  those  without  this

<!-- PAGE=? -->
disease.  Critical  limb  ischemia  is  associated  with  a  very high intermediate-term morbidity and mortality resulting from cardiovascular events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Aortic cross-clamping and  unclamping  are  associated with  signi fi cant  hemodynamic  disturbances  because  of the decrease in blood fl ow distal to the aortic clamp and the increase in blood fl ow proximal to the level of aortic occlusion. Th ere is also a substantial increase in systemic blood  pressure. Th e  hemodynamic  response  to  aortic cross-clamping di ff ers depending on the level of clamping: thoracic, supraceliac, or infrarenal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Perfusion  pressures  distal  to  the  aortic  cross-clamp  are decreased and are directly dependent on the pressure above the level of aortic clamping to aid in blood fl ow through collateral vessels or through a shunt. Blood fl ow to vital organs distal  to  the  aortic  clamp  depends  on  perfusion  pressure and not on cardiac output or intravascular volume.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Aortic  cross-clamping  is  associated  with  formation  and release of hormonal factors (activation of the sympathetic nervous  system  and  the  renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system) and other mediators (prostaglandins, oxygen-free radicals, complement cascade). Overall, injury to the spinal cord, lungs, kidneys, and abdominal viscera is principally due to ischemia and subsequent reperfusion injury caused by the aortic cross-clamp (local e ff ects)  and/or to release of mediators from ischemic and reperfused tissues (distant e ff ects).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e  principal  causes  of  unclamping  hypotension  are (1)  central  hypovolemia  caused  by  pooling  of  blood  in reperfused tissues, (2) hypoxia-mediated vasodilation causing an increase in vascular capacitance in the tissues below the level of aortic clamping, and (3) accumulation of vasoactive and myocardial-depressant metabolites in these tissues.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Data from transcranial Doppler and carotid duplex ultrasonography studies suggest that carotid artery stenosis with a residual luminal diameter of 1.5 mm (70% to 75% stenosis) represents the point at which a pressure drop occurs across the stenosis, that is, the point at which the stenosis becomes hemodynamically signi fi cant. Th erefore, if collateral cerebral blood fl ow is not adequate, transient ischemic attacks and ischemic infarction can occur.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Both  hypertension  and  hypotension  may  be  observed frequently  during  the  period  immediately  a ft er  carotid endarterectomy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Acute arterial occlusion is typically caused by cardiogenic embolism. Systemic emboli may arise from a mural thrombus in the le ft ventricle that develops because of myocardial infarction or dilated cardiomyopathy. Other cardiac causes of  systemic  emboli  are  valvular  heart  disease,  prosthetic heart  valves,  infective  endocarditis,  le ft atrial  myxoma, atrial fi brillation, and atheroemboli from the aorta and iliac or femoral arteries.

Patients at low risk for deep vein thrombosis require only minimal prophylactic measures, such as early postoperative ambulation and use of compression stockings. Th e risk of deep vein thrombosis may be much higher in patients older than age 40 who are undergoing operations lasting longer  than  1  hour,  especially  orthopedic  surgery  on  the lower extremities, pelvic or abdominal surgery, and surgery that  requires  a  prolonged  convalescence  with  bed  rest  or limited mobility. Th e presence of cancer also increases the risk  of  thrombotic  complications.  Subcutaneous  heparin (minidose  heparin)  and  intermittent  external  pneumatic compression of the legs help to prevent deep vein thrombosis in patients at moderate risk following abdominal and orthopedic surgery.

Endovascular  repair  of  aortic  lesions  is  a  relatively  new technique for which data on long-term outcomes and randomized trials are lacking, but the signi fi cant improvement in  perioperative  mortality  together  with  development  of new gra ft s  and  devices  has  started  a  new  era  in  vascular surgery. Carotid and peripheral arterial endovascular procedures have emerged as alternative, less invasive methods of arterial repair.
