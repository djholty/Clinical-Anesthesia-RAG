Disease states related to erythrocytes are anemia and polycythemia. Anemia is characterized by a decrease in the red cell mass,  with  the  main  adverse  e ff ect  being  a  decrease  in  the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. Polycythemia ( erythrocytosis ) represents an increase in hematocrit. Its consequences are primarily related to an expanded red cell mass and a resulting increase in blood viscosity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHYSIOLOGY OF ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia is a sign of disease manifesting clinically as a reduced absolute number of circulating red blood cells (RBCs). Th ere is  no  single  laboratory  value  that  de fi nes  anemia.  Although a  decrease  in  hematocrit  is  most  o ft en  used  as  an  indicator, anemia has been de fi ned as a reduction in one or more of the major RBC measures: hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, hematocrit, and RBC count. In adults, anemia is usually de fi ned as an Hb concentration of less than 11.5 g/dL (hematocrit < 36%) for women and less than 12.5 g/dL (hematocrit < 40%) for men.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In acute blood loss the hematocrit may be unchanged initially. In parturient women, decreased hematocrit values re fl ect increases in plasma volume in relationship to the RBC mass (physiologic anemia). Decreases in hematocrit that exceed 1% every 24 hours can be explained only by acute blood loss or intravascular hemolysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most important adverse e ff ect of anemia is decreased tissue  oxygen  delivery  due  to  associated  decreases  in  arterial  oxygen concentration (Ca o 2 ).  For  example, decreases in Hb concentrations from 15 g/dL to 10 g/dL result in a 33% decrease in Ca o 2 . Initial compensation for decreased Ca o 2 is accomplished by a rightward shi ft of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, which facilitates release of oxygen from Hb to  tissues. Th is  is  followed  by  tissue  redistribution  of  blood to the myocardium, brain and muscles from the skin (which results in pallor) and kidneys (which subsequently stimulates erythroid  precursors  in  the  bone  marrow  to  produce  additional RBCs). Another compensatory mechanism is increased cardiac output as an indication of decreased blood viscosity. Fatigue  and  decreased  exercise  tolerance  re fl ect  the  inability  of  cardiac output to increase further and maintain tissue

oxygenation, especially in anemic patients who are physically active  or  patients  with  coronary  artery  disease.  Orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion are followed by cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, ascites, and edema as a consequence of high-  output heart failure in chronic, severe anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th ere are many causes and forms of anemia. Th e most common causes of chronic anemia are iron de fi ciency, the presence of a chronic disease, thalassemia, and acute blood loss.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Transfusion Trigger

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e decision to perform transfusion before elective surgery is based on a combination of factors: the preoperative Hb level, the risks of anemia balanced against the risks of transfusion, the presence of co-existing diseases, and the magnitude of the anticipated blood loss. Transfusions of packed RBCs can be administered  preoperatively  to  increase  Hb  concentrations, with recognition that a period of approximately 24 hours is needed to restore intravascular fl uid volume. Compared with similar volumes of whole blood, packed RBCs produce about twice as high an increase in Hb concentration.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e most appropriate Hb level to serve as the trigger for perioperative blood transfusion is uncertain. Although the "10/30" rule (transfuse if the hemoglobin level is below 10 g/dL or the hematocrit is below 30%) used to be commonly cited as a reference point, there is no evidence that Hb values below this level mandate the need for perioperative RBC transfusion. Th ere is clear evidence that patients with Hb levels of less than 6 g/dL should receive transfusions, whereas patients with compensated chronic anemia and hematocrit values between 6 and 10 g/dL can tolerate these levels without evidence of end-organ ischemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e strongest evidence regarding perioperative transfusion comes  from  the  Transfusion  Requirements  in  Critical  Care trial, which found no signi fi cant di ff erences in 30-day mortality rates between a group managed using a "restrictive" transfusion strategy (transfusions were administered as necessary to keep Hb values between 7 and 8 g/dL) and a group treated using a "liberal" strategy (Hb was kept between 10 and 12 g/dL). Th e restrictive regime did not cause a signi fi cant increase in mortality, cardiac morbidity, or duration of hospitalization.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
RBC transfusions have been associated with direct  transmission of infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunode fi ciency  virus  (HIV)  infection.  In  the critically  ill  and  trauma  patients,  transfusions  are  independently associated with longer intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay, higher mortality rates, increased incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, and increased mortality. Th e immunomodulatory e ff ects of RBC transfusion can lead to cancer recurrence, postoperative bacterial infection, transfusionrelated acute lung injury, and hemolytic transfusion reactions.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For surgery, an expected blood loss of 15% or less of total blood volume requires no replacement therapy. A loss of up to 30% can be replaced exclusively with crystalloid solutions. A loss of more than 30% to 40% generally requires RBC transfusion to restore oxygen-carrying capacity. Th e transfusion is given  along  with  crystalloid  and  colloid  solutions  to  restore intravascular volume and maintain tissue perfusion. In the case of massive transfusion (>50% of blood volume replaced within 24 hours), RBC transfusion should be accompanied by administration of fresh frozen plasma and platelets at a ratio of 1:1:1.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  coronary  artery  disease  merit  special  consideration. In vivo studies have found evidence of myocardial ischemia at Hb levels of 7 g/dL in the presence of coronary artery stenosis of 75% or more. Th e literature suggests that the transfusion trigger of a hematocrit of 28% to 30% should be used in patients with signi fi cant coronary artery disease, especially in those with unstable coronary syndromes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia in Anemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
If elective surgery is performed in the presence of chronic anemia, it seems prudent to minimize the likelihood of signi fi -cant changes that could further interfere with oxygen delivery to  tissues.  For  example,  drug-induced  decreases  in  cardiac output or a le ft ward shi ft of  the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve due to respiratory alkalosis from iatrogenic hyperventilation could interfere with tissue oxygen delivery. Decreased body temperature also shi ft s the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the le ft .  Decreased tissue oxygen requirements may accompany  the  depressant  e ff ects  of  anesthetic  drugs  and hypothermia, o ff setting the decrease in tissue oxygen delivery associated  with  anemia,  although  to  unpredictable  degrees. Signs and symptoms of inadequate tissue oxygen delivery due to anemia are di ffi cult to appreciate during anesthesia. E ff orts to o ff set the impact of surgical blood loss by such measures as normovolemic hemodilution and intraoperative blood salvage are considerations in selected patients. E ff ects of anesthesia on the sympathetic nervous system and cardiovascular responses may blunt the usual increase in cardiac output associated with acute normovolemic anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volatile  anesthetics  may  be  less  soluble  in  the  plasma  of anemic patients, which re fl ects a decrease in the concentration of lipid-rich RBCs. As a result, uptake of volatile anesthetics in the plasma of anemic patients might be accelerated. However, the e ff ect of decreased solubility of volatile anesthetics due to anemia is probably o ff set by the impact of an increased cardiac output. Th erefore, it seems unlikely that clinically detectable di ff erences  in  the  rate  of  induction  of  anesthesia  or  vulnerability to an anesthetic overdose would be present in anemic patients compared with nonanemic patients.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolytic anemia represents accelerated destruction (hemolysis)  of  erythrocytes  caused  most o ft en by hemoglobinopathies  and  immune  disorders.  In  hemolytic  anemias  either RBCs are removed from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system (extravascular hemolysis) or the cells are lysed within  the  circulation  (intravascular  hemolysis). Th erefore, RBC life span is shorter than the normal 120 days, and the resulting tissue hypoxia leads to hyperproduction of RBCs in the bone marrow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 20 HEMATOLOGIC DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolytic anemia is characterized by reticulocytosis (>100,000  cells/mm 3 )  and  increased  mean  corpuscular  volume size, which re fl ect the presence of immature erythrocytes; unconjugated  bilirubinemia;  increased  lactate  dehydrogenase  (LDH)  level;  and  decreased  serum  level  of  haptoglobin.  Con fi rmation  of  hemolytic  anemia  should  be  followed by performance of Coombs' test to rule out an immunologic cause,  examination  of  a  peripheral  blood  smear,  and  Hb electrophoresis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of Red Cell Structure

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  oxygen  required  by  tissues  for  aerobic  metabolism  is supplied by the circulating mass of mature erythrocytes. Th e circulating  RBC population is continually renewed by the erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow under the control of both humoral and cellular growth factors. Th is cycle of  normal  erythropoiesis  is  a  carefully  regulated  process. Oxygen  sensors  within  the  kidney  detect  minute  changes in the amount of oxygen available to tissues and by releasing erythropoietin are able to adjust erythropoiesis to match tissue requirements.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e mature RBC has the shape of a biconcave disk. It lacks a nucleus and mitochondria, and one third of its contents is made up of a single protein, Hb. Intracellular energy requirements are  largely  supplied  by  glucose  metabolism,  which  is targeted at  maintaining Hb in a soluble, reduced state, providing  appropriate  amounts  of  2,3-diphosphoglycerate  (2,3DPG),  and  generating  adenosine  triphosphate  (ATP)  to support  membrane  function.  Without  a  nucleus  or  protein metabolic pathway, the cell has a limited life span of 100 to 120  days.  However,  the  unique  structure  of  the  adult  RBC provides maximum fl exibility  as  the  cell  travels  through  the microvasculature.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEREDITARY SPHEROCYTOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormalities in membrane protein composition can result in  lifelong  hemolytic  anemia. Hereditary  spherocytosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in most patients. It is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia in Europe and the United States, with a frequency of 1 in 5000 individuals. Th e  principal  defect  is  a  de fi ciency  in  membrane skeletal proteins, usually spectrin and ankyrin. A ff ected cells show abnormal osmotic fragility and a shortened circulation half-life.  Hereditary  spherocytosis  can  be  clinically  silent, and about one third of patients have a very mild hemolytic anemia, with spherocytes rarely visible on peripheral blood smear. Some patients, however, have a more severe degree of hemolysis and anemia, and fewer than 5% of patients develop life-  threatening anemia. Patients with hereditary spherocytosis o ft en have splenomegaly and experience symptoms of easy fatigability in proportion to the degree of chronic anemia. Th ese patients are at risk of episodes of hemolytic crisis, o ft en precipitated by viral or bacterial infection. Th ese crises worsen the chronic anemia and may be associated with jaundice. Infection with parvovirus B19 can produce a transient

<!-- PAGE=? -->
(10 to 14 days) but profound aplastic crisis. Th e risk of pigment gallstones is high in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and should be considered in patients complaining of biliary colic.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic  risk  in  these  patients  is  largely  dictated  by  the severity of the anemia and whether the hemolysis is stable or in a period of exacerbation due to concurrent infection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Episodic anemia, o ft en triggered by viral or bacterial infection  and  cholelithiasis,  must  be  considered  in  the  preoperative  evaluation.  Patients  undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass merit special consideration. Th e use of cardiopulmonary bypass may lead to excessive hemolysis, because spherocytes are more susceptible to mechanical and shear stress than normal erythrocytes. Th ere are recommendations  that  mechanical  heart  valves  be  avoided,  but  shortterm use of cardiopulmonary bypass may be safe.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEREDITARY ELLIPTOCYTOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary elliptocytosis is  caused by an abnormality in one of  the  membrane  proteins,  spectrin  or  glycophorin,  that makes the erythrocyte less pliable. Hereditary elliptocytosis is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder and is prevalent in regions where malaria is endemic. In those areas the incidence may reach 3 in 100 people. Hereditary elliptocytosis  is  most  o ft en diagnosed as an incidental fi nding. Th e majority  of  cells  demonstrate  an  elliptical  or  even  rodlike appearance. Most patients with hereditary elliptocytosis are heterozygous and only rarely experience hemolysis. In contrast,  those  with  homozygous  or  compound  heterozygous defects  may  demonstrate  greater  degrees  of  hemolysis  and more severe anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACANTHOCYTOSIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acanthocytosis is  another  defect  in  membrane  structure found  in  patients  with  a  congenital  lack  of β -lipoprotein (abetalipoproteinemia)  and  infrequently  in  patients  with severe  cirrhosis  or  pancreatitis.  It  results  from  cholesterol or  sphingomyelin accumulation on the outer membrane of the erythrocyte. Th is accretion gives the membrane a spiculated appearance that signals the splenic macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system to remove it from the circulation, which produces hemolysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is  a  stem  cell  disorder that may arise in hematopoietic cells any time from the second to the eighth decade of life and result in complement-activated RBC hemolysis. A number of di ff erent associated mutations have  been  identi fi ed,  but  all  result  in  abnormalities  in  or  a reduction in amount of a membrane protein known as glycosylphosphatidyl glycan. Besides hemolytic anemia, patients are at risk for other complications such as venous thrombosis due to complement activation. Th e thromboses have an incidence of approximately 40% and can involve the hepatic and portal

<!-- PAGE=? -->
veins as well as other venous sites. In the absence of protectin, a critical glycosylphosphatidyl glycan-linked protein, patients can have a dysplastic or aplastic bone marrow suggestive of damage to all hematopoietic precursor cells. Paroxysmal nocturnal  hemoglobinuria  tends  to  be  a  chronic  disorder,  with hemolytic anemia and de fi ciencies in other marrow constituents. Median life expectancy a ft er diagnosis is 8 to 10 years.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nocturnal manifestation of the hemolysis is thought to be a result  of  carbon  dioxide  retention  and  subsequent  acidosis. Th erefore,  during  anesthesia,  predisposing  factors  such  as hypoxemia, hypoperfusion, and hypercarbia that can lead to acidosis and complement activation should be avoided. Inhalational agents and propofol may have a theoretical advantage over  thiopental,  which  can  be  associated  with  complementactivated  anaphylactoid  reactions.  Because  of  the  risk  of venous thrombosis, maintaining hydration is important.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders of Red Cell Metabolism

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Lacking  a  nucleus  and  having  a  limited  life  expectancy,  the erythrocyte  maintains  only  the  very  narrow  spectrum  of activities  necessary  to  carry  out  its  oxygen-transport  function. Th e stability of the RBC membrane and the solubility of intracellular Hb depend on four glucose-supported metabolic pathways. Th ese four pathways are illustrated in Figure 20-1. Th e most clinically relevant pathways are described in the following sections.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
EMBDEN-MEYERHOF PATHWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Embden-Meyerhof pathway (nonoxidative or anaerobic pathway) is responsible for generation of the ATP necessary for membrane function and the maintenance of cell shape and pliability.  Defects in anaerobic glycolysis are associated with increased red cell rigidity and decreased survival, which produces a hemolytic anemia. De fi ciencies of the glycolytic pathway are not associated with any typical morphologic red cell changes that herald their presence, nor do they lead to hemolytic crisis a ft er exposure to oxidants. Th e severity of hemolysis is highly variable and largely unpredictable.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHOSPHOGLUCONATE PATHWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e phosphogluconate pathway couples oxidative metabolism with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and glutathione reduction. It counteracts environmental oxidants and prevents globin denaturation. When patients lack either of the two  key  enzymes,  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydrogenase  and glutathione reductase, denatured Hb precipitates on the inner surface  of  the  RBC  membrane,  which  results  in  membrane damage and hemolysis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) de fi ciency is an X-linked disorder and is the most common enzymatic disorder of RBCs, with more than 400 million people a ff ected worldwide.

G6PD activity is highest in young red cells and declines with age. Th e half-life of these erythrocytes is approximately 60 days. Th e clinical manifestations of the disorder depend of the level of the enzyme, with fi ve classes described by the World Health Organization.  Patients  can  have  chronic  hemolytic  anemia (class I, <10% G6PD activity), intermittent hemolysis (class II, 10% G6PD activity), and hemolysis only with stressors (class III, 10% to 60% activity), or no hemolysis (classes IV and V).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hemolysis is the result of the inability of the RBC to protect  itself  from  oxidative  stress.  Acute  insults  that  either

precipitate  new  or  aggravate  preexisting  hemolysis  include infection, certain drugs, and ingestion of fava beans.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  Anesthesia. Anesthetic  risk  is  largely  a function of the severity and acuity of the anemia. Th e goal is to avoid the risk of hemolysis by not exposing the patient to oxidative drugs. In vitro studies show that codeine, midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, and ketamine are safe, but it might be wise to avoid iso fl urane, sevo fl urane, and diazepam, which depress G6PD activity in vitro. Methylene blue is a particular concern. If a patient with methemoglobinemia (with already compromised oxygen delivery) is also G6PD de fi cient, methylene blue administration may be life threatening. Drugs that can induce methemoglobinemia, such as lidocaine, prilocaine, and silver nitrate, should be avoided. Hypothermia, acidosis, hyperglycemia, and infection can precipitate hemolysis in the G6PDde fi cient patient, and these conditions need to be aggressively treated in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pyruvate  kinase  de fi ciency,  an  autosomal  recessive  disorder,  is  the  most  common  erythrocyte  enzyme  defect  causing congenital hemolytic anemia. Pyruvate kinase de fi ciency is  found  worldwide,  but  shows  a  higher  prevalence  among people of northern European extraction and individuals from some regions of China. Although less prevalent than G6PD de fi ciency,  pyruvate  kinase  de fi ciency  is  considerably  more likely to produce a chronic hemolytic anemia. Accumulation of  2,3-DPG  in  the  RBCs  causes  a  shi ft of  the  oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the right to facilitate oxygen release to  peripheral  tissues.  Splenectomy  does  not  totally  prevent hemolysis  but  does  decrease  the  rate  of  RBC  destruction. Th e severity of the clinical presentation ranges from a mild, fully compensated process without anemia to life-threatening, transfusion-requiring  hemolytic  anemia  at  birth.  Severely a ff ected individuals may have chronic jaundice, develop pigmented gallstones, and manifest splenomegaly. Splenectomy o ft en improves the chronic hemolysis and may even eliminate the need for transfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
METHEMOGLOBIN REDUCTASE PATHWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  methemoglobin  reductase  pathway  uses  the  pyridine nucleotide-reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide generated from anaerobic glycolysis to maintain heme iron in its ferrous  state.  An  inherited  mutation  of  the  methemoglobin reductase enzyme results in an inability to counteract oxidation of Hb to methemoglobin, the ferric form of Hb that will not  transport  oxygen.  Patients  with  type  I  reduced  nicotinamide  adenine  dinucleotide-diaphorase  de fi ciency  accumulate small amounts of methemoglobin in circulating red cells, whereas patients with type II disease have severe cyanosis and mental retardation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
LUEBERING-RAPAPORT PATHWAY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  Luebering-Rapaport  pathway  is  responsible  for  the  production of 2,3-DPG. A single enzyme, 2,3 bisphosphoglycerate mutase, mediates both the synthase activity resulting in 2,3-DPG formation and the phosphatase activity that then converts 2,3DPG to 3-phosphoglycerate, returning it to the glycolytic pathway. Th e  balance of formation versus metabolism of 2,3-DPG is  pH sensitive, with alkalosis favoring synthetase activity and acidosis  favoring  phosphatase  activity. Th e  2,3-DPG  response is also in fl uenced by the supply of phosphate to the cell. Severe phosphate  depletion  in  patients  with  diabetic  ketoacidosis  or nutritional de fi ciency can result in reduced 2,3-DPG production.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DISORDERS OF HEMOGLOBIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
The Hemoglobin Molecule

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  RBC  is  basically  a  repository  for  Hb  molecules,  each containing active heme groups and representing 90% of the dry weight of the red cell. Each heme group is capable of binding to an oxygen molecule. Th e respiratory motion of Hb-that is, the uptake and release of oxygen to tissues-involves a speci fi c change in molecular structure. As Hb shuttles from its deoxyhemoglobin to its oxyhemoglobin form, carbon dioxide and 2,3-DPG are expelled from their position between the β -globin chains, which opens  the  molecule  to  receive  oxygen.  Furthermore,  oxygen binding by one of the heme groups increases the a ffi nity of the other groups to load oxygen. Th is interaction is responsible for the sigmoid shape of the oxygen dissociation curve.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inherited  defects  in  Hb  structure  can  interfere  with  this respiratory motion. Most defects are substitutions of a single amino acid in either the α - or β -globin chains. Some interfere with molecular movement, restricting the molecule to either a low- or high-a ffi nity state, whereas others change the valency of heme iron from ferrous to ferric or reduce the solubility of the Hb molecule. Hb S (the abnormal Hb in sickle cell disease) is an example of an Hb with a single amino acid substitution that results in reduced solubility, which typically causes precipitation of the abnormal Hb.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemoglobin S and C

<!-- PAGE=? -->
SICKLE S HEMOGLOBIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sickle cell disease is a disorder caused by the substitution of valine for glutamic acid in the β -globin subunit. In the deoxygenated state, Hb S undergoes conformational changes exposing a hydrophobic region of the molecule. In extreme states of  deoxygenation,  the  hydrophobic  regions  aggregate,  and this results in distortion of the erythrocyte membrane, oxidative damage to the membrane, impaired deformability, and a shortened life span of 10 to 20 days.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sickle  cell  anemia,  the  homozygous  form  of  Hb  S  disease, presents early in life with severe hemolytic anemia and progresses  to  end-organ  damage  involving  the  bone  marrow,  spleen,  kidneys,  and  central  nervous  system.  Patients experience episodic painful crises ( vasoocclusive crises )

<!-- PAGE=? -->

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
characterized by bone and joint pain that may or may not be associated with concurrent illness, stress, or dehydration. Th e severity  and  progression  of  the  disease  are  remarkably  varied. Organ damage can start early in childhood, with recurrent splenic infarction culminating in loss of splenic function in the fi rst decade of life. Th e kidney is another prime target, with painless hematuria and loss of concentrating ability as an early feature progressing to chronic renal failure in the third or fourth decade of life. Pulmonary and neurologic complications are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Lung damage results from chronic persistent in fl ammation. Acute chest syndrome, a pneumonia-like complication, is characterized by the presence of a new pulmonary in fi ltrate involving at  least  one  complete  lung  segment  plus  at  least  one  of  the following: chest pain, temperature higher than 38.5° C, tachypnea, wheezing, or cough. Neurologic complications include stroke, usually as a result of arterial disease rather than sickling. Adolescents present with cerebral infarction and adults develop hemorrhagic strokes.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sickle  cell  trait does  not  cause  an  increase  in  perioperative morbidity or mortality. However, sickle cell disease is  associated  with  a  high  incidence  of  perioperative  complications. Risk factors for complications include advanced age; frequent and severe recent episodes of sickling; evidence of end-organ damage such as a low baseline oxygen saturation, elevated creatinine level, cardiac dysfunction, and history of stroke; and concurrent infection. Risks intrinsic to the type of surgery are also important considerations, with minor procedures such as inguinal hernia repair and extremity surgery considered to be low risk, intraabdominal operations such as cholecystectomy categorized as  intermediate  risk,  and  intracranial  and  intrathoracic procedures classi fi ed as high risk. Among orthopedic procedures, hip surgery and hip replacement, in particular, are associated with a considerable risk of complications, including excessive blood loss and sickle cell events.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  goals  of  preoperative  transfusion  management  have changed  in  recent  years.  Studies  examining  the  e ff ects  of aggressive transfusion strategies aimed at increasing the ratio of  normal Hb to sickle Hb have found no bene fi t  compared with the more conservative goal of achieving a preoperative hematocrit  of  30%.  Indeed,  the  aggressive  strategy  necessitated  signi fi cantly  more  transfusion,  and  the  complications of  transfusion  outweighed  its  bene fi ts.  Accordingly,  patients undergoing low-risk procedures rarely require any preoperative transfusion, and patients undergoing moderate- to highrisk operations need only have preoperative anemia corrected to a target hematocrit of 30%. Choice of anesthetic technique does not appear to signi fi cantly a ff ect the risk of complications stemming from sickle cell disease. Secondary goals of avoiding dehydration, acidosis, and hypothermia during anesthesia reduce the risk of perioperative sickling events. Use of occlusive orthopedic tourniquets is not contraindicated in sickle cell disease, although the incidence of perioperative complications is increased with their use. Postoperative pain requires aggressive management, since pain at the operative site and pain caused by vasoocclusive events can exacerbate complications of this disease.  Patients  o ft en have a degree of tolerance to opioids, and a subset of patients may have opiate addiction, but these facts must not interfere with appropriate pain management.

Despite concerns that regional anesthesia might have detrimental e ff ects in sickle cell patients, it is not contraindicated and may o ff er advantages in pain control.

Acute  chest  syndrome  may  develop  2  to  3  days  into  the postoperative  period  and  demand  treatment  of  hypoxemia, adequate analgesia, and, frequently, blood transfusion to correct  anemia  and  improve  oxygenation.  Inhaled  nitric  oxide to  reduce pulmonary hypertension and improve blood oxygenation  has  shown  promise.  In  the  postoperative  period, patients also need to be monitored for pain crises, stroke, and infection.

SICKLE C HEMOGLOBIN

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e prevalence of Hb C is about one fourth that of Hb S. Hb C causes the erythrocyte to lose water via enhanced activity of the potassium chloride cotransport system. Th is results in cellular dehydration that, in the homozygous state, may produce a mild to moderate hemolytic anemia. Ironically, the presence of both Hb S and Hb C traits (Hb SC) that in isolation cause no symptoms together produce a tendency to sickling and complications similar to those of Hb SS disease. It appears that the dehydration produced by Hb C increases the concentration of Hb S within the erythrocyte, exacerbating its insolubility and tendency to polymerize.

Management of Anesthesia

Th e anesthetic risks of Hb SC disease are not as well studied as those of Hb SS disease. However, one investigation suggested that perioperative transfusion considerably reduces the incidence of sickling complications in this subset of patients.

SICKLE HEMOGLOBINβ -THALASSEMIA

Among African Americans, the frequency of the β -thalassemia gene is only one tenth that of the gene for Hb S. Th e clinical presentation  of  this  compound  heterozygous  state  is  largely determined by whether it is associated with reduced amounts of  Hb  A  (sickle  cellβ + -thalassemia)  or  no  Hb  A  whatsoever  (sickle  cellβ 0 -thalassemia).  In  the  absence  of  any  Hb A, patients experience acute vasoocclusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and other sickling complications at rates approaching those of patients with Hb SS.

UNSTABLE HEMOGLOBINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hbs are made unstable by structural changes that reduce their solubility or render them more susceptible to oxidation of amino acids within the globin chains. More than 100 unique unstable Hb variants have been documented, most associated with only minimal clinical manifestations. Th e mutations typically impair the globin folding or heme-globin binding that stabilizes

<!-- PAGE=? -->
the heme moiety within the hydrophobic globin pocket. Once freed  from  its  cle ft ,  the  heme  binds  nonspeci fi cally  to  other regions of the globin chains. Th is causes them to form a precipitate called the Heinz body that contains globin chains, chain fragments, and heme. Heinz bodies interact with the red cell membrane, reducing its deformability and favoring its removal by splenic macrophages. Unstable Hbs vary in their propensity to form Heinz bodies, and the severity of the associated anemia correspondingly  varies.  Hemolysis  may  be  aggravated  by  the development of additional oxidative stresses, such as infection or ingestion of oxidizing agents. Patients with recurring bouts of  severe  hemolysis  or  morbidity  because  of  chronic  anemia may be considered candidates for splenectomy, which is usually e ff ective in reducing or even eliminating symptoms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anesthetic management of patients with unstable hemoglobins is largely dictated by the degree of hemolysis. Transfusion during bouts of severe hemolysis and avoidance of oxidizing agents are important. Th ese patients may have severe anemia and Hb-induced renal injury.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Thalassemias

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Globin chains are assembled by cytoplasmic ribosomes under the control of two clusters of closely linked genes on chromosomes 11 and 16. Th e fi nal globin molecule is a tetramer of two α -globin and two nonα -globin chains. In the adult, almost all Hb is made up of two α -globin and two β -globin chains (Hb A) with minor components of Hb F and Hb A 2 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An inherited defect in globin chain synthesis known as thalassemia is  one of the leading causes of microcytic anemia in children and adults. Th is disorder shows a strong geographic in fl uence, with β -thalassemia predominating in Africa and the Mediterranean area, and α -thalassemia and Hb E dominant in Southeast Asia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THALASSEMIA MINOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most individuals with thalassemia have thalassemia minor and are heterozygous for either an α -globin ( α -thalassemia trait) or β -globin ( β -thalassemia trait) gene mutation. Although the mutation may decrease synthesis of the a ff ected globin chain by up to 50% of normal, producing hypochromic and microcytic RBCs, the anemia is usually only modest with relatively little  accumulation  of  the  una ff ected  globin.  Accordingly, morbidity associated with chronic hemolysis and ine ff ective erythropoiesis is rarely encountered.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THALASSEMIA INTERMEDIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with thalassemia intermedia show more severe anemia  and  prominent  microcytosis  and  hypochromia. Th ey have  symptoms  attributable  both  to  anemia  and  to  hepatosplenomegaly,  cardiomegaly,  and  skeletal  changes  secondary to bone marrow expansion. Th ese  individuals  may have a milder form of homozygous β -thalassemia, a combined α -and β -thalassemia defect, or β -thalassemia with high levels of Hb F.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THALASSEMIA MAJOR

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with thalassemia major develop severe, life-threatening anemia during their fi rst few years of life. To survive childhood, they require repeated transfusion therapy to correct anemia and suppress the high level of ine ff ective erythropoiesis. Th e severity of thalassemia is remarkably variable, even among patients with seemingly identical genetic mutations. In its most severe forms,  patients  exhibit  three  defects  that  markedly  depress their  oxygen-carrying  capacity:  (1)  ine ff ective  erythropoiesis, (2) hemolytic anemia, and (3) hypochromia with microcytosis. Th e  de fi cit  in  oxygen-carrying  capacity  produces  maximum erythropoietin  release,  and  marrow  erythroblasts  respond  by increasing their unbalanced globin synthesis. Th e accumulating unpaired  globins  aggregate  and  precipitate,  forming  inclusion bodies that cause membrane damage to the RBCs. Some of these defective red cells are destroyed within the marrow, which results in ine ff ective erythropoiesis. Some abnormal erythrocytes escape into the circulation, where their altered morphology can cause accelerated  clearance  (hemolytic  anemia)  or,  at  best,  reduced oxygen-carrying capacity resulting from the lowered Hb content (hypochromia with microcytosis). Other features of severe thalassemia include those attributable to bone marrow hyperplasia, including frontal bossing, maxillary overgrowth, stunted growth, and osteoporosis, as well as those caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis (hepatomegaly). Hemolytic anemia may produce splenomegaly together with dyspnea and orthopnea, which over time results in congestive heart failure and mental retardation. Transfusion therapy will ameliorate many of these changes, but complications resulting from iron overload such as cirrhosis, right-sided heart failure, and endocrinopathy frequently require chelation therapy. Some patients demonstrate reduced transfusion requirements a ft er splenectomy. However, the risk of postsplenectomy sepsis in younger patients argues for deferment of surgery until a ft er 5 years of age if possible. For patients receiving  adequate  transfusion  and  chelation  therapy,  splenectomy may not be  indicated.  Bone  marrow  transplantation  was fi rst performed for thalassemia major in 1982 and is a therapeutic option for younger patients with HLA-identical siblings.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e severity of the thalassemia is a critical determinant of the degree  of  end-organ  damage  and  the  anesthetic  risk.  In  its mildest  forms,  a  chronic,  compensated  anemia  is  the  major concern. With more severe forms of this disorder, the anemia is more signi fi cant, and associated features may include splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, skeletal malformations, congestive  heart  failure,  mental  retardation,  and  complications  of iron overload such as cirrhosis, right-sided heart failure, and endocrinopathies. Skeletal malformations can make tracheal intubation and regional anesthesia di ffi cult.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

vitamin B 12 , exposure to chemotherapeutic agents, or a preleukemic state. Since these are all defects in nuclear maturation, patients have macrocytic anemia and megaloblastic bone marrow morphology.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FOLATE AND VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Folic acid and vitamin B 12 de fi ciency are primary causes of macrocytic anemia in adults. Both vitamins are essential for normal DNA synthesis, and high-turnover tissues such as bone marrow are the fi rst to be a ff ected when these vitamins are in short supply.  In  de fi ciency states, the marrow precursors appear much larger  than  normal  and  are  unable  to  complete  cell  division. Accordingly, the marrow becomes megaloblastic, and macrocytic red cells are released into the circulation. Th e prevalence of de fi ciency of these vitamins varies considerably in di ff erent parts of the world. In developed countries, alcoholism is a frequent source of folate de fi ciency, both because of the poor dietary habits of alcoholic individuals and because of alcohol's interference with folate metabolism. In developing countries where tropical and nontropical sprue is more widespread, malabsorption may increase the frequency of vitamin B 12 de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sustained exposure to nitrous oxide can produce an impairment  of  vitamin  B 12 activity.  Nitrous  oxide  can  oxidize  the cobalt atom of the vitamin, which reduces its cofactor activity and causes impairment in both methionine synthesis and S -adenosylmethionine  synthesis. Th is  action  requires  long exposure to high concentrations of nitrous oxide and pertains only to situations in which scavenging systems are inadequate, as might be found in dental o ffi ces or with recreational use of the gas.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A macrocytic anemia caused by folate or vitamin B 12 de fi -ciency may result in Hb levels of less than 8 to 10 g/dL, a mean red cell volume of 110 to 140 fL (normal = 90 fL), a normal reticulocyte count, and increased levels of LDH and bilirubin. In addition to causing megaloblastic anemia, vitamin B 12 de fi -ciency is associated with peripheral neuropathy due to degeneration of the lateral and posterior columns of the spinal cord. Th ere are symmetrical paresthesias with loss of proprioceptive and vibratory sensations, especially in the lower extremities. Gait  is  unsteady,  and  deep  tendon  re fl exes  are  diminished. Memory  impairment  and  depression  may  be  prominent. Th ese neurologic de fi cits are progressive unless vitamin B 12 is provided. Nonmedical abuse of nitrous oxide may be associated with neurologic fi ndings similar to those that accompany vitamin B 12 de fi ciency and pernicious anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Folate and vitamin B 12 de fi ciency can be corrected by vitamin administration. In cases of intestinal malabsorption the parenteral  route  is  preferred.  Emergency  correction  of  lifethreatening anemia or preparation for urgent surgery entails red cell transfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of anesthesia in patients with megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B 12 de fi ciency is in fl uenced by the need to maintain delivery of oxygenated arterial blood to peripheral tissues. Th e presence of neurologic changes may deter the selection of regional anesthetic techniques or peripheral nerve blockade. Th e use of nitrous oxide would not be prudent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MICROCYTIC ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Defects  in  hemoglobinization,  such  as  those  seen  in  severe iron  de fi ciency,  produce  markedly  ine ff ective  erythropoiesis and microcytic, hypochromic anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Iron Deficiency Anemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Nutritional de fi ciency of iron as a cause of anemia is found only in infants and small children. In adults, iron de fi ciency anemia  re fl ects  depletion  of  iron  stores  caused  by  chronic blood  loss.  Typically  this  involves  losses  from  the  gastrointestinal tract or from the female genital tract (menstruation). Pregnant women are susceptible to development of iron de fi -ciency anemia because of the increased RBC mass required during gestation and the needs of the fetus for iron.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Diagnosis. Patients experiencing chronic blood loss may not be able to absorb su ffi cient iron from the diet to form Hb as rapidly as RBCs are lost. As a result, RBCs are produced with too little Hb. Most cases of iron de fi ciency anemia in the United States are mild, exhibiting Hb concentrations of 9 to 12 g/dL. A decreased serum ferritin concentration (<30 ng/mL) is diagnostic of iron de fi ciency anemia. Th e absence of stainable iron in a bone marrow aspirate is also con fi rmatory evidence for iron de fi ciency anemia. Absence of reticulocytes, decreased serum iron level, and reduced transferrin saturation are also seen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Treatment. Iron de fi ciency anemia is treated with ferrous iron  salts  administered  orally.  Iron  stores  are  replenished slowly. Th erapy should be continued for at least 1 year a ft er the source of blood loss that caused the iron de fi ciency is corrected. A favorable response to iron therapy is evidenced by an increase in Hb concentration of approximately 2 g/dL in 3 weeks or return of Hb concentrations to normal in 6 weeks. Continued  bleeding  is  re fl ected  by  reticulocytosis  and  failure of the Hb concentration to increase in response to iron therapy.  It  may  be  desirable  to  postpone  elective  surgery for  up  to  4  weeks  and  allow  time  for  correction  of  anemia preoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemoglobins with Increased Oxygen Affinity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hb mutations that increase the oxygen-binding avidity of the heme moiety cause the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to shi ft to the le ft , which reduces the P 50 (i.e., the partial pressure of oxygen at which Hb is 50% saturated with oxygen). Many types  of  mutations  can  increase  oxygen  a ffi nity. Th ese  Hbs bind oxygen more readily than normal and retain more oxygen at lower P o 2 levels. Accordingly, they deliver less oxygen to tissues at normal capillary P o 2 , and blood returns to the lungs still  saturated  with  oxygen.  Since  these  variant  Hbs  cannot acquire excess oxygen in the lungs despite their higher oxygen a ffi nity, the net result is a mild tissue hypoxia that triggers increased erythropoietin production leading to polycythemia.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

Tissue  oxygen  delivery  at  baseline  may  be  barely  adequate, so  that  even  a  modest  decrease  in  hematocrit  is  potentially dangerous.  Patients  with  only  mild  erythrocytosis  do  not require  intervention.  Patients  with  high  hematocrits  (>55% to 60%), whose blood viscosity may further compromise oxygen delivery, may require preoperative exchange transfusion, and careful avoidance of hemoconcentration is required in the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemoglobins with Decreased Oxygen Affinity

<!-- PAGE=? -->
METHEMOGLOBINEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methemoglobin is formed when the iron moiety in Hb is oxidized from the ferrous (Fe 2+ ) state to the ferric (Fe 3+ )  state. Normal Hb, upon binding oxygen, partially transfers an electron from the iron to the oxygen, which moves the iron close to its ferric state, and the oxygen resembles a superoxide. Deoxygenation ordinarily returns the electron to the iron, but methemoglobin forms if the electron is not returned. Th e normal erythrocyte maintains methemoglobin levels at 1% or less by the methemoglobin reductase enzyme system. Methemoglobin moves the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve markedly to the le ft and therefore delivers little oxygen to the tissues. Levels of methemoglobin below 30% of the total Hb content cause no compromise in tissue oxygenation. Levels between 30% and 50%,  however,  do  initiate  symptoms  of  oxygen  deprivation, and levels higher than 50% can result in coma and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Methemoglobinemia of clinical importance can arise from three  mechanisms: globin chain mutations favoring the formation of methemoglobin, mutations impairing the e ffi cacy of the methemoglobin reductase system, and toxic exposure to substances that oxidize normal Hb iron at a rate that exceeds the capacity of the normal reducing mechanisms.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hb M arises from mutations that stabilize heme iron in the ferric  (Fe 3+ )  state,  making  it  relatively  resistant  to  reduction by  the  methemoglobin  reductase  system. Th e  methemoglobin has a brownish blue color that does not change to red on exposure to oxygen, which gives patients a cyanotic appearance independent of their Pa o 2 . Patients with M-type Hbs are usually asymptomatic, since their methemoglobin levels rarely exceed 30% of total Hb.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Mutations  impairing  the  methemoglobin  reductase  system rarely result in methemoglobinemia levels of more than 25%. Like their counterparts with Hb M, a ff ected patients may exhibit a slate-gray pseudocyanosis despite normal Pa o 2 levels. Exposure to chemical agents that directly oxidize Hb or produce reactive  oxygen  intermediates  that  oxidize  Hb  may  produce an  acquired  methemoglobinemia  in  which  life-  threatening amounts  of  methemoglobin  accumulate.  Infants  have  lower levels  of  methemoglobin reductase in their erythrocytes and may manifest greater susceptibility to oxidizing agents.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  anesthesia  in  patients  with  methemoglobinemia focuses on avoiding tissue hypoxia. Pulse oximetry is  unreliable in this setting and will typically give a value of 85% oxygen saturation. During surgery, an intraarterial catheter  should  be  inserted  for  measurement  of  blood  pressure, methemoglobin levels, and arterial blood gas concentrations. Acidosis should be corrected, and the electrocardiogram must be closely monitored for signs of ischemia. Patients with Hb M  may  be  more  sensitive  to  exposure  to  oxidizing  agents. Th erefore, local anesthetics, nitrates, and nitric oxide should be avoided.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the setting of toxic methemoglobinemia, methylene blue should be available. Th e dosage is 1 to 2 mg/kg of a 1% solution in saline infused over 3 to 5 minutes. Th is  treatment is usually e ff ective, but may need to be repeated a ft er 30 minutes. Methylene  blue  acts  through  the  methemoglobin  reductase system  and  requires  the  activity  of  G6PD.  Patients  who  are G6PD de fi cient and patients severely a ff ected by methemoglobin may require exchange transfusion.

Fanconi's anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that presents with severe pancytopenia in the fi rst two decades of life and o ft en progresses to acute leukemia. Th e gene frequency in Western societies is approximately 1 in 200 persons, whereas in white South Africans, it may be as high as 1 in 80. When fully  expressed  (as  occurs  in  1  per  100,000  live  births),  the disorder is associated with progressive bone marrow failure, multiple physical defects, chromosomal abnormalities, and a predisposition to cancer. Some patients may not have the classic physical defects, and the diagnosis should be considered in children and young adults with acute myelogenous leukemia.

ANEMIA DUE TO DRUG- AND RADIATION-ASSOCIATED MARROW DAMAGE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Anemia due to marrow damage is a predictable side e ff ect of chemotherapy, and this anemia is usually mild except with the use of high-dose, multidrug chemotherapy that can produce pancytopenia. As long as the drugs do not irreversibly damage the bone marrow, recovery is usually complete. High-energy radiation  can  also  produce  anemia  resulting  from  marrow damage, the degree of which is predictable from the type of radiation, the dose, and the extent of marrow exposure. Longterm exposure to low levels of external radiation or ingested radioisotopes can also produce aplastic anemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  drugs  have  been  associated  with  the  development of severe, o ft en irreversible, aplastic anemia. Table 20-1 lists  classes  of  drugs  that  have  been  associated  with  marrow damage. Some, such as chloramphenicol, can produce severe, irreversible aplastic anemia a ft er only a few doses of the drug, but most, such as phenylbutazone, propylthiouracil, and tricyclic antidepressants, are associated with a more gradual onset of pancytopenia, which is reversible if the drug is withdrawn.

Bone marrow damage can result from direct invasion of the marrow by  an  infectious  agent.  Miliary  tuberculosis  is  perhaps  the  best  example  of  this.  Immunosuppression  of  stem cell  growth  can  also  produce  anemia,  even  aplastic  anemia. Th is can be seen following viral illnesses such as viral hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, HIV infection, and rubella. Parvovirus B19 infection can cause an acute, reversible pure red cell aplasia in patients with congenital hemolytic anemia. Although most of these anemias are reversible,  some  infections can produce fatal aplastic anemia.

ANEMIA DUE TO HEMATOLOGIC OR OTHER   MARROWINVOLVING   MALIGNANCY

Anemia may be caused by any leukemia that reduces the number of erythroid precursors, whether by diverting the stem cells away from the erythroid pathway or by crowding them out of the marrow by their shear numbers. Solid tumors such as breast, lung, and prostate cancer may metastasize to the marrow, producing  a  similar  hypoproliferative  anemia.  Myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders are also capable of crowding out RBC precursors and thus leading to anemia.

Sustained hypoxia usually results in a compensatory increase in the RBC mass and hematocrit. Although this increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, it also increases blood viscosity.

Th is  e ff ect  is  relatively  minor until the hematocrit exceeds 55%, at which time blood fl ow to vital organs can be signi fi cantly reduced.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PHYSIOLOGY OF POLYCYTHEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polycythemia and erythrocytosis are terms that describe an abnormally high hematocrit. Even modest increases in the hematocrit can have a major impact on whole-blood viscosity. An increase in hematocrit can result from a reduction in plasma volume ( relative polycythemia ) without an actual increase in red cell mass. An acute decrease in plasma volume, as may be seen with preoperative fasting, can convert an asymptomatic polycythemia into one in which hyperviscosity threatens tissue perfusion. When the hematocrit rises to levels above 55% or 60%, whole-blood viscosity increases exponentially, especially in small blood vessels  such as capillaries with low fl ow/shear rates. Th e  cerebral circulation is particularly vulnerable to reductions in blood fl ow resulting from increased viscosity (Figures 20-2 and 20-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  clinical  signs  and  symptoms  of  an  elevated  hematocrit vary depending on the underlying disease process and the rate of development.

POLYCYTHEMIA VERA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Primary polycythemia, also known as polycythemia vera or PV , is a stem cell disorder characterized by proliferation of a clone of hematopoietic precursors, nearly all of which arise from a mutation in the JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) gene. Th is clonal expansion most commonly produces an excess of erythrocytes, but numbers of platelets and leukocytes may also be increased. Th e criteria  for  a  diagnosis  of  polycythemia  vera  include  an  elevated Hb level (>18.5 g/dL in men and >16.5 g/dL in women) and either  the  presence  of  the JAK2 mutation  or  two  of  the following: hypercellularity of the bone marrow, a subnormal serum erythropoietin level, and endogenous erythroid colony formation. Polycythemia vera may appear at any age, but most patients develop the disease in their sixth or seventh decade. Patients  can  have  a  number  of  symptoms.  Budd-Chiari syndrome is  a  common  presentation,  as  is  generalized  pruritus and  erythromelalgia.  Coronary  or  cerebral  thrombosis  can o ft en  be  the  presenting  symptom.  Pulmonary  hypertension occurs  with  increased  frequency  in  this  population.  Patients generally  require  regular  phlebotomy  and  may  also  require treatment with myelosuppressive drugs such as hydroxyurea to control the hematocrit. Approximately 30% of patients will die of  thrombotic  complications and another 30% will succumb to cancer, most commonly, myelo fi brosis and acute leukemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with PV who are undergoing surgery are at increased risk  of  perioperative  thrombosis  and,  paradoxically,  hemorrhage. Th e increased risk of thrombosis is due to the predictable combination of baseline hypercoagulability augmented by the prothrombotic state of surgery. Hemorrhage is attributable to an acquired von Willebrand disease caused by abnormally low amounts of the ultralarge von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers essential to normal platelet adhesion. Th e hyperviscosity associated with a high hematocrit favors a conformational change in vWF that renders it vulnerable to enzymatic cleavage. Th erefore,  the  most  hemostatically  e ff ective  large  multimers become depleted, which creates a risk of bleeding. Phlebotomy and avoidance of dehydration lower the risk of both thrombosis and hemorrhage during the perioperative period.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Polycythemia vera patients are at risk for perioperative hypercoagulability and hemorrhage. Reduction of the hematocrit to 45% before surgery may reduce the risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Th rombocytosis should be decreased to 400,000 platelets/mm 3  or less. Aspirin therapy should be withheld for 7 days before surgery. Desmopressin and cryoprecipitate are bene fi cial in improving the levels of vWF and thus can reduce bleeding.

SECONDARY POLYCYTHEMIA DUE TO HYPOXIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An increase in the RBC mass without evidence of change in other hematopoietic cell lines is a normal physiologic response to hypoxia, regardless of cause. Individuals living at high altitudes up to 7000 ft experience a compensatory polycythemia that  is  physiologically  appropriate  and  not  associated  with clinical abnormalities. At higher altitudes, humans are at risk of both acute and chronic mountain sickness, manifested as severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, and disorientation resulting from cerebral edema.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Signi fi cant  cardiopulmonary  disease  can  also  result  in enough  tissue  hypoxia  to  induce  polycythemia.  Congenital heart disease with a signi fi cant right-to-le ft shunt and cyanosis is a good example. Extremely low cardiac output, whether congenital or acquired, may stimulate release of erythropoietin and be associated with an increased hematocrit. Pulmonary disease can result in hypoxic polycythemia. Extreme obesity with  the  development  of  hypoventilation  (pickwickian  syndrome) is a classic example. Inherited defects in Hb, such as high-a ffi nity  Hb and defects in the amount or function 2,3DPG, may cause polycythemia resulting from reduced tissue oxygen delivery and a le ft ward shi ft in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve. Defects or drugs producing signi fi cant methemoglobinemia can also lead to a compensatory polycythemia. Individuals  with  disorders  causing  methemoglobinemia  are distinguished by their pseudocyanotic appearance,  which results from the brownish color of the ferric Hb because of its inability to re fl ect red light upon oxygenation.

SECONDARY POLYCYTHEMIA DUE TO INCREASED ERYTHROPOIETIN PRODUCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Renal  disease  and  several  erythropoietin-secreting  tumors have  been  associated  with  secondary  polycythemia.  Hydronephrosis,  polycystic  kidney  disease,  renal  cysts,  and  both benign  and  malignant  renal  tumors  can  result  in  increased erythropoietin production. Uterine myomas, hepatomas, and cerebellar  hemangiomas  have  also  been  shown  capable  of secreting erythropoietin. A ft er renal transplantation, patients can develop erythrocytosis that is unrelated to erythropoietin production.  Angiotensin-converting  enzyme  inhibitors  will reverse  this  polycythemia.  Surreptitious  use  of  recombinant erythropoietin  by  high-performance  athletes  also  produces polycythemia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia in Secondary Polycythemia Management of patients with secondary polycythemia varies depending on the speci fi c cause. Patients with mild hypoxic polycythemia require no speci fi c treatment. In patients with a  very  high  hematocrit,  phlebotomy  may  be  indicated  to reduce the thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications of the disorder.

DISORDERS OF HEMOSTASIS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Normal Hemostasis

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Any disruption of vascular endothelium is a potent stimulus to clot formation. As a localized process, clotting acts to seal the break in vascular continuity, limit blood loss, and begin the  process  of  wound  healing.  Prevention  of  an  exuberant response that would result in pathologic thrombosis relies on several  counterbalancing mechanisms, including the anticoagulant properties of intact endothelial cells, circulating inhibitors of activated coagulation factors, and localized fi brinolytic enzymes. Most abnormalities in hemostasis involve a defect in one or more of the steps in the coagulation process. It is important, therefore, to understand the physiology of hemostasis.

CASCADE COAGULATION MODEL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e cascade model of coagulation described 60 years ago consists  of  an  extrinsic  and  an  intrinsic  pathway  (Figure  20-4). Th e extrinsic system was represented by factor VIIa and tissue factor. By contrast, the intrinsic system was thought to be entirely intravascular. Both pathways could activate factor X, which, in complex with factor Va, could convert prothrombin to thrombin. Th e  prothrombin time (PT) used to guide warfarin (Coumadin) therapy re fl ects  the  extrinsic  pathway, whereas  the  activated  partial  thromboplastin  time  (aPTT) used to guide heparin therapy re fl ects the intrinsic pathway. Although  this  model  correlates  well  with  clotting  assays,  it does not accurately represent in vivo clotting.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEW COAGULATION MODEL

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In vivo coagulation follows exposure of blood to a source of tissue  factor,  typically  from  subendothelial  cells,  following damage to a blood vessel. Th e intrinsic, or contact, pathway of coagulation has no role in this earliest clotting event. Tissue factor-initiated coagulation has three phases: an initiation phase, an ampli fi cation phase, and a propagation phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e initiation phase begins as exposed tissue factor binds to factor  VIIa  (Figure  20-5). Th is  factor  VIIa-tissue  factor  complex  catalyzes  the  conversion  of  small  amounts  of  factor  X  to Xa, which in turn generates similarly small amounts of thrombin. During the ampli fi cation phase platelets, factor V , and factor XI are activated by the small amount of thrombin (Figure 20-6). Th e propagation phase is initiated by the activation of factor X by factors VIII and IX and calcium on the platelet surface (Figure 20-7). During this phase thrombin increases its own formation by activating platelets and factors V and VIII, which sets the stage for formation of the factor VIIIa-IXa complex. Formation of this complex allows factor Xa generation to switch from a reaction catalyzed by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex to one produced by the intrinsic tenase (Xase) pathway. Th is  switch is

of enormous kinetic advantage, since the intrinsic Xase complex is 50 times more e ffi cient at factor Xa generation. Th e bleeding diathesis  associated  with  hemophilia,  with  its  intact  initiation phase and absent propagation phase, is evidence of the hemostatic importance of the propagation phase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Commonly  used  laboratory  tests  of  soluble  coagulation factors measure only the kinetics of the initiation phase. Th e PT and aPTT both have as end points the fi rst appearance of fi brin gel. Th is occurs a ft er completion of less than 5% of the total reaction. Th ese tests are sensitive in detecting severe de fi -ciencies in clotting factors, such as hemophilia, and in guiding warfarin or heparin therapy. However, they do not model the sequence of events necessary for actual hemostasis and do not necessarily predict the risk of intraoperative bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In the venous circulation, the kinetic advantage of the coagulation cascade assembly on the platelet surface is readily apparent. However, relatively small numbers of platelets are needed to ful fi ll this function. To increase the risk of venous bleeding, the platelet count must decrease to very low levels, that is, fewer than 10,000/mm 3 . Th is contrasts sharply with the arterial circulation, in which the minimum platelet count needed to ensure hemostasis for surgery is at least fi ve times that number.

Hereditary de fi ciency of factor VII is a rare autosomal recessive disease with highly variable penetrance and clinical severity. Only patients with the homozygous de fi ciency have factor VII levels low enough (<15%) to have symptomatic bleeding.

Th e  treatment  of  a  single-factor  de fi ciency  depends  on  the severity  of  the  de fi ciency.  For  surgery,  factor  levels  of  20% to  25%  provide  adequate  hemostasis.  Several  products  are available  to  treat  factor  VII  de fi ciency.  Patients  with  factor VII levels of less than 1% generally require treatment with a concentrated source of factor VII. Th e preferred product for prophylaxis in patients with factor VII de fi ciency is Proplex T (factor IX complex) because it contains high levels of factor VII. Factor VII de fi ciency with active bleeding is treated with either Proplex T, factor VII concentrate, or the activated form of factor VII, recombinant factor VIIa. Patients with mild to moderate factor VII de fi ciency can be treated with infusion of fresh frozen plasma. Prothrombin complex concentrate can also be used, but it carries a high risk of thrombosis.

CONGENITAL DEFICIENCIES IN FACTOR X, FACTOR V, AND PROTHROMBIN (FACTOR II)

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital de fi ciencies in factor X, factor V , and prothrombin are inherited as autosomal recessive traits, and severe de fi ciencies are quite rare. Patients with a severe de fi ciency in any of these  factors  demonstrate  prolongation  of  both  the  PT  and PTT. Patients with factor V de fi ciency may also have a prolonged bleeding time because of the relationship between factor V and platelet function in supporting clot formation.

Management of Anesthesia

De fi ciencies in factor X, factor V , and prothrombin can be corrected with fresh frozen plasma. To obtain a signi fi cant increase in the level of any factor, a considerable volume of fresh frozen plasma must be infused. As a rule of thumb, 10 to 15 mL/kg of fresh frozen plasma is needed to obtain a 20% to 30% increase in the level of any missing factor. Th is represents a considerable volume of plasma and may present a signi fi cant cardiovascular challenge to some patients. Th e duration of e ff ectiveness of this replacement therapy depends on the turnover time of each factor, which then dictates how o ft en a repeat infusion of fresh frozen plasma will be needed. Factor V is stored in platelet granules, and in a bleeding patient platelet transfusion is an alternative way to deliver missing factor V to the site of bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For  factor  X,  factor  V ,  and  prothrombin  de fi ciency  in patients  facing  surgery  with  a  signi fi cant  risk  of  blood  loss, several prothrombin complex concentrates are available. Th e advantage of these products is that factor levels of 50% or more can be achieved without the risk of volume overload. Th e disadvantages of prothrombin complex concentrates are signi fi -cant,  however,  and  include  the  risk  of  inducing  widespread thrombosis, thromboembolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. It is also important to recognize the variation in factor levels in the di ff erent products.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemostatic Disorders Affecting Coagulation Factors of the Propagation Phase

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Defects in the propagation phase of coagulation are associated with a signi fi cant bleeding tendency. Some of these propagation  phase  defects  are  detected  by  an  isolated  prolongation of the aPTT. Th e X-linked recessive disorders hemophilia A and B are the principal examples of this type of abnormality. A marked reduction in either factor VIII or factor IX is associated with spontaneous and excessive hemorrhage, especially hemarthroses and muscle hematomas. A de fi ciency in factor XI also prolongs the aPTT but typically results in a less severe bleeding tendency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Not all factor de fi ciencies causing prolongation of the aPTT are associated with bleeding. Th e initial activation stimulus for this laboratory test is surface contact activation of factor XII (Hageman's factor) to produce XIIa. Th is reaction is facilitated by the presence of high-molecular-weight kininogen and the conversion of  prekallikrein  to  the  active  protease  kallikrein. De fi ciency in any of these three factors causes prolongation of the aPTT. However, these contact activation factors play no role in either the initiation phase or the propagation phase of clotting in vivo. Th us, de fi ciencies of factor XII, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and prekallikrein are not associated with clinical bleeding. Patients with de fi ciencies of these particular factors require no special management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
CONGENITAL FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY: HEMOPHILIA A

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  factor  VIII  gene  is  a  very  large  gene  on  the  X  chromosome.  Patients  with  the  most  severe  hemophilia  generally have  an  inversion  or  deletion  of  major  portions  of  the  X

<!-- PAGE=? -->
chromosome genome or a missense mutation resulting in factor VIII activity of less than 1% of normal. Other mutations, including  point  mutations  and  minor  deletions,  generally result in milder disease with factor VIII levels above 1%. In some patients, a functionally abnormal protein is produced, which causes a discrepancy between results on the immunologic assay of factor VIII antigen and results on the coagulation test of factor VIII activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e clinical severity of hemophilia A is best correlated with the factor VIII activity level. Patients with severe hemophilia have factor VIII activity levels that are less than 1% of normal and are usually diagnosed during childhood because of frequent,  spontaneous hemorrhage into joints, muscles, and vital organs. Th ey require frequent treatment with factor VIII replacement.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor VIII levels as low as 1% to 5% of normal are enough to reduce the severity of hemophilia, but these patients are still at increased risk of hemorrhage with surgery or trauma. Th ey have much less di ffi culty with spontaneous hemarthroses or hematomas, however. Patients with factor levels of 6% to 30% have only mild disease that may go undiagnosed well into adult life. Nevertheless, they are at risk for excessive bleeding when undergoing a major surgical procedure. Female carriers of hemophilia A can also be at risk of excessive surgical bleeding. About 10% of female carriers have factor VIII activity of less than 30%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with severe hemophilia A have a signi fi cantly prolonged aPTT, whereas in those with milder disease, the aPTT may  be  only  a  few  seconds  longer  than  normal. Th e  PT  is normal.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Whenever major surgery is necessary in a patient with hemophilia A, the factor VIII level must be brought to near normal (100%) for the procedure. Th is requires an infusion of factor VIII concentrate. Since the half-life of factor VIII is approximately  12  hours  in  adults,  repeated  infusions  every  8  to  12 hours will be needed to keep the factor VIII level above 50%. In children, the half-life of factor VIII may be as short as 6 hours, which requires more frequent infusions and laboratory assays to con fi rm e ffi cacy. Peak and trough factor VIII levels should be measured to con fi rm the appropriate amount of factor VIII to be infused and the dosing interval. Th erapy must be continued for up to 2 weeks to avoid postoperative bleeding that disrupts wound healing. Even longer periods of therapy may be required in patients who undergo bone or joint surgery. In this situation, 4 to 6 weeks of replacement therapy may be needed.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Up to 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A who are exposed  to  factor  VIII  concentrate  or  recombinant  product will eventually develop inhibitor antibodies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate can both be used to correct factor VIII levels. For patients with mild hemophilia desmopressin can also be administered either intravenously or intranasally.  Fibrinolytic  inhibitors,  such  as ε -aminocaproic acid (EACA) and tranexamic acid, can be given as adjunctive therapy for bleeding from mucous membranes and are particularly useful for dental procedures.

CONGENITAL FACTOR IX DEFICIENCY: HEMOPHILIA B

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  hemophilia  B  have  a  clinical  spectrum  of  disease similar to that found in hemophilia A. Factor IX levels of less than 1% of normal are associated with severe bleeding, whereas more moderate disease is seen in patients with levels of 1% to 5%. Patients with factor IX levels of between 5% and 40% generally have very mild disease. Milder hemophilia (>5% factor IX activity) may not be detected until surgery is performed or the patient has a dental extraction. Similar to the laboratory fi ndings in hemophilia A, patients with hemophilia B have a prolonged aPTT and a normal PT.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
General guidelines for management of patients with hemophilia B  do  not  di ff er  signi fi cantly  from  those  for  management  of hemophilia A patients. Recombinant or puri fi ed product or factor IX-prothrombin complex concentrates are used to treat mild bleeding episodes or administered as prophylaxis for minor surgery. Caution is needed when using factor IX-prothrombin complex  concentrates. Th ese  agents  can  contain  activated  clotting factors. When given in amounts su ffi cient to increase factor IX levels to 50% or more, there is an increased risk of thromboembolic complications, especially in patients undergoing orthopedic procedures. Th erefore, it is essential to use only recombinant factor IX to treat patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery and those with severe traumatic injuries or liver disease.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Puri fi ed factor IX concentrates or recombinant factor IX is used for several days to treat bleeding in patients with hemophilia B. Because of absorption into collagen sites in the vasculature, factor IX is less available than factor VIII, so that dosing is approximately double that for factor VIII concentrates. Factor IX has a half-life of 18 to 24 hours, so repeat infusion at 50% of the original dose every 12 to 24 hours is usually suffi cient to keep the factor IX plasma level above 50%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ACQUIRED FACTOR VIII OR IX INHIBITORS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with hemophilia A are at signi fi cant risk of developing  circulating  inhibitors  to  factor  VIII. Th is  occurs  in  30% to  40%  of  patients  severely  de fi cient  in  factor  VIII.  Patients with hemophilia B are less likely to develop inhibitors to factor IX. Only 3% to 5% of these patients develop inhibitors during their lifetime. A severe hemophilia-like syndrome can occur in  genetically  normal individuals because of the appearance of an acquired autoantibody to either factor VIII or factor IX. Th ese patients are usually middle-aged or older with no personal or family history of abnormal bleeding who experience the sudden onset of severe, spontaneous hemorrhage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A test known as a mixing study is required to detect the presence of an inhibitor. Th is study is performed by mixing patient plasma and normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio to determine whether the prolonged PTT shortens. Th e  mixing study for a patient with classic hemophilia A who has a de fi ciency of factor VIII activity  but  no  circulating  factor  VIII  inhibitor  will  usually show a shortening of the PTT to within 4 seconds or less of the normal value. In contrast, in a patient with a factor VIII inhibitor, the PTT will not be corrected to that extent, if at all.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of a hemophilia A patient with circulating factor VIII inhibitors will vary according to whether the patient is a high or low responder. Low responders have low titers of inhibitors and do not show anamnestic responses to factor VIII concentrates.  High  responders  have  high  titers  of  inhibitors and have dramatic anamnestic responses to therapy. Patients in the low-responder category can usually be managed with factor VIII concentrates. Larger initial and maintenance dosages of factor VIII are required, and frequent assays of factor VIII levels are essential to guide therapy. High responders cannot be treated with factor VIII concentrate. Major hemorrhage can be managed with "bypass" products such as activated prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa. Recombinant factor VIIa is becoming the treatment of choice for patients with acquired inhibitors. Although the thrombin formed via factor VIIa is not as strong as that seen with factor VIII therapy, recombinant factor VIIa therapy is successful in controlling bleeding in more than 80% of patients with factor VIII inhibitors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemophilia  B  patients  with  factor  IX  inhibitors  can  be managed in acute situations using recombinant VIIa or a prothrombin complex concentrate.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who develop an autoantibody to factor VIII or IX without a history of hemophilia can experience life-threatening  hemorrhage  and  may  exhibit  very  high  inhibitor  levels. Treatment with recombinant factor VIIa or an activated prothrombin  concentrate  is  required.  Administration  of  factor VIII or IX alone will not be e ff ective.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
FACTOR XI DEFICIENCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  only  other  coagulation  factor  defect  causing  an  isolated prolongation of the PTT and a bleeding tendency is factor XI de fi ciency (Rosenthal's disease). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Factor XI de fi ciency is much rarer than either hemophilia A or B, but it a ff ects up to 5% of Jews of Ashkenazi descent from Eastern Europe. Generally, the bleeding tendency is  quite  mild  and  may  be  apparent  only  following  a  surgical procedure.  Hematomas  and  hemarthroses  are  very  unusual, even in those patients with factor XI levels of less than 5%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e treatment of factor XI de fi ciency depends on the severity of the de fi ciency and the bleeding history. Most patients can be treated with infusion of fresh frozen plasma. Treatment of patients with factor XI de fi ciency with active bleeding includes administration of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa with redosing according to PT results.

Hypo fi brinogenemic patients usually do not have spontaneous bleeding but may have bleeding with surgery. Severe bleeding can be anticipated in patients with plasma fi brinogen levels of less than 50 to 100 mg/dL.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysfibrinogenemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Production of an abnormal fi brinogen is a more common defect than very low levels of fi brinogen. Fibrinogen is synthesized in the  liver  under  the  control  of  three  genes  on  chromosome  4. More than 300 di ff erent mutations producing dysfunctional and, at  times,  reduced  amounts  of fi brinogen  have  been  reported. Many of these mutations are inherited as autosomal dominant traits. Th e  clinical  presentation  of dys fi brinogenemia is  highly variable. Patients who have both a reduced amount of fi brinogen and a dysfunctional fi brinogen ( hypodys fi brinogenemia ) usually have excessive bleeding. Most dys fi brinogenemic patients have abnormal results on coagulation tests but do not have a clinical bleeding  tendency.  Overall,  approximately  60%  of  dys fi brinogenemias are clinically silent. Th e remainder can present with either a bleeding diathesis or, paradoxically, a thrombotic tendency. A small number of dys fi brinogenemias have been associated with spontaneous abortion and poor wound healing.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Laboratory evaluation of fi brinogen involves measurement of  both  concentration and function of fi brinogen. Th e  most accurate  quantitative  measurement  of  total fi brinogen  protein  is  provided  by  immunoassay  or  a  protein  precipitation technique.  Other  screening  tests  for fi brinogen  dysfunction include the thrombin time and clotting time using a venom enzyme such as reptilase.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients with dys fi brinogenemia have no clinical disease. Th ose who are symptomatic and at risk of bleeding during or a ft er surgery require treatment with cryoprecipitate. To increase the fi brinogen level by at least 100 mg/dL in the average-size adult, 10 to 12 units of cryoprecipitate must be infused, followed by  2  to  3  units  each  day.  Dys fi brinogenemia  patients  with  a thrombotic tendency require long-term anticoagulant therapy.

FACTOR XIII DEFICIENCY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Stability  of  the fi brin  clot  is  hemostatically  important.  De fi -ciency of factor XIII ( fi brin-stabilizing factor) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Patients have persistent umbilical or circumcision bleeding at birth. Patients demonstrate a severe bleeding diathesis characterized by recurrent so ft tissue bleeding,  poor  wound  healing,  and  a  high  incidence  of  intracranial hemorrhage. Blood clots form but are weak and unable to maintain hemostasis. Fetal loss in women with factor XIII de fi ciency approaches 100%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor  XIII  de fi ciency  should  be  considered  in  a  patient with  a  severe  bleeding  diathesis  who  has  normal  results  on coagulation  screening  tests,  including  PT,  PTT, fi brinogen level,  platelet  count,  and  bleeding  time.  Clot  dissolution  in urea can be used as a screening test. Patients at risk of severe hemorrhage have factor  XIII  levels  of  1%  of  normal. Th ose with factor XIII levels of approximately 50% usually exhibit no bleeding tendency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor XIII-de fi cient patients can be treated with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, or a plasma-derived factor XIII concentrate. Factor XIII has a long circulating half-life of 7 to 12 days, and adequate hemostasis is achieved with even very low plasma concentrations (1% to 3%).

Disorders Affecting Platelet Number

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  normal  circulating  platelet  count  is  maintained  within relatively narrow limits. Approximately one third of platelets are sequestered in the spleen at any given time. Since a platelet has a life span of approximately 9 to 10 days, some 15,000 to 45,000 platelets/mm 3  must be produced each day to maintain a steady state.

MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA: GENERAL CONCEPTS FOR THROMBOCYTOPENIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Regardless of the cause of thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusions  are  appropriate  if  the  patient  is  experiencing  a  lifethreatening hemorrhage, is bleeding into a closed space such as  the  cranium,  or  requires  emergency  surgery.  Long-term management of thrombocytopenia requires  other  therapeutic  maneuvers  either  to  improve  platelet  production  or  to decrease platelet destruction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet transfusion therapy must be tailored to the severity of the thrombocytopenia, the presence of bleeding complications, and the patient's underlying disorder. For minor surgery the platelet count should be more than 20,000 to 30,000/mm 3 . For major surgery the platelet count should be increased to 50,000/mm 3 .  However,  for  neurosurgical  procedures  platelets should be increased to 100,000/mm 3 . Each unit of singledonor apheresis platelets or 6 units of random-donor platelets increases the platelet count in a normal-sized adult by approximately 50,000/mm 3 . If there is alloimmunization or increased platelet consumption, measurement of platelet counts 1 hour a ft er  transfusion  and  at  frequent  intervals  is  important  in planning further platelet transfusion needs.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
One unit of single-donor apheresis platelets is equivalent to a random-donor pool of 4 to 8 units. For patients who become alloimmunized to random-donor platelets, blood banks can provide  HLA-matched single-donor  platelets.  Random-  and single-donor  platelets  do  not  need  to  be  ABO  compatible. However, su ffi cient RBCs are transfused in the platelet pool to  increase  the  risk  of  sensitization  in  Rh-negative  patients. Th erefore, such patients, particularly women of childbearing age,  should  receive  platelets  from  Rh-negative  donors  or  be treated with Rh0(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM) following transfusion of Rh-positive product.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  very  low  platelet  counts,  usually  less  than 15,000/mm 3 ,  can  experience  signi fi cant  bleeding  from  multiple sites including the nose, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal  tract,  skin,  and  vessel  puncture  sites.  One  sign  that strongly  suggests  thrombocytopenia  is  the  appearance  of  a petechial rash involving the skin or mucous membranes. Th is condition is usually most pronounced over the lower extremities  because of the increased hydrostatic pressure there. Th e di ff erential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia is best organized according to the physiology of (1) platelet production, (2) distribution in the circulation, and (3) platelet destruction.

Disorders Resulting in Platelet Production Defects: Congenital

Platelet production disorders may be caused by megakaryocyte aplasia or hypoplasia in the bone marrow.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOCYTOPENIA-ABSENT RADIUS SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Congenital  hypoplastic  thrombocytopenia  with  absent  radii ( TAR syndrome ) is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Th rombocytopenia  develops  in  the  third  trimester or soon a ft er birth. Th e thrombocytopenia is initially severe (<30,000  platelets/mm 3 ),  but  slowly  improves  over  time, approaching the normal range by age 2. Th ese patients o ft en have  bilateral  radial  anomalies,  and  abnormalities  of  other bones may also occur.

FANCONI'S ANEMIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  hematologic  manifestations  of Fanconi's  anemia do  not usually appear until about 7 years of age. Th e  bone marrow shows reduced cellularity and reduced numbers of megakaryocytes. Stem cell transplantation is curative in the majority of children once severe bone marrow failure has developed.

MAY-HEGGLIN ANOMALY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with May-Hegglin  anomaly typically have giant platelets  in  the  circulation  and  Döhle's  bodies  (basophilic inclusions)  in  white  blood  cells.  Platelet  production  is  variably ine ff ective, with one third of patients having signi fi cant thrombocytopenia.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
WISKOTT-ALDRICH SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is  an  X-linked  disorder  that  presents  with  a  combination  of  eczema,  immunode fi ciency,  and thrombocytopenia. Circulating platelets are smaller than normal, function poorly because of granule defects, and have a reduced survival. Ine ff ective thrombopoiesis is the principal abnormality.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT THROMBOCYTOPENIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia show an increased megakaryocyte mass but ine ff ective platelet production  and  release  of  macrocytic  platelets  into  the  circulation. Many of these patients also have nerve deafness and nephritis (Alport's syndrome).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Disorders Resulting in Platelet Production Defects: Acquired

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A failure in platelet production can result from bone marrow damage. All aspects of normal hematopoiesis can be depressed, even to the point of bone marrow aplasia (aplastic anemia). Reductions  in  the  marrow  megakaryocyte  mass  are  seen  in response  to  radiation  therapy  or  cancer  chemotherapy,  as  a result  of  exposure  to  toxic  chemicals  (benzene,  insecticides) or alcohol, and as a complication of viral hepatitis. In fi ltration of the bone marrow by a malignant process can also disrupt thrombopoiesis. Hematopoietic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, acute leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloproliferative disorders, frequently produce platelet production defects.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Ine ff ective  thrombopoiesis  can  also  be  seen  in  patients with vitamin B 12 or  folate  de fi ciency (caused by alcoholism) and defective folate metabolism. Marrow megakaryocyte mass is increased, but e ff ective platelet production is reduced. Th is failure of platelet production is rapidly reversed by appropriate vitamin therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet  transfusions  are  a  mainstay  in  the  management  of patients  with  platelet  production  disorders.  Patients  with ine ff ective  thrombopoiesis  secondary  to  an  intrinsic  abnormality of megakaryocytes are treated similarly to those with a production disorder when there is need for urgent surgery. Ine ff ective thrombopoiesis associated with either vitamin B 12 or  folate  de fi ciency should be treated with appropriate vitamin therapy. Recovery of the platelet count to normal occurs within days, which makes platelet transfusion unnecessary in all but the most acute situations.

Platelet Destruction Disorders: Nonimmune

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet  consumption as a part of intravascular coagulation is seen in several clinical settings. If the entire coagulation pathway is activated, the process is referred to as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC can be dramatic, with severe thrombocytopenia and marked prolongation of results on coagulation factor assays, accompanied by bleeding, or it can be low grade, with little or no thrombocytopenia and less tendency for bleeding. Platelet consumption can also occur as an isolated process, so-called platelet DIC. Viral infection, bacteremia, malignancy, high-dose  chemotherapy,  and  vasculitis  can  result  in  su ffi -cient endothelial cell damage to dramatically increase the rate of platelet clearance without full activation of the coagulation pathway. Basically, this is an accentuation of the normal blood vessel repair process in which platelets adhere to exposed subendothelial surfaces and then aggregate with fi brinogen binding. With marked endothelial disruption, enough platelets can be consumed to result in thrombocytopenia. Blood vessel occlusion by formation of platelet thrombi is unusual but can occur with severe vasculitis. Patients with acquired immunode fi ciency syndrome (AIDS) can develop a consumptive thrombocytopenia with end-organ damage secondary to arterial thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura,  hemolytic  uremic  syndrome,  and  HELLP  syndrome  ( h emolysis, e levated l iver enzymes, and l ow p latelet count) are the most important examples  of  nonimmune  platelet  destruction.  Although  the underlying pathophysiologies of these disorders are distinctly di ff erent, these entities can lead to thrombus formation and end-organ damage.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombotic  thrombocytopenic  purpura (TTP)  is  characterized by formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the arterial and capillary microvasculature, leading to thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic  hemolytic  anemia.  Although  this  disease was classically described as a complex of fi ve symptoms and signs-fever,  renal  failure,  thrombocytopenia,  microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and neurologic symptoms-not all of these are present in all patients with TTP . Th e presence of thrombocytopenia  and  microangiopathic  hemolytic  anemia (the latter documented by the fi ndings of anemia, schistocytosis,  reticulocytosis,  decreased  haptoglobin  level,  increased LDH level, and a negative result on Coombs' test) are considered su ffi cient for the diagnosis of TTP in the absence of other possible explanations. TTP can occur as a familial disease, a sporadic illness without apparent cause (idiopathic), a chronic relapsing condition, or a complication of marrow transplantation  or  treatment  with  certain  drugs  (quinine,  ticlopidine, mitomycin C, interferonα , pentostatin, gemcitabine, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine). Preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome in pregnant women can evolve into TTP postpartum.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
TTP is an excellent example of increased platelet destruction  secondary  to  activation,  aggregation,  and  thrombus formation. Th e  underlying  mechanism  in  familial  or  cyclic disease involves a de fi ciency of vWF-cleaving protease activity secondary to an inherited mutation of the gene that results in persistent circulation of ultralarge vWF multimers. Plasma exchange  is  e ff ective  in  removing  some  of  these  multimers and  returning  the  vWF-cleaving  protease  activity  to  normal.  Cases  refractory  to  plasma  exchange  may  respond  to immunosuppression.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HEMOLYTIC UREMIC SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a disorder similar to TTP that is most o ft en seen in children who come for treatment of bloody diarrhea secondary to infection with a particular strain of Escherichia coli or related bacteria that produce Shiga-like toxin. Acute renal failure dominates the presentation. Th rombocytopenia and anemia are less pronounced than with TTP, and neurologic signs are absent. Th ese patients do not need plasmapheresis or fresh frozen plasma therapy. Most children recover spontaneously but may require hemodialysis for some period. Th e mortality rate is less than 5%. Adults infected with this strain of E. coli can have features of both HUS and TTP but  usually  with  less  renal  involvement.  Since  the  mortality rate in older children and adults is higher than that in young children,  they  should  be  treated  with  plasma  exchange  and hemodialysis, regardless of the pattern of their illness.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HELLP SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombocytopenia is a frequent complication of pregnancy. Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 70,000 and 150,000/mm 3 ) is seen in 6% to 7% of women nearing delivery and represents a physiologic change similar to the dilutional anemia  of  pregnancy. Th rombocytopenia  associated  with hypertension  is  observed  in  1%  to  2%  of  pregnancies,  and as  many  as  50%  of  mothers  with  preeclampsia  will  develop a DIC-like condition with severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts of 20,000 to 40,000/mm 3 ) at the time of delivery. Th is is  referred  to  as HELLP syndrome when the combination of red cell hemolysis (H), elevated liver enzyme levels (EL), and low platelet count (LP) is present. Physiologically, HELLP syndrome resembles TTP. Control of the hypertension and completion of the delivery is usually enough to bring the process to a halt. However, a few patients will go on to develop TTPHUS following delivery. Postpartum TTP is a life-threatening illness  with  a  poor  prognosis.  Treatment  with  both  plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin has yielded variable results.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA IN NONIMMUNE PLATELET DESTRUCTION DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Proper management of patients with platelet destruction disorders  depends  on  the  diagnosis.  In  individuals  who  have nonimmune destruction as a part of DIC, platelet and plasma transfusions  are  supportive  therapy. Th e  only  truly  e ff ective therapy is treatment of the underlying cause of the DIC. If the primary condition can be corrected, levels of coagulation factors and platelet counts will recover.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with TTP or HUS should receive platelet transfusions  only  for  life-threatening  bleeding.  With  TTP  or  HUS there is the potential for signi fi cant harm from platelet transfusion,  since  transfusion  may  lead  to  increased  thrombosis and end-organ damage secondary to marked platelet aggregation and activation. Surgery should be delayed whenever possible until the underlying disorder is controlled.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HUS and HELLP syndrome present a di ff erent therapeutic challenge. HUS in children can usually be managed without plasmapheresis,  although  dialysis  may  be  necessary  if  renal failure is severe. HELLP syndrome, like preeclampsia, usually resolves with delivery of the fetus. However, a small number of women will develop to a TTP-like syndrome postpartum. Th ese patients should be treated with plasma exchange. Th e response to treatment is generally poor once end-organ damage has occurred.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet Destruction Disorders: Autoimmune

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombocytopenia  is  a  common  manifestation  of  autoimmune disease. Th e severity of the thrombocytopenia is highly variable.  In  some  conditions,  the  platelet  count  falls  to  as low as 1000 to 2000/mm 3 . In other patients, the ability of the megakaryocytes  to  increase  platelet  production  results  in  a compensated state with platelet counts ranging from 20,000/ mm 3  to near-normal levels.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

Th e diagnosis of immune platelet destruction can usually be  made  from  the  clinical  presentation,  the fi ndings  of  an increased  number  of  reticulated  (RNA-containing)  platelets in blood, and demonstration of an increase in marrow megakaryocyte number and ploidy. Expansion of the megakaryocyte  mass  is  evidence  that  platelet  production  is  increasing markedly in an attempt to compensate for the shortened survival of the platelets in the circulation.

Posttransfusion Purpura

Adults can develop posttransfusion purpura following exposure  to  a  blood  product,  most  o ft en  RBCs  or  platelets. Although multiparous women negative for platelet antigen A1 are at greatest risk, posttransfusion purpura has been reported in both men and women. Usually, a potent alloantibody with platelet antigen A1 speci fi city is readily detected in the plasma.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Drug-Induced Autoimmune Thrombocytopenic Purpura

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several drugs can produce immune thrombocytopenia. Quinine, quinidine, and sedormid are the best known and have been  studied  extensively.  Clinically,  patients  show  severe thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts of less than 20,000/ mm 3 . Th ese  drugs  act  as  haptens  to  trigger  antibody  formation  and  then  serve  as  obligate  molecules  for  antibody binding to the platelet surface. Th rombocytopenia can also occur within hours of the fi rst  exposure  to  a  drug  because of preformed antibodies. Th is  has been reported with varying  frequency  (0%  to  13%)  with  abciximab  (ReoPro)  and other  glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa  inhibitors.  Other  drugs,  such  as α -methyldopa,  sulfonamides,  and  gold  salts,  also  stimulate autoantibodies.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heparin-Induced Th rombocytopenia. Th e  association  of heparin with thrombocytopenia deserves special discussion. Heparin-induced  thrombocytopenia  (HIT)  can  take  one  of several forms. A modest decrease in the platelet count, HIT type  1  ( nonimmune HIT )  may  be  observed  in  a  majority  of patients within the fi rst day of therapy with full-dose unfractionated  heparin. Th is  condition  relates  to  passive  heparin binding  to  platelets,  which  results  in  a  modest  shortening of  the  platelet  life  span. Th e  e ff ect  is  transient  and  clinically insigni fi cant.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A second form of HIT, HIT type 2 ( immune-mediated HIT ), is more important. In this type of HIT, antibodies form to the heparin-platelet  factor  4  complex,  and  these  are  capable  of binding to platelet receptors and inducing platelet activation and aggregation. Platelet activation results in further release of  heparin-platelet  factor  4  and  the  appearance  of  platelet microparticles  in  the  circulation.  Both  of  these  phenomena magnify the procoagulant state. In addition, heparin-platelet factor  4  complex  binds  to  endothelial  cells  and  stimulates thrombin production. Th is  leads  to  both an increased clearance of platelets with resultant thrombocytopenia and venous and/or  arterial  thrombus  formation,  with  the  potential  for severe end-organ damage and the potential for thromboses in unusual sites, such as the adrenal gland, the portal vein, and the skin.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e incidence of HIT type 2 varies with the type and dose of heparin and the duration of therapy. Between 10% and 15% of patients receiving bovine unfractionated heparin develop an antibody. Fewer than 6% of patients receiving porcine heparin develop antibodies. Th e risk of heparin-induced thrombosis is lower than the incidence of antibody formation. Fewer than 10% of those who develop an antibody to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex will experience a thrombotic event. However, the risk varies considerably with the clinical situation and can reach 40%  or  higher  in  the  period  a ft er  orthopedic  surgery.  Some studies have suggested that the presence of the HIT antibody has a negative impact on clinical outcomes even in the absence of overt thrombosis. HIT antibody-positive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery or receiving heparin therapy for unstable angina have been reported to have a signi fi cantly higher incidence of adverse events, including prolonged hospitalization, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Immune-mediated HIT appears between days 5 and 10 of heparin use. Th ere are two variants: an early-onset HIT that occurs in patients exposed to heparin within the previous 3 months and a delayed-onset HIT that appears a ft er  heparin is discontinued. Th e diagnosis is based on a scoring method called the 4Ts system that considers the degree of t hrombocytopenia, the t iming of the platelet reduction, the presence of t hrombosis or other sequelae, and the presence of other causes of t hrombocytopenia (Table 20-3).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients who receive full-dose unfractionated heparin for longer than 5 days or who have previously received heparin should be routinely monitored with measurement of the platelet count every other day. A decrease in the platelet count of more than 50%, even if  the  absolute  platelet  count  remains within the normal range, can signal the appearance of an HIT type  2  antibody. Th is  mandates  stopping  administration  of heparin and substituting a direct thrombin inhibitor for continued  anticoagulation.  If  heparin  is  continued,  even  at  low dosages, or low-molecular-weight heparin is substituted, there is still signi fi cant risk of a major thromboembolic event.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
An acute form of HIT type 2 can occur when heparin therapy is restarted within 20 days of a previous exposure. If an HIT antibody is already present, a patient in whom heparin therapy is  restarted  can  exhibit  an  acute  drug  reaction  with sudden onset of severe dyspnea, rigors, diaphoresis, hypertension, and tachycardia. Such patients are at extreme risk of fatal thromboembolism if heparin administration is continued.

Management of Anesthesia. Platelet transfusions are appropriate if a patient with thrombocytopenia is experiencing lifethreatening  hemorrhage  or  is  bleeding  into  a  closed  space. Platelet  transfusion  therapy  must  be  tailored  to  the  severity

The 4Ts score is assigned by summing the values for each of the four categories. A score of 1, 2, or 3 is considered to indicate low probability of HIT; 4 or 5 indicates intermediate probability of HIT; and 6, 7, or 8 indicates high probability of HIT .

of the thrombocytopenia, the presence of bleeding complications,  and  the  patient's  underlying  disease.  In  patients  with autoimmune thrombocytopenia secondary to drug ingestion, the  most  important  management  step  is  to  discontinue  the drug. Corticosteroid therapy may speed recovery in patients with  an  idiopathic  thrombocytopenic  purpura-like  picture. Th e rate of recovery depends on both the clearance rate of the drug and the ability of marrow megakaryocytes to proliferate and increase platelet production. Even if the platelet count is very low, bleeding is unlikely and patients can be allowed to recover without platelet transfusion.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
HIV-infected thrombocytopenic patients who require urgent surgery should be given platelet transfusions as appropriate.  For  elective  surgery  in  patients  who  develop  thrombocytopenia early in their HIV/AIDS disease, consideration may be given to treatment with zidovudine before scheduling surgery.  About  60%  of  these  patients  will  show  a  response, and up to 50% will have long-lasting improvement in platelet count. Th e e ff ect, however, is not immediate. It can take up to 2 months before the platelet count improves. Among patients who do not respond to zidovudine, splenectomy can be helpful in more than 85% of cases if done early in the course of the thrombocytopenia.  Corticosteroids,  intravenous  immunoglobulin, and intravenous Rh0(D) immune globulin have also been used in patients with AIDS. With disease progression, HIV-infected  patients  develop  a  platelet  production  defect that responds only to platelet transfusion therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
To  prevent  life-threatening  thromboembolic  events  in patients  with  HIT,  all  forms  of  heparin  must  be  stopped immediately. Any delay can put a patient at increased risk of thrombosis. Substitution of low-molecular-weight heparin for unfractionated heparin is not an option, because there is signi fi cant antibody cross-reactivity. If a thrombotic event occurs in  HIT  patients,  treatment  with  a  direct  thrombin  inhibitor should be initiated. Oral anticoagulants should never be started until there is continuous and successful coverage with a direct thrombin inhibitor. Th e immediate reduction in protein C levels that occurs with the initiation of warfarin therapy can lead to worsening thrombosis, including massive skin necrosis and limb gangrene. Since factor VII levels may mirror the decrease in protein C, limb gangrene can be associated with a rapid increase in the international normalized ratio a ft er initiation of warfarin treatment. If this occurs, warfarin should be discontinued and vitamin K given to reverse its e ff ect.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Cardiac  surgery  represents  a  challenge  for  patients  with HIT, since heparin is the ideal anticoagulant for use during cardiopulmonary  bypass. Th e  procedure  should  be  delayed until the HIT episode resolves or, if this is not possible, bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, should be used for anticoagulation during cardiopulmonary bypass.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th rombocytopenia unrelated to drug exposure, infection, or autoimmune  disease  is  generally  classi fi ed  as autoimmune idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). Th is diagnosis can be made only by excluding all other causes of nonimmune and immune platelet  destruction.  Most  adults  with  the  disorder proceed to a chronic form of ITP in which a continued high level of marrow platelet production is required to maintain a chronically low to near-normal platelet count in the face of a shortened platelet life span. Th is condition is characterized by a high level of platelet destruction that is balanced by a high

marrow production of platelets that have better than normal function.  Severe  bleeding  does  not  occur  until  the  platelet count is below 10,000/mm 3 . Patients with chronic ITP have platelet counts of 20,000 to 100,000/mm 3 .

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelet survival in severely a ff ected patients can be measured in hours rather than days, with destruction occurring mainly in the spleen. Transfused platelets also have a shortened life span. Some patients demonstrate only modest shortening of platelet survival, which suggests a subnormal rate of platelet  production.  Although  most  ITP  patients  receiving platelet transfusions rapidly destroy the infused platelets, up to 30% of patients demonstrate near-normal posttransfusion platelet survival.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of Anesthesia. Severe autoimmune ITP associated with bleeding in adults should be treated as a medical emergency with administration of high-dose corticosteroids for the fi rst 3 days. If there is a need for emergency surgery or  clinical  evidence  of  intracranial  hemorrhage,  the  patient should also be given intravenous immunoglobulin and platelet transfusions at least every 8 to 12 hours, regardless of the e ff ect on the platelet count. Some patients who receive platelet transfusions will show a relatively normal posttransfusion platelet count and reasonable platelet survival. Even when there is no posttransfusion improvement in the platelet count, however, su ffi cient numbers of the transfused platelets may survive to improve hemostasis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Some adults do not respond to corticosteroids and go on to develop chronic ITP. If ITP persists for longer than 3 to 4 months, it is extremely unlikely that the patient will spontaneously recover. In this case, splenectomy should be considered if the platelet count is less than 10,000 to 20,000/mm 3 . Approximately  50%  of  patients  will  achieve  a  permanent remission a ft er splenectomy. If splenectomy is recommended for a patient with chronic ITP , it is important to immunize the patient with pneumococcal, meningococcal, and Haemophilus in fl uenza vaccines before surgery to reduce the risk of postsplenectomy sepsis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management of chronic ITP in pregnancy deserves special attention. Most women with chronic ITP can be managed during their pregnancy with no medication, modest amounts of prednisone, or intermittent use of intravenous immunoglobulin.  If  the  thrombocytopenia  becomes  severe,  a  higher  daily dose  of  steroids  together  with  weekly  intravenous  immunoglobulin, especially during the last 2 to 3 weeks of pregnancy, may be needed to prevent maternal bleeding. Even with severe ITP in the mother, most children are born with normal platelet counts. Platelet counts in neonates may decrease for 7 days or longer following delivery. Th erefore, in children at risk, platelet counts should be checked every 2 to 3 days until the platelet count begins to increase.

Qualitative Platelet Disorders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormalities  in  platelet  function  are  o ft en fi rst  noted  as  a complication  of  an  acute  illness  or  surgery.  However,  there may be several factors that could play a role in determining the severity of the bleeding tendency. Consequently, this is not a time when an accurate diagnosis is easily made, so treatment should address as many potential contributing factors as possible. Treatment should include discontinuing drugs that inhibit platelet function, empirically replacing vWF or treating with desmopressin,  and  even  transfusing  platelets.  Although  this approach lacks precision, it is e ff ective.

CONGENITAL DISORDERS AFFECTING PLATELET FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Von Willebrand's Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Von Willebrand's disease (vWD) is the most common inherited abnormality a ff ecting platelet function. It  is  inherited  as either  an  autosomal  dominant  or  autosomal  recessive  trait with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1 in 100 to 3 in 100,000 individuals. Severe vWD with the occurrence of lifethreatening bleeding is seen in fewer than 5 individuals per million in Western countries.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  vWD  usually  experience  mucocutaneous bleeding  (especially  epistaxis),  easy  bruising,  menorrhagia, and  gingival  and  gastrointestinal  bleeding. Th e  number  of patients  with  slight  to  moderate  reductions  in  vWF  activity  far  exceeds  the  number  with  overt  clinical  bleeding,  so there  can  be  a  marked  overdiagnosis  of  vWD  if  measured vWF level is the sole criterion for diagnosis. Th e diagnosis of "clinically important" vWD should be limited to those cases in  which  abnormal  bleeding  occurs.  If  vWD  is  considered to  be  a  contributing  factor  in  a  bleeding  patient,  it  should be treated empirically, and laboratory evaluation should be postponed until the patient is in clinically stable condition and has not received either blood products or drugs for several weeks.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Screening laboratory evaluation for vWD should include measurement  of  the  bleeding  time,  platelet  count,  PT,  and aPTT.  Patients  with  mild  vWD  generally  have  near-normal test  results.  In  those  with  more  severe  disease,  the  bleeding time is markedly prolonged but the platelet count is normal. Patients with a severe de fi ciency of vWF or defective binding of factor VIII to vWF have a prolonged PTT secondary to low levels of factor VIII in plasma. Speci fi c assays of vWF level and function are then necessary to con fi rm the diagnosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Full  evaluation  of  patients  with  vWD  requires  measurements  of  factor  VIII  coagulant  activity,  vWF  antigen,  vWF activity, and vWF multimer distribution. Th ese studies are of diagnostic importance in the classi fi cation of vWD, which, in turn, is essential in planning clinical management.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 1 Disease. Type  1  vWD (80% of cases) is the most common  variant  and  represents  a quantitative defect in plasma vWF levels. Clinical severity is quite variable, but generally correlates with the plasma levels of vWF and factor VIII. In patients and families with a history of repeated and severe bleeding episodes, vWF antigen and vWF activity are usually reduced to less than 15% to 25% of normal. Th ese individuals should be treated for any bleeding episode and given prophylactic treatment for even minor surgical procedures.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Chapter 20 HEMATOLOGIC DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
429

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 2 Disease. Type 2 vWD is characterized by a qualitative defect in plasma vWF. Th is can involve a reduction in the number of larger vWF multimers or variable changes in vWF antigen and factor VIII binding. Th e absence of larger multimers results in a disproportionate decrease in vWF activity.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Type 3 Disease. Type 3 vWD is characterized by the virtual absence of circulating vWF antigen and very low levels of both vWF activity and factor VIII (3% to 10% of normal). Th ese patients experience severe bleeding with mucosal hemorrhage, hemarthroses, and muscle hematomas reminiscent of that in hemophilia A or B. However, unlike patients with hemophilia, these patients have a very prolonged bleeding time.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Management  of  Anesthesia. Th e  type  of  vWD  and  its severity, as well as the nature, urgency, and location of the surgical  procedure,  all  factor  into  the  therapeutic  management of a patient with vWD. Treatments for this disorder include desmopressin, a drug that optimizes plasma levels of endogenous  vWF,  and  blood  products  that  contain  vWF  in  high concentrations.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin that, when given intravenously, stimulates  release  of  vWF  from  endothelial  cells  to  produce  an immediate  rise  in  plasma  vWF  and  factor  VIII  activity. Th is  enhances platelet function. It can be very e ff ective in correcting  the  bleeding  defect  in  vWD.  Platelet  function abnormalities  resulting  from  aspirin,  glycoprotein  IIb/IIIa inhibitors, uremia, or liver disease can be partially corrected by  desmopressin-stimulated  release  of  very  large  vWF multimers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Success  in  treating  vWD  patients  with  desmopressin depends on the disease type. Patients with type 1 vWD show the best response. Th e value of treatment with desmopressin in  patients  with  type  2  disease  is  less  certain.  Patients  with type 3 vWD do not respond to the drug since these patients lack  endothelial  stores  of  vWF.  Both  vWF  and  factor  VIII must be provided to reliably treat bleeding in patients with type 3 vWD.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Desmopressin is available in both intravenous and intranasal preparations. Desmopressin is administered intravenously in a dose of 0.3 mcg/kg. A highly concentrated nasal spray can be self-administered by women with type 1 vWD for management of menorrhagia. Th is formulation can also be e ff ective in controlling bleeding associated with tooth extraction or minor surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Desmopressin  therapy  is  most  e ff ective  in  treating  mild bleeding  episodes  or  in  preventing  bleeding  during  minor surgery.  Patients  with  baseline  vWF  and  factor  VIII  levels of more than 10 to 20 IU/dL seem to do best with this drug, demonstrating a threefold to fi vefold increase in vWF levels. However,  even  if  the  response  is  suboptimal,  bleeding  may be partially contained, or, in the case of surgical prophylaxis, blood loss and the need for transfusion can be reduced. A disadvantage of desmopressin is its relatively short-lived e ff ects. Improvement in the bleeding time and vWF level is limited to

<!-- PAGE=? -->
12 to 24 hours. Th e response can decrease with repeated doses because of the development of tachyphylaxis. In situations in which control of bleeding is critical, such as following major surgery,  desmopressin  alone  will  be  inadequate,  and  vWF replacement is necessary.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Replacement of vWF can be achieved by infusion of cryoprecipitate  or  puri fi ed  concentrates  containing  the  vWFfactor VIII complex. Cryoprecipitate is a readily available and e ff ective  blood  product  that  contains  concentrated  amounts of fi brinogen, vWF, and factors VIII and XIII. Its administration results in an immediate shortening of the bleeding time, which re fl ects the infusion of larger vWF multimers. Th e dosing  schedule  for  cryoprecipitate  is  empirical.  Patients  with severe type 1 or 3 disease are managed like patients with severe hemophilia A by increasing factor VIII levels to 50% to 70% of normal for major surgery and 30% to 50% of normal for minor surgery or less severe bleeding.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Because there is a risk of transfusion-transmitted infection with cryoprecipitate, puri fi ed commercial preparations of factor VIII-vWF concentrate are available and are recommended. A suitable concentrate must contain the larger vWF multimers to be e ff ective. One preparation rich in vWF is Humate-P. Once bleeding is controlled, a single daily dose of concentrate is su ffi cient, since the half-life of the factor VIII-vWF complex in patients with vWD is about 24 hours.

ACQUIRED ABNORMALITIES OF PLATELET FUNCTION

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Acquired  platelet  dysfunction  is  seen  in  association  with hematopoietic  disease,  as  part  of  a  systemic  illness,  or  as  a result of drug therapy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Myeloproliferative Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with myeloproliferative disorders, such as polycythemia vera, myeloid metaplasia, idiopathic myelo fi brosis, essential  thrombocythemia,  and  chronic  myelogenous  leukemia, frequently exhibit abnormal platelet function. Some patients have very high platelet counts and demonstrate either abnormal bleeding or a tendency for arterial or venous thrombosis. In patients with polycythemia vera, expansion of the total blood  volume  and  an  increase  in  blood  viscosity  may  contribute to the thrombotic risk. Th e most consistent laboratory abnormalities in patients with bleeding are defects in epinephrine-induced aggregation and in dense granule and α -granule function. Bleeding resulting from an acquired form of vWD may also be observed in these disorders, which results from a loss of higher-molecular-weight vWF multimers.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dysproteinemia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Abnormal platelet function, including defects in adhesion, aggregation, and procoagulant activity, are observed in patients  with  dysproteinemia.  Almost  one  third  of  patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or immunoglobulin A myeloma have a demonstrable defect in platelet function. Multiple  myeloma  patients  are  less  commonly  a ff ected. Th e concentration of the monoclonal protein spike appears to correlate with the abnormalities in platelet function.

STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uremia

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Uremic patients consistently show a defect in platelet function that correlates with the severity of the uremia and anemia. It appears that the uncleared metabolic product guanidinosuccinic acid acts as an inhibitor of platelet function by inducing endothelial cell nitric oxide release. Platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation are abnormal and thromboxane A 2 generation is decreased.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Most patients with uremia have a prolonged bleeding time that is corrected by hemodialysis. Interestingly, the bleeding time  also  shortens  with  either  RBC  transfusion  or  erythropoietin  therapy.  For  acute  bleeding  episodes,  desmopressin therapy can improve platelet function transiently.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Liver Disease

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  general,  the  most  likely  cause  of  hemorrhage  in  severe liver disease is a discrete defect, such as bleeding varices or a gastric or duodenal ulcer. However, if a cirrhotic patient has widespread bleeding, including ecchymoses and oozing from puncture  sites,  a  coagulopathy  should  be  considered.  Such patients can have multiple defects in coagulation. Th rombocytopenia related to hypersplenism is common. Platelet dysfunction resulting from high levels of circulating fi brin degradation products increases the bleeding tendency. In addition, reduced production  of  factor  VII  and  low-grade,  chronic  DIC  with increased fi brinolysis add to the coagulopathy.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Inhibition by Drugs

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Several  classes  of  drugs  can  a ff ect  platelet  function  (Table 20-4). Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiin fl ammatory drugs have  a  well-recognized  impact  on  platelet  function.  Aspirin

<!-- PAGE=? -->
is  a  powerful inhibitor of platelet thromboxane A 2 synthesis because of its irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase function.  Nonsteroidal  antiin fl ammatory  drugs  such  as  indomethacin, ibuprofen, and sul fi npyrazone also inhibit platelet cyclooxygenase, but their e ff ect is reversible and lasts only as long as the particular drug is in the circulation. Such agents are  weak  inhibitors  of  platelet  function  and  are  not  usually associated  with  severe  clinical  bleeding.  However,  they  can contribute to bleeding when other aggravating factors, such as treatment with other anticoagulants, a gastrointestinal disorder, or surgery, are present. Certain foods, food additives, vitamins, and herbal products-such as vitamins C and E, ω -3 fatty acids, and Chinese black tree fungus-can also reversibly inhibit platelet function through the cyclooxygenase pathway.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  impact  of  antibiotics  on  platelet  function  can  be  a major contributor to hemorrhage in critically ill patients. Th e penicillins,  including  carbenicillin,  penicillin  G,  ticarcillin, ampicillin, nafcillin, and mezlocillin, can interfere with both platelet adhesion and platelet activation and aggregation. Th ey bind to the platelet membrane and interfere with vWF binding and the response of platelets to agonists such as adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine. Signi fi cant clinical bleeding can occur if these antibiotics are administered in very high dosages. Th e presence of aggravating factors related to the critical illness must be important, since abnormal bleeding is rarely seen  when  these  antibiotics  are  used  in  generally  healthy patients.  Platelet  dysfunction  has  also  been  reported  with some cephalosporins.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Volume  expanders,  such  as  dextran,  can  interfere  with platelet  aggregation  and  procoagulant  activity  when  infused in large amounts. Th is can be a signi fi cant disadvantage in the trauma setting but can be useful in the vascular surgery setting to prevent platelet thrombosis. Hydroxyethyl starch is less likely to interfere with platelet function but can cause a detectable defect if given in amounts in excess of 2 L.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MANAGEMENT OF ANESTHESIA IN PATIENTS WITH QUALITATIVE PLATELET DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e therapeutic goal in qualitative platelet disorders is less exact than in disorders resulting in thrombocytopenia. Because the platelets are dysfunctional, the absolute platelet number does not predict bleeding risk. Treatment with desmopressin may improve a mild to moderate platelet defect, especially if the risk of bleeding is relatively minor. If the bleeding risk is more substantial, platelet transfusions may be required. Th e bleeding time, results of platelet function analysis, or the thromboelastogram may be used to measure end points of coagulation but  will  not  guarantee  adequacy  of  platelet  function  for  the challenge  of  surgery.  As  a  general  rule,  su ffi cient  platelet transfusions to increase the percentage of normal/functional platelets to the 10% to 20% range will be su ffi cient to correct drug-related platelet dysfunction.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Platelets become quite dysfunctional in the setting of hypothermia  (temperature  <35°  C)  and  acidosis  (pH  <7.3),  and platelets transfused into a patient with either or both of these conditions will rapidly become dysfunctional as well.

HYPERCOAGULABLE DISORDERS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Sources of hypercoagulability can be divided into two major classes:  a  congenital  predisposition  caused  by  one  or  more genetic abnormalities, o ft en referred to as thrombophilia, and acquired or environmental hypercoagulability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Heritable Causes of Hypercoagulability

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary  conditions  predisposing  to  venous  thromboembolism  (VTE)  can  conceptually  be  divided  into  conditions that  either  decrease  endogenous  antithrombotic  proteins  or increase prothrombotic proteins (Table 20-5).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO DECREASED ANTITHROMBOTIC PROTEINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary Antithrombin Deficiency

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Antithrombin III is the most important of the body's defenses against clot formation in healthy blood vessels or at the perimeter of a site of active bleeding. Antithrombin III de fi ciency is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, with an estimated frequency of 1 per 1000 to 5000 individuals. Homozygous antithrombin de fi ciency is not compatible with life. Heterozygous patients have an antithrombin III level between 40% and 70% of normal. Individuals who are heterozygous for antithrombin III de fi ciency are roughly 20 times more likely than nonde fi -cient individuals to develop VTE at some point in their lives. Th e thrombotic event usually occurs in association with some triggering event that further increases hypercoagulability.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In addition to anticoagulation, anesthetic management for these  patients  should  include  maintaining  the  antithrombin III level above 80% for 5 days a ft er the procedure. Th is is done by administering antithrombin III concentrates.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Hereditary Protein C and Protein S Deficiency Hereditary  de fi ciency  of  protein  C  and  protein  S  adversely a ff ects  thrombin  regulation  by  restricting  the  activity  of

<!-- PAGE=? -->
DVT, Deep vein thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
*All values pertain to the heterozygous state of the given condition.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
thrombin already formed and interfering with the ability to limit the rate of thrombin generation. Th e risk of VTE is about the same as with antithrombin III de fi ciency.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Synthesis of both protein C and protein S is vitamin K dependent, so individuals who are protein C de fi cient are at particular risk of thrombosis if warfarin therapy is initiated in the absence of protective anticoagulation with heparin. Speci fi cally, during the fi rst  days  of  warfarin  treatment,  before  inhibition  of  the vitamin  K-dependent clotting  factors  is  su ffi cient  to  provide the intended anticoagulation, modest suppression of protein C synthesis may compound the already subnormal protein C levels and result in heightened hypercoagulability. In  addition to therapies to prevent or treat VTE, patients with protein C and S de fi ciency may require infusion of fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrates to correct the levels of these proteins. In patients with protein C de fi ciency, puri fi ed protein C concentrate and activated protein C can be used.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
THROMBOPHILIA DUE TO INCREASED PROTHROMBOTIC PROTEINS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor V Leiden

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor  V  Leiden  di ff ers  from  normal  factor  V  because  of  a genetic alteration that makes it very resistant to inactivation. Th erefore, factor Va Leiden stays active in the circulation longer than normal, which promotes increased thrombin generation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Factor V Leiden carries a low to intermediate procoagulant risk. Patients who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden have a fi vefold to sevenfold increased risk of VTE, whereas the risk in homozygous individuals is increased up to 80-fold. Th e prevalence of factor V Leiden varies considerably in di ff erent ethnic populations. It is present in 5% of people of northern European descent but only rarely in those of African or Asian descent. Th erefore,  depending  on  the  ethnic  makeup  of  the community, up to 1 in 20 patients coming for routine surgery can be expected to have a degree of heightened risk of VTE attributable to factor V Leiden.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prothrombin Gene Mutation

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Another thrombophilia that operates via an increase in prothrombotic proteins is known as the prothrombin gene mutation (prothrombin 20210A), which causes levels of prothrombin to be considerably higher in a ff ected individuals than in the general population. If this mutation is the only thrombophilic risk factor, the VTE risk is relatively low. Th e importance of this thrombophilia is similar to that of factor V Leiden and lies in the frequency of the gene rather than its potency. Also as with factor V Leiden, ethnicity plays a signi fi cant role in the prevalence of this gene. It occurs in about 4% of individuals of European descent but rarely in patients of African or Asian descent.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
of thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, and arterial occlusion.  Patients  with  these  conditions  are  also  at  risk  of thrombosis of splenic, hepatic, portal, and mesenteric blood vessels. Th e  pathogenesis  of  these  thromboses  is  not  clear, but increased activation and aggregation of platelets may be important for this hypercoagulable state.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
MALIGNANCIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  certain  malignancies  demonstrate  a  marked thrombotic tendency. Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, colon, stomach, and ovaries are the tumors most o ft en associated with thromboembolic events. Indeed, these malignancies o ft en present with an episode of deep vein thrombosis or migratory  super fi cial  thrombophlebitis.  Of  all  patients  who develop  primary  thrombophlebitis,  25%  to  30%  will  have  a recurrence, and 20% of these will turn out to have cancer. Th e pathogenesis of the thrombotic tendency appears to relate to a combination of release of one or more procoagulant factors by the tumor that can directly activate factor X, endothelial damage  by  tumor  invasion,  and  blood  stasis.  Laboratory  testing may show no abnormalities or some combination of thrombocytosis, elevation of the fi brinogen level, and low-grade DIC.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
PREGNANCY AND ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE USE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Pregnancy  and  oral  contraceptive  use  have  been  reported  to increase the risk of thrombosis. Th e overall incidence of thrombosis is approximately 1 in 1500 pregnancies but is higher in women who have an inherited hypercoagulable state, a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, or a family history of thromboembolic disease; who are obese; who are kept at bed rest for a prolonged period; or who require cesarean section. Th e risk of pulmonary embolism is highest during the third trimester and immediately postpartum and is a signi fi cant cause of  maternal  death.  Antithrombin  III-de fi cient  women  are  at greatest risk and should receive anticoagulant therapy throughout pregnancy. Factor V Leiden and the prothrombin mutation are associated with much lower risk. Women with these inherited traits do not need to receive anticoagulant treatment.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e association of oral contraceptive use with thrombosis and thromboembolism appears to be multifactorial. Women who  also  smoke,  have  a  history  of  migraine  headaches,  or have an inherited hypercoagulable defect are at increased risk (30-fold higher) of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and cerebrovascular thrombosis. Th ere appears to be a weaker relationship between estrogen use at the time of menopause and the occurrence of thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at risk of thromboembolic disease including renal vein thrombosis. Th e  reason is unclear but may be due to lower than normal levels of antithrombin III or protein C as a result of renal loss of coagulation  proteins,  factor  XII  de fi ciency,  platelet  hyperactivity, abnormal fi brinolytic activity, and higher than normal levels of  other  coagulation  factors.  Hyperlipidemia  and  hypoalbuminemia have also been proposed as possible etiologic factors.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODIES

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  presence  of  antiphospholipid  antibodies  does  not  necessarily correlate with thrombosis. Patients with hepatitis C, mononucleosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, or HIV infection can have circulating antiphospholipid antibodies but do not have a propensity for thrombosis.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e term antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is used when patients  experience  thromboses or pregnancy complications and  have  laboratory  evidence  of  antiphospholipid  antibodies in their blood. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome can be primary, as the sole manifestation of autoimmune disease, or  secondary  in  association  with  systemic  lupus  erythematosus (secondary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome). Th e diagnosis  requires  the  following  clinical fi ndings:  thrombosis  or  pregnancy-related  morbidity,  and  the  presence  of  one of  the  antiphospholipid  antibodies  (anticardiolipin,  antiβ 2 -glycoprotein I, or the lupus anticoagulant).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e antibodies are clinically de fi ned by the method of detection. Lupus anticoagulant antibodies are detected by their prolongation of the PTT and the dilute Russell viper venom time, whereas anticardiolipin and antiβ 2 -glycoprotein I antibodies are measured directly by immunoassay. Th e risk of thrombosis appears to be greater with lupus anticoagulants or antibodies with activity speci fi cally directed at β 2 -glycoprotein I.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Th e  exact  mechanism  of  the  thrombotic  action  of  these antibodies has yet to be de fi ned. Th e antibodies might activate endothelial cells to increase the expression of vascular adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin. Th is would increase the binding of white blood cells and platelets to the endothelial surface and lead to thrombus formation.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients with lupus anticoagulants have an increased propensity for thrombosis, with 30% to 60% of patients experiencing one or more thrombotic events during their lifetime. Isolated venous thrombosis or thromboembolism make up two thirds  of  the  events  and  cerebral  thrombosis  accounts  for  the other third. Up to 20% of patients who have a VTE not associated with a disease, surgery, or trauma are found to have antiphospholipid antibodies. Along with factor V Leiden and the prothrombin gene mutation, the presence of an antiphospholipid antibody must be considered as a likely cause of thromboembolic disease in younger individuals. Patients can also develop catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome characterized by multiorgan failure resulting from widespread small vessel thrombosis, thrombocytopenia,  acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome,  DIC, and occasionally an autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Th is clinical picture is indistinguishable from that of TTP . Bacterial infection o ft en appears to be a triggering event for this syndrome.

Management of Anesthesia in Venous Hypercoagulable Disorders

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Current antithrombotic strategies range from simple management approaches such as early ambulation to a combination of elastic stockings and subcutaneous heparin therapy followed by conversion to outpatient warfarin therapy. Surgical patients may have a host of risk factors for VTE, all of which must be

<!-- PAGE=? -->
considered when balancing the degree of thrombotic risk and the costs (monetary expense and bleeding risk) of perioperative anticoagulation. A number of professional societies have espoused a four-tiered approach to risk strati fi cation in surgical patients that permits the intensity of prophylaxis to be adjusted to the VTE risk (Table 20-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Prophylactic strategies may take pharmacologic and physical  forms.  Large  trials  suggest  that  subcutaneous  administration  of  unfractionated  or  low-molecular-weight  heparin confers a 60% to 70% reduction in risk of VTE. By contrast, aspirin  provides  relatively  weak  prophylactic  e ff ects.  Physical  methods of prophylaxis such as the use of graded elastic compression stockings are associated with a 40% to 45% risk

reduction, whereas intermittent pneumatic compression stockings yield a risk reduction approaching that of heparin use.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
A number of investigations published in the late 1970s and early 1980s presented evidence that regional anesthesia (usually neuraxial blockade) resulted in a decreased incidence of postoperative VTE. Th is was particularly true for lower extremity joint replacement surgery. As a result, regional anesthesia became the preferred anesthetic technique for this surgery and other procedures associated with a high risk of VTE. However, even when neuraxial anesthesia was combined with techniques such as early ambulation and intraoperative use of antiembolism stockings, the VTE risk was still unacceptably high. As a result, postoperative prophylactic anticoagulation with drugs such as warfarin or subcutaneous heparin became the standard of care for operations associated with a high risk of VTE (see Table 20-6).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Now that routine antithrombotic prophylaxis is utilized, the advantages of regional compared with general anesthesia are less clear in patients at high risk of VTE. Recent meta-analyses have found that regional and general anesthesia for hip surgery appear to produce comparable results in terms of most outcomes. Although there appears to be a slight reduction in VTE incidence with regional anesthesia and also a decreased need for  transfusion, this does not translate into a signi fi cant difference in mortality. Th e U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory prohibiting neuraxial anesthesia in patients receiving low-molecular-weight heparin resulting from an increased risk of epidural hematomas may further limit the use of regional anesthesia or its extension into the postoperative period. Postoperative pharmacologic prophylaxis for VTE is very e ff ective, and so it may not be prudent to withhold these drugs to allow continued use of an epidural anesthetic postoperatively.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Patients  with  an  absolute  contraindication  to  anticoagulant therapy or those with a major bleeding complication may bene fi t from placement of a vena caval fi lter to prevent recurrent pulmonary emboli. Th e fi lters are e ff ective and reduce the incidence of pulmonary embolism to less than 4%. In cancer patients  for  whom  anticoagulant  therapy  has  failed,  a  vena caval fi lter  combined  with  continued  anticoagulation  may provide greater protection.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
ANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS IN PATIENTS RECEIVING LONG-TERM ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulant therapy requires special attention. Certain operations such as some ophthalmic, dental, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal procedures  can  be  carried  out  without  interruption  of  oral anticoagulant  therapy. Th e  risk  of  perioperative  thrombosis must be weighed against the risk of bleeding during and a ft er surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
For most operations anticoagulation needs to be temporarily  interrupted, and bridging therapy with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin is instituted in patients at moderate and high risk of thrombosis. Bridging therapy reduces the  risk  of  VTE  by  up  to  80%.  Warfarin  should  be  stopped approximately 5 days before the procedure and heparin should be started 36 hours a ft er the last dose of warfarin. In patients

<!-- PAGE=? -->
434

<!-- PAGE=? -->
STOELTING'S ANESTHESIA AND CO-EXISTING DISEASE

<!-- PAGE=? -->
receiving heparin by continuous infusion, the infusion should be  stopped  6  hours  before  surgery.  Patients  receiving  lowmolecular-weight heparin should receive the last dose no less than 18 hours preoperatively if they are on a twice-daily regimen and 30 hours preoperatively if they are on a once-daily regimen.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  cases  in  which  neuraxial  anesthesia  is  planned,  the guidelines  of  the  American  Society  of  Regional  Anesthesia and  Pain  Medicine  recommend  that  needle  placement  for regional anesthesia take place 12 hours a ft er the last dose of low-molecular-weight heparin if prophylactic dosing is used and 24 hours a ft er the last dose of low-molecular-weight heparin if therapeutic dosing is used. Similarly, epidural catheter removal needs to be carefully coordinated with the heparin dosing (Table 20-7).

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Resumption  of  anticoagulation  postoperatively  requires an  evaluation  of  the  risk  of  recurrent  thrombosis  and  consideration  of  the  degree  to  which  surgery  itself  increases hypercoagulability. Th ese  factors  must  be  weighed  against the  bleeding  risk  associated  with  resumption  of  anticoagulation. Since there is a delay of approximately 24 hours a ft er warfarin administration before the international normalized ratio begins to increase, warfarin therapy should generally be resumed as soon as possible a ft er  surgery except in patients at high risk of bleeding. Th ese patients can be managed with bridging therapy with heparin until the international normalized ratio reaches therapeutic levels.

HEART DISEASE

Patients with acute anterior wall myocardial infarction who, because  of  a  wall  motion  abnormality,  are  likely  to  form  a mural thrombus should receive warfarin for 2 to 3 months a ft er the infarction. A ft er that time there is little risk of embolism. Patients  with  atrial fi brillation,  particularly  atrial fi brillation associated with valvular disease, a dilated atrium, and evidence of heart failure or a prior embolus generally require moderatedose warfarin therapy inde fi nitely. Th e need for anticoagulation in patients with atrial fi brillation is determined using the CHADS2 scoring system, which takes into account the stroke risk  factors  of  congestive  heart  failure,  hypertension,  age  75 years or older, diabetes mellitus, and prior stroke (Table 20-8). In patients with atrial fi brillation undergoing major surgery, oral  anticoagulant  therapy  should  be  stopped  and  bridging therapy with heparin begun.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
Dabigatran,  an  oral  direct  thrombin  inhibitor  recently approved for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fi brillation  that  is  not  associated  with  valvular  heart  disease, may pose a challenge. It is suggested that dabigatran be stopped 3 to 5 days before surgery in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) and 2 to 3 days before surgery in others. If parenteral anticoagulant therapy is necessary, it should be initiated 12 to 24 hours a ft er the last dose of dabigatran.

SUMMARY

<!-- PAGE=? -->
In  summary,  hypercoagulability,  a  state  of  exaggerated activation  of  the  coagulation  system,  plays  a  major  role  in the pathogenesis of VTE, a process that a ff ects  some 2 million Americans annually with an estimated annual mortality of 150,000 from pulmonary embolism. New heritable causes of  hypercoagulability  are  being  identi fi ed,  and  some  genetic predisposition to thrombosis can be identi fi ed in more than half of patients with deep vein thrombosis. Anesthesiologists are being asked to care for an increasing number of patients carrying the diagnosis of hypercoagulability, many of whom are receiving long-term anticoagulation therapy. Th e perioperative period represents a time of high risk for VTE (Table 20-9). Some surgeries are associated with a more than 100-fold increase in the risk of thrombosis. Knowledge of the optimum operative management of these patients inevitably lags behind the  identi fi cation  of  their  pathophysiology,  but  it  is  incumbent upon the anesthesiologist to understand the mechanisms behind  hypercoagulability  and  to  make  educated  choices about the management of these patients. Hypercoagulability plays a less clearly de fi ned role in the pathophysiology of arterial thrombotic events, but the high morbidity and mortality associated with arterial occlusion in the perioperative patient makes  staying  abreast  of  these  developments  an  important part of patient care.

KEY POINTS

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Th e erythrocyte and its major protein constituent, Hb, are highly specialized so that  oxygen delivery can be rapidly adjusted to meet local tissue needs. Disorders a ff ecting the formation,  structure,  metabolism,  and  turnover  of  RBCs can impair their ability to perform this vital task in patients undergoing surgery.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Preoperative management of patients with sickle cell disease no longer mandates exchange transfusion to decrease the ratio of sickle Hb to normal Hb; instead, transfusions are  required  only  as  needed  to  achieve  a  preoperative hematocrit of 30%.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Recent  advances  in  cell-based  coagulation  models  have changed our fundamental understanding of in vivo  clotting. Th is  improved  understanding  has  allowed  a  better appreciation of how speci fi c defects in coagulation components a ff ect the balance of hemostasis and what therapeutic interventions o ff er the best risk/bene fi t ratio.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Sources of hypercoagulability can be divided into two major classes: a congenital predisposition that is usually lifelong and an acquired or environmental hypercoagulability such as occurs in surgery. In patients experiencing a fi rst-time VTE, some congenital predisposition can be identi fi ed in up to 50% of cases. However, in almost all cases of VTE, some acquired or environmental hypercoagulability serves as a triggering event.

<!-- PAGE=? -->
■ Most disorders  producing  a  state  of  venous  hypercoagulability  a ff ect  the  generation  or  disposition  of  thrombin, whereas in the arterial circulation, platelet and endothelial function and regulation also critically a ff ect the prothrombotic tendency.
